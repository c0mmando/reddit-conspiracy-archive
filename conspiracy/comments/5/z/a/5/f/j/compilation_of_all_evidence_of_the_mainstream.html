        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the inception of the PIzzagate investigation, there seems to have been an extremely well coordinated, and highly organized assault on it&#39;s credibility. Naturally, this raised a few questions amongst the &quot;conspiracy community&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>I&#39;d Like to point out that there was a subreddit dedicated specifically to Pizzagate in the early days, several months ago. That sub was deleted and banned by mods, which many believed to be a BLATANT example of censorship.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fearing yet another witchunt, Reddit bans Pizzagate sub</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/</a></p>

<p>Following the ban, one of the earliest examples of media distortion/intervention regarding the subject of John Podesta&#39;s emails was the invention of the term &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

<p>The timing of the creation of this new Orwellian term, &quot;fake news&quot; seemed all too  coincidental with the Pizzagate revelations of John Podesta&#39;s Emails. </p>

<p>After the investigation began to pick up steam, the MSM and social engineers agreed this could no longer be ignored, it had passed the threshold and had to be addressed with propaganda to distort the public&#39;s view. </p>

<p><strong>Stephen Colbert&#39;s Hit Piece on PG pushing the new &quot;Fake News&quot; term, discrediting the investigation</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y</a></p>

<p>This was unprecedented <sup>.</sup> Many of us were in shock when we saw this. However, this is merely one example of the great lengths TPTB would go to to try and bury this investigation..</p>

<p>Next, Snopes had released their article on the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, somehow debunking it, and also branding it as fake news. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>And who else but our beloved Wikipedia, to release a write up on Pizzagate, also referring to it as fake news and calling it &quot;Debunked&quot;, whilst distorting several of the fundamental facts.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: the term Debunked has never been used or associated with a conspiracy until Pizzagate. There was a clear, coordinated effort to discredit this investigation, and the desperation to use the term &quot;debunked&quot; was unprecedented until then.</strong></p>

<p>Surprise, <strong>A gunman storms into the suspected pedophile trafficking business with a gun, branding the issue as a &quot;violent witch hunt&quot; and &quot;politically motivated&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/">https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/</a></p>

<p>After successfully branding the investigation as a conservative hate-hunt, the social engineers (ever so nervous), had decided it&#39;s time a major news network address this issue. So, our dear friend at FOX news and Megyn Kelly decided to set the record straight for us, with an appearance from Comet Ping Pong owner himself, James Alefantis. The interview focused on the &quot;detrimental effects of fake news&quot;, and how small businesses can be affected by fake stories.</p>

<p><strong>(NOTE: Many of us believe the shooting to be a staged false flag attack. The topic simply picked up too much steam, and they had to demonize the investigators as &quot;Radical alt-Right)&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TG3k2Bv0jrI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TG3k2Bv0jrI</a></p>

<p>At this point, TPTB are feeling pretty secure. They have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Declared it a &quot;conspiracy&quot;</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Branded fake news</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Painted Pizzagate as a politically motivated movement against the left</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, all they have to do is wait. They hope that time will eventually bury the issue and it will be just a mere memory. </p>

<p>However, with the amount of circumstantial evidence that has been archived on the Internet, there is enough to put these people away forever.</p>

<p><strong>This is a coordinated and focused effort to discredit us. Keep talking about this stuff, keep sharing, keep it alive. The fact that they are going through this amount of money, resources, and effort to silence is. Is only validating our cause. Good speed gents.</strong></p>

<p>PS: David Brock, there is a special place in hell for you, you two faced fuck. </p>

<p>Who is &#39;us&#39;? r/conspiracy on the whole does not agree with your bullshit theory, so stop trying to bring across &#39;us&#39;. You are the one believing utter falsehoods and bending over backwards to try and keep a narrative alive. Fuck, I&#39;ve seen so many nuts on r/conspiracy, but they were funny because most of them were trolls or at least were open to constructive conversation, but now we just have a bunch of morons who drank too much kool-aid and claim that shariablue is downing voting them for their bullshit....</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and best of luck at your protests/demonstrations on March the 18th and the 25th!</p>

<p>I recommend live streaming all of it --- and get speakers to talk about all the evidence you have uncovered. Have a huge, never ending demonstration.</p>

<p>There is honestly so much, that you could spend hours talking about it publicly and while you spread truth, regular people are going to stop and listen and wonder wtf is this shit?</p>

<p>Make sure to have stickers, buttons little cards, all with the key search words term and also of course, a link/bar code to the best pizzagate info sight.</p>

<p>Because many of these people are going home or will hear about the commotion on twitter/social media and research the fuck out of pizzagate. </p>

There is honestly so much evidence that you could spend hours talking about it publicly and never have to repeat yourself, though repeating key facts isn&#39;t a bad thing, but while you are out there spreading truth, regular people are going to stop by wonder wtf is this shit?

    <div class="md"><p>It would take John Podesta trying to explain all the emails, about handkerchiefs, swimming with small children, explaining his pedo artwork in his home, James explaining why he called a baby a hotard &amp; taped his god daughter to a table. </p>

<p>I want to know why a restaurant that constantly labels themselves as &quot;kid and family friendly&quot; allows their employees to post photos of nude men with pizza over their crotch &amp; caption it &quot;cum visit&quot; while tagging comet pong. Images like these were directly linked from comets pong IG page, where kids follow, totally unacceptable. </p>

<p>&amp; instead of firing the employee like any normal manager would, James defended him! I&#39;ve seen new stories of subway workers getting fired for using lettuce that fell on the ground. Where the fuck are the news stories about james and his employees talking about murdering and pizza covered cum. </p>

<p>I want James to explain why they have pedo bands like Heavy Breathing play at their place, &amp; have the music posters says &quot;starts at 9pm, ALL AGES WELCOME!&quot; every time. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the explanation of Majestic ape of Heavy Breathing talking at Comet about Jared from subway coming down there because he likes the &quot;sounds&quot;, then Jimmy&#39;s lawyer from the crowd shouts &quot;&amp; little boys!&quot;  His fucking LAWYER said that! This was all said right before Majestic ape was talking about birthing a baby &amp; then immediately killing it. </p>

<p>This is just like 1% of the weird/strange things about pizzagate. When will you fucks start to pay attention &amp; stop protecting pedos?</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Most of the children came from the ravaged village of Callebas, where people told the AP they handed over their children because they were unable to feed or clothe them after the quake. They said the missionaries promised to educate the children and let relatives visit.</em></p>

<p><em>Their stories contradicted Silsby&#39;s account that the children came from collapsed orphanages or were handed over by distant relatives.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Why lie about how she got the kids?</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Silsby had begun planning last summer to create an orphanage for Haitian children in the neighboring Dominican Republic. When the earthquake struck she recruited other church members, and the 10 spent a week in Haiti gathering children for their project.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a little &quot;cart before the horse&quot;, isn&#39;t it?  Wouldn&#39;t most people sort out the orphanage first, <em>then</em> get the kids?</p>

<p>Or at least get the orphanage ball rolling........</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10BUENOSAIRES166_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10BUENOSAIRES166_a.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;<em>The paper adds that Laura Silsby, the leader of the U.S. missionaries, had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>So in other words, Silsby&#39;s defense was that she was taking the children to an orphanage that didn&#39;t actually exist.</p>

No one really knowing who the shooter was. People saying the shooters mom was a good elementary school teacher. Staff members saying she never taught at the school.

The school being destroyed and rebuilt and the construction workers signing NDAs to not talk about anything they did or didn&#39;t see. The fact that the parents who got media attention all moved to the area within the last few years. The fact that they&#39;ve all received millions in donations and federal funds. How does that not raise questions? Oh right it&#39;s wrong to question it because &quot;it was kids, how can you be so callous?&quot; It takes some real idiocy to even think for one second that all that shit adds up </p>

<p>That&#39;s seriously it? I thought there would be some incriminating shit by the way you described it</p>

<p>Holy shit what an unreadable article.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to find the source on the collage of weird kid art they have on there.</p>

<p>Seems like it&#39;s just an example of more art made by Biljana Djurdjevic and isn&#39;t related to Tony Podesta other than the fact that he has some art by her</p>

<p>Speaking of the <a href="https://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=100798">Arc of Hysteria</a>, I tried finding anything related to Jeffrey Dahlmer [sic] in history of this thing. Seems like the only relation is that one of dahmers victims looks sort of like, but nothing alike, with the arc?</p>

<p>How can you not be disturbed by the quote</p>

<p>There will be children‚Äã aged 6-11 in the pool for your entertainment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly the first time I read it as &quot;no problem if you bring kids, there will be other kids here and a pool&quot;</p>

<p>But yeah, if you jump straight to thinking of pedophilia of course it sounds weird</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s enough to start raising questions.</p>

<p>Is it, though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes i believe it is a bit of a stretch for any normal person to believe it but when you start to think about cases like standurski, subway guy and Rotherham ...it happens and people turn a blind eye because no way would that person i know so well could commit such a horrible thing to such an innocent child...it truly is hard to believe but with all the human/child trafficking being busted all around the world we know it happens way too often </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i would imagine that the president spends millions in taxpayers money on security regardless if he goes to Mar-a-Lago or anywhere else. </p>

<p>i imagine that its actually cheaper to permanently secure a place that the president visits often, as compared to temporarily securing a series of places that the president does not visit often. </p>

<p>if i had the presidents ear, i would advise him to get rid of the secret service. they work for the money printers, which is exactly why the money printers &quot;guard&quot; (hold hostage) the president, and how they will JFK him if he steps out of line. i would have him recruit his security team from the military, probably from a small pool of those few who have guarded the tomb of the unknown soldier, or similarly prestigious candidates from other branches</p>

<p>Yeah kids in a pool isn&#39;t weird. Telling an adult there will be kids there (when you don&#39;t seem to be telling them to bring their kids if they even have them), listing their ages, and assuring them they WILL be in the pool and YOU will have fun, that is pretty weird.</p>

<p>Yeah it is an artist. Okay. They are photographs of underage kids. Okay. He hung them in his bedroom?</p>

<p>Those are just weird notes. They aren&#39;t evidence, but when you have hundreds of things that are all weird in the same thing you should take notice. Connections with third world orphanages and adoption agencies are often a huge red flag. Connections to a convicted missionary child trafficker who trafficked kidnapped children to missions and orphanages is also a huge red flag.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a certainty, but it certainly isn&#39;t debunked and there is enough that it can&#39;t be just forgotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing this mentioned and I don&#39;t get what is so odd. Perhaps you don&#39;t have kids? I wouldn&#39;t do it now, my boys are teenagers. However, when they were little and more rambunctious, I referred to them as entertainment for family and friends on multiple occasions. So then, why is this email referred to so often? What makes you think this is referring to something nefarious when there is nothing suggested of the sort?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no doubt that pedophiles exist. What is lacking here is that the cases are somehow connected. Can you provided any evidence that these separate cases are linked in any way or somehow tied back to the Podestas or Clintons. Anything at all?</p>
