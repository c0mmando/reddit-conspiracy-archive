       Since the inception of the PIzzagate investigation, there seems to have been an extremely well coordinated, and highly organized assault on it's credibility. Naturally, this raised a few questions amongst the "conspiracy community".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I'd Like to point out that there was a subreddit dedicated specifically to Pizzagate in the early days, several months ago. That sub was deleted and banned by mods, which many believed to be a BLATANT example of censorship.
       </strong>

      <p>
       <strong>
        Fearing yet another witchunt, Reddit bans Pizzagate sub
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Following the ban, one of the earliest examples of media distortion/intervention regarding the subject of John Podesta's emails was the invention of the term "fake news".
      </p>
      <p>
       The timing of the creation of this new Orwellian term, "fake news" seemed all too  coincidental with the Pizzagate revelations of John Podesta's Emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the investigation began to pick up steam, the MSM and social engineers agreed this could no longer be ignored, it had passed the threshold and had to be addressed with propaganda to distort the public's view.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       This was unprecedented
       <sup>
        .
       </sup>
       Many of us were in shock when we saw this. However, this is merely one example of the great lengths TPTB would go to to try and bury this investigation..
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, Snopes had released their article on the "conspiracy theory", somehow debunking it, and also branding it as fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">
        http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And who else but our beloved Wikipedia, to release a write up on Pizzagate, also referring to it as fake news and calling it "Debunked", whilst distorting several of the fundamental facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        NOTE: the term Debunked has never been used or associated with a conspiracy until Pizzagate. There was a clear, coordinated effort to discredit this investigation, and the desperation to use the term "debunked" was unprecedented until then.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Surprise,
       <strong>
        A gunman storms into the suspected pedophile trafficking business with a gun, branding the issue as a "violent witch hunt" and "politically motivated"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/">
        https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After successfully branding the investigation as a conservative hate-hunt, the social engineers (ever so nervous), had decided it's time a major news network address this issue. So, our dear friend at FOX news and Megyn Kelly decided to set the record straight for us, with an appearance from Comet Ping Pong owner himself, James Alefantis. The interview focused on the "detrimental effects of fake news", and how small businesses can be affected by fake stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (NOTE: Many of us believe the shooting to be a staged false flag attack. The topic simply picked up too much steam, and they had to demonize the investigators as "Radical alt-Right)"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TG3k2Bv0jrI">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TG3k2Bv0jrI
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, TPTB are feeling pretty secure. They have:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Declared it a "conspiracy"
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Branded fake news
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Painted Pizzagate as a politically motivated movement against the left
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       At this point, all they have to do is wait. They hope that time will eventually bury the issue and it will be just a mere memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, with the amount of circumstantial evidence that has been archived on the Internet, there is enough to put these people away forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is a coordinated and focused effort to discredit us. Keep talking about this stuff, keep sharing, keep it alive. The fact that they are going through this amount of money, resources, and effort to silence is. Is only validating our cause. Good speed gents.

       Who is 'us'? r/conspiracy on the whole does not agree with your bullshit theory, so stop trying to bring across 'us'. You are the one believing utter falsehoods and bending over backwards to try and keep a narrative alive. Fuck, I've seen so many nuts on r/conspiracy, but they were funny because most of them were trolls or at least were open to constructive conversation, but now we just have a bunch of morons who drank too much kool-aid and claim that shariablue is downing voting them for their bullshit....

There is honestly so much evidence that you could spend hours talking about it publicly and never have to repeat yourself, though repeating key facts isn't a bad thing, but while you are out there spreading truth, regular people are going to stop by wonder wtf is this shit?

       My theory? Pizzagate is projection. Pedophiles pointing at their foes and shrieking, "Those fiends! They're after our children!". It's like how those who so gleefully and knowingly share completely made-up, bullshit misinformation pieces for political reasons have so enthusiastically attempted to co-opt the phrase "fake news". The sort of people who keep going to websites they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       are giving them viruses, because they agree with the alternative facts there.

       It would take John Podesta trying to explain all the emails, about handkerchiefs, swimming with small children, explaining his pedo artwork in his home, James explaining why he called a baby a hotard &amp; taped his god daughter to a table.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to know why a restaurant that constantly labels themselves as "kid and family friendly" allows their employees to post photos of nude men with pizza over their crotch &amp; caption it "cum visit" while tagging comet pong. Images like these were directly linked from comets pong IG page, where kids follow, totally unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp; instead of firing the employee like any normal manager would, James defended him! I've seen new stories of subway workers getting fired for using lettuce that fell on the ground. Where the fuck are the news stories about james and his employees talking about murdering and pizza covered cum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want James to explain why they have pedo bands like Heavy Breathing play at their place, &amp; have the music posters says "starts at 9pm, ALL AGES WELCOME!" every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the explanation of Majestic ape of Heavy Breathing talking at Comet about Jared from subway coming down there because he likes the "sounds", then Jimmy's lawyer from the crowd shouts "&amp; little boys!"  His fucking LAWYER said that! This was all said right before Majestic ape was talking about birthing a baby &amp; then immediately killing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just like 1% of the weird/strange things about pizzagate. When will you fucks start to pay attention &amp; stop protecting pedos?

       so what you are actually saying is that "cheese pizza" and "pizza" have been known to be code words for a long time, so its really not a stretch to say that podesta's contacts didn't invent the code words just for the podesta emails, especially given the unusual context in which the word pizza is used?

       You don't think they're strange? You don't think it's weird the grandma of those kids also runs a blog for her grandbaby?

       Why would she say "come see Evie raw &amp; uncut"?

       Look at the labels she used on her granddaughters blog

       Tamera Luzzatto served as then-Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff from 2001 to 2009. She isn't even the real biological grandma of these kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's believed she used to be a man, which is fine, but it does add to her strangeness.

       What vid? The explanation is that they're being "edgy" by joking about Jared. "we all have our preferences" is clearly intended to be a joke. If you listen to her other videos where she's talking it's the same sort of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you don't like that explanation, right? Won't accept it? That's my point.

       Oh yeah, also, Xanax is not a common date rape drug. That would be rohypnol. What it IS often used for is to help people afraid of flying relax on long plane rides, like if you were flying from DC to Europe.

       <em>
        Most of the children came from the ravaged village of Callebas, where people told the AP they handed over their children because they were unable to feed or clothe them after the quake. They said the missionaries promised to educate the children and let relatives visit.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Their stories contradicted Silsby's account that the children came from collapsed orphanages or were handed over by distant relatives.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Why lie about how she got the kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        Silsby had begun planning last summer to create an orphanage for Haitian children in the neighboring Dominican Republic. When the earthquake struck she recruited other church members, and the 10 spent a week in Haiti gathering children for their project.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a little "cart before the horse", isn't it?  Wouldn't most people sort out the orphanage first,
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       get the kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or at least get the orphanage ball rolling........

       "
       <em>
        The paper adds that Laura Silsby, the leader of the U.S. missionaries, had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       So in other words, Silsby's defense was that she was taking the children to an orphanage that didn't actually exist.

       Well, I never claimed that I was a fan of this scene, I'm not. The jokes are in questionable taste, I agree with that also. I don't go in for that sort of shit either. But I know people who do act like that and make "edgy" jokes like that. We're talking about a bunch of art school grads, here. Many of them are kind of fucked.

       Why is it so hard for people to believe that some of the richest, most corrupt, most connected people In the world wouldn't give in to their sick fantasies. These people have all the power they need to make it happen. Hell even the movie industry has all the power it needs. And you're trying to tell me Hillary Clinton and John podesta could never do something like this? Give me a break. These guys are some sick fuckers closely connected to even more disgusting people like Denny Hastert. Get out of here. You're pretty obviously a shill if you can't even be open to the idea.

       Why, on a conspiracy board, would anyone ever be opposed to even

       the possibility of a pedophile ring?

       Sandy Hook is definitely questionable. Despite all of the coverage there is absolutely no footage of any kids being evacuated. No paramedics got inside. No one really knowing who the shooter was. People saying the shooters mom was a good elementary school teacher. Staff members saying she never taught at the school. People saying they heard maybe 5-10 shots at most and yet the official report saying over 100 rounds were discharged. The school being destroyed and rebuilt and the construction workers signing NDAs to not talk about anything they did or didn't see. The fact that the parents who got media attention all moved to the area within the last few years. The fact that they've all received millions in donations and federal funds. How does that not raise questions? Oh right it's wrong to question it because "it was kids, how can you be so callous?" It takes some real idiocy to even think for one second that all that shit adds up

       I'm still trying to find the source on the collage of weird kid art they have on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like it's just an example of more art made by Biljana Djurdjevic and isn't related to Tony Podesta other than the fact that he has some art by her

       yes i believe it is a bit of a stretch for any normal person to believe it but when you start to think about cases like standurski, subway guy and Rotherham ...it happens and people turn a blind eye because no way would that person i know so well could commit such a horrible thing to such an innocent child...it truly is hard to believe but with all the human/child trafficking being busted all around the world we know it happens way too often

       i would imagine that the president spends millions in taxpayers money on security regardless if he goes to Mar-a-Lago or anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       i imagine that its actually cheaper to permanently secure a place that the president visits often, as compared to temporarily securing a series of places that the president does not visit often.

       if i had the presidents ear, i would advise him to get rid of the secret service. they work for the money printers, which is exactly why the money printers "guard" (hold hostage) the president, and how they will JFK him if he steps out of line. i would have him recruit his security team from the military, probably from a small pool of those few who have guarded the tomb of the unknown soldier, or similarly prestigious candidates from other branches

       Yeah kids in a pool isn't weird. Telling an adult there will be kids there (when you don't seem to be telling them to bring their kids if they even have them), listing their ages, and assuring them they WILL be in the pool and YOU will have fun, that is pretty weird.

       I keep seeing this mentioned and I don't get what is so odd. Perhaps you don't have kids? I wouldn't do it now, my boys are teenagers. However, when they were little and more rambunctious, I referred to them as entertainment for family and friends on multiple occasions. So then, why is this email referred to so often? What makes you think this is referring to something nefarious when there is nothing suggested of the sort?

       There is no doubt that pedophiles exist. What is lacking here is that the cases are somehow connected. Can you provided any evidence that these separate cases are linked in any way or somehow tied back to the Podestas or Clintons. Anything at all?
