       But that's only thousands in a country of hundreds of millions. Logically the CIA would want to control large chunks of the population, not fringe conspiracy theorists that believe "Sandy Hook was a false flag" and "the government is turning the frogs gay."

       You are not getting it.. yes, the CIA try to control the mainstream media. But they also want to control (or put in place) an outlet that challenges everything so they can control it.. they aren't doing it so this guy can get millions of views.. it's so they can control his chunk of the audience and shape the narrative (any and ALL narratives) to their liking.

       They want to control ALL of the narratives. Not just the popular one. Can't have the tin foils just free to investigate and speculate, need someone to control us enough to let us think we are free to explore these ideas.

       There is a lot of "circumstantial" evidence and discussion of people he associates with but very little actual evidence about Jones himself.

      <p>
       Saying something "Even Bin Laden was a CIA opertive" doesn't amount to evidence about Alex Jones.

       This "article" is trash and doesn't really make any connections at all. I honestly don't think Alex Jones is disinfo or anything like that. The fact that you're randomly saying it with THIS as your proof makes me think even more that this is a disinfo campaign itself.

       It definitely is. I would have believed it wasn't a disinfo campaign if he just straight up said alex jones is a crazy nutball. But linking to some random site and not saying too much. Weird. Especially cuz I've been doing my research and Alex has been on point lately.

       Alex Jones agrees that 9/11 was a false flag. Why hasn't Trump revealed that? But more importantly, why hasn't Alex Jones acknowledged this? During the campaign Alex couldn't stop trashing Goldman Sachs but after Trump won and acted like how a GS stooge would act (I like Trump, I get that he was scripted to be the good cop to Hillary's bad cop, but he was also scripted to win) Alex didn't say a word. I've seen Alex shut down and refuse to discuss conspiracy theories he either didn't know or didn't agree with and that's not what a truth-spreader would do. InfoWars has moved from an underground back page and radio broadcast to a flashy, sleek, high budget super-model extravaganza and my inclination AJ wasn't The One grew more and more until I don't watch or trust him like I used to. He's really entertaining! And so is Trump! But the truth is neither of them are who we've been looking for. Is he working directing beneath and for the CIA? Does he talk on the phone with them before every broadcast? Probably not, but I'm sure he's been compromised. Many people agree with OP and I, just YouTube "Alex Jones Exposed" and be open-minded. Trump's whole extended family is Jewish  (and about 95% of his board of directors) and believe the same is true about Alex. Zionists are one of the big players in the world if not the biggest and why wouldn't they have controlled opposition for guys like is? AJ is that guy

       Hm. Everyone here seems to be one group. To not do their own research with an open mind about all this. Question everything and everyone. Bill cooper was legit, if you're legit, you get pooped. If you run your mouth like this guy, and "get into" secret meetings in the woods and are still allowed to breathe.. well damn. Interesting though, how any opposing thoughts are down voted. As if there is no such thing as controlled opposition. It's like 10D chess y'all... big players small players. Small, medium audiences. He's right about one thing, there is a war on for your mind. They've won from the looks of it... especially when you think you know who "they " is. Go ahead. Down vote me. Ask me for sources. Lol.

       He is like Jar Jar Binks. Literally playing the Drunken Fist strategy, getting hammered on Joe Rogan's show. Dude is coked out of his mind, but "in vino, veritas" is not applicable with these guys. The strategy is "fire, aim, ready" which is bass ackwards.

       I think more realistically, he's just a doomsday-seller - peddling his 'vitality' and 'emergency' wares.
When I (like many, I presume) first went down the Rabbit Hole, Alex Jones was a first stop. I remember thinking "yeah, this guy gets it", but as the years have gone by, and his shows are absolutely BOMBARDED with products for sale, I've realised that at worst he's just an egomaniac, whose cashing-in on his viewers' collective worry.
I think the intelligence community most likely see him as a sort of harmless 'rascal' - that guy at the bar whose yelling about "the damn gummint" lying to us all.
It's a shame, because some of the things he reports, I believe, do have some veracity; it's just that he's a fucking fool, whose learned that you can sell shit to people who are scared - especially if you also encourage that fear.
      </p>

       His interview with David Duke was a pretty good example about the 'limits' he sets for himself when it comes to exposing "the power elites/globalists (although he calls them globulists) /cabal etc" - something that you wouldn't think someone with his alleged 'mission statement' would do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree he is a form of controlled (or rather 'allowed' opposition. The thing that really does it for me is when he starts talking about "God". Anyone who wants to talk about "the truth", but then also talks about a 'magic man in the sky' immediately loses
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       credibility to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add that to his "guns are freedom!!" crap (I'm a Brit), and you've got pretty clear indicators that the guy isn't the 'saviour' that he purports to be.

       Anyone here watch Homeland? They have an Alex Jones type character on this season that works with the CIA to make the liberals look bad. It's kind of hilarious. The guy does a terrible impression of him.

       I don't mean to upset you man.. but Alex jones is no hero.. just a classic example of an intelligence agency controlling the counter narrative
