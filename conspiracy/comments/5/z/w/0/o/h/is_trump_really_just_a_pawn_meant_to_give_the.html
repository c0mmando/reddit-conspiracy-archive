       Nah actually the policies Obama wanted he did. And the ones who couldn't get done, were met with GOP opposition. It's nothing like Trump at all. I read ALOT of policy dude, and I watch C-span like a nerd when something comes up that is important to me.

       So many more people need to be watching C-SPAN and actually reading policy, good for you for doing your part!
      </p>
      <p>
       But as far as Obama goes, he was just as much of a joke that Trump looks like he may be. For a candidate that ran on a platform of Hope and Change, his 8 years left the country "hoping" for "change" so badly that they elected a reality TV star to office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never closed Guantanamo, gave TRILLIONS of dollars to the banks in bailout money, created the most overreaching drone strike program, took us to war in multiple new countries (including putting troops back on the ground in Iraq). After running on a platform of transparency and supporting whistleblowers, he ended up prosecuting more whistleblowers than any other President. He passed a healthcare bill that required everyone to be insured, while doing absolutely nothing about the ridiculously inflated drug prices in America, which is exactly what the healthcare industry wanted...
      </p>
      <p>
       I could keep going on, but please don't whitewash Obama's legacy already. He was a phenomenal speaker and said what the people wanted to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, I'd still take Trump over Obama. At the VERY least, Trump was able to finally end the TPP. But I'm not too happy about much else.

       Trump and his administration are gutting the Veteran's Affairs, or trying to, and not a moment too soon. The organization is corrupt to the core, taking care of deep pockets but not enlisted men. Check out H.Res.198 (

       Good cop, bad cop.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're now into the evil, unpopular, stupid and despotic administration that does the dirty jobs. That deploys the unpopular measures demanded by big business, big pharma, big weapons manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Hillary was really sick, that's why she
       <em>
        didn't win.
       </em>
       Maybe her team just couldn't convince the money masters they were up to the job, maybe they had just one too many cemeteries in the closet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most likely, the Big Orange was set up as the
       <em>
        bad hombre
       </em>
       to take the blame. Like those up and coming women executives that get miraculously promoted to CEO of such and such company as some scandal approaches. They get to go get grilled at Congress, they get spat at by stockholders, they have to ask for forgiveness before the TV cameras. Then they resign in disgrace. A club boy takes the reins and vows to undo the mistakes. Rinse, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why not even Trump's wife has been sleeping at the White House. Why he spends his time at his hotels. He's not allowed, she's not allowed to be there. They're just actors playing their part. Patsies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The help doesn't get to sleep in the master's silken sheets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the war between the intelligence agencies has reached such heights they don't care about keeping up appearances anymore. They have all the secrets, they have all the calls, the photos, the videos, the names of the dead and the numbers in black and white.
       <em>
        They are captains now
       </em>
       . They decided to stop groveling to the elected clowns and set their rules. They have elected chaos for now.

       Cutting State Department, Department of Education, and the EPA budget seems to be pretty anti-establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how much power the State Department is wielding??
      </p>
      <p>
       And the EPA with its corporate friendly execs? It's like a revolving door for them (Monsanto rings anything??)
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the Department of Education, with its massive student loan backing which only benefits Wall St indebting future generations??

       How is this the case? He's giving the Military Industrial Complex their wettest dream deal EVER. Cutting funding to every nearly every department that doesn't carry a gun in the line of their service to the country and increasing the military budget.

       Those were campaign promises though. To his voters that means he is doing what he promised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing TPP and persuing bilateral trade deals is the closest thing to anti establishment he has really done, in the sense that is a kick in the teeth to globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think he is anti-establishment really though, that would be silly. He is super PRO-AMERICAN establishment and foreign interest, hence the whole "america first" economic nationalism moniker. That said he doesn't like how the government is bloated and wants to gut a large number of departments and funding. If you want to you, could reach and call that anti-establishment, but really it is just classic conservatism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess, the closest I can think that would make him seem that way is his willingness to float conspiracy theories in the media, and his distrust in intelligence agencies. He is also not liked by any of the real long term establishment powers, which is really inarguable, but doesn't necessarily make him anti-establishment.  No one likes Ted Cruz either, and it would be just as silly to call him anti-establishment.

       Ever wonder what Trump looks like without makeup? A creepy fuck like Ramsay Bolton. He is nothing but a pawn bought from day one. Maybe it's a drunken master thing and he has dirt on everyone but I doubt it.

       This subreddits became extremely anti-trump overnight. I personally don't think this subreddits should have trump/Hillary politics in it but it went from anti Hillary to anti trump really quickly. Post something anti-trump and watch how fast it makes it. To. The top.
