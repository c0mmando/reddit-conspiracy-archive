        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve been looking into Trump and I found a few questionable things.</p>

<p>A) The Trump Epstein connection, it seems not only has Trump  been on his plane, Trump is quoted saying: <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/">http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/09/the-friendship-between-trump-and-a-billionaire-pedophile-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, <strong>and many of them are on the younger side.</strong> No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>B) Trump was accused of walking in on underage models, walking in their dressing rooms. Which you might be able to deny, if Trump weren&#39;t on tape admitting to walking into dressing rooms.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/306088/donald-trump-having-sex-walking-in-on-naked-beauty-pageant-contestants-howard-stern/">http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/306088/donald-trump-having-sex-walking-in-on-naked-beauty-pageant-contestants-howard-stern/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Well, what you could also say is that, as the owner of the pageant, it’s your obligation to do that,” Trump said, before discussing how he got away with going backstage when the contestants were naked.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I’ll go backstage and everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it,” Trump said. “You know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good.”</p>

<p>“You know, the dresses. ‘Is everyone okay?’ You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I’ve been very good,” he added.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is obviously trolling Epstein in that quote. He&#39;s called for the death penalty for pedophiles. And he&#39;s already publicly called out Bill Clinton for his activities on Epstein&#39;s island. Not to mention, if there&#39;s any incriminating evidence on Trump and pedophilia, his enemies would have made sure it would have come out by now.</p>

<p>Trump is clean on this one, which is why he&#39;s such a target. DC, MSM, Hollywood, big industry, is swarming with pedophiles and they have been running scared since he got elected. Any lie will do to distract the public from the truth.</p>

<p>I know Trump&#39;s connection to Jeffery Epstein (and told as many people about is as possible during the election along with the Clinton connection). But, there is not a connection between Pizzagate and Epstein, beyond Epstein being a sos pedophile. </p>

<p>The quote is from 2002. You have to go back to 1999 to find out why he said it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1999 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maRT3TEcRLs">Donald Trump Banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar A Lago</a>    </p>

<p>According to an investigation by Radar, Trump was among dozens of renowned New Yorkers who knew Epstein socially but ostracized him after Palm Beach police uncovered the financier’s sleazy double life.  </p>

<p>What’s more, Brad Edwards, a lawyer for Epstein’s favorite underage sex slave Virgina Roberts, subpoenaed Trump to give a deposition in the civil case against the sleaze bag.  </p>

<p>But it was eventually withdrawn because Trump voluntarily provided information.  </p>

<p>“Around 2008 or 2009, Brad was issuing subpoenas to a lot of people who’d met Epstein,” the source told Radar. “He got a call back from Mr. Trump’s lawyer to say there was no need to subpoena him — Mr. Trump would call him immediately.”  </p>

<p>The call followed quickly, Radar has been told.  </p>

<p>“During the conversation, Mr. Trump was open and forthright,” Edwards said. “I cannot discuss the substance of the conversation. But I will say that it was obvious to me that he was in no way involved in any untoward activity.”   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things don&#39;t bother me. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s an old creep. Or maybe he thinks he&#39;s they are his girls and seeing them change is not big deal. See what you said is easily explainable.</p>

<p>BUT, trump has deep ties to the black economy. Just one example, he had the US&#39;s number one coke trafficker as his front man for a helicopter service that flew the elite from trump locations in NY to trump casinos in NJ. There are several other connections.</p>

<p>Tied with the FACT that his girls he brings in for modeling are brought here illegally.</p>

<p>Illegal status here is the first step to being pimped. And most like likely pimped to the elite.</p>

<p>So he has the girls, and he has the man power. His connections seem like, to me, to be too close for just coincidence.</p>

<p>I was a trump fan till I found out he was going to war in Syria and all his black economy connections.</p>
