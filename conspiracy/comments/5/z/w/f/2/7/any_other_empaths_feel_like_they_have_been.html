    <div class="md"><p>If you are a lightworker, incarnated star-seed soul, or just a very light filled person, you can be targeted by negative astral entities or attacked long range by scalar technology. It&#39;s the same reason so many good people in our culture die mysteriously. The Cabal is real and they have advanced capabilities through ET tech, archons, negative ESP individuals etc. </p>

<p>Take precautions to defend yourself energetically. Mentally clear your aura daily. Burn sage in your personal living space. Consciousness is key when dealing with negative energy. Maintain positive thoughts and optimism in overcoming any fear. Any effect that negative occult manipulation can have stops completely when you take your power back. It is all 3D matrix illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTF does that even mean - point of context? We are humans aren&#39;t we? Is that not a point of context?</p>

<p>Aspies are incredibly sensitive to everything.. light, sensations, abuse.. even the taste of food.</p>

<p>The reason you and others wrongly believed aspies aren&#39;t empathetic is because we are so focused on certain things that we SEEM oblivious to other things at different times.</p>

<p>Do a search on Google for aspergers and empath and you will see many aspies corroborating what i am saying.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anyone who is more empathetic to animal pain than myself. Watch this video of Temple Grandin to see she is the same way with animals...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please. Do you not understand what being diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s means? It literally means that you lack empathy. That is one of the prime markers they use to identify people in the autism spectrum, and more specifically those with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. You lack empathy, otherwise YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. You seem to think that an article written in 2013, that has not been touched upon since, points to some ground breaking discovery that will change the world. It changed nothing. It was not a discovery, it was an untested hypothesis. </p>

<p>I read the article you linked me to, it did not convince me, nor did it change the minds of ANYONE in the mental health field. After reading the article you linked, I went on to read more interesting studies that were backed by actual research and I learned something that I did not know before we began our back and forth: folks with Asperger&#39;s have the ability to MIMIC empathy. And to them, they fully believe that they are empathizing. But here&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s only an act, because they have no POINT OF REFERENCE for what empathy actually is because they cannot feel it the way &quot;the rest of us&quot; do. What you call empathy is what you think empathy is. It&#39;s not. You&#39;re autistic. You don&#39;t understand empathy as it is... you understand it the way you think it is.</p>

<p>Do you realize what subreddit you are posting in? And yet you speak as if the establishment has a clue..</p>

<p>Do you know I was not diagnosed for aspergers through most my life?</p>

<p>Do you know that when Temple Grandin was young they said she could never do anything in her life and was almost locked away in essentially a mental hospital?</p>

<p>This is why the &quot;establishment&quot; is full of clueless idiots.</p>

<p>As I told you.. people with autism are PERCEIVED as lacking empathy... they don&#39;t SHOW that they have empathy.. that is not at all equivalent to actually not having empathy...</p>

<p>Do you realize that people with autism are so sensitive to things that they are forced to block out stimulus? Again.. this is the complete opposite of what you claim...</p>

<p>You can understand what TRUE empathy is because YOU don&#39;t have autism.. it is YOU and other non-autists who lack a POINT OF REFERENCE...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you get it? It&#39;s like asking a blind person to explain sight.. the non-autist is actually the one with out site here.. it&#39;s a matter of bias.. non aitists think their view is the default view.. never realizing that they are the ones who in fact lack perception. The reason people with autism suffer is because non autistics lack empathy.. that is the hilarious irony here.. but neutorypicals are too clueless to get that.</p>

<p>Just like how the mainstream is too clueless to realzie conspiracies exists so they assume the conspiracy theorists are the idiots... same exact situation... the ignorant masses.</p>

<p>Temple Grandin has revolutionized the understanding of autism.. for this same reason.. like me SHE knows and YOU do not...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are going to preach that NTs lack empathy, we are at an impasse. You&#39;re basically trying to negate all medical science relating to autism spectrum disorders simply to prove yourself right. How can anyone argue with that?

It is specifically regarding empathy for other humans. You&#39;ll bend any fact needed to make yourself right.

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the mistake you are making is that you are taking empathy too literally here.. yes.. people with autism can&#39;t totally RELATE to neurotypicals because we are different.. but that doesn&#39;t mean we lack actual empathy. We just have different frames of reference. That&#39;s all they are saying. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just speaking different languages.. you are taking the language TOO literally. That doesn&#39;t mean autists lack true empathy... neutortypicals are the ones who lack true empathy.</p>

<p>Neutrotypicals in society have a constructed an artificial empathy.. THAT is the problem. It&#39;s a cultural construct. That is what they mean by lack of empathy.. but it&#39;s a completely faulty and stupid criteria.</p>

<p>That is what autistic people tell themselves so they don&#39;t feel abnormal. It&#39;s a lie. </p>

<p>You have done that throughout this entire discussion. You have no proof to backup anything you have said. I have the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association backing me up. Oh poop... that&#39;s mainstream, so it has to be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If autists are more empathic than non autists then how could YOU possibly have that point of reference? It is you that lacks empathy... you think that because autists see things differently than you it is us that is lacking.. it&#39;s hilarious when you think about it. Neurtypicals can&#39;t see themselves as lacking in anything.. THAT is the problem.</p>

<p>And that is why Temple Grandin revolutionized the animal care industry.. neurotypicals were totally clueless. How can you claim NTs are empathic?</p>
