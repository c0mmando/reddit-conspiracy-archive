        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Few things help your cause more than when the world&#39;s smartest man agrees with you.  And taking advantage of his vulnerable state would seem like an attractive method to make your case, especially if you can get him to say what you want without him being able fight fight back.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve long suspected he is either a vegetable or is unable to clearly communicate.  He supposedly built a device that helps him communicate, yes.  But he&#39;s too twitchy to input the words himself.  He has staff that do that for him per public knowledge.  Ask yourself.  What could he physically do if they created whatever message they wanted for him and stamped his name on it?  He can&#39;t talk, he can&#39;t walk, and he can&#39;t fight back. </p>

<p>He&#39;s had his current condition for decades, which is decades longer than most with the same condition, and any time he weighs in on an issue it&#39;s always from a globalist perspective.  </p>

<p>If you watch any footage of him interacting with his interpreters it seems very vague and almost unbelievable that they can decipher what he&#39;s saying.  It just looks like a man who&#39;s lost control of his central nervous system twitching uncontrollably.  Not saying this is proof of anything, and there may be other video of him interacting more coherently, just wondering if anyone else has noticed this?</p>

<li><p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">What I Finally Understood</a> (IMO, this should be mandatory reading for anyone seeking truth).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lincoln.pdf">The Lincoln Assassination was a False Flag</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/tate.pdf">The Tate Murders were a False Flag</a></p></li>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with all of Mathis&#39; conclusions, but he does an excellent job at forcing me to critically re-consider my own beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve never heard of him because 99% of people you&#39;ve heard about in the alt-news &quot;truther&quot; community are promoted because they are limited hangout disinfo agents. I don&#39;t think Miles is one, but I suppose anything is possible. </p>

<p>I recommend going to his updates page and starting with his paper on Theosophy and the Beat Generation from 2013 and reading forward from there in more or less in chronological order. The reason is that he makes discoveries along the way and later papers often build explicitly or implicitly on previous ones. And when you&#39;re done with that you can go ahead and have your mind explode from [his scientific work,](milesmathis.com) which is a whole &#39;nother mindfuck altogether (in a good way). </p>

He lost his teeth, which is why his face has changed shape (everyone who looses the majority of their teeth goes through this.

<p>It&#39;s also more than just a bit curious that he was mediocre and only middling-fair at science prior to being stricken with all the work that made his name known to everyone only coming along after he was totally incapacitated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually his cheek that controls the computer, the only muscle he still has good control over. An IR sensor in his glasses moves his cheek to stop on a letter of the alphabet - and the computer has SwiftyKey on it, trained from his books and talks.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to ask him? Blink twice if CIA hacked you Steven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that now.  Dating is up for debate in my mind.  There&#39;s a ton of inconsistencies, but some is a no brainer for me like fossils.  Of course they are old as shit.  Ice core samples are far more accurate for dating and they prove that most fossils are much older than biblical interpreters believe.  I&#39;m not trying to preach the biblical prophetic narrative here.  I am simply asking people to question macro evolution... it does not prove any type of creation.  They can leave it out of biology class as far as I&#39;m concerned.  There is still a ton of biology left to teach that is scientifically observed.  Effectively, they have given atheists something to believe in.  Thus making macro evolution a religion, because due to lack of observation, if you &quot;believe&quot; it still, then you are placing blind faith in it... ergo religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What inconsistencies are there with radiometric dating? It&#39;s very simple in that you take an element with a radioactive half-life that fits with the time length that you need to measure. The mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is: D = D0 + N(t) (eλt − 1) where t is age of the sample,
D is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the sample,
D0 is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the original composition, N is number of atoms of the parent isotope in the sample at time t (the present), given by N(t) = Noe-λt, and
λ is the decay constant of the parent isotope, equal to the inverse of the radioactive half-life of the parent isotope times the natural logarithm of 2. The equation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the measured quantity N(t) rather than the constant initial value No. There actually about 20 different elements that you can use to measure radioactive, of which carbon dating one. The only real inconsistencies that come with it is the randomness of radioactive decay. That&#39;s why dating generally has a range. There are definitely some inconsistencies in science that&#39;s reported, and there are researchers who will fudge the numbers and publish a paper that&#39;s no repeatable. The thing about science though is it&#39;s about correcting faulty knowledge through repeated observation and testing. There is no inferent bias in that.</p>

<p>Macro evolution is very clearly documented with the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs. or mammals from synapsid reptiles. People who do not believe in evolution generally either are motivated either from religion or complete lack of understanding it. </p>

<p>People who do not believe in this have not done their research, or have an inherent bias towards evolution. Evolution does not rule out creation AT ALL. It has nothing to do with the origin of life itself, that would be abiogenesis. The terms micro evolution and macro evolution are not used in actual, non religious academia. The terms were invented by creationists as a fallacious argument against science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first paragraph.  You reinforce my initial statement regarding inconsistencies and fudging of numbers.  This is why I refer to ice core data, it is much more consistent and gives us an established timeline of now - how old the ice is.  A few hundred thousand years of good geological, temperature, and well preserved iso data.  I think everyone can get behind that logic.  </p>

<p>As for the rest.  I&#39;m sorry, but citing prehistoric creature evolution is just more examples of micro evolution and natural selection.  It shows no inception of universal life, nor does it explain human evolution in any way.  Human fossils show up randomly in the timeline of archaeology and the jump between primate to man is so vast, observed science would require hundreds of missing links to justify bone structure and muscle transformation in and of themselves.... let alone other physical and mental characteristics.  Applying the darwinian paradigm to humans is a tremendous stretch, and would better be applied to neanderthal or sasquatch archetypes of ancient bipedal ape.  </p>

<p>And I make no defense for religion.  I&#39;m not religious, Christian, Muslim, whatever.... I just see myself as spiritually in tune.  But you can&#39;t use public tax dollars to teach macro evolution as fact when there is no observed science behind it.  </p>

<p>Also, see what I mean with the down votes?  It instantly offends people for them to consider the fact macro-evolution and it&#39;s implementation in public school is a propaganda tool used to further secularize the citizenry.  Less religion is a bad thing, in America at least, because of a plethora of reasons.  Devolution of the moral structure of the populous being one of the biggest.  However, I see Darwinism it&#39;s self as a major catalyst of turning science into religion.  The propaganda it&#39;s self is creating a cult.  </p>

<p>Ok.. how should we teach biology then?</p>

<p>Less religion is bad eh? Just like all those atheist republican politicians who always get caught in gay sex acts...oh wait, nope got confused, must&#39;ve been the Christian/Conservative politicians that do that regularly. Got it, the guys that tell us the bible is law and such. Nice. </p>

<p>Or maybe even that one religion, ya know where they have everything made of gold, and they own a city in Italy... ya know the big church that has been around for centuries trying to force their beliefs on others, while their faculty abuse young boys worldwide.

<p>Darwins theory of evolution was the biggest breakthrough in biology, period. All modern biology stems from this. Teaching biology without teaching evolution is like teaching physics and not including gravity. </p>

<p>I think you don&#39;t understand, there is an awful lot of evidence for evolution. And atheism is not a religion. It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like a-theist, anti-theist. Not following religious doctrine. That&#39;s all it means. There is no collective belief system that atheists follow. </p>

<p>...Evolution is an extremely proven theory. Just ask the Catholic Church</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously &#39;theory&#39; doesn&#39;t means the same as &#39;fact&#39;. Nobody is debating that.</p>

<p>And obviously &#39;scientific theory&#39; and &#39;scientific fact&#39; do not mean the same thing. That&#39;s why they are different words.</p>

<p>Scientific facts are measured and/or observed. They never change. 
Scientific theories are the scientist&#39;s interpretation of the facts. They change when other scientists propose a theory that explains all the evidence better, leaves out less evidence. Once a theory explains everything we know, it gets accepted. Imagine this evidence as thousands arrows on a flat surface, imagine them all pointing the same direction - that is what it looks like to someone when they learn all the facts about the evidence of man made climate change. Once a theory has been accepted, it is still up for complete scrutiny, not like a Holy Book. If you only have 20 bits of evidence and you have a rough idea, once more evidence is discovered it can give you a much better idea of where all the evidence arrow&#39;s are pointing. And the best test of a theory, can you predict something with it?</p>

<p>For instance, consider the theory of gravity. Using math, we can calculate exactly how fast an object will accelerate towards another object. Then we can use our 1000&#39;s of other scientific theories to build a fucking rocket ship. Fly to the moon. Drop some shit and record how fast it goes - guess what - as fast we predict it. So we know the theory is sound.</p>

<p>For the theory of evolution, just go get the two must fucked up looking pugs - make them fuck and see how god damn messed up the babies are in a couple generations. You can do this test at home in only a few years. Or check out all the evidence posted below. So you don&#39;t have to do the tests yourself, you&#39;re welcome.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, the poor babies get exponentially more fucked up down the line. <a href="http://i2.wp.com/trendingpost.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bull-Terrier.jpg?resize=650%2C435">Check this poor fuckers nose out</a> I mean <a href="https://cdn.playbuzz.com/cdn/23611a8a-6157-4f08-9085-a936e6af290a/6cb61340-ac73-4cff-83aa-ac710062a012.jpg">what the fuck is that</a>. And have you seen <a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/boxers-then-and-now.jpg">this poor doggo?</a></p>

<p>That is caused by man interfering with evolution. <a href="https://dogbehaviorscience.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/100-years-of-breed-improvement/">These dogs are suffering.</a>And it&#39;s all because we are forced into incest, never mixing breeds.

<blockquote>
<p>Mainstream science is falsifying and exaggerating info and drawing conclusions based on that fake science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. Do you have a shred of evidence for this claim? Going to guess no. Take a look at this <a href="https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer">interactive tree of life.</a> Take 20 minutes and have a look at this thing, there is evidence that supports this entire tree. You see the dinosaurs going extinct? You see the crazy complexity of this thing? That&#39;s where we came from, look at all the things in between. See those neanderthals extint next to us? ayyyy get rekt. Although <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/neanderthal/">2% of caucasian DNA is from neanderthals</a>.</p>

<p>Right. Next look at how close to us chimps are to us. Then go watch some monkeys on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02544td/episodes/player">Planet Earth</a> then tell me you really can&#39;t see then acting at all like us, even though out brains, anatomy, emotions are extremely similar. (yes our emotions are a product of evolution.)</p>

<p>I ask you to read this post at least, check out the sources and have a read for a while. See what you think.</p>

<p>Please suggest some reading material that suggests otherwise. I will happily read it, but I don&#39;t think you are correct at the moment.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that Hitler believed in Germany for the Germans, that was his whole appeal. It was called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/hitler_lebensraum_01.shtml"><em>Lebensraum</em> (&#39;living space&#39;).</a> As you would learn if you read any books on the topic.</p>

<p>But I do not believe that Hilter and the Nazi party being right wing has anything to do with you not understanding what a scientific theory and what a scientific fact are. You are projecting on me, calling me brainwashed when you know your beliefs hold no substance. Unlike you, I question all my beliefs and would happily change my opinions if you had some evidence you back up anything you&#39;ve said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately saying things like &quot;Only Nazi&#39;s study Nazi&#39;s&quot; proves you&#39;re a moron and a hypocrite, when you also say things like &quot;He was a failed liberal art student who blamed it on ethnicities he deemed privileged. Also a vegan, anti gun, and a socialist, like you.&quot; - so you have to admit either you have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about (not studied Nazism) or you&#39;re a filthy fucking Nazi.</p>

<p>And also saying &quot;Didn&#39;t read it don&#39;t care what you think&quot; followed by telling me to &quot;Read outside your box some time.&quot; is another example of you being a complete hypocrite.</p>

<p>During a visit to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which would require round-the-clock nursing care, and remove what remained of his speech. [55] [56] The
National Health Service would pay for a nursing home, but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation. [57] [58] Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking&#39;s second wife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. It&#39;s all there, we only have to unwind it. First of all, if you have had ALS for 23 years and have pneumonia to the point that doctors are recommending life support be terminated, a tracheotomy isn&#39;t going to cure you immediately. A tracheotomy is just the procedure of drilling a hole in your windpipe so you can breath through it instead of your nose or mouth. But the problems obviously went far beyond that, or they wouldn&#39;t have been recommending life support termination. He was probably losing control of his diaphragm, and couldn&#39;t fill his lungs on his own. That is what happens with ALS, you know: you lose control of parts of your body one by one, until you finally lose control of them all. We aren&#39;t told why a tracheotomy suddenly allowed him to go off the ventilator, for instance. So none of this makes any sense. If you have any doctor friends, ask them what they think of this paragraph at Wikipedia. They may tell you the truth. </p>

He&#39;s among the top tier, sure, but a lot of his attention (like it or not) stems from him being bound to a wheelchair and surviving as long as this. His studies of black holes and using general relativity are, of course notable..but the public enjoys the idea of living in a time of modern Einstein, whether it&#39;s accurate or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking this too after I read those Snowden leaks.. I figured if they could get into anything what&#39;s stopping them from having Stephen Hawking tell us what we &quot;want&quot; to hear. Hopefully it&#39;s not true and those are just personal beliefs he&#39;s sharing but if he is being controlled then I certainly hope he&#39;s not in there suffering through it all. It&#39;s a sensitive subject as you don&#39;t want to look like you&#39;re making fun of the condition or trivializing it but based on pretty much everything that&#39;s been leaked about our government regarding cyber weapons and technology it&#39;d be ignorant to think this couldn&#39;t be a possibility. </p>

<p>Teachers should simply teach biology.  Macro evolution is but a small part of the subject, attempting to explain creation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Darwins theory of evolution was the biggest breakthrough in biology, period. All modern biology stems from this. Teaching biology without teaching evolution is like teaching physics and not including gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since there is no observed science for creation... stop teaching it.  It is effectively the atheist&#39;s belief system, in other words religion.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you don&#39;t understand, there is an awful lot of evidence for evolution. And atheism is not a religion. It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like a-theist, anti-theist. Not following religious doctrine. That&#39;s all it means. There is no collective belief system that atheists follow. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If both evolution and religious explanation for creation are unproven theories, you should teach neither in tax payer funded public school.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Evolution is an extremely proven theory. Just ask the Catholic Church</p>
