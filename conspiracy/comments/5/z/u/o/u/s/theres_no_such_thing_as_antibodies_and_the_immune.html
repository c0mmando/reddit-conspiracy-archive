       Antibodies are too small to be seen by light microscopes. But the images we have from electron microscopes are also suspect.

       Why are the antibodies all oriented in the same way? Antibodies take on a shape that is reminiscent of the letter Y.

       If they are scattered randomly, then we should see a random assortment of

       Depending on how the antibody is sliced, their appearance under the microscope should vary. And yet they don't...

       Well, it's based on the idea of the immune system having a memory, which then allows it to produce specific antibodies in response to specific antigens.

       Oh right. Well it's tied to vaccination, which mainly comes from Pasteur and Jenner.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the actual discovery of antibodies comes from a biologist named Oswald Avery. He was also involved in the discovery of DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kitasato Shibasaburō discovered that animals injected with bacteria produced a neutralising substance called an anti toxin and that this substance was specific. He would be the first scientist to describe them.

        original transcript
       </a>
       of the ruling from the OLG Stuttgart, February 2016.
 
Paragraph 20 says:
       <strong>
        The phenomena presented as measles viruses are actually cellular vesicles.
       </strong>
       Paragraph 29
       <strong>
        Which is possible only through "negative staining", which was not done.
       </strong>
       Furthermore, the determination of the diameter should not have been carried out on the basis of models and drawings, but this was done in the sixth publication
 
Ultimately paragraph 122 says this:
 
“As a result, the appeal, in so far as it is admissible, is in any event successful, because
       <strong>
        the criterion of the claim to prove the existence of the measles virus by "a scientific publication" was not fulfilled by the applicant.
       </strong>

       There isn't much other discussion on the idea of immunity elsewhere. This documentary about German New Medicine

       I use SEM for work sometimes:

       1 - you do not need to prepare samples with a microtome. You can seriously glob what ever you want onto the sample holder and your good to go.  I'm not in the medical field, so I don't know their typical prep methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - you can cut thin sections to what ever thickness you want.

       Even if preparation doesn't require any slicing, it would still be unusual for 3D objects such as antibodies to all be arranged in almost exactly the same direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a bit like rolling several die and getting just sixes. The antibodies in the picture look more like 2 dimensional objects; similar to the appearance of the letter Y on a page, rather than the 3D Y.

       Viruses are the ultimate parasite: they don't even have to be alive to do their dirty work. They coopt the workings of a cell, and that's why they can be miniscule on their own - they don't need all the fancy self-sufficiency stuff if they can steal it.

       So are you saying that science can
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       be profited from without being distorted? That as soon as a single penny can be made, the entire discovery and all those involved become corrupt? I'm not saying that corporations never lie, I'm just doubting the claim that there does not exist valid, proven science that corporate rely on to make a profit. Hell, many applications of the sciences literally cannot be distorted or else they would not work, for example, cold medicine. Many companies sell cold medicine, so you would call it "corporate science." But the effects of the drug is clear: your symptoms are reduced when you take it. How do you conflate the idea of a corporation making money off of proven cause and effect, or "real science".

       I am using my common sense. There are a millions types of bacteria. There are types that your body doesn't react to because they don't cause issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are types that do, like cholera. A simple proof is the Broad Street pump discovery which is what I was referring to. The logical conclusions are quite simple and easy to achieve. People get sick more when drinking water that has high amounts of the cholera bacterium in it. Those whose pumps were not infected didn't have a high number of cases, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we vaccinate as well, to ensure our body doesn't get overwhelmed by unknown bacteria and can defend itself. It's called having a known enemy and is a universal fact even in human warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply by saying "there are bacteria in the air and I'm not sick so there" is complete hogwash. Your body has a resistance to many if not all types if bacteria around you right now due to simple exposure if not immunity from exposure at a younger age.

We'll it's not good enough for me.

       And you can't have a "known enemy" when the variety of different bacteria and fungus is so astronomically large.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this. If we are surrounded by, and our own body is permeated with microscopic organisms then how come we are not sick all the time? 
The "known enemy" theory cannot apply, since there are constant mutations and infinite varieties of organisms all around us.

       I don't think you read my comment. The taught in school part was the
       <em>
        Broad Street pump discovery
       </em>
       . It's part of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes you can have a known enemy when they mutate. Its like asking someone to identity pi. Even if you change a few digits in the 10000th ish places, your average person will still recognize it as pi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Random mutations are very very minor in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the bigger mutations, viruses mutate much faster due to their style of reproduction and the fact they are basically just rogue RNA. Example: the flu
      </p>
      <p>
       Bacteria don't mutate so quickly because they are living organisms and dont reproduce the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bacteria in our gut are helpful and thus our body doesn't try to fight them off. When foreign bacteria come in, our body gets alerted and then a fever happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah 'known enemy' works since our body doesn't look for the full pattern to recognize bacteria, but instead looks for certain key elements and proteins on the surface. Taking the pi analogy again, it's like identifying a number as pi based on seeing 3.14 at the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, how do you explain AIDS and other such immunodeficiency disorders? If there is no immune system and bacteria don't exist, how does AIDS occur and a normally healthy person start getting sick of every disease they come across?

       The vast majority of bacteria &amp; viruses you run into aren't targeting humans - or even animals. Of those that do target humans, a significant chunk are warded off by the immune system pretty effectively, leaving only a thin sliver of properly dangerous stuff. A good chunk of that last sliver is counteracted with vaccination, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also nature lives in 'harmony' only in the sense that there's a precarious cold war going on, complete with the occasional arms race. Red in tooth and claw, you know?

       I'm still not sure why we get measles once and don't get it again. Maybe after measles the tissue is permanently changed in some way?

       Indeed, immunity is only a theory, as are many concepts in micro-science. But a few things for you to ponder on:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         how can the technique of immunoassay be so effective at creating practical results if antibodies/antigens does not exist
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         how does the process of allergy occur, i.e. what catalyses the reaction of inflammation, etc (and would this not be the immune system 'fighting'? Coming up with a fever?)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is your interpretation therefore of AIDS as a disease of failing immune system?

       I was going to post the immunoassay one.  It's not a small thing if antibodies don't exist, they create antibodies to all kinds of things specifically to develop tests all the time.  If there aren't any antibodies we need new explanations for why everything from HIV tests to pregnancy tests work.

       The antibody test for pregnancy involves using antibodies to detect human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that increases in the blood of pregnant women.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other changes that occur, like changes in bacterial content and also in insulin levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps these are the changes detected by the tests, if we assume that antibodies don't exist.

       A lot of experiments we do are simply glorified magic tricks. Immunoassay could easily just be gram staining of bacteria to produce different colours.

       For your answer to immunoassay I really can't agree, it's much much more specific than a simplistic technique like gram staining (you say "...experiments WE do..." do I understand then that you have personally performed an immunoassay?

       Finally I would like to say, you can maintain your argument that the immune system does not exist while still conceding that antigens-antibodies do exist, their concept is not so ridiculous, very similar to the concept of ligand-receptor (or do you not believe in ligand-receptor?)

       Wait. My daughter and I are both sero negative for mononucleosis, measles, chickenpox and shingles. That literally means that we've had those infections under observation, had a blood test for the antibody, came back negative, had a full blood culture and tested positive for the virus. That leads me to believe that antibodies do, indeed, exist or they wouldn't have sent us for culture testing.

       That is false.  Proteins fold into specific shapes.  Look up "protein structure alpha helix" and "protein structure beta sheet".

       I am not going to bother with explaining the whole subject.  Certainly, interested parties can buy the book "Introduction to protein structure." and educate themselves on their own time.

       Why are you assuming that evidence for antibodies rest solely on visualizing them?  I mean, I'm a chemist, I can't "see" the molecules I make, but I can infer their structure, from NMR, IR, and mass spec. measurements.

       of the ruling from the OLG Stuttgart, February 2016.
 
Paragraph 20 says:
       <strong>
        The phenomena presented as measles viruses are actually cellular vesicles.
       </strong>
       Paragraph 29
       <strong>
        Which is possible only through "negative staining", which was not done.
       </strong>
       Furthermore, the determination of the diameter should not have been carried out on the basis of models and drawings, but this was done in the sixth publication
 
Ultimately paragraph 122 says this:
 
“As a result, the appeal, in so far as it is admissible, is in any event successful, because
       <strong>
        the criterion of the claim to prove the existence of the measles virus by "a scientific publication" was not fulfilled by the applicant.

       I was not referring to the original photo, did you go to my link? Those are not nearly as grainy, and taken from multiple sources.

       So are you saying that science can
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       be profited from without being distorted? That as soon as a single penny can be made, the entire discovery and all those involved become corrupt? I'm not saying that corporations never lie, I'm just doubting the claim that there does not exist valid, proven science that corporate rely on to make a profit. Hell, many applications of the sciences literally cannot be distorted or else they would not work, for example, cold medicine. Many companies sell cold medicine, so you would call it "corporate science." But the effects of the drug is clear: your symptoms are reduced when you take it. How do you conflate the idea of a corporation making money off of proven cause and effect, or "real science".
