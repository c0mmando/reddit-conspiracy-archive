        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Antibodies are too small to be seen by light microscopes. But the images we have from electron microscopes are also suspect.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://starklab.slu.edu/neuro/Rh1Antibody.jpg">picture</a> illustrates the inconsistencies with 3D geometry that are all too common with electron micrographs.</p>

<p>Why are the antibodies all oriented in the same way? Antibodies take on a shape that is reminiscent of the letter Y.</p>

<p>If they are scattered randomly, then we should see a random assortment of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=3d+image+of+the+letter+Y&amp;safe=active&amp;hl=en&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd-LrFiczSAhWBjxQKHRXpAzUQ_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1289&amp;bih=677">orientations</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>When a sample is prepared for the electron microscope, an ultramicrotome is used to create a thin section.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v14/n8/fig_tab/ni.2621_F1.html">Antibodies are about 3μm long</a>. Ultramicrotomes cut sections, which are around 50 to 100nm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramicrotomy">thick</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are 1000 nm in a μm, so the antibody length is longer than the length of the section cut by the ultramicrotome.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/marderlab/content/orders%20of%20magnitude/magnitude.jpg">The orders of magnitude</a> show that an antibody of length 3μm would inevitably be sliced by a tool cutting sections of width 100nm.</p>

<p>Depending on how the antibody is sliced, their appearance under the microscope should vary. And yet they don&#39;t...</p>

<p><strong>At best, this picture is an artefact of the preparation process, at worst, it may be a CGI composite.</strong></p>

<p>White blood cells exist and do indeed recycle bacterial cells. But there is no ‘antigen specific immunity’ and the idea of immunity is a hoax...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh right. Well it&#39;s tied to vaccination, which mainly comes from Pasteur and Jenner. </p>

<p>But the actual discovery of antibodies comes from a biologist named Oswald Avery. He was also involved in the discovery of DNA.</p>

<p>Kitasato Shibasaburō discovered that animals injected with bacteria produced a neutralising substance called an anti toxin and that this substance was specific. He would be the first scientist to describe them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s discussed in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC382621/pdf/canmedaj00108-0082b.pdf">this article</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you found it interesting. Stefan Lanka stated way back in 1994 that viruses don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>His <a href="http://neue-medizin.com/lanka2.htm">website</a></p>

<p>He also won a court case in Germany, during which it was found that the Measles virus does not exist.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="http://lrbw.juris.de/cgi-bin/laender_rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bw&amp;amp;GerichtAuswahl=Oberlandesgerichte&amp;amp;Art=en&amp;amp;sid=46bf3db2df690aba6e4874acafaf45b6&amp;amp;nr=20705&amp;amp;pos=0&amp;amp;anz=1">original transcript</a> of the ruling from the OLG Stuttgart, February 2016.
 
Paragraph 20 says:
<strong>The phenomena presented as measles viruses are actually cellular vesicles.</strong>
 
Paragraph 29
<strong>Which is possible only through &quot;negative staining&quot;, which was not done.</strong> Furthermore, the determination of the diameter should not have been carried out on the basis of models and drawings, but this was done in the sixth publication
 
Ultimately paragraph 122 says this:
 
“As a result, the appeal, in so far as it is admissible, is in any event successful, because <strong>the criterion of the claim to prove the existence of the measles virus by &quot;a scientific publication&quot; was not fulfilled by the applicant.</strong> </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much other discussion on the idea of immunity elsewhere. This documentary about German New Medicine <a href="https://youtu.be/Z57uBCcOdvI?t=2h16m7s">briefly discusses it here</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>It is from a laser scanning confocal microscope, not an SEM.  </p>

<p>I use SEM for work sometimes:</p>

<p>1 - you do not need to prepare samples with a microtome. You can seriously glob what ever you want onto the sample holder and your good to go.  I&#39;m not in the medical field, so I don&#39;t know their typical prep methods.</p>

<p>2 - you can cut thin sections to what ever thickness you want.</p>

<p>Even if preparation doesn&#39;t require any slicing, it would still be unusual for 3D objects such as antibodies to all be arranged in almost exactly the same direction.</p>

<p>It would be a bit like rolling several die and getting just sixes. The antibodies in the picture look more like 2 dimensional objects; similar to the appearance of the letter Y on a page, rather than the 3D Y.</p>

<p>So are you saying that science can <em>never</em> be profited from without being distorted? That as soon as a single penny can be made, the entire discovery and all those involved become corrupt? I&#39;m not saying that corporations never lie, I&#39;m just doubting the claim that there does not exist valid, proven science that corporate rely on to make a profit. Hell, many applications of the sciences literally cannot be distorted or else they would not work, for example, cold medicine. Many companies sell cold medicine, so you would call it &quot;corporate science.&quot; But the effects of the drug is clear: your symptoms are reduced when you take it.

<p>So that makes it true? How in depth did you study this theory in order to confirm or deny it proposal? 
Lots of things are taught in school. Most of those things are false. 
But by all means, continue to consume and regurgitate what exactly is fed to you. Most people are incapable of critical thinking. </p>

<p>Sickness exists. The reason why is not what you were taught. It&#39;s not bacteria. Bacteria is everywhere. Use your common sense.</p>

<p>How lovely. Thanks for assuming something about me despite having no knowledge about me or anything I have or have not done in life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacteria is everywhere. Use your common sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am using my common sense. There are a millions types of bacteria. There are types that your body doesn&#39;t react to because they don&#39;t cause issues.</p>

<p>There are types that do, like cholera. A simple proof is the Broad Street pump discovery which is what I was referring to. The logical conclusions are quite simple and easy to achieve. People get sick more when drinking water that has high amounts of the cholera bacterium in it. Those whose pumps were not infected didn&#39;t have a high number of cases, if any.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we vaccinate as well, to ensure our body doesn&#39;t get overwhelmed by unknown bacteria and can defend itself. It&#39;s called having a known enemy and is a universal fact even in human warfare.</p>

<p>Simply by saying &quot;there are bacteria in the air and I&#39;m not sick so there&quot; is complete hogwash. Your body has a resistance to many if not all types if bacteria around you right now due to simple exposure if not immunity from exposure at a younger age.</p>

We&#39;ll it&#39;s not good enough for me. </p>

<p>And you can&#39;t have a &quot;known enemy&quot; when the variety of different bacteria and fungus is so astronomically large. </p>

<p>Ask yourself this. If we are surrounded by, and our own body is permeated with microscopic organisms then how come we are not sick all the time? 
The &quot;known enemy&quot; theory cannot apply, since there are constant mutations and infinite varieties of organisms all around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you read my comment. The taught in school part was the <em>Broad Street pump discovery</em>. It&#39;s part of history.</p>

<p>And yes you can have a known enemy when they mutate. Its like asking someone to identity pi. Even if you change a few digits in the 10000th ish places, your average person will still recognize it as pi.</p>

<p>Random mutations are very very minor in most cases.</p>

<p>As for the bigger mutations, viruses mutate much faster due to their style of reproduction and the fact they are basically just rogue RNA. Example: the flu</p>

<p>Bacteria don&#39;t mutate so quickly because they are living organisms and dont reproduce the same way. </p>

<p>The bacteria in our gut are helpful and thus our body doesn&#39;t try to fight them off. When foreign bacteria come in, our body gets alerted and then a fever happens. </p>

<p>So yeah &#39;known enemy&#39; works since our body doesn&#39;t look for the full pattern to recognize bacteria, but instead looks for certain key elements and proteins on the surface. Taking the pi analogy again, it&#39;s like identifying a number as pi based on seeing 3.14 at the start. </p>

<p>By the way, how do you explain AIDS and other such immunodeficiency disorders? If there is no immune system and bacteria don&#39;t exist, how does AIDS occur and a normally healthy person start getting sick of every disease they come across?</p>

<p>now the video of the bacterium morphing into blood cell....this is something i had never heard about and looks super interesting, thank you for the link</p>

<p>Finally I would like to say, you can maintain your argument that the immune system does not exist while still conceding that antigens-antibodies do exist, their concept is not so ridiculous, very similar to the concept of ligand-receptor (or do you not believe in ligand-receptor?)</p>

Paragraph 20 says:

Paragraph 29
<strong>Which is possible only through &quot;negative staining&quot;, which was not done.</strong> Furthermore, the determination of the diameter should not have been carried out on the basis of models and drawings, but this was done in the sixth publication
 
Ultimately paragraph 122 says this:
 
“As a result, the appeal, in so far as it is admissible, is in any event successful, because <strong>the criterion of the claim to prove the existence of the measles virus by &quot;a scientific publication&quot; was not fulfilled by the applicant.</strong> </p>

I&#39;m not saying that corporations never lie, I&#39;m just doubting the claim that there does not exist valid, proven science that corporate rely on to make a profit.
