       I've been into conspiracies since a young age because my dad told me about the 9/11 conspiracy theory when I was just 12. And then I started reading more theories. I'm 25 now and since last year I've got back into conspiracies really hard to the point where I'm see them everywhere in daily life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I see 666 in innocent looking brand logos and I pick up on cues that hint to Satan worship etc. Plus with all the Pizzagate stuff being validated means even the most harmless things I analyse and see sinister things. I can't stop, I'm just so suspicious of everything including everything I eat and the clothes I wear. Our whole life from beginning to end is a conspiracy. I enjoy video games but now I'm seeing NWO references in them as well and it ruins my enjoyment and time playing games, which are supposed to destress me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk what to do. Therapy never helps me.

       The only religious person I know is a textbook catholic.  They are younger than me, study the Bible, attend baptisms, church, never swear, no sex before marriage etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet they listen to all the pop music that the elite pump out which is full of sexual innuendo and occult themes. They consume TV and movies like all the other proles. They study business at university, one of the careers that is implicit in the financial slavery of humans. So you see, they are no different. They have no idea.

       It really is the only thing you can do. Meditate, grow a garden, go hunting or fishing. Help out at a community center. If you have the money, buy some land and homestead it. Raise some small animals (chickens, rabbits, etc etc) or large livestock. Try your hardest to live as far away from the system as possible. A lot easier said than done, though.

       I kind of get what you're implying. I mentioned conspiracies about clothes, you counter with OBEY which is both a brand of clothing and a word that means...well, to obey authority. This is not what I was referring to. You've missed the mark but good effort.

       You can be into conspiracies and also have a healthy social life. Don't become obsessed with any one thing. Try to engage with new people and learn from people with different lifestyles than your own. Make sure you get out and experience life!

       not a bible thumper, but the nature of human beings is to find balance..alot of things in the world keep you off balance...so look at the seven deadly sins..then think of their mirror opposites..find balance between these extreme negatives and positives

       first..breathe...then understand there is a thing called analysis paralysis, information can be a double edged sword.  Take comfort in nature, take walks.  Knowing based on internet info is kinda subjective..not saying true(or false)..this is about peace of mind and self preservation.  Patience and youth in a sugared up television driven world at 25 prob has your mind outrunning your actions.  Think of yourself as a car driving at night sometimes, you can only see as far as the headlights shine but you are moving.  All these things happening in the information age are happening fast. I don't have all the answers but i can suggest self sufficiency, energy and water production...DIY channels are my favorite cause McGuyver could do anything.  Don't let the perceived landscape of things steal the joy out of life, cause even what you perceive is controlled.  Get a dog.  Think of that animal as a bit from first Tron movie(fictional base program that could only answer yes or no)..a dog only understands base emotions..love, hate, eat, sleep, hump, pee and poop..this animal ages 7 times faster than a human.  Time is relative and things will change alot more, maybe for the better maybe not..but its worth seeing.  Realizing things around you...like how VitaminWater has not vitamins(they took the space out so the two words Vitamin and water do not mean vitamins and water so vitaminwater..a word that didn't exist before they trademarked it is sold under a guise that you will be drinking vitamins and water..sugar liquid)..chicanery everywhere...i would suggest traveling abroad, don't just visit France for a week..spend 2+ months there immerse yourself into the culture learn the language, study the difference between cultures.  Your 25..still got the momentum of youth, big world to see.  Many good and bad things in this world..don't stay stuck on clu types(can't create squat).  Find Happiness(as long as its like not hurting people or animals )

       also video games are fun but aren't the answer..the makers of the games follow formulas to keep you addicted..go back to NES and see the base equations of games and see how the new games just recycle old narratives mostly...watch westworld..see the people that have gotten bored with the narrative..set your life up to maintain new experiences at a reasonable pace of everyday life..in America the pace of life can vary..Northeast of US are the uptights and overly competitive and self important.  The south is less efficient but soulful and partying is politics...west coast..those fuckers do drugs and don't remember yesterday(perceived in the movie The Informers perfectly)...Knowledge is a mirror..it will show you who you are and who you want to be(cloud atlas)..experience equals knowledge..seek wisdom from those with more experience...and try to stay out of debt.

       This may sound stupid, but try it anyway if you've got a good place.  Try gardening.  Nothing makes you stop thinking about the BS in the world better in my own experience then growing things yourself.  The satisfaction you feel will surprise you, if you have any inclination for such things.  I am into gardening for just that reason most of all, as well as exercise and better food.  Best of luck.

       In every conspiracy theory I found myself obsessed with it came back to the same 3 things. God, lies, and why.  That's why  I find myself questioning everything and anyone. The entire world is a giant grey area-Nothing is black or white it's all a giant contradiction. 
My favorite thing to question was religion up until a few months ago when it became obvious that God seems to be at the bottom of many rabbit holes. I don't believe in organized religion but I do believe in God after embarking through a lot of the topics in this sub.

       thats some cypher, number 23 stuff right there..i hope this guy is joking...as a person who has limited time on this planet, create that which didn't exist before you got here but can stay and inspire others long after you are gone.
