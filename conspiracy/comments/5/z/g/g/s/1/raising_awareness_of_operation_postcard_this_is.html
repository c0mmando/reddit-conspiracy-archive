        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The time has come for us to go beyond doing research, and posting online. We have found more than enough evidence to convince any open minded, rational, honest person that the allegations of elite pedophelia being rampant in our government and other institutions are real. </p>

<p>In my opinion, we still do not have enough support among the public to stage a protest that would be taken seriously. Some have even suggested that we should avoid doing such a thing because of COINTELPRO tactics that could be used against us. I understand why someone would be weary of publicly demonstrating against this, knowing the kind of people are in charge.</p>

<p>What is a simple way we can all anonymously get involved in a real way that goes beyond a Tweet or an upvote? Postcards!</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2017/03/08/send-a-postcard-to-president-trump-on-march-15/">unrelated campaign</a> to send the white house a postcard on March 15. I&#39;m sure they will get a mix of support and &quot;go back to Russia!&quot;, but imagine if we could make this be the biggest issue? I think that could send a serious message that we are ready to get the ball rolling, and that it needs to happen as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t possibly set us back in any way, and we owe it to ourselves to at least try. It is the absolute least we could do. And we don&#39;t even have to just do it on one day. If you are reading this at any point in the future, and John Podesta isn&#39;t in prison, and you haven&#39;t sent a postcard, send one!</p>

<p>Address:</p>

<p>President Donald J Trump</p>

<p>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW</p>

<p>Washington, DC 20500</p>

<p>Share this wherever it will be heard!</p>

<p>And for any naysayers that want to convince us that Trump will never prosecute, for whatever reason, then that is exactly why you should send him a postcard. If I was confident he would take care of this issue on his own, then I wouldn&#39;t have bothered to make this thread. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not Trump ever intended to make this a priority. It is up to us to make our voices heard in whatever way possible - make the change happen!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s please make a sticky out of this for at least tomorrow to raise awareness. Would be amazing if we could get an #OperationPostcard trend going 3/15/17.</p>

<p>Violence is not the answer. If you haven&#39;t noticed, they have been trying to provoke civil unrest since Trump won the election.</p>

<p>Did I say that? You know that you can make a felony arrest without being a police officer, right?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for unthinking pacifism. If they&#39;re going to ignore pedophilia, we&#39;re going to have to solve the problem ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason we have guns is because of exactly what is going on in our government. If this happened in the 1700s we would have replaced the government by now. But it&#39;s not and we have an amazing ability to share information faster than ever. Violence could very well turn into our only answer, but we have to believe for now that the American people are better than this and trust we can show them the light. </p>

<p>This may very well be why nothing has really happened yet, not enough of the people to back the president when it will matter most.</p>
