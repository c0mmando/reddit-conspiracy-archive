        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">404</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Golden_Shart.html">Golden_Shart</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hundreds of online reputation management and pr agencies plague this website every day. They have people staffed to have active &amp; aged accounts with organic-looking posts and comments. These companies will have contracted individuals who have geniune activity on their accounts and regularly post normal content. Every single one of these shills follows strict guidelines for how to properly misdirect and manipulate comment sections of a post. </p>

<p><strong>Bolded</strong> sections are COINTELPRO techniques. </p>

<p>The steps look something like this:  </p>

<ul>
<li> Shill account makes a post covertly promoting a brand, by either having the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4zjc76/the_boyfriend_got_in_trouble_yesterday_he_sent/">logo of the product in the picture</a>, or <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5y3r16/nike_is_launching_a_hijab_collection_that_muslim/">pretending to be a random person finding out about something a company just did or has done in the past</a>. Posts like these promoting companies are identical to the ones slandering companies, the only difference is that the most visible and highest upvoted comments will have a strong bias against the relevant company. <strong>This type of PR forum manipulation is called &quot;consensus cracking&quot;, where a post that is either unbiased or biased for a specific brand or opinion is debunked, exposed or criticized heavily by a highly visible, high upvoted comment/comments that appear to provide strong talking points and evidence but also heavily nuanced with conjecture, rhetoric, and opinion.</strong> </li>
<li> As to not raise suspicion and prevent unwanted backfire, shill content posters like these will have very limited interaction in the comment section and very rarely express interest or bias on the subject at hand, unless in a political-oriented subreddit.<br/></li>
<li> The comments that are intended to be the most visible will be posted the earliest and immediately upvoted. This is done to immediately create a popular opinion within a specific thread and introduce a forum manipulation tactic called <strong>forum &quot;sliding&quot; or &quot;flushing&quot;</strong><br/></li>
<li> To forum slide or flush, dissenting replies are immediately curtailed by shill redditors replying to the same comment with off-topic, unrelated, and nondamaging comments. These comments will be upvoted immediately by shill accounts and the target comment will slowly lose its visibility. As the thread matures the consensus within this section of comments will be so strong that shill accounts won&#39;t even need to downvote the target comment, actual redditors will do it for them.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>This is simple to do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxNvUWN3vYk">In fact, it can be done for as little as $200 for one post (albeit probably poorly).</a>  </p>

<p>Now take posts like these happening in all corners of the website and let it marinate for 11 years. At this point the shilling is at all-time high as the website is in the top 10 of most popular websites in the US, and top 25 of the most popular websites in the world, but most of the shilling is not done by paid employees of PR companies nor is it done by popular shill redditors looking to make money off their account&#39;s gravitas. It&#39;s done unwittingly by the vast majority of the community. Almost every person on this website is promoting a company or an opinion or arguing against it using talking points invented by special interest groups or PR companies.  </p>

<p>This subreddit is not an exception.  </p>

<p>Many of us are unintentionally rebounding arguments and ideas cooked up inside of an office, focusing on non-issue events or people and scrutinizing them intensely while overlooking the things we should be talking about. Cooking up conspiracies about things that the elite want us to be focusing on.  </p>

<p>In the face of overwhelming criticism I believe PizzaGate was/is one of these things. What a fantastical world it would be if every single crooked politician we regularly discuss in a negative light were involved in a systemic effort to actively commit the most heinous crimes a human-being could possibly partake in? How did we think that we were &quot;uncovering&quot; anything about PizzaGate at any point in a public online forum, where any evidence we muster together against the accused is visible for them to see as we find out about it? This subreddit is not a safespace where everyone developing a conspiracy is welcome but everyone we develop a conspiracy about is somehow unable to get access. Even if we came across hard evidence for the police to actually do something, do you think it would&#39;ve been there by the time they were able to get to it? The details of PizzaGate and where to find out more about it was discussed in Washington Post articles. It struck all the right chords at the right time. Bill Clinton has a terrible sexual misconduct record and ties with Epstein. The Clinton&#39;s were extremely relevant at the time and subject to heavy scrutiny with their corruptness. Systemic pedophile rings have always been a relevant subject among conspiracy theorists as proof of their existence is rampant.  </p>

<p>Posts about this conspiracy were littered with hit and run attacks against anyone who presented an unpopular opinion. Actual healthy discussion about PizzaGate was very limited. Skeptics of PizzaGate were often labelled as liberals and idiots oblivious to the real world, and people promoting PizzaGate were often labelled by the other side as right-wing Trumpettes or conspiritards within our own subreddit. The purpose of the subreddit is to develop conspiracies in an environment where all perspectives are taken into account and discussed and that never happened with this.</p>

<p>In the nature of this post, I don&#39;t want there to be any predisposed opinion on PizzaGate within this thread. I believe it&#39;s very possible and likely that a lot of aspects from the PizzaGate theory could be true, and when the theory was first being developed I was strongly interested in it. I simply propose that it&#39;s very possible this could&#39;ve been a misdirection theory and I think in order for this sub to thrive we need to approach all theories with a heavy amount of skepticism no matter how damning or wonderful they might be. That is key to making this sub as genuine as possible and an outlier of this manipulated website.</p>

<p>So with all this being said, what else can be done to prevent this subreddit from becoming like every other echo chamber on this website?</p>

<p>No where in that comment did I say the NYT is &quot;just a little biased,&quot; and no where in that comment did I imply that. You say you don&#39;t want to argue? Than maybe be a little more careful in your reading analysis. </p>

<p>Seriously, read the comment again. You COMPLETELY misinterpreted what I was saying, or you are intentionally muddying the waters <em>right now</em> (which is a classic shill technique, I might add). That comment was merely meant to communicate the idea that some fake news is &quot;faker&quot; than other fake news, and so maybe that term isn&#39;t as useful as people think.</p>

<p>You have no idea what you are talking about. I guess you can feel validated by cherry picking a few comments that <strong>you think</strong> are &quot;lefty talking points&quot; but anyone else can see my history, and see that is bullshit.</p>

<p>And you know what? I find the entire idea that someone would pay people to pretend to be liberal, on a CONSPIRACY FORUM, in order to influence public opinion, to be absolutely laughable. Why? Because this is a fringe community with little to no influence on public policy/opinion. It would be literally a waste of money for CTR or Shareblue to actually hire people to post on this sub.</p>

<p>If anyone around here is a shill, it&#39;s the people continually pushing the most ridiculous conspiracies and trying to muddy the waters and sow discord and division.</p>

<p>Russia: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One Russian newspaper put the <strong>number of employees at 400,</strong> with a budget of at least 20 million rubles (roughly $400,000) a month. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?_r=1">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?_r=1</a></p>

<p>Britiain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The British army is creating a special force of Facebook warriors, skilled in psychological operations and use of social media to engage in unconventional warfare in the information age.</p>

<p>The 77th Brigade, to be based in Hermitage, near Newbury, in Berkshire, will be about <strong>1,500-strong</strong> and formed of units drawn from across the army. It will formally come into being in April.</p>

<p>The brigade will be responsible for what is described as non-lethal warfare. Both the Israeli and US army already engage heavily in psychological operations.</p>

<p>Against a background of 24-hour news, smartphones and social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, the force will attempt to control the narrative. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade</a></p>

<p>Israel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israeli government paying bilingual students to spread propaganda online primarily to international communities without having to identify themselves as working for the government. &quot;The [student] union will operate computer rooms for the project...it was decided to establish a permanent structure of activity on the Internet through the students at academic institutions in the country.&quot;</p>

<p>The plan aims to harness <strong>550</strong> bilingual students drawn from the student pool at the country’s seven universities, who will target their efforts abroad. <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/pmo-stealthily-recruiting-students-for-online-advocacy/">http://www.timesofisrael.com/pmo-stealthily-recruiting-students-for-online-advocacy/</a></p>

<p>US:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congressional negotiators on Wednesday approved an initiative to track and combat foreign propaganda amid growing concerns that Russian efforts to spread “fake news” and disinformation threaten U.S. national security.</p>

<p>The measure, part of the National Defense Authorization Act approved by a conference committee, calls on the State Department to lead governmentwide efforts to identify propaganda and counter its effects. The authorization is for <em>$160 million over two years.</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/effort-to-combat-foreign-propaganda-advances-in-congress/2016/11/30/9147e1ac-e221-47be-ab92-9f2f7e69d452_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/effort-to-combat-foreign-propaganda-advances-in-congress/2016/11/30/9147e1ac-e221-47be-ab92-9f2f7e69d452_story.html</a> </p>

<p>I know I must be doing something right because I have a few Reddit stalkers. One guy follows me around Reddit and claims that I am &quot;anti vaccine and anti gmo,&quot; but provides no evidence. Curiously, his comments get upvoted even though he doesn&#39;t show where I supposedly said these things. There was another stalker yesterday who had a huge post about how I&#39;m a Russian shill. It keeps going on and on, so I&#39;m obviously hitting a nerve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same exact boat myself. I have no problem with being pro-trump (as I am - gotta admit ya bias), but these professional redditors can fuck right off as far as I&#39;m concerned. Organic discussion is cool, but frankly the astroturfing I see on almost every pro/anti-trump thread is ridiculous.

<p>Diversions include flat Earth, Alex Jones acting crazy, Joe Rogan acting interested but not convinced or anything but mellow and docile acceptance, before changing subjects, attention to source, reaction, overboard rage and vicious speech, helplessness to point of passive and tacit approval, posts same pic or headline sans content - old trick of bait and switch. Vigilant thinking overcomes all... until censorship comes from the site itself. Already have seen this too. Some take prodding, others get angry and start crusading, so it&#39;s already maxed out, and backfired enough the law of diminishing returns is on the side of truth. Truth is complicated, and there should be perfectly valid reasons for some confidence in certain matters, but this shit has gotten out of hand. It will look so ridiculous in a few years, anyone buying it then will be ashamed of their judgment. That ship has sailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as an outside observer, this place has gotten absolutely taken over by T_D posters and supporters; I used to come here to hear about how wind gusts are the farts of invisible aliens, but now it&#39;s basically just sucking off Daddy Trump and screeching about how Hillary is evil and going to destroy the country, even though she fucking lost.</p>

<p>This is 100% true, and easily witnessed by just casually browsing this sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting that Trump detractors are almost systematically targeted here when they&#39;re outspoken about Trump. John McCain was a recent example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said this before and I&#39;ll say it again here. You can&#39;t post anything negative about trump without getting your inbox blasted by his supporters telling you you&#39;ve fallen for propaganda. As if they haven&#39;t. 
Also ever notice how the mods always sticky a thread that&#39;s completely off topic every time trump steps in it or some new &quot;evidence&quot; of Russian involvement comes to light? The mods are in on it too. 
For the record I dislike Hillary too. I don&#39;t think many (if any) people in the government currently really have the common people&#39;s interest at heart. 
But I doubt the Trump supporters have made it this far and are already sending me messages calling me a cuck or whatever. </p>

<p>My personal conspiracy is that any conspiracies that paint Trump in a bad light are immedietly downvoted, and any conspiracies leading discussion away from him and his administration are immediately upvoted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First you&#39;re mixing up two very distinctly different types of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.   One type is promoted by the independent media, the other promoted by the main stream media.  If you&#39;ve spent any time following conspiracy theories, you&#39;d understand that anything promoted by the main stream media is typically met with more skepticism than anything from the independent media.</p>

<p>The reasoning behind this is simple and obvious again if you&#39;ve spent any time following conspiracy theories.  The main stream media is controlled by the establishment, the globalists, the corporations that control each industry, aka TPTB(the powers that be).  If you follow conspiracies regularly, anyone who suddenly parrots the main stream media&#39;s narrative on any topic seems like a shill. </p>

<p>Now Im no Trump supporter, but I&#39;ve yet to succumb to the main stream media&#39;s anti Trump hysteria either.  I do have a memory however and his entire campaign was largely centered around being anti establishment, attacking the main stream media, and fighting against the globalists who do not want a strong Nationalist leading themost powerful country in the world.</p>

<p>Knowing these things it&#39;s very easy to understand why this sub can appear &quot;pro Trump&quot;, even if all it really is is the same it&#39;s ever been which is &quot;anti globalists/nwo&quot;.  It&#39;s the sudden influx of &quot;anti Trumpers&quot; trying to parrot the main stream media&#39;s narratives on issues surrounding him that should worry the long timers around here.</p>
