<p>Most ancient legends have 2 things in common, a giant flood and a northern race of giants. In the late 1890s and 1930s hundreds of ancient giant skeletons were found throughout New England and parts of the South East, in North America.</p>

<p>12,000 years ago the earth flooded when hit by a solar flare of such magnitude that it may have short circuited some ancient pyramids. Ancient humans lived underground out of fear for years. Many of our churches are built at entrances that hid these dwellings. When you have evidence of 8 foot ancient peoples, it is the height of greed to hide it. This of course all happened during the great credit and currency privatisation of 1913, back when it was called thievery instead of neoliberalism.</p>

<h2>Abraham Lincoln&#39;s Meditation On The Ancient Giant Race</h2>

<p>This video is a stonemason&#39;s research on ancient stone mounds and gets good at the 40:00 mark. The egg shaped stone is the 3rd hardest stone to drill into and requires a modern concrete drill bit. Ancient giants knew metallurgy and were magical stone masons. The heights of these ancient giant skeletons runs 7 to 10 feet. Legends put them slightly larger. Do you want to know what Abraham Lincoln said about them? We are mis-under-informed.</p>

<h2>The Mega Solar Flare Of 12,800 Years Ago And The Great Flood</h2>

<p>This next podcast is a geologist&#39;s opinion about the major solar flare event 12,800 years ago that very quickly melted down enough ice to flood the planet. He says the solar event caused many quakes and volcanos to go off. Maps tell us the giant race were excellent navigators. Most of them died off in villages 400 feet below current sea levels. Thus the second phase of sea rise will sink our civilization, and if any mountain fortress survivors remain I hope they remember us.</p>

<h2>Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings: Evidence of Advanced Civilization in the Ice Age </h2>

<p>Charles Hapgood’s classic 1966 book on ancient maps is back in print after 20 years. Hapgood produces concrete evidence of an advanced worldwide civilization existing many thousands of years before ancient Egypt. He has found the evidence in many beautiful maps long known to scholars, the Piri Reis Map that shows Antarctica, the Hadji Ahmed map, the Oronteus Finaeus and other amazing maps. Hapgood concluded that these maps were made from more ancient maps from the various ancient archives around the world, now lost. Hapgood also concluded that the ancient mapmakers were in some ways much more advanced scientifically than Europe in the 16th century, or than the ancient civilizations of Greece, Egypt, and Babylonian. Not only were these unknown people more advanced in mapmaking than any people prior to the 18th century, it appears they mapped all the continents. The Americas were mapped thousands of years before Columbus. Antarctica was mapped when its coasts were free of ice. There is evidence that these people must have lived when the ice age had not yet ended in the Northern Hemisphere and when Alaska was still connected with Siberia by the Pleistocene, ice age “land bridge.”</p>

<h2>Bonus Crazy, 6 Dots And 2 Lines, The Shakespeare Equation</h2>

<p>Did you know that you can find all of history&#39;s holiest numbers hidden in plain sight by measuring 6 dots and 2 lines hidden on the cover of a 400 year old book? The book was printed before many of these numbers were rediscovered in modern times. The ending will blow your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of this cable TV alt-history -  from Ancient Aliens, America Unearthed et al originates from long debunked Victorian hoaxes. A lot of this current resurrecting of old hoaxes seems to be motivated by proving that Europeans made it to America before the Asians did(becoming NA&#39;s), or that at least everything civilized about NA culture was gleaned from contact w Europeans. That people are so drawn to these &quot;possibilities&quot; just shows how far backward American culture and education has gone.</p>

<p>My favorite one is how (even though Native Americans did mine copper) the ancient abandoned copper mines in the northern US and Canada were mined by Minoans.</p>

<p>Another hilarious one is from the nut Scott Wolter(America Unearthed) who found the ruins of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_house">spring-house</a> in the woods and claimed it was a masonic ritual space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. First, the whole thing largely has to with the fact that books were laid out from very early on based on known ratios, for instance the square root of 2. So that makes other related ratios more likely to be found. (and those ratio have been known long before names were put to them.) Second, there is the reverse engineering, to take various measures and arrange them until you find something close enough to a known constant. These figures are all relatively small and not too hard to arrive at with enough lines and minor fudging. Lastly typesetters hand crafted covers, so the creator may have further used some measures to make things symmetric and look good thus leading to other embedded ratios. </p>

<p>Taken all together, at best maybe there was a &quot;coinkidink&quot; with the placement of one period, that just happened in to fall into the right place to produce a common ratio (albeit imprecisely), but nothing more.</p>

Is it scary knowing that tens of thousands of anthropologists walk the street, obsessed with studying bones, specificaly the Holy Grail of all bones, hominids...but they are all too stupid to take notice of 8000 giant skeletons at the Smithsonian the past 100years?

    <div class="md"><p>Still wouldn&#39;t cover all the land. I live on an island in the Pacific and the mountains here are over 2000&#39;. No where near any water level rise. And a 2 mile tidal wave would be insane and unheard of. The largest ever known is just over a third of a mile.  And that was a landslide in an inlet, forcing the water upward.</p>

<p>As for the skeletons. &quot;Several&quot; extra tall ones are all I can find an actual source on. These can easily be accounted for be chance. There are several prehistoric all hominids of large stature. These skeletons could be fossils. 2 12&#39; skeletons are revered by the Tibetans but there is no good science on those only anecdotal evidence.  </p>

<p>It is a myth. Allegory. A metaphorical tale. Most of it is violent and horrid and really not the best book to solely rule your life on.  Over the years it has been altered and changed by those that with to manipulate and control.</p>

<p>The last group was the free masons and the new and old testament as we know it since the 1300&#39;s is their work. </p>

by Richard J. Dewhurst</a></p>

<p>A study of the substantial evidence for a former race of giants in North America and its 150-year suppression by the Smithsonian Institution </p>

<p>• Shows how thousands of giant skeletons have been found, particularly in the Mississippi Valley, as well as the ruins of the giants’ cities </p>

<p>• Explores 400 years of giant finds, including newspaper articles, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports </p>

<p>• Reveals the Stonehenge-era megalithic burial complex on Catalina Island with over 4,000 giant skeletons, including kings more than 9 feet tall </p>

<p>• Includes more than 100 rare photographs and illustrations of the lost evidence </p>

<p>Drawing on 400 years of newspaper articles and photos, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports, Richard J. Dewhurst reveals not only that North America was once ruled by an advanced race of giants but also that the Smithsonian has been actively suppressing the physical evidence for nearly 150 years. He shows how thousands of giant skeletons have been unearthed at Mound Builder sites across the continent, only to disappear from the historical record. He examines other concealed giant discoveries, such as the giant mummies found in Spirit Cave, Nevada, wrapped in fine textiles and dating to 8000 BCE; the hundreds of red-haired bog mummies found at sinkhole “cenotes” on the west coast of Florida and dating to 7500 BCE; and the ruins of the giants’ cities with populations in excess of 100,000 in Arizona, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Louisiana. </p>

<p>Dewhurst shows how this suppression began shortly after the Civil War and transformed into an outright cover-up in 1879 when Major John Wesley Powell was appointed Smithsonian director, launching a strict pro-evolution, pro-Manifest Destiny agenda. He also reveals the 1920s’ discovery on Catalina Island of a megalithic burial complex with 6,000 years of continuous burials and over 4,000 skeletons, including a succession of kings and queens, some more than 9 feet tall--the evidence for which is hidden in the restricted-access evidence rooms at the Smithsonian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Advanced ancient societies doesn&#39;t fit with the theory of evolution that says mankind evolved from primitive origins. The conditions of Earth, pre &quot;Noah&#39;s flood&quot;, was one of ADVANCED GLOBAL WAR with advanced weapons like atomic bombs. The first truly great world war that was spreading to potentially wipe out all life on Earth. The human race was preserved through one family. Here&#39;s the account of this great global war, Genesis 6:</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the FACE OF THE EARTH, and daughters were born to them, 2 </p>

<p>5 Then the Lord saw that the WICKEDNESS of man was GREAT IN THE EARTH, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. </p>

<p>11 The earth also was CORRUPT before God, and the EARTH was FILLED with VIOLENCE. 12 So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for ALL FLESH had corrupted their way on the earth.
13 And God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence THROUGH THEM;. (God plainly saw where mankind was headed, total annihilation through their warfare) and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Graham Hancock used to be a proponent of Earth Crust Displacement but he is now firmly behind the Comet Strike Theory. </p>

<p>Also, something to consider about the climate change. One of the many impacts could have caused the Earth&#39;s axis to shift. </p>
