        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Put aside your feelings for Trump for ONE second and just consider the evidence in this theory. You want TRUTH, it starts by considering evidence. You call yourself a conspiracy theorist, then stop looking through political goggles and start searching for the TRUTH. This is the ONE conspiracy theory that gets downvoted into oblivion around these parts. No one is able to explain why since it&#39;s a viable and important theory. I know there&#39;s Trump fans around, but even then certain anti-Trump theories are allowed, but for some reason NOT THIS ONE. My guess, Russian Trolls want this one off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy theory that NEEDS more attention and is well researched and backed up. The allegations are mind blowing, and when viewing this whole Trump-Russia fiasco through the eyes of these theories it makes things a lot more clear. Anyone who has been following the Trump-Russia scandal and thinks MSM or Intelligence Community doesn&#39;t have any real dirt or connections needs to read what Louise Mencsh is digging up. Firstly some background on the Author, Louise Mensch:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Former British MP</p></li>
<li><p>She works as an independent journalist for FOX News parent company News. Corp.</p></li>
<li><p>She is credited for breaking stories such as the FISA warrant on Trump Tower&#39;s server which is connected to Russian banks, BEFORE MSM even had a sniff of it here: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/louise-mensch-trump-russia-ties-media-scoop">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/louise-mensch-trump-russia-ties-media-scoop</a></p></li>
<li><p>She also broke a story a couple weeks ago about Trump&#39;s plane and a Russian Oligarch&#39;s plane landing in the same airport and possibly having a secret meeting during the election that is ONLY now being reported by Rachel Maddow TONIGHT. Maddow&#39;s report confirming Mensch&#39;s own reporting is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfeSitSbRA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfeSitSbRA</a> Proof that Mensch knew about it before Maddow is here: <a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/830903681927303168">https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/830903681927303168</a></p></li>
<li><p>She also wrote a story last week about Jeff Session&#39;s connections to Russia BEFORE the knowledge of his meetings became public. You can read her breakdown of Session&#39;s Russian connections here DATED FEB 7: <a href="https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/">https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/</a></p></li>
<li><p>She has been quoted saying “I’ve never been sued because I’ve never been wrong,” in the aforementioned Guardian article.
In short, she comes off as a conspiracy nut but her theories are being proven more and more true as MSM catches up with her and corroborates her claims.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now on to the Carolina Conspiracy. You can read about it here and come to your own conclusions: <a href="https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/the-carolina-conspiracy-putin-catfished-weiner-louise-mensch/">https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/the-carolina-conspiracy-putin-catfished-weiner-louise-mensch/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s my best attempt at summarizing her findings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overall theory: Russia working with Trump PLANTED Huma Abedin&#39;s now famous October Surprise emails on Anthony Weiner&#39;s computer so that the FBI could find it. They then forced Comey&#39;s hand to report it hurting HRC&#39;s chances in the election. In order to do this, they hacked Anthony Weiner&#39;s computer, then had Russian hackers SEXT with him on a confirmed hacked program, they then revealed through Putin related journos at the DailyMail that the girl was 15 to FORCE the FBI to have to investigate his laptop, therefore finding the Huma Abedin emails. </p></li>
<li><p>Russia has operatives within the NY FBI Field office and the NYPD (through Rudy Giuliani and General Flynn). 9/11 Mayor Rudy has known history of NYPD and corruption, see here: <a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/rudy-giuliani-legacy-racism-corruption/">https://www.liberationnews.org/rudy-giuliani-legacy-racism-corruption/</a>
He&#39;s also publically boasted about his FBI ties here: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-hints-at-ties-to-the-fbi.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-hints-at-ties-to-the-fbi.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>A Russian Hacker named Yvgeny Nikulin who has been confirmed to be indicted in the hacking of Dropbox, Linked-in and Formspring in 2012-2013 is involved in Trump&#39;s connections to Russia. Link: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring</a></p></li>
<li><p>Anthony Weiner used Formspring to sext with &quot;15 year old girl&quot; which made him vulnerable to Nikulin&#39;s hacking.
The &quot;15 year old girl&quot; story was posted by pro-Trump DailyMail&#39;s Alana Goodman which lead the FBI to investigate Weiner&#39;s laptop </p></li>
<li><p>Alana Goodman has been seen photographed @ Trump Tower partying with Russian State-Owned Media Sputnik reporter Cassandra Fairbanks. Fairbanks is known as a hacker fangirl and has also been photographed with Trump and the first lady. Source: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuvT9_CWcAAkp5e.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuvT9_CWcAAkp5e.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Weiner was not sexting with a 15 year old girl but actually being manipulated by Russian connected hacking group ‘Crackas With Attitude’ who have been caught previously hacking the head of the CIA, and a great many FBI agents, police officers, and other law enforcement officials. Read about Crackas with Attitude here: <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/fbi-arrests-two-alleged-members-of-group-that-hacked-the-cia-director">https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/fbi-arrests-two-alleged-members-of-group-that-hacked-the-cia-director</a></p></li>
<li><p>One of the Attorney General&#39;s charged with &quot;prosecuting&quot; Crackas with Attitude is Jeff Session&#39;s # 2 guy: Dana Boente. Hackers who coordinated the hack on Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop planted Hilary Clinton&#39;s emails on that laptop for James Comey to find and then was forced to reveal his findings publically as we all know during the election. </p></li>
<li><p>Russia needed to invent an underage victim &quot;the 15 year old girl&quot; in order for the FBI to look at Weiner&#39;s laptop in the first place. Before this, all of Weiner&#39;s storied sexual deviancy had been with older women.</p></li>
<li><p>Weiner has NOT been indicted yet (which is weird) and has stated publicly that he has emails which prove that this sexting fiasco is a hoax. Which is probably why he hasn&#39;t been indicted yet. Analysis of the &quot;15 year old girls&quot; emails to Weiner include admission that &quot;You Got Catfished by a Dude&quot; and also contains 4 passages plagiarized from books that a 15 year old girl from North Carolina probably hadn&#39;t read. These passages were from the books: Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace. Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk. Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters and Seymour an Introduction, both by J.D. Salinger. Tales of Ordinary Madness, “A Dollar and Twenty Cents” by Charles Bukowski. He was also supposed to have a hearing on Mar 7. This has since been postponed without reasons given. Probably because he was framed and it&#39;s for national security reasons: <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/federal-court-hearing-tuesday-march-7-clinton-email-case-judicial-watch-seeking-answers-abedinweiner-laptop-emails/">http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/federal-court-hearing-tuesday-march-7-clinton-email-case-judicial-watch-seeking-answers-abedinweiner-laptop-emails/</a></p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;15 year old girl&quot; and her father who is an attorney HAVE NOT been cooperating or working with law enforcement individuals since the sexting scandal came to light. And they have NOT filed a police report on the incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Lara Trump was in the hometown of the &quot;15 year old girl&quot; on October 21st and boasted about the Hilary Clinton email October Surprise even though she had no legal way of knowing they existed. She may have been instrumental in finding a &quot;15 year old girl&quot; to match with the story. </p></li>
