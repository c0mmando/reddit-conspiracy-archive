<p>1 of Crowdstrike&#39;s main investors is Obama&#39;s ex Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Who invested 100 million into Crowdstrike and has a less than stellar record. Not to mention Hillary campaign contributor.</p>

<p>This could be one of the contractors that have CIA hacking tools. Maybe a competitor to them leaked to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>If you were on trial for some kind of crime and they had you at a specifiic ip address also used by thousnads of other people, guess what?  Not guilty verdict.  </p>

<p>You misunderstand my point about mccain + friends, trump is in the same position... totally unable to comprehend the complexities of computer networking.  </p>

<p>OH, but these crowdstrike folks are going to give everybody the facts!  Forget that they&#39;re not part of the government and that their owner apparently has a deep seeded hate for russia... don&#39;t let that get in the way of the &quot; facts &quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;They could show putin on camera...&quot;<br/>
    If they could.  They can&#39;t though and that&#39;s the entire point here.  Nobody has seen conclusive evidence that putin directed the hacking, let alone the far flung, completely made up theory that it was to put Trump in the white house.  </p>

<p>That my friend, is a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have any evidence of a pizza pedo ring, yet you&#39;d think that was proven around here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me formulate your argument in a clear manner because you continue to refuse to.</p>

<p>x-agent is used as an indicator of attribution. 
x-agent is Russian state sponsored malware.
x-agent was found  in connection to the DNC and Podesta breaches.
Therefore the Russian government hacked the DNC and Podesta.</p>

<p>To support your premises you linked to the fireeye report.
This report analyzes the following software:</p>

<p>SOURFACE</p>

<p>CHOPSTICK</p>

<p>CORESHELL</p>

<p>OLDBAIT</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qnSuwPU.png">https://i.imgur.com/qnSuwPU.png</a></p>

<p>This report has nothing to do with x-agent, therefore it does not support your case.</p>

<p>You linked the welivesecurity report, where we find the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Performing attribution in a serious,
 scientific manner is a hard problem that is out of scope 
of ESET‚Äôs mission.
 As security researchers,
 what we call 
‚Äúthe Sednit group‚Äù is merely a set of software 
and the related network infrastructure,
 which we can hardly correlate with any 
specific
 organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0Cyvdvr.png">https://i.imgur.com/0Cyvdvr.png</a></p>

<p>It lists x-agent as a indicator of compromise:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zncK7D3.png">https://i.imgur.com/zncK7D3.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zgEAEyO.png">https://i.imgur.com/zgEAEyO.png</a></p>

<p>Your own words were </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And indicator of compromise is not necessarily evidence for attribution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we find that welivesecurity report does not support your position.</p>

<p>Crowdstrike report from June 2016 makes a lot of assertions but ultimately lists x-agent as an indicator of compromise:
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/In0mf5o.png">https://i.imgur.com/In0mf5o.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/</a></p>

<p>to quote you again</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And indicator of compromise is not necessarily evidence for attribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But let us actually see what is claimed about x-agent in these reports:</p>

<p>From Crowdstrike:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as:
rundll32.exe ‚ÄúC:\Windows\twain_64.dll‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait a second: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the researchers, the malicious XAgent app was written for iOS 7, but it is not optimized to hide its presence on iOS 8 devices, the second app MadCap doesn‚Äôt work on jailbroken devices.
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/r0uHtmg.png">https://i.imgur.com/r0uHtmg.png</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/apt28-cybercrime-or-state-sponsored-hacking/">http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/apt28-cybercrime-or-state-sponsored-hacking/</a></p>

<p>Fireeye does an analysis of x-agent and concludes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nalysis of XAgent
The XAgent app is fully functional malware. After being installed on iOS 7, the app‚Äôs icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately. When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can safely conclude that Crowdstrike did not identify x-agent the apt 28 malware, because what they describe does not fit the description from two different sources.</p>

<p>To conclude no evidence has been provided that x-agent is a russian state sponsored malware.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not false, you keep trying to dismiss evidence but all you&#39;re doing is proving again and again you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. This really is an endless argument. And anything I post you either dismiss based on poorly drawn conclusion like the Russian language connection (which you&#39;re doing again, smh) or you&#39;d misrepresent it like you did in the North Korea thread in this post (only quoting the malware without a code connection, but not quoting what was listed as a connection in &quot;other notes&quot; or the many more pieces with a connection).</p>

<p>You could very easily find that yourself, but you won&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t fit your beliefs. It seems like you&#39;re just trying to get me to waste my time. </p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re completely ignorant on this subject so you claiming that doesn&#39;t really hold any water. You don&#39;t know enough to even make a good argument as shown over and over again, it may sound good to you but to anyone who does this kind of thing for a living it sounds extremely uninformed. If you don&#39;t believe me go to <a href="/r/netsec">/r/netsec</a> and post all of this. </p>
