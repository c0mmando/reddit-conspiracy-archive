    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Occult simply means hidden. So one of the ways they control people is by hiding in plain sight. Using symbols to communicate (marketing to subvert you conscious thought processes, secret symbols let each other know who is in the &quot;club&quot;)</p>

<p>Also, Satan is real and he hates humanity and loves despots. And many of these people are outright Satan worshipers. Pedophilia, ritual murders, etc.</p>

<p>But the primary means of control is just lying to people constantly about what is really going on. Create &quot;news&quot; that is nothing but lies. Cover up real history. Teach people to value framing over substance (pay attention to the handsome man in the nice suit with the nice hair who makes you feel safe).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t predict excatly what the NWO goal is, but it always seems to include a one-world government, a cashless society, depopulation, etc etc you know what I mean. Another bullet point on that list that&#39;s often overlooked is the breakdown of current religion and the debut of a one-world religion, but the only way that could ever be possible is if there&#39;s a big revlation about us misinterprutting current religion with an archelogical discovery or alien contact, either of which reveals some grand new truth. It&#39;s all gonna be a lie, of course, but it&#39;ll make people think we&#39;ve gone through a religious/spiritual revolution but really it&#39;s another step of making uss less peaceful, less informed and less powerful. Instead of a pleasent role-model like Jesus, for instance, they&#39;d rather have a wolf in sheeps clothing like Baal or Amun-Rah or any sort of Antichrist. Already we&#39;ve seen the top of the pyramid take steps to make people more athiest, could be a prerequisite to all this. </p>

<p>This is the only one I&#39;m not sure about. It seems like they want to destroy nation states, and rule through an extra-state system that is not actually a nation. And they&#39;ve mostly succeeded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way I have been able to cope with a why is this; essentially at the start of mankind/religion the relationship with God was a very literal and everyday thing, where as rituals, curses, spells, prayers, basically anything trying to invoke or control the forces of the universe is something that has persisted in belief and most importantly, practice. Why? If the Creator/God/Whatever has built in operations that can be triggered through created events, in essence, kind of like hacking the system with programs/designs built by the system itself. </p>

<p>Could be nothing like that, but to me that&#39;s why a modern cultist with a high &#39;station&#39; in life would do any of this, for &#39;power&#39;, &#39;control&#39;, and to syphon all the energy off those who falsely worship you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to believe while they may not control the world, it is a huge part of our world. I personally believe it is a huge part of pizzagate. And it is the part they want talked about the least. Bohemian grove was a big eye opener. It could be that these religions were hidden from the public in the past. And that they feel some sort of superiority for following these older almost forgotten religions. These are just my speculations but that&#39;s why we are here discussing right?</p>

<p>The question is whether there is real power behind it or not. It could just be used as a control mechanism for the puppet masters to control our world leaders. Kind of like a promise of ultimate power only to find out it is a lie to keep other humans in line. I think there is power within all humans and religion is used to bring it out and also to stifle it at the same time. They use our natural talents of the soul and lead us astray from the true meaning. For example when people experience being in the astral world, they try to explain it as heaven and full of angels. Which is close but in my opinion &quot;heaven&quot; is our spirit world that we all go to and hell doesn&#39;t exist. Some of these beliefs I have are from reading &quot;Journey of Souls :A Study of Life Between Lives by Michael Newton&quot;. </p>

<p>But I have experienced astral projection myself and I know it exists. I&#39;ve had dreams of the future that come true but the dreams were about the most insignificant things at times. For example I dreamed of a scene during an anime and remembered it years later. I know it is a premonition type of dream because of how vivid it is and how strong the feeling of deja vu is. And other times I dreamed of more recent and important things. Another example would be I dreamed of my ex, my daughters mother screaming in pain and asking a question &quot;Why? Why are you doing this? Why me?&quot; And etcetera. </p>

<p>My personal theory behind the whole future dreams/deja vu experiences is that our soul is downloading information about the life we chose to incarnate as. Of course we block that information but sometimes a little will leak out. Whether that sneak peek is supposed to be confirmation of being on the correct timeline or simply the souls subconscious desire to inform the conscious mind of its desires I haven&#39;t decided upon yet. I really need to refine the theory to be truthful.</p>
