<p>But most Americans seem happy with it because they&#39;re scared of the word socialism and have the attitude &quot;why should we have to pay for someone else who is sick?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Checking in from Chile. The CIA-backed coup of 1973 established private healthcare here, which is still on force to this day. A decent family health insurance costs roughly one median wage. And you still have to pay for stuff if something happens to you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically health for the wealthy. They are literally the only social group who can afford good healthcare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just googled the median Chilean income. Roughly 28,257,709 CLP.</p>

<p>Which is equal to $42682.70 USD.</p>

<p>Are you saying that family health insurance costs that much per year? Or have i made a mistake in my maths?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The median wage in Chile is roughly USD 600 per month! The average wage is around USD 1,400 per month, as Chile is the most unequal country on Earth.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t afford insurance, you have to use the public healthcare system, which I&#39;ve read and heard is extremely grim. &quot;Women have been known to give birth in toilets because they can&#39;t wait anymore&quot;-level of grimness. And, obviously, waiting lists that go for years and years. </p>

<p>And I think you still have to pay for stuff.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re poor or middle class and, for example, you suffer a stroke, you and your family may have to declare bankrupcy. Simple as that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like paying for the gas of someone who drives a gas guzzling truck who uses it for commuting - there will always be people that use more than they contribute and do so with no regard to the costs shouldered by their neighbors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna propose a pretty controversial topic, but I say once anyone hits the &quot;Obese&quot; part of the BMI chart, instant lap-band or gastric bypass... Against their will if need be. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that right now obese people are a large part of the cost of health care. <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/economic/">link</a> This way, after the surgery, we aren&#39;t paying for Chubby McTubberson to wolf down Big Macs and go to the hospital when their diabetes flares up. If that doesn&#39;t work then we put them in exercise jail or something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to pay for each other&#39;s gas if everyone drives hybrids because when money gets tight we can rely on each other to help us fuel up. But yeah, Mr. Hummer H2 can downsize, and would probably be better off for it anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna propose a relatively uncontroversial topic:</p>

<p>Focus on  1- Mental healthcare  2- Poverty  3- Education, first.</p>

<p>Happy sane intelligent people with a decent income mostly don&#39;t want to be fat, and will try not to be. Mental wellbeing can affect eating habits in a negative way. Being poor incentivizes bad eating. And many people are very ignorant when it comes to food and exercise. If they were better informed, this might help the problem. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just the fat guy who&#39;s driving up your health costs. It&#39;s the system itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s more about education, having graphic commercials about the consequences of being overweight and the illnesses it can cause (works for smoking) and put a tax on fast food/junk food and use it to subsidise healthy food.</p>

<p>Here in Aus, a pack of smokes is $30. I nearly fell over when I was in america a few years ago and saw packs of cigarettes for like $3.50 in the south. Our govt tax the shit outta them. </p>

<p>If you did that to fast food/junk food and lowered the price of good healthy produce it would make people change habits.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m guessing the people and corporations behind fast food are pretty powerful and that is an unlikely scenario.</p>

<p>Yeah, the US Propaganda Machine has done a fantastic job of making the word &quot;Socialism&quot; and all related concepts to be the dirtiest thing imaginable, and Completely Unamerican to the average citizen. Right behind &quot;communism.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many here grew up in the 80s like me, but I&#39;m pretty sure I heard the word &quot;commie&quot; thrown around as an insult about a dozen-dozen times, before i even knew what the word meant. </p>

<p>And y&#39;know... if this country were still living like we were in the 1950s... where an average guy could get a decent job and support and entire family on his own, all without having gone to college, I might agree that &quot;The American Way&quot; is superior to &quot;dirty communism.&quot; </p>

<p>But you know what? Someone came along, and grabbed &quot;The American Dream,&quot; and tied its hands behind its back, and held its head under a toilet bowl, while inviting all their friends to <strong>fucking GANG-RAPE it</strong> while it drowned to death.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s responsible?</p>

<p>Well, who benefitted? Who&#39;s got the money and power today? Those are the people who sold out The American Dream for quick profits, and fucked us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to say this. I work in the healthcare industry (3 doctors in my family). We definitely have some flaws, but to just say our healthcare is terrible across the board is ignorant. People from all over the world (including countries with socialized medicine) come to see our heart, brain specialists etc. So sick of people simplifying these issues to continue a lazy narrative. US healthcare is complicated, that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to fix. I personally blame the money grubbing insurance companies...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t aware that I was saying healthcare in the US was horrible across the board.</p>

<p>Overall we do have worse outcomes for more money.  On average.  But so far the only long-lasting things that have been done to &quot;improve&quot; our healthcare are to not require a woman to see her doctor just because she has a yeast infection.  And to not require a prescription for things like nicotine patches, and the like.  But we probably only did that because someone stood to make a profit.</p>

<p>I agree that the healthcare industry in the US has been ruined by the insurance companies.  And the industry isn&#39;t too hard to fix, there&#39;s just no will to have it done by the people who can do something about it.</p>

<p>I think they were kind of hard to enforce anyway.  And I&#39;m going to guess that weren&#39;t always ignored...  It&#39;s nice to know they&#39;ve largely been repealed though!  </p>

<p>My insurance covers 80%, so I&#39;m still on the hook for ~$1,200.  Now we all know my insurance company is paying nowhere near $3,600 because of &quot;discounts&quot;.  So for my wife and two kids I pay $700 a month with $1,500 deductible for each and 20% co insurance...if everyone meets their deductibles we are spending around 12k before insurance really kicks in anything.</p>

<p>Now, I have to remind myself from time to time that my insurance company has spent way more on me than I have for them (son has cochlear implants after three pairs of hearing aids, wife had cancer last year, my daughter spent 10 days in the nicu after birth with a helicopter flight to the nearest children&#39;s hospital) but those bills are terribly inflated too.  They sent me the bill for the helicopter flight...50k... 10 days in the nicu?  280k.   Cochlear implant surgery?  75k...  never saw any of the bills for the wife&#39;s cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason the prices are that high in the first place, is insurance company financial voodoo. I read a great article that explained all this a while back. They charge way more than it&#39;s really worth, because insurance companies have the power to negotiate the bill down. You do not. So they will charge you $700 for something that may literally cost them $1, because they expect the insurance company to haggle. Just like when you try to sell something on craigslist, or whatever. Except these pricks are playing with peoples lives and wellbeing. </p>

<p>And of course you and I have zero power to negotiate, like the insurance company does. So if you don&#39;t have insurance, or your insurance will only cover so much, you&#39;re basically fucked. </p>

<p>This whole system needs  to be torn to the ground and rebuilt from the bottom up. The level of corruption, chicanery, and horseshit is too high to ever really fix, I fear, without a complete change... </p>

<p>I want to make sure we are defining our terms the same way so that I know that we on the same page as we communicate.  When you say that &quot;corporations are people&quot; do you mean that corporations are made up of people whom each own their lives and private property and then choose to contractually relate to each other in certain ways so that profits and be made and distributed within those contractual terms?  Or do you mean something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What!? No, the reason why people work is because they value money more than their free time and the reason the employer hires workers is because they value the workers time more than they value the money. Both parties get something more valuable (for them, as value is completely subjective) in exchange for something less valuable (again, for them). Thus both parties profit from the employer/employee relationship.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But profit as stated by the IRS is cost minus expenses.  Yes you are correct in your statements that each person makes the decision based on what is good for them, but in reality they are exchanging something of equal value.  The employer values the employee&#39;s time as X rate and the employee values their time at less than X so they agree to exchange.  This is similar to a barter and is technically a fair price for the goods and thus a even exchange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, wages are not immoral. They are typically voluntary and I am all for that, I believe we have a different definition for profit.  I view profit as revenue minus expenses.  Which is how a corporation pays taxes.  A human on the other hand is taxes for all his revenue/wages.  </p>

<p>So a person whom receives wages, is his revenue.  He must feed and shelter himself, he or she also must remain relatively healthy and sane enough to continue to work for wages.  All of these costs would be subtracted from his revenue and thus equal his profit.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, since we have corporate personhood.  We should have humancorporatehood.  Where a human can take all the tax advantages allowed to corporations.  But I digress as we are far off the original topic. </p>

<p>This may have been true once upon a time, but I don&#39;t think it is any longer. That only works when those who own the means of production share some of those profits among the workers, in the form of higher wages. Wages have not kept up with inflation for a very long time now. Workers <em>are</em> being exploited. </p>

<p>As an aside here:  Many, if not <em>most</em> people value their time far more than what they&#39;re actually being paid for it, and only accept the pay they do, because they haven&#39;t found anyone willing to pay them <em>more</em>. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not like this is a perfectly fair arrangement, and most people participating are content with the deal. The company hiring is usually getting a much better deal than the person being hired. If they weren&#39;t, then the company would be making less profits. </p>

<p>So most people are paid less than their time is actually worth. Yay for economic coercion! </p>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. If they valued their time more than the money they get paid then they wouldn&#39;t work. It is as simple as that. But of course they want to be paid <em>more</em>, everyone does.</p>

<p>This. But in reality, it&#39;s much worse than that for many. Especially those working for minimum wage. I&#39;m sorry, but with the current value of the dollar, in this economy, just about any person&#39;s time / labor should be worth more than a measly $7-8 per hour. That&#39;s practically legalized wage slavery. </p>

<p>People making a <em>real living wage</em> are the ones trading their time for what it&#39;s worth. Everyone else is getting <em>ripped off</em>. Cheated. </p>

    <div class="md"><h1>If it looks like capitalism and it behaves like capitalism, it&#39;s capitalism.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism is a means of free trade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free Trade is a means of free trade, and it can exist under any economic model if it&#39;s allowed.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">&quot;Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit&quot;</a>, and the mixed economy is a form of capitalism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Restricting that trade to the point where it&#39;s only in the hands of a few is certainly not capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trade isn&#39;t restricted &quot;to the few&quot; though. You participate in it all the time, and if you have capital you can engage in it too. It&#39;s not a closed system, though you&#39;d be hard pressed to actually get to a point where you have any say in the means of production.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And switching economic systems won&#39;t stop the government from being corrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corruption, as it currently exists, is generally a means to increase your own wealth, right? If anything shady is going on the mantra is <em>follow the money</em>.</p>

<p>So what happens if there&#39;s no money, and production is controlled collectively? I don&#39;t think I have to spell it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just see Uncle Joe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stalin was <em>authoritarian</em>. It&#39;s not restricted to Communism. He used his position <em>at the head of a strong, centralised, government</em> for his personal gain and was by most accounts ruthless in supporting the mechanism that allowed him to exist in that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling it late stage capitalism is just a red herring for the bigger problem of having a corrupt government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling it late stage capitalism is calling a duck a duck, assuming you subscribe to the duck-naming economic theories. All of the negatives are symptomatic of a capitalist society, regardless of how socialised it is, and can&#39;t be solved by legislation or governance, as the mechanisms of capitalism are already so firmly entrenched and, to badly quote Mr Lenin, &quot;there are no hopeless situations for capitalism&quot;.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just say that &quot;capitalism isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the way in which it&#39;s being used!&quot; any more than you can say that &quot;releasing carbon into the atmosphere isn&#39;t causing climate change, it&#39;s the way in which it&#39;s being released!&quot;. Capitalism is enabling all of these shitty things, and using it in a different way or dismissing it as &quot;not <em>real</em> capitalism&quot; won&#39;t changed the fact that it&#39;s real and it&#39;s fucking over millions of people all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the quote you&#39;re debating against isn&#39;t really from this poster, it&#39;s from a nobel prize winning economist. and it is true, that throughout history the only proven way of improving the situation of everyone has been capitalism </p>

<p>there is room for profit in healthcare, as it drives better service, innovation, etc - but the system we have now is a government enforced oligopoly by multiple ways. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>stuff like this shows how little of economics a lot of people understand. without the huge government barriers, if your insurance company is providing a shitty service at $100/mo, and I realize I can provide equal or better service for cheaper, i will do it and take all your customers. when you get companies competing against each other, that&#39;s how the average person wins. when you have the BS we have now, you get the healthcare sector being the strongest in the S&amp;P500 starting when obama took office</p>

<p>You got me here. My comment was snarky and did rely on a false dichotomy. Allow me to step back from it a bit and say that there is a proper balance that needs to be struck between socialism and capitalism, but that in my opinion the balance should lean more toward free-market capitalism.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re arguing that healthcare should be a for-profit business when the post is clearly about &quot;when it was better&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it&#39;s the &quot;when it was better&quot; part I would disagree with. You&#39;d have to define what you mean by &quot;better&quot;. When people rail against &quot;profits&quot; they typically reveal a lack of basic understanding about risk/reward and how it relates to innovation and economic growth. More often than not, it reveals an underlying adherence to Marxism.</p>

<p>I think your belief is bullshit.  What risk is being rewarded?  Capitalism as it&#39;s currently practiced in this country - and been exported to the entire effing world - depends upon &quot;risk&quot; entirely borne by the government (in other words, taxpayers) and rewards entirely going to the so-called risk-takers.</p>

<p>You think any corporation expands anywhere these days without some guarantee of profit before the first architect gets a paper cut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because those markets are single payer, their governments are able to negotiate prices down below true market value because of the lack of competition. Any profit that eliminates for the drug company offering the drug there now needs to be made up for elsewhere, and that elsewhere is the U.S.</p>

<p>Of course, we&#39;re rich as fuck and don&#39;t have single payer, so the the prices can be set much higher without stifling demand. With those high prices, medical product companies are still able to earn a profit, although much less than if less countries had single payer. If those profits were to vanish—or worse, become losses—that would dry up all new investments in private medical innovation and capital would seek other industries like software or real estate in search of a return.</p>

<p>Of course you&#39;ll probably say good riddance because nobody should profit from the health care industry. But I would ask yourself why health care is any more fundamental to our happiness and well being than food, energy, information access, clothing, housing, etc., all of which yield profits for investors. </p>

<p>If you believe all profit is bad, well, then I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re unlikely to learn much from each other in this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, slot of mental loop holes you have to jump through to come to some of the conclusions you&#39;ve implied.</p>

<p>let&#39;s just take information access as an example. An industry that has taken billions in public funds from state, city and federal governments contracts to ensure its citizens have access to broad band and then abandoned those plans, conspires with competition to drive up prices while driving down quality and provided legendarily terrible customer service all mingled with fraudulent charges.</p>

<p>Do you want to do the energy sector with its billions in subsidies provided by public tax dollars?</p>

<p>Perhaps you want to do housing which has brought the US to an all time low of house ownership and economic decimation while chasing profit?</p>

<p>It seem perhaps your argument is clearly disingenuous or grossly ignorant of the problem and avoidance by the industry.</p>

<p>It seems that you feel like the private profits are great for the health industry despite all of the problems it causes ( unnecessarily dangerous drugs in the market, insurance companies dropping customers who get sick, refusing to cover people who are sick) but when someone collectively bargain for prices suddenly it&#39;s unfair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Canadian, I feel the need to correct your statement a little bit.</p>

<p>Yes, you are technically correct that just about everyone has secondary &quot;private&quot; health insurance. This is generally done through peoples employers and a deduction is taken off that vast majority of peoples paycheques for it. As for me, my company pays the insurance fee for me, so I&#39;m one of the lucky few that don&#39;t have to pay for my own private insurance.</p>

<p>However, the private insurance generally covers the 3 things that the government plan doesn&#39;t. Namely, Dental, Vision and Prescription drugs. They also handle things like short term disability, long term disability, medical devices, etc. etc. that a person outside of a hospital in Canada is not covered for.</p>

<p>However, anything, literally ANYTHING medical in nature given in a hospital is &quot;free&quot; (free being in quotes because we pay for it through taxes). Most people hear about wait times. Yes, this is true, because there are a lot of people who need their hips/knees/joints replaced and only so many operating rooms. If you can afford to wait, you wait. If you can&#39;t afford to wait, you&#39;re seen immediately.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to the ER exactly once. I had severe, debilitating pain in my back/left side. The triage nurse at the hospital took one look at me, and didn&#39;t even ask to see my health card before I was whisked away to the front of the line of ~30 other people in the ER. I was seen immediately by a doctor, had a diagnosis, a morphine drip, my own bed, and a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. Turns out it was a kidney stone. I walked out of the hospital with a prescription, so urine funnels, and an appointment with a urologist in 2 weeks. Total cost to me: $0.</p>

<p>I broke my wrist a few years back. The doctor that I saw didn&#39;t feel comfortable fixing it with the amount of damage there was. 1 week later I&#39;m seeing a specialist. 1 week after that I&#39;m in surgery having everything fixed. Antibiotics, pain killers, etc. 1 week after the surgery and my cast comes off, the health care team refers me to physiotherapy. 2 months of physio exercises, going in to see a therapist once a week to return full motion and flexibility to my primary wrist. Total cost to me: $0.</p>

<p>I have experienced the socialized medicine you people seem to be so scared of. We have some of the best care in the world, and, more importantly, EVERYONE has access to it. Sure, there are people who don&#39;t have family doctors that plug up ERs. Sure, there are wait times for non-life threatening problems. However, it can be flexible when it needs to.</p>

<p>Back to my kidney stone... I was travelling a lot for work at the time, and my stone was stuck between my kidney and bladder. I couldn&#39;t travel to the US where a majority of our clients were because the insurance called it a &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; and wouldn&#39;t cover me. After 6 weeks of &quot;wait-and-see&quot; I finally said to my urologist that this was affecting my job since I was grounded. I had surgery scheduled next week.</p>

<p>The Canadian health care system is not the boogey man your Republicans make it out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism works great in mangy cases but the reason it is wrong to apply to healthcare cones down to supply and demand. Supply and demand for a product the consumer chooses to buy works well at maintaining fair prices but healthcare demand by the consumer is not a choice. When you are sick you need healthcare which inevitably everyone needs at some point. Thus the endless demand for it. By allowing profits on this you end up with rising costs that the consumer had no choice but to accept and had no leverage to drive the price down. Take for instance out ever rising drug prices. The pharma companies can charge whatever they want for a life saving drug because the demand is always there. If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a dick move to charge someone a huge amount for a pill or they die than I don&#39;t know what is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans pay way too much for mediocre healthcare, which most Americans are not satisfied with. When I see healthcare companies dropping coverage for someone because their needs are too expensive, and the company just gets to revert to the old standby: &quot;Sorry, we have to think of our shareholders&quot;, you get a sense of how this system isn&#39;t about making our healthcare system high quality for the American people, but making money for investors &amp; shareholders. For something as basic &amp; fundamental as healthcare in a modern society, it seems like a detriment to that society to make the first focus be all about the capital that can be generated for investors. I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with it if we were the best healthcare on the planet with a high rate of satisfaction.. But we are most definitely NOT.</p>

<p>This is our healthcare system in America. But don&#39;t worry, complaints like mine &amp; a million other people don&#39;t mean shit, because these companies spend a lot of money lobbying, and that means they won&#39;t have anything to worry about &amp; business &amp; profits will remain good for them.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re either being purposefully disingenuous, or your logical faculties are so out of order it&#39;s amazing. Trading labor for wages is not the same thing as profit from a business. In one, you&#39;re using the only capital a poor worker has -- their body and time, to expend work to earn a small reward. </p>

<p>In business you use your capital, (combined with the economic coercion inherent in the capitalist system) to convince many poor workers to expend <em>their</em> energey, to run <em>your</em> business, so you can make <em>large</em> profits. Each worker helps to make your company $X  per day, and only receive a small percentage of that for their own labor. </p>

<p>So &quot;profiting&quot; from one&#39;s own labor, and profiting off of the labor of others, are two very different concepts. </p>

<p>Keep on figuratively sucking the cock of one of the biggest villains in US politics though. It&#39;s a great way to illustrate to everyone else how bad your thought process is.  </p>

Even a difference diligently maintain for appearances is a difference; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it, though.</p>

<p>Both parties are certainly too close to corporate interests, but I only have to look at history since the last party re-alignment to know that - even so - all the &quot;both parties are just the same lolol&quot; talk is typically a facile attempt to justify supporting Republican policies over people&#39;s own best interests. Like, &quot;I know their tax plan sucks for me and my family, but both parties are just the same lololol&quot;. Well, even if one party is supporting restricting insurance company over-profiting for the sake of keeping up appearances and the other party doesn&#39;t give a shit about keeping up appearances, that&#39;s a profound difference.</p>

I think the Republican party has been selling the public a big lie about deficit spending and taxes - and their role in such things. I think that <em>even if</em> the only difference between the parties was that one was more blatant in their crony capitalist antics, it definitely wouldn&#39;t be the sort of difference that would encourage me to support that party. I stand a better chance of influencing the Democratic party than those who have been pushing a reverse Robinhood ideology since Reagan. Do I think the Democratic party is superior to the Republican party? In what way? Enough so that the only Republican I&#39;ve ever voted for was a well-loved state comptroller who considered his position nonpartisan, at any rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh. Insurance companies had a work around that. What they did was jack up the negotiated price of service with a doctor/provider to make up for it. Ex. Patient A, w/o Obamacare used to pay 100$ for doctor&#39;s visit. With her Obamacare, doctor was billing her 400$. She tells doctor just consider her as having no insurance then. Doctor tells her he can&#39;t because that&#39;s his contract with the insurance company.  Point is get the gross to be as big as you can, so that 15% will still be huge.</p>

<p>Obama should have at least put in the public option but he got lobbied by the biggest lobby in DC -- the healthcare industry. He had a super majority. He wasted it. He&#39;s worse than a republican because he&#39;s a sellout. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I first heard the entire idea, that the Kennedy SONS (not the father) were uniquely principled individuals.  This documentary even suggests we lost WW2, and is generally a fascinating watch.  It&#39;s a long one though, might be best to take it in chunks.  :)</p>

Lamont won the primary but wasn&#39;t supported in the general by the either the Connecticut or national Democratic party, who were openly campaigning for Joementum and the Connecticut For Lieberman party (which Lieberman want even a member of). We could have easily gotten Lamont in if the Democrats were interested in supporting their own nominee</p>

<p>In characteristic short-sighted fashion, the Democrats were repaid for their loyalty just two years later by Joementum endorsing McCain and becoming one of the biggest roadblocks in Congress to the passage of Obamacare.</p>

<p>Ryan told Chuck Todd of NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he feels an obligation as leader of the House Republicans to back Trump, warts and all. To do otherwise, he said, would divide the party and ultimately lead to a third consecutive Democratic victory in November’s presidential election.</p>

<p>“I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the 1st District of Wisconsin, but as speaker of the House,” Ryan said in an interview that aired Sunday. “And imagine the speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read any of those articles?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from one </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Paul is going from the guy everyone looked to to rebuild the party to being a helping hand to the president,” said retiring Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.). Lawmakers typically fall in line behind the president when their party controls the White House, he continued, so Republicans in Congress won&#39;t &quot;have as much freedom ... as they did when [they] were working against a Democratic president.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is just not true, this administration has had the most difficulty getting appointments confirmed of any in recent history.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t disagree that they are taking longer. I said the blame falls with the Administration. Look at how many <em>nominations</em> they&#39;ve made, how far along they are in terms of producing documents, the vetting, etc. Things are moving slowly because they simply aren&#39;t doing their job quickly. It has very, very little to do with Democratic obstructionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all the articles I have read none have mentioned that the administration has been slow to provide &quot;documents&quot; for their appointments and many of the cabinet positions were nominated before inauguration yet have taken unusually long to confirm despite a republican majority.</p>

<p>It is true they have they to nominate many positions, but of the ones that have been they have taken an uncharacteristically long time to be confirmed. My original point was that if the congressional republicans were fully behind trump it would not have taken this long because they can force a majority vote to confirm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I read breitbart about as much as I read any other source. </p>

<p>So from these articles what is made apparent, to me, is that most of the nominees were not pre-vetted prior to being approached by the administration, which is where the lack of documentation comes into play. So on that front I am more sympathetic to your argument, but my original point was not so much that the administration is without fault.</p>

<p>Rather that senate republicans could be doing more to support trump, but choose not to, while at the same time being outspoken in their dislike of his administration. It appears, in my opinion, that these people are playing their part both to the special interests they receive funding from and their republican base who voted trump into office. The result being that they don&#39;t want to work with trump, but are forced to vote along party lines to retain support from republican voters who want trumps agenda pushed through.</p>

<p>Which is the usual corrupt politics that we&#39;ve seen for decades now and the reason trump was elected, people want politicians who will do what they were voted into office to do, not what their corporate special interest donors want them to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When insurance has a government mandated Medical Loss Ratio, there is only one way to collect more money to the company. You increase the cost of everything. </p>

<p>Simple math. $1000 and 80% MLR. Insurance company gets at most  $200 for their business. </p>

<p>Suppose they need $400 to operate. Without a MLR they could try to convince medical providers to accept $200 less out of that $800. But that&#39;s illegal now. So for the insurer to get  $400, they need to make sure there is $2000 and then $400 and $1600 passed to medical providers.</p>

<p>Its the most perverse incentive ever, it&#39;s a government mandate to skyrocket healthcare cost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually yes.</p>

<p>Unregulated healthcare was very affordable. It wasn&#39;t until WW2 wage controls that created the employer provided health insurance that is now systemic.</p>

<p>Also look at LASIK. Unregulated and paid for by the consumer directly. It&#39;s now measured in  hundreds of dollars. This was something that didn&#39;t even exist in Healthcare 25 years ago. It revolutionized eye care and is affordable to almost every single American. </p>

<p>Would you prefer it described as healthcare that is not part of the US health insurance club membership system?</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve had LASIK done to me several years ago. I paid a little over a thousand per eye for pinnacle quality care with the latest in technology from a surgeon who completed thousands of successful procedures. The other day on the radio I heard the same provider advertising LASIK for  $250 per eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your lame attempts at being pedantic because you can&#39;t confront the argument so you avoid it and deflect. </p>

<p>If you believe health insurers don&#39;t have vast impacts on the practice of healthcare, you&#39;re sticking your head in the sand. That affects the market. When enough insurers operate consistently in contracts that ultimately becomes written rules or regulations. Hell, on the HMO side, they literally regulate how doctors deliver care according to mandated procedure schedules. </p>

<p>When your company is responsible for giving millions and billions of dollars out, that has clout. An insurer can tell any healthcare provider you must do XX to be in-network. If this insurer covers 25% of the providers market, that means to reject the terms of the insurer they might lose over 25% of their revenue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not it works.</p>

<p>Each insurance contract stipulates reimbursement rates. Each contract year/duration has negotiations at each renewal about reimbursement, or what the provider sees in cash money. The provider will want more money each year due to cost inflation, they will request  XX% more dollars.</p>

<p>Insurers will counter offer with some lower percentage in regular markets. Now in a mandated MLR market, insurers are incentivized to accept the largest  reimbursement rates. Then insurers pass along this higher cost to beneficiaries through higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher coinsurance. </p>

That&#39;s a tough sell to either party, but definitely near impossible to the tea partiers and establishment republicans. In Washington, the farther left or right people who want more extreme measures generally don&#39;t have any bargaining power. They got thrown under the bus because they&#39;ll take any decent reform over nothing. Obama had to convince everyone else. The ACA did good things but also created unforseeable problems, but that&#39;s the nature of healthcare, it&#39;s really complicated and if you ever want to really fix it, and I&#39;ve listened to policy experts debate about the many different factors, most of them agree that it&#39;s almost impossible to sell a real solution to politicians. Good luck convincing someone you&#39;re gonna need 10 years when they run for election basically every other year. The ACA really should&#39;ve been a stepping stone for future administrations to improve upon. But apparently working together just isn&#39;t gonna happen anymore at the rate we&#39;re going and the new health bill looks pretty damn shitty. The way things are going, we&#39;re already seeing a new generation of young, I&#39;m talking under 25 far right wing christian extremists already taking office all over the country at the state levels and soon they&#39;ll be in Washington. What the hell happened to centrists?? Reality is that a fine mix of liberalism and conservatism can fix most problems. But politicians don&#39;t want to fix things. It literally is not in their interest to fix most things. That&#39;s a big problem. I&#39;m on board with increasing term length as a way to possibly address that. If you have 5, 10 years to do something and you have zero results to show, well you can get the fuck out of office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contain the costs of healthcare, there has to be transparency. So what actually happens behind closed doors is insuance CEO&#39;s meet with jospital CEO&#39;s and literally ask the hospitals to raise their chargemaster rates just so the insurance comapny can advertise the fact that they have the best discounts. <strong>The question is discounts off of what?</strong> If I charge you 100 million dollars for a knee replacement and give you a 99% discount you are still getting fucked.</p>

<p>So what happens in real life is major insurance companies downsize their clinical management departments, full of nurses that are helping people adhere to caremaps layed out by doctors, and reinvest that extra cash to advertise their wonderful discounts. </p>

<p>There is no transparency in the fully insured market. PPO networks and hospitals collude to maintain profit margins and monopolies. It&#39;s impossible to get an exact price of a procedure up from a hospital. Some ambulatory surgical centers, like the one in Oklahoma, do actually advertise prices but that is an anomaly in the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cap is in regards to the ratio of premium vs claims expenditures. So if the insurance company spends less than 80% of the premium it received to cover the risk of the policy on claims costs they are supposed to return whatever x% of that amount under 80% to the policy holder. That creates a disincentive to actually save the client money. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Money is a double-edged sword. </p>

<p>On the one hand, it acts as an incentive to provide a service like health care.</p>

<p>On the other hand, money is a very corrupting influence. As soon as people can make a profit doing something, they begin to change they way they do that thing so as to make more and more profits.</p>

<p>Eventually, the original purpose of the activity (e.g. providing health care) becomes a secondary consideration... and making as much money as possible becomes the primary consideration.</p>

<p>This is where things get interesting. Some people can see what has happened and begin to call for change. But then you&#39;ve got the people who want to keep things from changing because they&#39;re the ones making all that money. So they make up all kinds of bullshit excuses and outright lies why changing the system would be bad. Even worse, you get a bunch of fuckwits who believe them and take their side.</p>

<p>Now Big Medicine is making so much money, they can easily pay their lawmaker friends to keep things the way they are. It&#39;s hard to see any real improvement ever being made as long as so much money is at stake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piggybacking on your comment for visibility-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m a primary source on this. I help people navigate the healthcare delivery system, negotiate with providers and dispute fraudulent medical bills. Even the Federal Government admits 97% of medical bills contain errors, fraud or both. Below is a comment I made in another subreddit while trying to explain the system to people that have no idea what they are discussing.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s dispel the notion that there is some sort of magic bullet legislation that will fix our broken system. TrumpCare, ObamaCare, they are both disasters.</p>

<p>When medicare part D was passed, a Senator who I cannot remember at the moment (maybe Baucus) slipped a rider into the bill that made it so medicare could not negotiate with Big Pharma on the price of drugs. So Pharma can charge whatever the hell they want, see epipen.
Obamacare was rammed through congress in a budget conciliatory vote before any of the legislators even read the fucking 1000+ page bill. Nancy Pelosi, &quot;We have to pass it to see what&#39;s in it!&quot; Great fucking idea Nancy.</p>

<p>The &quot;Affordable&quot; Care Act is nothing more than an insurance company subsidy bill. Yes, it helped people that have never had coverage before gain access to care, which is great. But, that comes with consequences; all Americans were mandated to buy health insurance, and let me be very clear, health insurance is not equivalent to healthcare. So, many people are stuck with $6000 deductibles and $1000 a month premiums to just to avoid a fucking government penalty. EDIT the penalty I&#39;m referencing is the employer mandate, not the individual mandate. There are so many companies that can&#39;t afford to compete in the global market and offer competitive benefits simultaneously</p>

<p>This TrumpCare bill will be more of the same, crony capitalistic policies that take OUR tax money and pad the profits of private companies. Capitalist dream- privatized profits, socialized losses. Now, BOTH sides of the aisle have royally fucked the healthcare delivery system. All of us need to stop bickering about partisan issues and take responsibility for our own health. The government will not solve your problems.</p>

<p>So, to sum up that rant, the current system is dominated by three cartels; the giant hospital systems like HCA, the giant insurance companies like BCBS, CIGNA, and Aetna, and finally Big Pharma. They all collude together to maintain their profits.</p>

<p>The only difference between these cartels and the one&#39;s you might think of in regards to Mexico or Pablo Escobar is that they enforce their market power with bill collectors and lawyers rather than men with guns (though one could argue the DEA fills that role). Many politicians are owned by these powers and have no interest in disrupting the status quo and their feathered nests in DC.
Rant over.</p>

<p>Disclaimer- I know there are genetic disorders that no one can control, I am not dismissing those. I am happy that people finally have access to care, but anyone who knows about basic economics knows that there is always a trade-off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is certainly a difficult question. If there was actually a free market in place (100% transparency, lots of buyers and sellers, low barriers to entry, and a homogeneous product) things would theoretically work. We don&#39;t have anything like that though. I&#39;m copying one of my other comments-   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Govt, policies have assisted the healthcare industry in blocking each one of these. Medicare pricing allowed insurers to piggyback on govt pricing, thus concentrating &quot;buyers&quot;, and Obamacare is concentrating sellers through mergers. It is impossible to compare procedures, effectiveness or any information on costs , benefits or substitutes because insurers deliberately obscure it (antitrust exemption for insurers) and state and fed regulators are complicit to allowing cost shifting to avoid the state paying for the uninsured. Regulatory hurdles to paraprofessionals, walk in clinics and access to the prescription pad, are entry barriers. It is therefore amusing to read comments proclaiming the failure of the free market. The free market has not failed to work. It has been blocked at every point by industry, which is deeply embedded in govt and health care policy, and every reform effort begins with meetings with the &quot;industry&quot;, which has captured the government and legislatures. So the industry redivides the pie and moves he deck chairs. It is a parasite that feeds on the host but must not kill it, because then it too will die.
The power of market economics is apparent from the interest in the topic and the websites springing up in response to demands or information. Unchain it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then, after so many pitiful efforts to put in place a free market for healthcare, can we be forgiven for concluding that though it may a good idea when all the pieces are in place and allowed to function, it simply cannot work in practicality today?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let&#39;s grant the unlikely event that transparency is put in place across the entire system, though I would disagree even with this premise being possible when it is in a publicly owned company&#39;s interest to protect their mode of business and profits, which is directly threatened by advertising things like reimbursement rates. </p>

<p>Your argument here that a free market is still a viable mode of delivering Healthcare, is that people will then be able to find a deal?</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to pay a few thousand to repair a car that I love. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to pay my retirement and take a second mortgage out on my home to save my child. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem. I don&#39;t want to rely on the cheap doctor to save my loved one and I will accept a life of debt if it means they live. This was the US before the ACA, with millions in insurmountable debt or bankrupt because it was that or don&#39;t treat the cancer.  We tried a free market in healthcare and that was what happened.</p>

<p>On an open market there is a vested interest to keep you sick and a returning customer, or to squeeze as much money as they can out of you when disaster strikes and you have no choice but to get treatment or die.</p>

<p>A single-payer system through the government has a vested interest in keeping you a productive member of society and paying taxes.</p>

<p>When it comes to improving people&#39;s health, it sure seems like one of those options is far better than the other.  </p>

<p>So again, I&#39;ll ask, what is it about a free market that makes the downsides worth it?  </p>

<p>Will I get to choose while Im on rhe phone with 911 which ambulance company comes to my home when I get shot? </p>

<p>Will I get to choose between discount chemo and premo-chemo when my cancer comes back after going with the discount one the first time? </p>

<p>Will I get to choose the half rate doctor who has a sepsis rate 5x higher than the national average, but no one knows it because no one is subsidizing better quality care so no one is reporting outcomes?</p>

<p>How exactly can the free market ever put something like Healthcare before profit and still be able to call it &quot;care&quot;, when they know it&#39;s the one thing people will pay any amount in order to get? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve mentioned multiple times that there is inelastic demand, which is why I would prefer a single payer system...... but here&#39;s the thing, you&#39;re on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> advocating for a federally run health system....</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe in other countries, but I don&#39;t trust this government to have my best interest in mind, even if it means I keep paying taxes. </p>

<p>The one federally run medical system in this country, the VA, is considered the most inefficient in the country; rife with fraud and corruption. Those are our veterans, the ones we salute at each of our &quot;bread and circus&quot; football games, the one&#39;s we buy a drink at the bar for, yet they have the worst healthcare in the country. How does that make sense?</p>

<p>In a perfect world where factions of the Federal Government didn&#39;t subdue their own population with fear and useless trinkets I would advocate for a single payer system. If the government didn&#39;t drone strike an american citizen without due process, if the government didn&#39;t continually violate our 4th amendment rights, if the government didn&#39;t waste trillions on wars for profit of the few at the expense of the many, I would advocate for single payer.</p>

<p>You may say I&#39;m moving the goalposts, but I would strongly disagree. The main reason I advocate for the free market is because I don&#39;t want THIS government to have anything to do with my healthcare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely are moving the goalposts, but not in the manner you hedged.</p>

<p>The VA is a socialized healthcare delivery system. It is administered by government and military officials and pays for practically all of the care it administers and its facilities.  </p>

<p>Medicare Part D is a single payer health insurance. It pays for the care administered by all contracted healthcare providers on a variable reimbursement rate, most often tied to value (quality + cost).</p>

<p>No sane person looking at healthcare reform is arguing that we should expand the abomination that is the VA, or model jack shit after it out of the gate.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re generally arguing that if Medicare eligibility were expanded you could cripple the insurance companies&#39; hold on prices and premiums.  They would be relegated to offering catastrophic supplementals people could purchase to sit on top of their basic government  coverage.  In addition it would incentivize private market competition for healthcare delivery components like pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests and technological integrations, as they would still be competing to gain coverage by Medicare.  But reimbursement for actual healthcare delivery, like office visits, surgeries and lab tests, would be dependent on the value calculations of Medicare and the ability of providers to report it. It is a single-payer system that encourages competition.  A win-win.</p>

<p>As someone well aware of where this conversation is taking place, I completely sympathize with the deep seated rejection of any expansion to bureaucratic administration, but that just wouldn&#39;t be necessary in order to accomplish this.  Also having worked in healthcare going on a decade, I have seen first hand the giant leaps forward CMS has rewarded and taken the lead on across the healthcare landscape.  </p>

<p>10 years ago the VA was the only healthcare system apart from perhaps ones like Kaiser and large private hospitals to have even a semi-functioning Electronic Health Record system (EHR), let alone any capability whatsoever to regularly measure and track actual health outcomes and performance. But, their budget and their organization had practically no correlation to the standard of care they were delivering, only to patient volume, and perhaps things like billing data or re-admittance rates.</p>

<p>Today, we&#39;re all on EHRs and gearing up for MACRA to begin tying reimbursement rates to quality improvement efforts, performance measurements and outcomes, patient engagement and cost optimization on an even larger scale.  All indications point to this being the only mechanism around right now to even slightly pressure private insurances to be more transparent about their reimbursement rates.  </p>

<p>And it is coming from a Federal Agency.  </p>

<p>To me, looking at CMS&#39; previous actions, results, and stated goals, and trying to hold it independent of the politics going on in the much larger government (which it has successfully maneuvered for over 50 years) there is clearly a track record worth trusting, or at least a model worth seriously considering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love everything you said here. All true. </p>

<p>I would push back a little on the role of the Big Healthcare Systems Cartel. Healthcare systems and hospitals FOR SURE share the blame with the other two for the situation leading to the passage of the ACA. Since the ACA however, they have not exactly been &#39;raking in the cash&#39;. </p>

<p>I work for one of the major non-profit healthcare systems and can say a lot on the topic of who is really benefiting from these lobbied changes. Instead, I would &quot;follow the money&quot; and invite folks to google &quot;pharma profits&quot;, &quot;healthcare/hospital profits&quot; and &quot;health insurance profits.&quot; I believe you will find that Healthcare Systems are bearing the brunt of cost cutting measures, while Insurers and Pharma are reaping the benefits. </p>

<p>Now, when the switch to value-based care and population health are complete... Healthcare Systems will have absorbed the role of the insurance companies and both cover and provide care for populations cutting out an unhelpful, inefficient, profit-sucking middle man. ...unless they sell out to insurers first having not being able to survive the current climate.</p>

<p>TL/DR: Healthcare Systems and Hospitals did not have as big a say as some might think in the problems with the ACA. Their financial performance is evidence of this. </p>

<p>I agree with you here because Emergency Rooms are required by law to accept anyone who comes in. However, this leads to cost shifting on to private plans.</p>

<p>The large systems that dominate mostly rural states have virtual monopolies though. Medicare was designed to reimburse &quot;efficiently&quot; run hospitals at a profitable rate. Problem is, in my experience, efficient hospitals are hard to come by. </p>

<p>Big Pharma definitely benefits the most though</p>

<p>Yea everybody does their best to avoid HHS scrutiny, but that&#39;s not the best incentive. It only encourages people to do just enough not to get audited. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Valid point. Thing is, almost every Network Service Agreement between a PPO and a health system stipulates a no audit provision on medical bills. It&#39;s fucking insane. The actual plan participant has to request an itemized bill, and since everyone treats healthcare as a passive cost they are rarely requested by individuals. </p>

<p>For example, think about having a car under warranty; you&#39;re definitely going to go to the dealership for maintenance because you don&#39;t give a shit, it&#39;s covered under warranty. But once the warranty is up you actually start to shop for the best deal. Apply that latter mindset to healthcare and you would see a lot more efficiency simply because transparency would be demanded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you make a claim that&#39;s obviously bullshit people should be a bit rude about it.  There&#39;s not an industry in the country where a 97% failure rate would work.</p>

<p>I code medical bills every day.  I don&#39;t know every inch of the industry, that&#39;s right.  But I know enough to know that the insurance companies audit and deny at a high enough percentage that if you&#39;re submitting wrong claims that often you aren&#39;t actually getting any work done or payments in.</p>

<p>As it turns out the study was done in 1986 on a subset of high risk claims for hospitals.  The number makes sense for something from 30 years ago before a huge amount of regulations have changed.  It has nothing to do with the ACA or anything going on at this point.</p>

<p>I know this will sound pedantic, but not every error is catastrophic, many are minor which is why the stat holds some merit. I will give you the point that that is a very difficult threshold hold to meet, and probably exaggerated a bit. This is in reference to private bills though which inherently implies cost shifting from uninsured patients to private ones.</p>

<p>I am not sure on the personal doctors profit.  Trading your time for payment is not technically really considered profit since it costs you something to gain something of supposed equal value.   I will look into this more and see if I can find a real answer. This is my assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that simple. America is a massive country with a hugely diverse population. Comparing them to much smaller and more homogeneous countries is disingenuous. We also spend the most on health care because we&#39;re the richest country in the world. Funny how rich people spend more money on stuff they want, isn&#39;t it? But more than that, we spend the most on health care because <em>we subsidize the medical research that the rest of the world benefits from</em>. If we switched to single-payer it would dramatically impact the medical industry by reducing investments in innovation, and ultimately hurt the rest of the world. </p>

<p>However, we can&#39;t ignore the basic laws of economics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Health services are inelastic goods, meaning prices can be increased and real demand shrink while profits rise. Providers know this.  Translating diminishing demand to make profit into human terms means people will be priced out of products they need.  </p>

<p>Health care decisions are made in conditions where cost/benefit analysis by the patient can&#39;t be done, therefore opportunity cost arithmetic does not apply. </p>

<p>There is severe informational asymmetry between buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Health care services are not a good like other products on the market place as you yourself admit. </p>

<p>I think reasonable people agree that if a resource is really scarce not make up economics scarce then we need to ration it in some means.  I don&#39;t see why a priori it should be monetary access that is criterion for distribution. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>propensity of humans with power to abuse that power to enrich themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have agreement! We should limit bureaucratic centralization and the profit motive in health care.  As the profit motive leads to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ehrlichman: “… the less care they give them, the more money they make.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice equivocation of the word laws by the way. The idea that perfectly rational agents, with perfect information are interested in maximizing utils( a made up measurment) respond to price increases in ceteris paribus conditions in definitve way is in any way a law is unfounded. </p>

In everything else the free market works because people can just choose not to buy a certain thing.  People can&#39;t just choose not to buy a liver if they need one.  That 12% still allows for competition and innovation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The catch is, if you&#39;re poor enough where your lack of good health insurance might kill you... none of these other countries want to take you either. Countries screen their residents. They don&#39;t let people come in to live, if they think they&#39;re going to be a drain on the system. So that mostly means people who are already well off, or have the <em>potential</em> to be well-off (education, etc.) But if you&#39;re already well to do, or have that potential, then the cost of health care in the US isn&#39;t as big a problem in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m waiting on baited breathe for why introducing market-forces were a bad idea.  </p>

<p>Do you even have any idea how most health-care works?<br/>
The company you work for ponies up the capital, they have to have a big ass fund, which they then hire a company like Aetna or Blue Cross and Blue Shield to manage and comply with law and regulations. They charge a nominal fee for this service (way less than what contracted HR services charge.)  </p>

<p>When you buy health-insurance individually you do not pony-up the capital to fund it. You <em>borrow it</em> which is why it&#39;s so freaking expensive.</p>

Do this for long enough and the doctor will raise the price whatever % he is getting shafted.  Along with inflation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Op means by heath care cost is the cost of procedures that  hospitals and clinics are charging. </p>

<p>Hundreds of uninsured people everyday visit hospitals for any little thing like a cold or tiny cut can&#39;t be turned away and never pay for their care forcing the hospitals to find away to make up for lost profits.</p>

<p>So what they do is when someone with heath insurance visits, they see $$$ since they know they&#39;re going to get paid. They overcharge insured patients for whatever care provided because hospitals and insurance negotiate over the cost. </p>

<p>Insurance will pay the minimum amount and hospitals know this so they charge more to get to trick the insurance into paying.</p>

<p>Also hospitals know patients with good insurance are scared to death of getting the credit ruined so if their insurance refuses to pay the entire cost then they&#39;ll just bill the patients the rest forcing you to either argue with your insurance to pay the rest, you just paying it, or risk getting sent to collections. </p>

<p>It&#39;s why many people hated how there was no opt out option in Obama care </p>

The number maybe twice as high, because these deaths are not always reported. The numbers do not reflect the people that are made permanetly disabled every year. They have taken away the right to sue Drs. You can, but have to have a Dr from that  state testify that malpractice was committed. (Kind of like rape charges in Muslim countries where 4 men have to testify they witnessed the rape.) The government wants the sick, disabled and poor to have access to healthcare. While everyone is arguing over who and how to pay ( Americans pay the highest prices in the world) no one is talking about the lack of quality. The word genocide comes to mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there aren&#39;t absurdly high standards.  In every state, you have to have completed medical school plus 1 year of internship to get a license.  That&#39;s it.  That&#39;s the legal standard and has been for decades.  It hasn&#39;t changed.  </p>

<p>Board certification is not a legal requirement, nor is it the purview of the AMA, it&#39;s the ABMS&#39; territory.  </p>

<p>Finally, doctors are not the cause of increased medical costs.  The idea that doctors make crazy amounts of money is a myth because it neglects to account for student loan debt and lost opportunity cost.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll also add that most physicians aren&#39;t even members of the AMA because it sucks at lobbying for it&#39;s members&#39; interests.  It&#39;s not an effective lobbying body and just doesn&#39;t have the money or political clout to have much effect, so doctors don&#39;t see much of a reason to give them money, which only exacerbates the problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really can&#39;t trim it by much though.  Medicine is stupid complicated and there&#39;s a lot to learn.  Plus, there&#39;s the question of age and maturity.  </p>

<p>You can trim maybe 1 year off college, and maybe 1 year off medical school, so you get med school plus college done in 6 years instead of 8.  Residency training is already stupid streamlined though for most fields, and I just don&#39;t see any way to learn what you need to in less time there. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that you have other people in this thread complaining how incompetent doctors are and how we should all be sued to death for all our mistakes...are they really going to support us having LESS education?</p>

<p>I do agree we could trim off a year or two, but I don&#39;t think that really makes that much difference in the end.  </p>

<p>The debt is DEFINITELY absurd.  I&#39;d be massively in favor of a single payer health care system that incentivized doctors to take the government insurance by offering full tuition payment in exchange (retroactively).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more concerned with a complete lack of innovation in the healthcare industry. I don&#39;t fault doctors for making mistakes, because we&#39;re all human, but I do fault them for pretending they know more than they do. Back pain is a great example; from what I can tell, mainstream medical practitioners know <em>fuck all</em> about what causes the vast majority of back pain, but that doesn&#39;t stop them from offering services that are no better than all the alternative medicine offerings when compared to placebo. </p>

<p>Diagnosing conditions is something that computers are <em>already</em> doing better than the best doctors, and so the need for doctors to be walking medical encyclopedias are numbered, but you can bet your ass the AMA and higher ed industry will be 20 years behind that curve. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to make it sound like the AMA is the sole cause of all our healthcare woes, but it&#39;s an often overlooked piece of the puzzle that needs to be talked about more. I don&#39;t agree with you that single payer will solve the problem because doctor shortages and brain drain is one of the biggest issues facing counties who have single payer today. I think the AMA had to embrace the changing world and figure out how to cater to a larger medical workforce instead of a smaller one, otherwise they risk setting these doctors up for a massive disaster once DocMoBot 3000 comes online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All true concerns, except for the AMA part.  The AMA really controls very little of physician behavior.  </p>

<p>I worry about brain drain too, but if we incentivize doctors well, we&#39;d stay.  That means reasonable pay and helping significantly with loan debt.  And facilitating patient care.  </p>

<p>I think chronic back pain is a terrible example, because it&#39;s extremely difficult to treat.  I agree that doctors aren&#39;t good at it, and don&#39;t understand it, but no one really does.  It just sucks.  A better example would be something like diabetes or infectious disease, which we understand VERY well and are pretty good at.  </p>

<p>I agree 1000% that the medical community doesn&#39;t innovate.  Ever.  We&#39;re AT LEAST 20 years behind the tech curve.  I&#39;m a technophile and it frustrates me to no end.  None of my young physician colleagues even know what Reddit is.  They don&#39;t know what Watson is.  They don&#39;t sub to r/singularity and see the AI masters coming.  </p>

<p>I still can&#39;t look up what drugs my patient is prescribed, except the ones I prescribe.  If they saw their dentist this morning and got antibiotics, I have zero way of knowing that if the patient doesn&#39;t tell me...which they don&#39;t half the time, because they think it&#39;s not important, they forget, or they lie.  It&#39;s just backwards.  Privacy issues abound, which hinders the tech.  But proprietary crap is a huge issue because everyone is trying to be the &quot;next big thing&quot; in health care so every tech system is locked down and won&#39;t talk to the others.  It&#39;s stupidly backward.  </p>

<p>The best electronic records look like they were designed in the mid 2000&#39;s and most of them look like windows 98.  The VA system looks like DOS.  Not even kidding. It&#39;s a joke.  </p>

<p>We do need to modernize.  Med schools have realized the changing lack of need to be a walking encyclopedia and are focusing more on concept understanding and lookup and data analysis than pure memorization, though not enough IMO.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a complex and tough problem though and the AMA doesn&#39;t have much to do with it at all unfortunately.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>India is 6 years for college plus med school.  That&#39;s what I said, that I think you could trim off 2 years max, likely one from college and one from med school.  </p>

<p>I disagree that primary care doesn&#39;t require an MD.  I found primary care to be the most challenging field during my med school training, as it requires you to know a lot about a broad array of topics.  Cardiology or Pulmonology, where you&#39;re only focused on one system, is FAR easier, IMO.  </p>

<p>I do agree that we underutilize mid-level providers, and that doctors shouldn&#39;t be wasting time seeing sprained wrists or common colds.  That being said, although I&#39;ve worked with some EXCELLENT NP&#39;s and PA&#39;s, the quality tends to be lower on average than MD&#39;s.  My PCP has an NP who is horrendous and we hate the rare times when we get stuck with her.  I see little mistakes from mid-level providers often (over prescribing antibiotics, not checking labs as they should), but I see big mistakes sometimes too (too high or low doses, wrong meds, not checking Lithium levels for over 2 years, etc).  I don&#39;t see these basic mistakes from doctors nearly as often.  I&#39;ve never seen a doctor not check a Lithium level, or start someone on 20 mg of Abilify.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the issue that they don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know, so there&#39;s some overconfidence and the risk of missed zebras.  Rare diseases like hemochromatosis, wilson&#39;s disease, or even meningitis I&#39;ve seen go misdiagnosed by mid-level providers.  </p>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t to say that I don&#39;t love mid-levels, I do.  But they do require adequate supervision (I will say that in most of the mistakes I&#39;ve seen, the covering MD was not providing adequate supervision, IMO).  Also, more mid-levels won&#39;t solve our primary care shortage, as most mid-levels go into other fields too, that pay better.  NP&#39;s don&#39;t want to do primary care any more than MD&#39;s do.  </p>

<p>What we need to do is encourage more people to become doctors by making medicine enjoyable again, restoring the doctor patient relationship, and making it financially worth it.  One of my best friends, who is probably the smartest person I know and would&#39;ve been an amazing doctor, decided NOT to go to med school because it just wasn&#39;t worth it.  She made a few million in the tech sales industry before age 30 and is now retired young.  People who are smart enough to be doctors can do other things, and they are.  We need to make medicine worth it for these people (and not just financially, but professionally too), or the shortage will only continue to grow.  We also need to utilize mid-levels more appropriately, but that alone isn&#39;t going to fix anything and might make things worse.</p>

It&#39;s a classic regulatory capture story but it&#39;s not talked about that often because a lot of attention is focused on Big Pharma even though it represents a fraction of health care costs. They do a lot of bullying of alternative medicine practitioners while enjoying a monopoly over the medical procedure codes the government has officially adopted (CPT).

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not &quot;acceptable&quot;, but some level of medical error is unavoidable.  First off though, your statistic is not a hard and fast number, it&#39;s an estimate from one study.  It&#39;s not verified and could be totally wrong.  The authors themselves admit this in the paper.  Second, what makes you think all of that medical error is committed by doctors?  I&#39;m sure some of it is, but much of it is also going to be further down the chain: a nurse gives the wrong dose, the pharmacy sends the wrong medicine, an aide tries to ambulate a patient without assistance, etc.   </p>

<p>Also, how do you define an error?  If a new patient comes out n unconscious to the emergency room, alone, and the doctor, trying to save their life, gives them a medicine they&#39;re allergic to, is that an error?  How is it the doctor&#39;s fault?  The doctor had no way of knowing the patient had a rare allergy and was giving the most effective, standard treatment for a problem.  </p>

<p>The fact remains that although treatment for an illness shouldn&#39;t cause death, sometimes it will.  Sometimes that&#39;s because of error, but sometimes that&#39;s just the way things are.  </p>

<p>I do think there is a lot of room for improvement in the medical system.  I do not think it lies with doctors.  Most of the improvement is in medical technology, which is in the dark ages.  Things like universal health care records, so doctors can see every patient&#39;s entire health history and mess regardless of if that patient has been to this hospital before would solve my hypothetical allergy problem above and save countless lives.  Better warning systems to prevent giving wrong doses and wrong meds.  The current warnings go off far too often and unnecessarily so doctors and nurses develop a tolerance to them and learn to ignore them.  They&#39;re useless.  We need alerts that go off when it&#39;s truly a problem.  But the computer systems aren&#39;t sophisticated enough to do that.  </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the issue of work hours.  Many errors are caused by the issue of &quot;residency&quot;, where doctors are forced to work crazy hours on little sleep for little pay.  A recent attempt at adding work hour rules didn&#39;t work, because it &quot;limited&quot; hours to 80 a week, and greatly increased patient handoffs.  But unfatigued doctors would definitely make less errors.   And it&#39;s not like they like being forced to work until their brains fall out.  They&#39;re forced to.  It&#39;s indentured servitude.  </p>

The system of working people long hours is a problem. More mistakes will be made due to fatigue.

<p><a href="http://courtingthelaw.com/2016/05/05/commentary/does-a-woman-need-four-witnesses-to-prove-rape/">This is a fairly decent read on it</a>, but the notable part;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, let’s look at the verses of the Quran which mention the production of four witnesses:</p>

<p>“The adulterer and the adulteress — flog each one of them with a hundred stripes” - (An-Nur 24:3).</p>

<p>“…And those who calumniate chaste woman but brings not four witnesses — flog them eighty stripes and do not admit their evidence ever after” – (An-Nur 24:5).</p>

<p>In above-mentioned verses, it has been made very clear that the requirement of four witnesses arises to prove adultery and not rape, and not when the husband is being accused of unfaithfulness, but when the wife is being accused.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s kind of the point. Ultimately, most businesses will pay you as little as they can possibly get away with paying you, while still actually getting what they want. Either you take what they offer, or you don&#39;t. But economic coercion means that a whole lot of people are going to take jobs where their time is valued less than they think it&#39;s really worth, because they&#39;re desperate, and something is better than literally nothing.</p>

<p>So in a way, the company is setting the value. Although on the lower end, ultimately, it&#39;s actually the government who sets the value.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basic economics identifies 4 attributes of a competitive market: large number of buyers and sellers, a homogeneous product, perfect information, and no entry barriers. </p>

<p>Government policies have assisted the healthcare industry in blocking each one of these. Medicare pricing allowed insurers to piggyback on government pricing, thus concentrating &quot;buyers&quot;, and Obamacare is concentrating sellers through mergers. </p>

<p>It is impossible to compare procedures, effectiveness or any information on costs, benefits or substitutes because insurers deliberately obscure it (antitrust exemption for insurers) and state and fed regulators are complicit to allowing cost shifting to avoid the state paying for the uninsured. Regulatory hurdles to paraprofessionals, walk in clinics and access to the prescription pad, are entry barriers. </p>

<p>It is therefore amusing to read comments proclaiming the failure of the free market. The free market has not failed to work. It has been blocked at every point by industry, which is deeply embedded in government and health care policy, and every reform effort begins with meetings with the &quot;industry&quot;, which has captured the government and legislatures. So the industry redivides the pie and moves the deck chairs. It is a parasite that feeds on the host but must not kill it, because then it too will die.</p>

<p>Nixon sold us out on healthcare, and started the first-ever &quot;war&quot; on an inanimate object - drugs, turning a blind eye to science and going heavy on &quot;Law and Order&quot;. Read the HST piece. It&#39;s a masterwork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the initial drafting of this bill, there was a public HMO option allocated to it. </p>

<p>Ted Kennedy at the time convinced other major Democrats to remove the Public option from the bill. They felt that making the bill too good would make it harder for Kennedy to use Healthcare as a platform to run against Nixon in the next election. </p>

<p>Further, Nixon actually agreed to the public option part. </p>

<p>Watergate got in the way, then shit went downhill for everyone. The bill&#39;s public option was not explored nor even brought to vote to be added again. </p>

<p>It has been documented through US history that everytime the government has messed with the Healthcare market, they would fuck it up even worse than before. In this case, the major cause of the fuck up was people playing politics instead of doing their jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with that is you will get terrible healthcare. There is an economic principle that applies to capitalist/oligarch economies that is called &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot;. Basically when no one stands to profit, the product or service will stagnate. It comes from common grazing grounds that no one owned in England, it would get ravaged and then because no one could own or charge for others to use it, that area would turn to a muddy swamp in the centers of towns almost immediately. It would grow back over time and happen all over again. The same would be for non-profit healthcare, lower grade service, doctors only charging cash for their services, Insurance companies closing doors giving few options to the public. It sounds like a great idea, but it would flip on us quick, unless the government were to subsidize the industry to where they could still make money and give themselves performance bonuses and then we would be tax more. 1 dime or 10 pennies, either way its the same. The only answer is a semi-socialist/capitalist society where we outlaw lobbying so that our government act in the best interest of the people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. If it was then why are 36 countries ahead of us? America is not the only country that comes up with medical breakthroughs.  Non profit does not mean working for free. Salaries and bonuses would be part of expenses. Insurance could sell policies disability policies. Paying salaries, expenses for domestic care,  lawn care, etc. when you are not able. All those paper pushers could become health care providers, contributing tot he care of the patient, or supplying the disability services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with the fact that 36 countries are ahead of us, but for a myriad of reasons. some of the more successful ones are a socio-capitalistic economics, others started their healthcare as nationalized before the oligarchs, publically traded companies and hedge funds took ahold of the industry. Its not 1 specific reason they crush us, but many. To truly overhaul how our systems works would take alot of effort and time because we cant force doctors and providers to be non-profit (the doctors would have to be as well because the rates of insurance companies are set by actuaries that look into the average costs, risks and liabilities and set the rates that way. So controlling the cost of actual services would have to be done somehow. Also, you would have to get rid of medicare/medicaid to sell disability policies (unless you are talking about long term disability insurance like what Aflac pushes)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Wishful thinking. I just know the best hospitals in US are usually non profit. Mayo clinic comes to mind.  The fact that medical error ranking 3rd in cause of death means we are in trouble. These are preventable errors. Not counting the patient was just to sick and procedure did not work, or we did all we could etc. I also know that some states are worse than others. Our state is so bad, we are afraid to get medical care. We have actually gone out of state for care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually very few people are motivated by things other than profit(salary), especially those who have people to provide for.

    <div class="md"><p>they is a million examples of privatized companies governing themselves for profit and the best interest of their customers. Profitability and customer advocacy are not inverse of one another. In companies that have a long term strategy, typically customer advocacy plays into it. Markets (Insurance, Stocks, Pharma, etc) that have a short term &quot;for today&quot; attitude towards their markets, and a lot of times, its systemic. The  reason insurance flipped is because of 80% of the market is owned by hedge funds (including Berkshire Hathaway) now and they are being pushed by those who just want the revenue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right and before this act, it was not possible for anyone involved in health care to use the stock market.   In some cases it is not a good idea to allow this type of thing.  </p>

<p>I would also argue that in general the stock market is a plague to society in general.  Most of the wealth created by them is of no actual benefit to society and usually, like in this example, it is the exact opposite.</p>

<p>I am also toying with the idea that the only reason the US dollar has not spun into hyperinflation due to the quantitative easing is due to the stock market&#39;s ability to vacuum up currency into the hands of a few, who do not redistribute these funds into the general economy.

    <div class="md"><p>i would agree with all your assertions. The dollar is kept off the market because it helps maintain a false value, the less physical money in the market, the more purchasing power it is. The US will shred physical money to pull this off,  and they do it ALL the time. I meant that the physical companies are owned by Hedge Funds, who actual customers are their investors, so they burn ties with one customer of the company they own a majority share of stock in to appease the other with dividends. When insurance companies had 1 person at the head of it and it was privately owned, typically that person would come to a long term strategy to keep multiple generations of a family within their customer base. However, once the decision maker becomes a fund who main function is to create profits for its clientele, then the insurance company is directed to do things like drive in money through price increases across the board, denying claims purposely with no reason. The banks also did this (Wells Fargo with fake accounts, Wachovia and others with ATM fees, and other gouging fees. The banks are here to appease themselves and investors (so put your money at a private bank, credit union or community bank)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a primary source on this. I help people navigate the healthcare delivery system, negotiate with providers and dispute fradulent medical bills. Even the Federal Governement admits 97% of medicals contains errors, fraud or both. Below is comment I made in another subreddit while trying to explain the system to people that have no idea what they are discussing. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s dispel the notion that there is some sort of magic bullet legislation that will fix our broken system. TrumpCare, ObamaCare, they are both disasters.</p>

<p>When medicare part D was passed, a Senator who I cannot remember at the moment (maybe Baucus) slipped a rider into the bill that made it so medicare could not negotiate with Big Pharma on the price of drugs. So Pharma can charge whatever the hell they want, see epipen.</p>

<p>Obamacare was rammed through congress in a budget conciliatory vote before any of the legislators even read the fucking 1000+ page bill. Nancy Pelosi, &quot;We have to pass it to see what&#39;s in it!&quot; Great fucking idea Nancy.</p>

<p>The &quot;Affordable&quot; Care Act is nothing more than an insurance company subsidy bill. Yes, it helped people that have never had coverage before gain access to care, which is great. But, that comes with consequences; all Americans were mandated to buy health insurance, and let me be very clear, health insurance is not equivalent to healthcare. So, many people are stuck with $6000 deductibles and $1000 a month premiums to just to avoid a fucking government penalty.</p>

<p>This TrumpCare bill will be more of the same, crony capitalistic policies that take OUR tax money and pad the profits of private companies. Capitalist dream- privatized profits, socialized losses.
Now, BOTH sides of the aisle have royally fucked the healthcare delivery system. All of us need to stop bickering about partisan issues and take responsibility for our own health. The government will not solve your problems.</p>

<p>So, to sum up that rant, the current system is dominated by three cartels; the giant hospital systems like HCA, the giant insurance companies like BCBS, CIGNA, and Aetna, and finally Big Pharma. They all collude together to maintain their profits.</p>

<p>The only difference between these cartels and the one&#39;s you might think of in regards to Mexico or Pablo Escobar is that they enforce their market power with bill collectors and lawyers rather than men with guns (though one could argue the DEA fills that role). Many politicians are owned by these powers and have no interest in disrupting the status quo and their feathered nests in DC.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

<p>Disclaimer- I know there are genetic disorders that no one can control, I am not dismissing those. I am happy that people finally have access to care, but anyone who knows about basic eeconomics knows that there is always a trade-off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be because a lack of profit incentive decreases the efficiency, seeing as the person running the hospital sees no change in their personal wealth whether they spend 80hours a week on the hospital or whether they spend 2 hours a week on it and then sit around masturbating to anime the rest of the week.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, if you look at the bill it&#39;s not self-evidently bad. I think it&#39;s entirely plausible that the Act is merely a well-meaning bill that was the product of the kind of compromise needed to achieve widespread support, rather than any collusive cabal. </p>

If not, you don&#39;t understand what a service is or how services improve, or how America&#39;s understanding of commodities not being a function of public intervention <em>improved every service and product that you enjoy today</em>. You didn&#39;t get fucking iPads or i7 CPUs by Apple and Intel having caps on profit margins. But we&#39;ll probably throw those incredible feats of technology under the rug as &quot;non-comparables&quot; to health care (even though health care has improved under similar conditions in the realm of health care technology, herp derp). Because, as you know, we are achieving such technological success by <em>not</em> being profit driven and choosing to invest in what the market wan--- oooooh.</p>

<p>And &quot;social responsibility&quot; isn&#39;t an argument. We can take a look at the US, Canadian and UK health care systems&#39; crumbling, unjust (work hours, understaffed, etc.) gov&#39;t programs to see how that sophist trick is playing out.</p>

<p>And, finally, &quot;how do you prevent monopolies, then???&quot; isn&#39;t an argument. As it&#39;s already been stated several times in here (see: <a href="/u/Redditsoldestaccount">/u/Redditsoldestaccount</a>), the monopoly is fueled by the gov&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>People are driven buy a lot of other things besides profit.  There are countless scientific studies on this fact.  Corporations on the other hand are driven only by profit.  So if you are saying that the only way to advance as a society is for a corporation to create something, I believe sir you are mistaken.</p>

<p>It is the people who create all this shit, and in a non-profit environment you can still pay your people really well.  You just cannot make profit for the sole purpose of paying shareholders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize you cannot, materially, support an operation that doesn&#39;t have some form of sustainable profit, yes? That&#39;s the part that makes up people&#39;s paychecks. (Of course, if you&#39;re a monopoly on force, you just take the profit form actual productive entities for your little social engineering projects)</p>

<p>A non-profit still needs a gross margin outside of revenue (donations are a form of profit). You can&#39;t &quot;break even&quot; - a &quot;cost&quot; of running needs to be reimbursed by a profit margin, or your losing money and value. Basic economics. It&#39;s why businesses go into bankruptcy. You cannot infinitely move debt around. What do you think an hourly labor rate is?</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually not sure what you&#39;re even trying to say, at this point. Yes, society does move forward by production. That&#39;s how biological beings continue to exist, fundamentally. You exert work (energy) in order to achieve (produce) some kind of sustainability. You aren&#39;t even philosophically correct, let alone well-versed in econ&#39; 101, it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, non-profits make plenty of money.  They have even have extra.  I think most people really don&#39;t know how the non-profit world works.  </p>

<p>My point is profiting off of the sick is a terrible idea.  A for profit corporation is required by law to make decisions that increase profits and not decrease profits.  This is a conflict of interest at its core when you are talking about running any hospital, drug company, insurance company ect.</p>

<p>I am saying that I disagree with your assumption that health care should be as profitable as possible.  I also disagree with your idea that biological beings operate for profit, that analogy is terrible.   I am also saying that basic economics is terribly flawed, in the sense that there is scarcity to begin with.  This is only created by the colonial economics model which is beyond broken.</p>

<p>Since we have diverged so far from the topic, I figured what the heck lets go for it.  </p>

<p>Basic economics is flawed and does not truly reflect what we see today or have ever seen due to this and many other facts.  Land, Labor and Capital are the required inputs to produce wealth, by econ definitions.  But the colonial model has treated land like capital.  As though it is something that man can create or own.  Therefore, there has never been a free market due to the fact that there has always been a monopoly of land, or a barrier to access in the very least.   So you see, we have never ever had a free market. </p>

<p>I could go on and on with examples if you don&#39;t get what I am saying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? Health care has a cost, whether your little fancy feelings like it or not. There is a price.</p>

<p>A CAT scan requires labor to make the machinery. Labor to operate. Labor to schedule use of it. We represent labor with money. It costs money to have a CAT scan. Or a knee brace. Or heart surgery.</p>

<p>What you suggest is we give the gov&#39;t power to steal money, which is labor, (so it&#39;s pseudo-slavery) and develop bureaucracy to run said giant socialist-slavery machine. Name a single bureaucratic element of the gov&#39;t that has &quot;reduced costs&quot; for everyone, using the actual definition of reduced prices (cannot contain my laughter that you actually said that a giant gov&#39;t program reduces costs--do you have ANY idea of what is happening to costs in Canada or the United States with their ridiculous policies of required admittance? Do you want to take a gander at Venezuela&#39;s central planning utopia?).</p>

<p>What you are probably going to do is step around the fact that the gov&#39;t is stealing swathes of money so that someone can get in &quot;free&quot; (hence &#39;reduced prices&#39;, except fraudulently represented as free) to check if their morning sneeze was cancer. Oh wait, giant centrally-planned systems like that <em>never</em> get abused, right? To the point where abuse inevitably ends up being forcefully paid for by the tax payer? That&#39;s only the tip of the massive, moon-sized glacier that is central planning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>much lower costs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a joke. You are regurgitating non-factual, non-reality nonsense along with the other socialists in this [month-old] thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not go back further than that.  The idea of economics is flawed.  Allow me to give one example.  Land, Labor and Capital are the required inputs to produce wealth, by econ definitions.  But the colonial model has treated land like capital.  As though it is something that man can create or own.  Therefore, there has never been a free market due to the fact that there has always been a monopoly of land, or a barrier to access in the very least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point about chronic back pain is that Doctors aren&#39;t as forthcoming as you are about how little they understand and have solutions for it, while simultaneously disparaging and lobbying against alternative practitioners like chiropractors. They&#39;re perfectly happy selling snake oil so long as it provides them with work and preserves their guru status.</p>

<p>Your other insights are fascinating though and I can see now I may be laying too much at the feet of the AMA. The whole industry is fucked beyond belief, but I really really really hope we don&#39;t move to single payer. We&#39;re the last industrialized nation where there&#39;s still an incentive to invest in medical ventures, and even still it&#39;s far less attractive than throwing money into real estate or software startups. </p>

<p>My hope is that the system collapses in such spectacular fashion that we have no choice but to repeal or ignore the regulations that are choking the industry and enjoy a renaissance of innovation that rivals Silicon Valley&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim as stated is false, because it is way too broad to possibly be true. Most healthcare before 1973 was for profit. It appears that there were caps on profit for some businesses, but there was still profit</p>

<p>Fighting Against the Evils of For-Profit Health Care: The Patients’ &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;
&quot;Prior to the 197O’s, America’s health care system was wildly overspending and overexpanding. Indemnity insurance and government agencies such as Medicare not only paid for medical costs, but also encouraged further growth. In the 1970’s, health care expenses soared to the point where it became clear that a change in the system was needed, The change came in a form of the Health Maintenance Organization (HM0) Act of 1973, which took its main source of inspiration from the Kaiser Permanente Health Care System (MacArthur, 1997). This provision encouraged the creation of organizations that would provide managed care by completely serving all its members on the capitation basis. The capitation basis mandates that each physician receive a flat fee for each patient visited, regardless of the amount of time he or she spends with said patient (Meckler, 1999). Clearly, it can be seen that such a remuneration policy encourages physicians to spend as little time as possible with people seeking health care. Furthermore, documentation suggests that physicians with certain HMOs are even afforded bonuses at the end of the year if they save money by limiting referrals and costly procedures (Meckler, 1999). Additionally, the HM() Act of 1973, originally designed to subsidize non-profit HMO&#39;.s and combat capitation, has had little initial impact on the system. The government was unwilling to battle the American Medical Association (AMA) in pushing the IIMO reform due to previous failures over Universal Health Care. At this point an unexpected ally of the managed care reform, corporate development, made an appearance.</p>

<p>The corporate world had kept a close eye on the transformation of the health care system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, which attracted doctors to elderly and poor patients. This form of public financing was very lucrative to investors, who already owned hospital chains and nursing homes that exploited Medicare and Medicaid for handsome revenues. Ironically, the effort&#39;s for cost containment also created opportunities for corporate development. The corporate world decided to jump in and shape the HMO reform rather than be shaped by it. Government, starved for a solution, welcomed this intervention by the for-profit sector and in 1980 President Reagan reformed the original HMC) Act of 1973 to include a fund to subsidize the establishment of for-profit HMOs (Kuttner, 1996). Now it was pressure of creating efficient, business-like management of the health care system that was undermining the traditional professional sovereignty of health care providers. Thus the HMOs, in addition to the for-profit hospitals, came under control of corporate organizations, In 1994, the Universal Health Care Plan, proposed by President Clinton, targeted for-profit health care providers as an integral portion of the medical field in the United States. With this bill, Clinton&#39;s goal was to create health alliances, made up of consumers, which would select between different providers and choose the plans they thought offered the best quality and access. These alliances would complement the already growing for-profit managed care sector in creating managed competition, as envisioned by Alain Ethoven (Kuttner, 1996). The government would subsidize the uninsured, and thus the entire country will be insured and have a choice of a provider, Unfortunately, when the Universal Health Care Plan was defeated, the system was left with business-oriented provider and an uneducated consumer.</p>

<p>Given this lack of governmental control the for-profit providers have invented several methods to cutting costs and thereby increasing profits. The physician working under an HMO contract is subject to a review of his or her decisions by the HMO; utilization reviews, gate keepers and financial incentives to withhold care are consistently on the minds of many physicians trying to provide both for their patients and themselves, This is a central conflict within the for-profit health care sector the dispute between the needs of the physician and the needs of the patient. Managed care&#39;s traditional goal of educating physicians about cost conscience quality care, to avoid practices such as defensive medicine, has turned into a race for the lowest possible medical loss ratio, and the highest profit. The race for profit inadvertently resulted in lower quality care, as evidenced by the special cases of HMOs. In capitation, the profit is made by providing the least possible care, and nothing is more effective in discouraging a patient&#39;s return than a distasteful experience with a provider,</p>

<p>While some argue against this largely negative view of the for-profit health care system, statistics show that HMOs have an alarming rate of patient decrease in health and incorrect diagnosis. One study conducted by Dr. John Ware of the AMA found that, &quot;…elderly and poor chronically ill patients had worse physical health outcomes in HMOs than in FFS (fee for service) systems,&quot; (Ware, et. al, 1996). A completely different study run by the American Heart Association stated, &quot;In hospital mortality of myocardial patients is twice as high in HMOs that in FFS systems.&quot; (Casale, 1997). These studies, and others like them, indicate a low level of quality in the health care of HMO’s and evidence the need for reform.&quot;...

    <div class="md"><p>Meh. Insurance companies had a work around that. What they did was jack up the negotiated price of service with a doctor/provider to make up for it. Ex. Patient A, w/o Obamacare used to pay 100$ for doctor&#39;s visit. With her Obamacare, doctor was billing her 400$. She tells doctor just consider her as having no insurance then. Doctor tells her he can&#39;t because that&#39;s his contract with the insurance company.  Point is get the gross to be as big as you can, so that 15% will still be huge.</p>

<p>Obama should have at least put in the public option but he got lobbied by the biggest lobby in DC -- the healthcare industry. He had a super majority. He wasted it. He&#39;s worse than a republican because he&#39;s a sellout. </p>

<p>I code medical bills every day.  I don&#39;t know every inch of the industry, that&#39;s right.  But I know enough to know that the insurance companies audit and deny at a high enough percentage that if you&#39;re submitting wrong claims that often you aren&#39;t actually getting any work done or payments in.</p>

<p>As it turns out the study was done in 1986 on a subset of high risk claims for hospitals.  The number makes sense for something from 30 years ago before a huge amount of regulations have changed.  It has nothing to do with the ACA or anything going on at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Labor is forced toil due to the custom of inherited property, otherwise we would be free to work the land and enjoy free time to produce all that we need. Unfortunately the unnatural virus of capitalism has enslaved many minds, and through violence those diseased minds have created a system that forces people to work many times what they need to so the parasite class can have ever more than they ever need.  Is a mugging victim incentivized to give up their wallet by having a gun shoved in their face?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All true concerns, except for the AMA part.  The AMA really controls very little of physician behavior.  </p>

<p>I worry about brain drain too, but if we incentivize doctors well, we&#39;d stay.  That means reasonable pay and helping significantly with loan debt.  And facilitating patient care.  </p>

<p>I think chronic back pain is a terrible example, because it&#39;s extremely difficult to treat.  I agree that doctors aren&#39;t good at it, and don&#39;t understand it, but no one really does.  It just sucks.  A better example would be something like diabetes or infectious disease, which we understand VERY well and are pretty good at.  </p>

<p>I agree 1000% that the medical community doesn&#39;t innovate.  Ever.  We&#39;re AT LEAST 20 years behind the tech curve.  I&#39;m a technophile and it frustrates me to no end.  None of my young physician colleagues even know what Reddit is.  They don&#39;t know what Watson is.  They don&#39;t sub to r/singularity and see the AI masters coming.  </p>

<p>I still can&#39;t look up what drugs my patient is prescribed, except the ones I prescribe.  If they saw their dentist this morning and got antibiotics, I have zero way of knowing that if the patient doesn&#39;t tell me...which they don&#39;t half the time, because they think it&#39;s not important, they forget, or they lie.  It&#39;s just backwards.  Privacy issues abound, which hinders the tech.  But proprietary crap is a huge issue because everyone is trying to be the &quot;next big thing&quot; in health care so every tech system is locked down and won&#39;t talk to the others.  It&#39;s stupidly backward.  </p>

<p>The best electronic records look like they were designed in the mid 2000&#39;s and most of them look like windows 98.  The VA system looks like DOS.  Not even kidding. It&#39;s a joke.  </p>

<p>We do need to modernize.  Med schools have realized the changing lack of need to be a walking encyclopedia and are focusing more on concept understanding and lookup and data analysis than pure memorization, though not enough IMO.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a complex and tough problem though and the AMA doesn&#39;t have much to do with it at all unfortunately.  </p>
