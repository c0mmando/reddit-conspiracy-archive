       I haven't dug into this subject in depth yet, and I'm not sure if this is the right sub to have this discussion. But can somebody give me the lowdown on why a lot of people (including Trump) deny human caused climate change when the overwhelming scientific consensus says otherwise?

       I realize the scientific discussion of climate change is better suited to another forum, but is there any evidence of conspiracy going on here? I've heard things about a carbon tax being pushed. I just want to be more informed on the subject.

       I can't trust any of the "science" but it's pretty clear the climate change faithful have been manipulating data to try to make their models work (and their models still don't work)
      </p>
      <p>
       And the geological record overwhelmingly supports a cooling trend for the planet. Air quality is something to be concerned about but humans are not substantially affecting the global climate.

       Environmental agencies say that because of the data they they made up; you should give them and the state money (to "protect the environment").
      </p>
      <p>
       This immediately should bring up red flags for people. It seems like things like the EPA manipulate data to get money and push more regulations

       The world has dirty, corrupt, lying politicians, priests, cops, military, lawyers, businessmen, and judges... is it a stretch to think that maybe some scientists are also dirty liars?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are gonna test the waters of "lying science" with the whole Round-Up thing... then maybe move on... Climate Change, Vaccines and Roundup are all kinda based on the same underlying "conspiracy theory"... and that is maybe a scientist would lie for more $$$.

       the "consensus" has been achieved through the denial of positions, tenure, and publication to contrary views regarding climate. The geologic record indicates several periods of glacial periods of melting and freezing before the existence of humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas. There is much more water vapor in the atmosphere than CO2 (which is currently only .06% of total atmospheric mass). Mass is a key part of all heat transfer equations.

       Fukushima is the

       environmental disaster of our age. Notice how the carbon shills will never acknowledge this, they are not allowed to, because nuclear power is the endgame of their agenda.

       Bullshit. Those "contrarian views" can and have been published, and every time they have been proved wrong. That's why there is a consensus among the vast majority of scientists.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But there is this little thing called the "hydrologic cycle" that keeps atmospheric water vapour at a contant level
       <em>
        all else being equal
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is,
       <em>
        all else
       </em>
       is no longer equal. It is a proven fact that we have increased the atmospheric concentration of CO2, which means
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       have changed the balance. Here is an ELI5 that illustrates what is happening:
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a ten gallon bucket with a hole in it sitting under a  running tap. The hole allows ten gallons per hour of water to flow out of the bucket. The tap is running at a rate of ten gallons per hour. As much water comes out of the bucket as goes in, so the bucket never fills up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you come along and turn up the tap just a little bit. Now, instead of ten gallons per hour, the tap is putting ten and a half gallons per hour of water into the bucket. But the hole still only lets out ten gallons of water per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, after the first hour, ten and a half gallons went into the bucket, but only ten came out. So now there is half a gallon of water in the bucket. After ten hours, one hundred and five gallons of water went into the bucket, but only one hundred came out. Now there is 5 gallons of water in the bucket.
      </p>
      <p>
       After 20 hours, 210 gallons went in, 200 came out, and the bucket is overflowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a simple explanation for what increasing the levels of Greenhouse Gases does. Nature
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       a way of keeping things in balance (ten gallons in, ten gallons out) but we came along and tipped that balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a system that is in "dynamic equilibrium" - like the tap and bucket with a hole in it - small changes can have profound effects. It takes time, though. At first nothing much happened. There is an extra half gallon of water in the bucket, but otherwise no real difference. Given enough time, however, that small change can build up to become a major problem, and the bucket can overflow.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Global Warming, the small change of CO2 (and other GHG's) concentration that we have caused, along with other factors such as deforestation, has slightly increased the average temperature of the planet. It is a simple physical fact that warmer air can hold more water vapour. So not only have we increased the CO2 concentration, but had the knock-on effect of increasing the water vapour concentration, and both of those are feeding back to cause warmer average temperature and thus higher waqter vapour concentrations and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what "Climate Change" is. It is a simple physical reality, that can't be legitimately denied.

       Can you give me one example where the transfer of heat is not related to the mass of objects giving and receiving heat? That's a big hole in your argument, plus the fact that the geologic record indicates that the cycle of glaciation is much older than the human race. Occam's Razor slices another major hole in your argument, as the vilification of CO2 emissions involves complex assumptions and hypotheses which cannot be proven in a classroom or home environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you are a part of a majority that believes in this idea does not make you right. It just makes your views commonplace (and well-advertised). The lack of scientific scrutiny on the ideas only reflects the religious nature of
       <em>
        scientism
       </em>
       and its grasp on  Western "intellectuals." To believe your views takes greater leaps of faith than doubting that .06% of the total mass of the atmosphere is responsible for heating all of it, plus the mass of the Earth's crust. The fact that this consideration has no merit in your mind illustrates the cultish quality of your beliefs.

       You can't tell effect from relative abundance. Despite being only a small fraction of the total atmosphere by mass carbon dioxide exerts a quarter of the clear-sky longwave radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere. You can plainly see the impact of carbon dioxide on earth's temperature in both the spectral flux at the top of the atmosphere and in the downwelling radiation from the atmosphere towards the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water vapor does exert ~2.5 times as much radiative forcing as carbon dioxide. However, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is a function of temperature, making water vapor a feedback on the climate rather than a forcing driving temperature change on its own. Our carbon dioxide emissions are warming the earth, which causes the atmosphere to hold more water vapor, which then amplifies the initial warming from our carbon dioxide. We have observed this moistening of the atmosphere as a feedback to our greenhouse gas emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of the warming and cooling coming out of and into glacial periods is due to carbon dioxide outgassing from or absorbing into the earth's oceans as a feedback to Milankovitch cycles. Why wouldn't the carbon dioxide we emit warm the earth just as it has done in the geological past and in accordance with the laws of physics? Paleoclimate data suggests that the earth will warm somewhere between 2-4.5°C for a doubling of carbon dioxide.

       hello again, u/paperskyline.... You have just given me your most cogent and coherent arguments for your position... will you do me a favor and give me your favorite links that prove or give evidence for the spectral flux at the top of the atmosphere and the longwave radiative forcing?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my skeptical viewpoint, I think it is possible that these ideas can prove the case in your mind, while invalidating it in the minds of doubters. I am speaking of Occam's Razor, here, which I would argue is less kind to your concept of the complex behaviors of CO2, than my concept of heat being a function of mass. Granted, we are dealing with input heat in the form of electromagnetic radiation (but mass does still apply). Still, I cannot qualify any input of heat into the Earth's atmosphere (primary offenders being solar radiation and  geothermal/volcanic activities as being a known, or even a constant (key point here). In this sense, while we know that atmospheric vapor retention increases with temperature, the relationship between CO2 levels and atmospheric vapor are correlated, but not provably causally related. The fact of the matter is that hotter air holds more vapor, the CO2 argument is independent of that truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, gimme your best links for that stuff, and I promise that I will consider the information with an open mind and give it some to register time before I respond... Cheers!

       is a graph of the spectral flux at the top of the atmosphere. It plots the inverse wavelength of light against the amount of that wavelength. The red line is what earth actually emits from its surface and the green is the wavelengths of light actually escaping to space. The difference between the two is due to the absorption of infrared wavelengths by greenhouse gases. The various greenhouse gases are named above their contribution and you can see the rather large impact of carbon dioxide near the peak wavelength of light emitted by earth.

       is a good paper discussing earth's energy budget. Figure 1 is the same thing shown above and when you take the difference between the two lines you get the radiative forcing impact at the top of the atmosphere, which is Figure 2 in the paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the energy from absorbing infrared wavelengths by greenhouse gases goes to warming the local atmospheric layer and the rest is reemitted as infrared in a random direction, some of it being redirected down to the surface. So at the surface we can also see the impact of various greenhouse gases on temperature.

       The problem I have with it is this. The BASIC idea of science is that you should be able to test your hypothesis. The best we currently have is correlations, but you cannot attribute causation. One of the MOST BASIC concepts of statistics is that correlation does not imply causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the only real way we have to test the impact humans have on climate is to run long term computer simulations. These simulations are built to model the climate, thus allowing the people to try out other variables to test their effects. This is where my issue comes in...
      </p>
      <p>
       These models are designed using a myriad of known variables to simulate our planet. A model is only ever a model, and should never be mistaken for the real thing (I.E. a globe that models the Earth is not the Earth itself... no shit!) I will go in with good faith and assume that these are built with the intention to best model the many variables and systems that affect global climate (and not to create a desired outcome), but there is absolutely ZERO way for them to account for unknown variables. Let's take this a step further though, and assume that those unknown variables (as unknowable as they are) would only have a minute and negligible effect on the results of these simulations, we still have nearly no way to test the validity of these systems in a long term simulation. You would have to run a simulation over the next few hundred years, then wait to see if the results match the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, these models are software. I personally work in software and have been responsible for modeling a number of MUCH simpler systems and know first hand that no matter how much care and effort you put into a model, it will never be 100% accurate unless it is a VERY simple concept. Approaching something as massive as modeling ALL OF THE SYSTEMS that can affect a planet's climate, those inaccuracies will compound as you piece them together into the greater model.
      </p>
      <p>
       We CAN run them with known historic data pulled from ice cores and tweak them so the results will inevitably match our current climate, but that is like starting with answers and looking for the right questions to make them correct. That is not science, but a self fulfilling prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am running out of time here, so I will try to sum this up as best I can... If you cannot PERSONALLY test the results of an experiment yourself, no matter how much you trust the source, you are still working on faith. I would gamble that 98% of global warming advocates are working on faith, and have zero scientific background or understanding beyond those basic correlations that most people are presented with to convince them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can compound this doubt by throwing in human error, confirmation bias, greed for more grant money, or any number of arguments that attempt paint climate scientists in a poor light, but I don't even really think that is necessary. Science is being able to test outcomes yourself, faith is trusting people who claim to be authorities on a topic.

       As far as I can tell, our climate isn't and never was a stable system. Trying to turn it into one seems as hopeless as kicking water uphill.

       No shit. Variables such as land use change also play a very large role. This planet used to be covered with ancient forests until we cut most of them down.

       And yet, its cycles can be detected in core samples - the same samples that show we've changed the environment far faster than any natural process ever has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are natural cycles. But they usually take thousands of years to occur - during which time species adapt to the changing conditions. But the rate of change is so fast now that there is no time for natural selection to keep up.

       Only a very few times in the past have things like this happened - and they are closely linked to mass extinction events, and were caused by massive volcanic eruptions or asteroid impacts, events that could not be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time, we are the cause, and we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       avoid most of the damage.

       The last time such a massive climate shift happened was roughly 12,000 years ago. What event caused this planet to shift so quickly out of that glaciation period? The best anyone can guess was an impact event in the ocean. Water vapor is actually one of the most prevalent greenhouse gases and triggers a worse positive feedback loop than CO2 does.
      </p>
      <p>
       We actually live in a time that things like asteroid impact actually CAN be avoided if we have an early enough lead time to act. I would rather we put more money and effort towards preventing that, since a impact in over 70% of the earths surface could trigger one of those catastrophic climate change/mass extinction events. I know it doesn't have to be one over the other, but one is potentially an immediate threat will the other come of as high minded rhetoric that is politicized to justify additional taxes and costly regulation.

       Climate Change:

      <p>
       An overreaction by "scientists" about the natural cycles of the earth's various climates, which change drastically over hundreds, thousands or millions of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the earth, "climate change" science is very new. Yes there are a lot of human beings on the planet and we do a lot of crazy things, but the earth will gladly shake us off like the parasites we are when we become a serious problem.

       Poles shift, mountains get formed, shit happens. Observing it is fine, going on wild speculations with a total lack of sample size on the matter is just something I don't agree with.

       are carbon dioxide levels over the past ~20,000 years. Compare the slow natural rise in carbon dioxide over thousands of years which caused much of the warming coming out of the last glacial period to the rapid spike in co2 since the industrial revolution. Not only are co2 levels substantially higher than they have been for millions of years but the current rate of increase in co2 is more than a hundred times as fast as the fastest rates of change seen in the ice core record. That rapid spike in co2 (and other greenhouse gases) from human activities is causing the earth to warm up more than ten times as fast as the rate of warming coming out of the last glacial period.

       Although there is a huge spike within the last 2,000 years, 20k years is still not a big sample when it comes to the age of the earth and how long these processes take or how often they occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, co2 levels were already on a steady upward trend long before the industrial evolution according to this data.

       That huge spike on the right side of the graph came after the industrial revolution, not before it. That is a liitle more clear if we zoom in further to

       . The increase in co2 since the industrial revolution has been proportional to our emissions, with just under half of our emissions staying in the atmosphere.

       The rate of increase over most of the Holocene was around ~0.002 ppm per year. The current rate of increase is over 2 ppm per year, more than a thousand times faster than the background rate of change during the Holocene.

       Warming is just the result of well-understood physics. Certain gases in our atmosphere such as carbon dioxide and water vapor are transparent to sunlight but opaque to the infrared light emitted by earth. Since these gases allow the sun to warm the earth but prevent the earth from cooling itself off to space that keeps the earth much much warmer than it would otherwise be. You can plainly see the impact of greenhouse gases such as co2 on temperature in both the difference between wavelengths of light emitted by earth compared to the wavelengths that actually escape to space and the wavelengths of light that the atmosphere sends back down towards the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide 45% since the industrial revolution. As a result we have observed the enhanced greenhouse effect as a decrease in co2 wavelengths escaping to space and a corresponding increase in co2's radiative forcing at the surface. You can even observe co2's radiative forcing go up and down in lockstep with its concentration in the atmosphere exactly like the physics says it should. That shows a direct cause-effect relationship between rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only does this increase in radiative forcing (the amount of energy reaching a square meter of earth per second) dwarf natural forcings on the earth such as the sun or orbital changes, but the patterns of warming also fit what we would expect from greenhouse-induced warming such as nights warming faster than days, the troposphere warming while the stratosphere cools, the tropopause rising, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several reasons why people don't believe in anthropogenic global warming. One would simply be an ignorance of the actual science. There is a huge gap between what most scientists think about anthropogenic warming and what the public thinks. Two, fossil fuel interests have waged a campaign to muddy the waters regarding the subject similar to what Tobacco companies did back in the day. Third, people's political and/or religious ideologies make them unwilling to accept the science. If you are a free market proponent then it is hard to think that the free market will actually be able to combat climate change; better to deny the issue altogether or downplay its significance. And fourth, it has simply become part of how people identify with their 'tribe'. All the people around them think it is fake, so they just go along with the group.
