<p>&quot;The Mall is filled with undercover Mossad Agents, and they work &#39;regular&#39; jobs at the Mall.  They&#39;re janitors, hair stylists, food servers, etc.  I have special security clearances, but only my supervisor knows who exactly the Mossad agents actually are&quot;.</p>

<p>I asked him why they are there and he said he didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>To give you some perspective..The Mall of America is right next to the International Airport and Minneapolis has a large Somali population.  In fact, it&#39;s the number one place in the U.S. for ISIS recruits.  I&#39;ve had no further conversations with him, but I speculate that the Mossad, and maybe elements within the FBI, are in cahoots to train and brainwash some Somali young men to become &#39;terrorists&#39;. Though, it still doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.</p>

<p>On another note Mossad/Israel training/funding ISIS gets the U.S. into wars with countries that surround Israel to do the fighting, clearing out, genociding for Israel.....they can then either swoop in and look for/extract Oil (Golan Heights) or install a puppet dictator controlled by them to make sure no one around them ever gets nukes or too powerful</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop and think for awhile.  If you never wore shoes the bottoms of your feet would become thicker, calloused and less sensitivity to pain of stepping on pebbles or whatever.  If you always protect that skin and never let it be abused it would be soft and far more sensitive than even someone who wore shoes most of the time but walked barefoot at home.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing.  Those who were circumcisedbas adults can tell you the difference. Logic can as well.</p>

<p>Look also ay the anatomy of other male mammals.  Cats, dogs, horses, sheep all have protective sheaths.  I used to have to clean the pilled up dirt clumps from the inside of the sheath on my gelding.</p>

<p>And look at this article.  Science understands the importance of the foreskin so much that when the equivalent on animals is damaged they seek to repair it.  It is never cut away if it can be helped.</p>

<p>[ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY OF THE PENILE AND CLITORAL PREPUCE IN PRIMATES</p>

<p>An Evolutionary Perspective of the Specialised Sensory Tissue of the External Genitalia](<a href="http://cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-mcgrath/">http://cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-mcgrath/</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the changes in sexual behaviour, it has been shown that an infant&#39;s response to pain can be altered for years as a consequence of circumcision.31-32 As noted by Taddio, &quot;postsurgical central sensitization (allodynia and hyperalgesia) can extend to sites of the body distal from the wound,&quot; suggesting a supraspinal effect.33 How the central nervous system is altered in humans to account for these behavioural changes is not understood, but in addition to central nervous system changes, peripheral nervous system damage is also exhibited by loss of the preputial corpuscular receptors and by amputation neuromas at the circumcision scar.34 This is consistent with the large numbers of nerve bundles in the male prepuce, which range from 6/nm dorsally to 18/nm ventrally. Although Taddio&#39;s work suggests a central nervous system change, it is unclear whether circumcision alters sexual behaviour by central nervous system changes, local sensory alterations of the external genitalia or a combination of both central and peripheral nervous system changes. Alteration in penile sensitivity most likely explains the sexual behaviour alteration associated with circumcision. <strong><em>Because of the sexual behaviour changes associated with circumcision, veterinary medicine avoids circumcising breeding stock and carefully repairs preputial damage.35 Non-human primate breeding programs do not use circumcision.</em></strong></p>

<p>Circumcision reduces sensation.  The foreskin prevents desensitation of the penis by protecting the glans (especially in the current day, where clothing can often rub against it).  Removing the foreskin serves no hygienic purpose if we assume you regularly shower, but it does A) Protect the glans (as I stated before) and B) provide an environment that allows natural processes protect the natural Ph balance of the skin of the glans, preventing harmful bacteria and drying.</p>

<p>You are saying that you believe the foreskin is useless, but I would counter that argument by pointing out that it is the result of millions of years of evolution.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand people who still defend the mutilation of babies genitals without consent, especially when the practice is just a holdover from religious times where people were unable to live as hygienically as we do today.</p>

<p>All other forms of religious genital mutilation is clearly attributable to the effort to curtail sexual pleasure in order to more stringently enforce religious puritanical tyranny.  Why in the world do you believe circumcision to be anything different?   </p>

<p>&quot;When a guy is uncircumcised, moisture can get trapped between his penis and his foreskin, creating the ideal environment for bacteria to incubate.&quot;</p>

His dad wouldn&#39;t even consider a discussion at the time and as my doctor had finally convinced me I was wrong and not having a boy I didn&#39;t come armed with info like I did on vaccines.  That and I had almost bled to death when they f*cked up the emergency c section and then knocked out the epidural so I was extra groggy being only recently awake when they start pushing circumcision and bottles!!</p>

<p>I swear they take advantage of us when they have us doped up wracking up more services to bill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again it all goes into hygiene. I and many people I know who are uncircumcised never have had these problems or will. Wanna know why? We&#39;re clean. It takes 3 seconds.</p>

<p>If you wanna go down the religion road why not allow female circumcision while you&#39;re at it? It&#39;s all opinions but really comes down to hygiene like everything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Female circumcision has nothing to do with it. We&#39;re talking useless skin vs. clitoris. </p>

<p>Hygiene is fine, but how about reduced risk of penile cancer, STDs, UTIs, and cervical cancer? Seems to outweigh anything else.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The overall risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later on.</p></li>
<li><p>Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.
Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.</p></li>
<li><p>Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it&#39;s less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.</p></li>

<p>Again all things having to do with hygiene. Why is it so hard to stay clean that you need to cut your skin off? I work outside and sweat and yet NONE of this has happened to me or my father or his father or their wives. Why? Because we clean our best friend everyday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha the foreskin isn&#39;t useless, during intercourse it acts as a gliding sheath and when flaccid it prevents the glans from drying out and protects against abrasions (both of which protect sensation).</p>

<p>Sexual organs are pretty much by definition the most evolved part of our bodies because they&#39;ve been functionally implicit to reproduction since before we became fucking mammals. There&#39;s nothing random or useless about their morphology.</p>

<p>I understand the psychological coping mechanism that would inspire thus disfigured to decide that, actually, it&#39;s an improvement! But it&#39;s self-delusion and you&#39;re perpetuating a barbaric practice by championing it.</p>

<p>As for women--you can&#39;t really tell the difference once erect, except that an uncircumcised penis won&#39;t have a band of scar tissue or a high chance of pointing fucking sideways. The &quot;ew uncircumcised&quot; meme is present in American sitcoms, but is and always was propaganda. Circumcision is actually very rare globally.</p>

<p>Having &quot;America&quot; in the name of a business doesn&#39;t qualify it for federal law enforcement presence. I&#39;ll not only be amazed that you learn it has any...I&#39;ll wonder how deep on the shit list an agent of any enforcement arm of the Feds has to reach to be assigned there. </p>

<p>By the way, it&#39;s been reported that Mall of America security does do terrorist recognition training offered by Israelis, so that could be how this legend got started, (if it&#39;s indeed a legend and terrorist-fighting federal agents once of blurred TV show fame aren&#39;t really policing a local mall).</p>

<p>What if it were her first day of work and she was just trying to overachieve so she could keep her job?  Or what if it were a girl on the autism spectrum trying to figure out how to handle herself around strangers?

<p>Why doesn&#39;t it? If we keep seeing terror attack committed in the name of Islam, then we side w/ the neocons and Israel on our view of the world, the &quot;civilization war&quot;. It helps do create havoc in any nation state, weakening them, and we may get killed and bomb their ennemy (as we have been doing for all the middle east wars). </p>

<p>There is also a fantastic job of using the religion (which is indeed dangerous) as a tool to trigger civil war and replace nationalism, socialism, atheism or whatever by fanatism which will break down  states (except Iran which is already a theocracy) and be a new incentive to bomb them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always get laughed out of the room for saying this but here it goes. Usually people who migrate to the u.s are considered &quot;first generation&quot; these people tend to have the hardest time culturally to adapt to new places and accept their ideals. The problem with places like some areas in Minnesota is that the males tend to fly back to their home countries to take wives then come back here with them sometimes with children, recycling the first generation ideals back into the mix. It keeps the society there at a standstill growth wise, and has the young people there influenced by birth ideals from a place they aren&#39;t from creating that higher overturn of people who return back to their countries to be fighters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have read and understand, it is actually 2nd generation that tend to be at higher risk of terrorism recruitment. First generation immigrants are honestly too busy just trying to make a living to really assimilate much at all. My grandparents, for example, immigrated from south america, never learned english because they had work 2-3 jobs at a time to keep their kids fed. My wife works with immigrant/refugee kids actually, and it is the same thing with these families today--the parents and older siblings are not really able to assimilate much without educational opportunities and end up just working at a factory or wherever.</p>

<p>Second generation though you have kids who are immersed enough in their new country&#39;s culture to be fully educated, but who also have a yearning for their &quot;home&quot; country. Not sure what your background is, but being multi-racial myself, there is something hard to describe with the feeling of being a minority and feeling disconnected from your roots. These kids are in all likelihood still economically disadvantaged, and have probably encountered racism/bigotry since a young age, in addition to feeling out of place here. That&#39;s what makes someone vulnerable to become a terrorist, and that&#39;s who terrorist groups (and FBI) target, because they can play off of those vulnerabilities and they can romanticize the idea of terrorism and paint it as part of their heritage or something, since it is something the 2nd gen person has never witnessed or really experienced. It is similar to how gang recruitment works....give someone something they can feel like they belong in and you can manipulate them to do anything, really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little context here goes a long way for people who are confused. 
Agents in malls all over the country not just the mall of america. Lots of evidence of this is you look into it enough some of the events around 9/11 mentioned &quot;zoomcopter&quot; kiosks around the country. Was actually a front company for intelligence communities.</p>

<p>These are secret agents of our allies or of our own country. They are looking for bad guys for sure, but why is the question. Well it&#39;s simple when you realize how many lies are being spread everyday. The agents are simply eyes on the public. Everyone is so paranoid about their agency&#39;s lies getting discovered they have secret agents everywhere. The reason they need eyes everywhere is because the lies are so large. Now by my username you may wonder what I&#39;m talking about and instead of actually saying it here. I&#39;ll leave that part to your imagination. But pretty much everything you know is a lie. Unless you have seen it with your own 2 eyes , and in person, I would consider it a lie.</p>

<p>No. The reason they have people everywhere is because it makes it difficult to surveil the few agents who are actually up to no good. The rest are there to distract investigators by acting as decoys.</p>

<p>If you go to any of them, there are undercover agents and goons everywhere looking out for threats.  This isn&#39;t really rocket science. If you fly on a plane, chances are there is an Air Marshal on the flight.</p>

<p>There is no conspiracy here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have read and understand, it is actually 2nd generation that tend to be at higher risk of terrorism recruitment. First generation immigrants are honestly too busy just trying to make a living to really assimilate much at all. My grandparents, for example, immigrated from south america, never learned english because they had work 2-3 jobs at a time to keep their kids fed. My wife works with immigrant/refugee kids actually, and it is the same thing with these families today--the parents and older siblings are not really able to assimilate much without educational opportunities and end up just working at a factory or wherever.</p>

<p>Second generation though you have kids who are immersed enough in their new country&#39;s culture to be fully educated, but who also have a yearning for their &quot;home&quot; country. Not sure what your background is, but being multi-racial myself, there is something hard to describe with the feeling of being a minority and feeling disconnected from your roots. These kids are in all likelihood still economically disadvantaged, and have probably encountered racism/bigotry since a young age, in addition to feeling out of place here. That&#39;s what makes someone vulnerable to become a terrorist, and that&#39;s who terrorist groups (and FBI) target, because they can play off of those vulnerabilities and they can romanticize the idea of terrorism and paint it as part of their heritage or something, since it is something the 2nd gen person has never witnessed or really experienced. It is similar to how gang recruitment works....give someone something they can feel like they belong in and you can manipulate them to do anything, really. </p>
