        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">248</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The Intelligence Community&#39;s Disposition Matrix is Racist</strong></p>

<p>The New left wants equality:</p>

<ul>
<li>For women</li>
<li>For all genders</li>
<li>For all sexual preferences</li>
<li>For all races</li>
<li>For all religions</li>
<li>For all creeds</li>
<li>For all substance usages, preferences</li>
<li>For all religious clothing preferences</li>
<li>For all dietary choices</li>
<li>For all lifestyles, recreational choices, habits</li>
</ul>

<p>And yet each of these things are being micromonitored by the state and put on a threat-assessment.  If you are black, you are considered a higher threat than a white.  If you are male you are a higher threat assessment than a female.  If you are a Muslim, you are a higher threat assessment than a Christian, unless you have a bullhorn and a stack of bibles in your home and you&#39;ve been visting the local university to request a permit to acesss the student union (ie: you&#39;re an evangelical provocateur unwelcome on campus).  If you believe in Scientology you&#39;re a bigger threat than an Atheist.</p>

<p>If you smoke you&#39;re a bigger threat than if you don&#39;t.  If you have tatoos you&#39;re a bigger threat than those who don&#39;t.  If you&#39;ve attended a Wicca meeting you may be a bigger or lesser threat depending on which political party is running the Threat Assessment Software at the time the assessment is made.  If you are a vegan, you&#39;re a larger threat than if you aren&#39;t (they want you to eat industry&#39;s milk and industry&#39;s meat and get cancer and weird diseases and be unhealthy---each industry makes money off you at every stage of your life).</p>

<p>They consider you more of a target (threat to their money) if you are gay depending on who is running the software; as well as whether you are a political enemy or not.  Or if you are gay AND use drugs or not, which many do (club scene)--by the numbers.  They consider you a threat (to their money) and make you a target if you are on disability.</p>

<p>All of these things make one a target for a cyber-harassment campaign.</p>

<p>If you complain about the CIA, or FBI or are critical in any way of the Government or a public figure within the government, or the deep state or a member of the political elite---especially on REDDIT or VOAT, and write God-bothering essays almost every day, then you set yourself up as a target.  Usually though, people only engage in this activity as a RESULT of realizing heuristically and by evidence they&#39;ve been targetted already.  It makes people crazy.  Their only empowering response is to fight back with information warfare.  It&#39;s just some are better at it than others, and as we&#39;ve seen, keyboard warriors--long considered lumpen trolls--have changed the course of history.  President Trump being evidence that people can block a wicked war witch and criminal from becoming POTUS.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>What is Cyber-harassment</strong></p>

<p>This is a sampling of things that tightly-integrated big-data systems and Disposition Matrix software can accomplish, causing degradation of someone&#39;s life, leading to them to social isolation with the hopes of eventually killing themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li>Degrading people&#39;s communications</li>
<li>Aggressively interrupting voice communication</li>
<li>Sending important inbound phone calls to voicemail, from prospective employers</li>
<li>Delaying or silently dropping emails</li>
<li>Flagging emails as spam putting legit emails into spam (for example someone in contact list)</li>
<li>Constantly flagging legit credit card purchases as fraud</li>
<li>Delaying / dropping / losing US mail, esp Voter Registration or Absentee Ballots</li>
<li>DDOS attacks on your computer equipment (ex: bitcoin miner) that appear to be from various other countries  (why is china/russia attacking my computer, I&#39;m John Q. Shouldn&#39;t Matter to Them)
*</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Can Numbers be Racist?</strong></p>

<p>One would expect this system would cause outrage.  But the justification that is thrown up as a kind of social justice hypocrisy firewall is the idea that all of this Disposition Matrix is simply run &quot;by the numbers&quot;.  It&#39;s fed historical and live data from police districts all over the world.  It&#39;s vaccuming massive amounts of data from Bureau of Prisons, from private security firms like Infragard, USGIS, FBI, JTTF Fusion Centers; purchase data from large retailers; your amazon shopping cart; to build this &quot;perspective&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can numbers be racist?  How can a system be racist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, first of all raw numbers ignore policy and culture, but that&#39;s for a longer essay.  Somehow, we can&#39;t even get beyond the numbers because there is this aggressive defense of the Establishment that&#39;s based on a very poor read of History and a very poor relationship that the New-Left has towards <em>actual</em> social justice and <em>actual</em> criminal justice</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, <strong><em>if someone isn&#39;t doing anything wrong, but they just happen to be political enemies of the prevailing party that is in power, is social or criminal justice being done when they are targetted and harassed by software in various ways?  The answer is a resounding NO.  But try to tell the New-LEft that.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Threat Assessment</strong></p>

<p>With that in mind, instead of the New-Left lashing out to their neighbors--who ought to have a right to make judgments and have opinions of their own, opinions that don&#39;t really affect others--they should take a deep look in the mirror instead and ask themselves why they are supporting a biggoted system that treats EVERY EQUALLY as UNEQUAL.</p>

<p>Because under this system, NO ONE is a match for some kind of assumed ideal-person a &quot;Perfect individual&quot; with a very low threat assessment: A perfect orwellian white anglo saxon protestant christian churchgoing technoserf that is both highly skilled and politically inactive, stable at work and personal finances, borrowing lots of money for the biggest house he can just barely unafford, who has perfect hair and teeth, is charismatic and never talks politics--only fashion; someone who follows all the rules without question and never talks about the rules and never wants anything to change and wants everyone to be just like him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There IS a new left.  I&#39;m a liberal.  I supported Bernie and I didn&#39;t vote because there were not choices I could get behind in the ballot.  I probably would have voted Trump though, if my absentee ballot had arrived in the mail, which it did NOT.  I called about it and they did send it out, I did not receive it.  (see essay above). </p>

<p>Now why didn&#39;t I drive 1.5 hrs to my polling place (i&#39;m in the mountains)?  I didn&#39;t want to be turned away because they had sent an absentee.  I wasn&#39;t about to drive 3 hrs to NOT be able to vote for a candidate I was only going to vote for to BLOCK Hillary, because she is a criminal, for &gt;3 decades a criminal.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll never be a democrat ever again.  I believe in all those things a liberal believes, except I actually believe it instead of being a hypocrite about it.  I believe a criminal should go to jail.  Hillary is a criminal.  Sanders may be also.  All these politicians that are breaking the law need to be in jail.  </p>

<p>As far as we can tell Trump has broken no laws but if he has then we should look at that also.  </p>

<p>The &quot;new Left&quot; I&#39;m referring to are the millenials that are having women protests and sufferages protests (why!?? WHY??  they can already vote!); and attacking people who supported trump as &#39;fascist nazis&quot; and have been censoring people all over social media and attacking people.</p>

<p>This is to whom I&#39;m referring.  I don&#39;t understand your &#39;neoconservative shills&#39; comment, unless you&#39;re saying that they are &#39;provocateuring&#39; which...may possibly be the case if you also included neoliberal political elite Soros and Bryzinski into this equation as in GHWB, CHeney, SOros, Bryzinski and Obama have all been working togther.  I could see that.</p>

<p>This is literally a fight between the public and the industrialists and they are using the media to gaslight everyone. It&#39;s just the bigges casualties are the people from California who are either young or unstudious or both--they are the ones that are being fooled the most by this and being inculcated into this New Left I&#39;m referring to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While many expected the low favorability ratings of the two candidates and the divisiveness of this election year to keep young voters home, 2016 saw similar rates of young adult turnout as 2012. On election day, Hillary Clinton won the youth vote (55 percent) while Donald Trump only garnered the support of 37 percent of the millennial electorate. Comparatively, in 2012, young adults voted for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by 60 percent to 37 percent.</p>

By the same token, it is your free will to go create a beautiful reality for yourself and society where people are free to creatively express themselves in the manner of their choose and you don&#39;t have to worry about some controlling entity putting thoughts in your head. Time isn&#39;t linear; it is just our consciousness that projects onto a linear timeline - really we are constantly choosing the timeline we end up in every moment.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the law of free will is also called the law of confusion because we must be able to doubt the idea that we are One with creation. If we knew this, there would be no reason to do anything that would harm others, and thus you would not have the free will to choose a service to self type path. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m capturing the concept exactly correctly, but close enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, everyone is rooted to the here and now. In fact, that is all that exists. But think of it this way, at each moment you have a number of different choices. For example, you could choose to cook a healthy meal, or you could choose to go buy some unhealthy fast food. If you cook the meal, you will probably end up feeling better when you have the nutrients from that meal  nourishing you. Then lets say someone does something that annoys you. Because you feel pretty good from that nice meal, you don&#39;t react in a mean way. But if you were not feeling well from the fast food meal you might snap at that person, creating a negative reaction in that person. </p>

<p>My point is that while you may not be able to &quot;hop timelines&quot;, you are constantly choosing whether to go &quot;left or right&quot; in the moment you have. When your choices line up with the universal will, they will snowball and you will find yourself in positions where it is easier and easier to make the desirable choices. But how do you know what that is? The key to knowing is acceptance and inner reflection. If you can accept your situation as it is in this moment, you can better understand the steps you need to change the parts that you do not desire. This takes meditating on the uncomfortable parts of your life, and accepting them for how they are. Because if you look hard enough, you can find that the uncomfortable parts exist as a consequence of actions you have taken in the past. So while you may not be able to change those consequences immediately, you can start with baby steps that will take you to the desired outcome eventually. Acceptance is a wonderful tool though, because it allows you to not get overwhelmed in the moment so that you can continue on the path of your choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer, no. But think about it, they are not an agency that is around to do good. Ideally they are around to spy on and provide intelligence on threats to our country. So if they provide good intell and it is used to stop a terrorist attack you will likely never know. </p>

<p>In a perfect world we don&#39;t need to spy on other countries, we don&#39;t live in a perfect world. In a perfect world there would be no nuclear weapons, but now that they exist we have to keep a few for the deterrence factor. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take this as a defence of the CIA, they have done a lot of terrible things. To our own citizens as well as foreign citizens. Changes need to be made for sure. But I dont think eliminating the CIA is possible, or the answer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, my absentee ballot (for the primaries) also didn&#39;t come in the mail. Perhaps my mistake was &quot;liking&quot; bernie on facebook earlier in the year? I was assured that it was just a coincidence, that these things get lost in the mail &quot;all the time&quot; (actually the words of one of the ballot workers who I talked on the phone with). </p>

<p>I ended up getting a replacement ballot sent to me which I only had 1 day to fill out (got it two days before election day). Because I got it so close they told me to send it directly to the polling place in order for them to count it. I overnighted it (25 dollars shipping) and lo and behold, the tracking on the shipment said it couldn&#39;t be delivered on election day, because the address that they specifically told me to send it to was &quot;closed&quot;. So the post office wasn&#39;t informed that the polling place was open on the election day. Give me a break. I called the absentee ballot guy again and he told me they got someone to specifically go to the post office to get my ballot. I thought that sounded strange; surely I wasn&#39;t the only person this happened to? I emailed him to make sure they got ALL the ballots that would have otherwise been undelivered, which he replied they did. </p>

<p>Needless to say I no longer have a facebook, and I didn&#39;t vote in the main election. Of course now I realize that our &quot;democracy&quot; is a joke, we don&#39;t actually have a democracy - maybe the main election isn&#39;t rigged but if the primaries leading up to them are, you are choosing between falsely selected candidates. I know Tim Canova and others got cheated out of their local elections, too, so it makes me wonder if any of our elections are actually fair? Presumably some of the local ones (at least in small counties)? </p>

<p>And yes, you are correct that the young are the most fooled. I was somewhat fooled to a degree due to the massive echo chamber my facebook had created for me. My posts about wikileaks and chemtrails were being censored without my knowledge (although I suspected something was up) while I kept being fed articles posted from buzzfeed, huffpo, etc (ie liberal propaganda). After supporting Ron Paul my senior year in high school I became more liberal believing in good things government spending could do (in theory at least), mostly due to the liberal friends I associated with in college. Funny thing is after getting red pilled by the dnc leaks and the blatant vote swapping in last year&#39;s primaries (then reading more about conspiracies and realizing we literally live in the matrix), I now realize Ron Paul was right about practically everything. But I also realize I would not be at the point where I am now if I had not deleted my facebook. The mind control echo chamber is quite strong, after deleting my facebook I was forced to look for my own sources of info and found that the world we live in is far more interesting than we are led to believe. But unfortunately my friends are currently gobbling up the Sessions and Flynn must resign because of Russian ties BS, or whatever the latest ShareBlue narrative is. I&#39;ve learned now not to red pill these people when they aren&#39;t ready for it because they just get angry and defensive, and completely shut out any receptivity to the information. </p>

<p>And yes, Its_a_bad_time makes a good point that millenials called bs on clinton and that they are fighting for truly progressive candidates. The problem is that, even though they think they are fighting for progressive values, they are doing this within a false context of left vs right manufactured by the media and govt propoganda machines. They may think they are unaffected by this because they reject the narratives, but they don&#39;t realize that tehy are framing their choices and beliefs within the narrow window given created by the media. For example, as soon as Bernie lost they said stuff like &quot;oh well he had no chance anyway, time to campaign for Clinton!&quot; or &quot;he really could have run a better campaign, now we have to get Clinton to win because Trump would be a disaster&quot;. They actually believed the narrative the Trump is this fascist bogeyman coming to destroy our country and that the primary was legitimate. Despite the mountain of evidence that I showed them that the primary was rigged, I was able to convince no one (that wasn&#39;t already predisposed to believing it) that it actually was. It&#39;s like 9/11 - the story is full of holes but people are too afraid at looking at the possibility that our government gives no fucks about us to not believe the mainstream narrative.</p>

<p>From my observations I think it seems to be this deep set fear of letting go of one&#39;s belief systems. Our media is completely controlled (music industry, art, film, etc), our science is watered down and funded almost exclusively for defense or industry related projects only, our politics is a circus, and our media is one giant corporate advertising apparatus. People don&#39;t want believe any of that is true because that would mean their entire lives are based on lies; their careers are based on a belief that what they are doing is good for the country or the people around them and it is too much to believe that they are just cogs in the machine. People are waking up to the corruption, though, so I think slipping in the red pills a little at at time is the way to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were only two realistic options in the general election, the Democratic nominee Clinton or the Republican nominee Trump. As the Democratic platform aligns closer to the left than the Republican platform(which is incredibly right wing) any abstention or vote for a third party would in essence be a vote <em>against</em> the left, correct? </p>

<p>As much as Clinton was a less than ideal candidate her platform still matched up closer with &quot;leftism&quot; than the Republican platform. Unfortunately America is stuck with a two-party system so you really just have to hold your nose and vote for the most left-wing candidate that has a chance at winning which was Clinton. </p>

I had not much against Trump politically until he promised all these fascist policies (aside from him being a living brand involved in poisonous industries, a guy with gold seatbelt clips in his personal helicopter), and I did not feel comfortable trading a possible brief economic bump for all the social anguish all but promised. </p>

<p>Some truth to these criticisms. Thing is, it&#39;s as broad a generalization as you claim they are making. See, the right complains about name calling from the left, but then go calling all leftists as SJW beta cucks. It goes both ways.</p>

<p>Not <em>all</em> people on the left sling shit like that just as <em>not all</em> people on the right do. It&#39;s extremely disingenuous to paint either small faction of either side as the majority.  There are SJW beta cucks. There&#39;s also real facists on the right. So... yeah.</p>

<p>The new left then is really the liberal faction of the CIA.
That seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur.</p>

facepalm over this. You don&#39;t see the gaslighting happening to you.</p>

<p>See this is where I disagree.

    <div class="md"><p>Answer: The New Left are violent totalitarians that want absolute control over everything thought, action and idea.  They are exactly like the Alt Right.  The only difference between the two are how they lie to their constituencies and what they lie about.  They have the same goals, however.</p>

<p>Both groups will, if given their way, will murder political opponents.  Its just what totalitarians have always done and will always do.</p>

<p>Very few humans, including Americans, really wan to allow other people to have different beliefs and allow other people to be free.  Most humans view other people&#39;s freedoms and voluntary actions as threats.</p>

<p>Look at all of the history of humanity.  The vast majority of our history is bloodshed, war, murder, genocide perpetuated by Kings, Dictators, Emperors (people with absolute power).</p>

<p>This little short lived experiment of &quot;freedom&quot; in the USA is a total abnormality for humanity.</p>

<p>What we are watching, right before our eyes, is humanity returning to its normal, brutal, violent, murderous state.</p>

<p>And its pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re upset with what?  Profiling exists for a reason.  There&#39;s patterns amongst people that are tell-tale signs of what they are, who they are, and what they could be capable of.  Is it perfect? No. Is it Minority Report level Precrime shit? No.  But it does work.  Whether someone is intentionally being messed with...who knows.  You stated that you live in the mountains but it seems you want all of the same benefits of living in the city (good cell service, good usps service).  Well, tough shit buddy.  You want to live off the grid, you&#39;re going to notice things don&#39;t run smooth as water.  Anecdotal experience doesn&#39;t prove anything. </p>

<p>And while there is a Left extreme, it is hardly the all-encompassing bubble you&#39;re describing all millennials and liberals as being under.  Left-leaning liberals still want equality for everyone, for everyone to have the same opportunity, and while you&#39;re absolutely correct about not lashing out at neighbors for having an opinion, it is completely wrong to think that their opinions don&#39;t affect others.  Their opinions are half, if not more, of the reason why the Left is up in arms.  Their opinions on Gay marriage, abortion, environmental issues are the reason that people are up in arms because their opinions are strewn throughout American policy and the way of life.  I&#39;d appreciate it a lot more if people would just keep their opinions to themselves.  if they don&#39;t want gays marrying, don&#39;t go to a gay wedding.  Don&#39;t want abortion? Fine, don&#39;t get one, but keep your opinion out of my world.  That is the point that this Leftist has been trying to make for a long time.</p>

<p>And,  If the CIA is looking at you, specifically, maybe there&#39;s a reason?  Maybe you&#39;ve done some shit, and that&#39;s why you&#39;re in the mountains, I don&#39;t know?  But the world doesn&#39;t revolve around you, or me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;new&quot; part about the &quot;New Left&quot; is that they are a more libertarian approach to dem socialism and social equality, like the greens. Remember, Bernie supported your right to bear arms...and put what you want in your body. Its just like the original new left (60s) except less brainwashed by cold war propaganda and more brainwashed by the propaganda of and by the old new left when they got to the age that they made children&#39;s media for the new generation celebrating equality and environmentalism (among other things obviously). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the new left is a bunch of useful idiots herded into a giant thought ghetto by well paid purposeful thought engineers who pay all sorts of opinion makers and opinion spreaders to control this so called group of &#39;leftists&#39;. </p>

<p>this is a lost cause . the people chomsky and other actual intellectuals used to speak to used to have a the capacity for critical thought . now there are throngs of useful idiots that drown out any useful discussion and they worship the paid thought engineers, most of whom are professors in university, famous actors/entertainers and other perosnalities that are worshiped and thoughtlessly followed by younger folks with no critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>oh yea, then there is control of intentionally deceptive media outlets whose job it is to hoodwink the left into supporting endless war. hbo/vicenews/cnn/cnbc people like bill maher and john oliver. if you are listening to them and you think youre a leftist or liberal, youre just another useful idiot and that&#39;s why they get paid so well...........</p>

<p>any adult over 30 who has a brain and has heard trevor noah even once, understands the distinigration of discourse is rapidly increasing. the level of thought control is becomign more direct and intentional and obvious. trevor noah is like a kindergarden political brainwashing show for 3 year olds. but that is the average mindset now of a lot of people.............</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s where this has been posted on Investment Watchblog.</p>

<p><a href="https://investmentwatchblog.com/why-is-does-the-new-left-defend-the-cia-its-a-hypocritical-for-a-group-that-values-universal-equality-to-support-a-cia-that-uses-racial-sexualilty-gender-profiling-as-threat-assessment-to-target/">https://investmentwatchblog.com/why-is-does-the-new-left-defend-the-cia-its-a-hypocritical-for-a-group-that-values-universal-equality-to-support-a-cia-that-uses-racial-sexualilty-gender-profiling-as-threat-assessment-to-target/</a></p>

<p>The site&#39;s About section begins with:</p>

<p>&quot;This is the place for people who are pro-capitalism, pro-business, pro-market, truth seeker, and anti-MSM.&quot;</p>

<p>So there&#39;s that. A well written piece that I disagree with 95% of the time, and is propaganda, like some reverse-Teen Vogue article about the Alt Right. I also wonder where OP has found evidence of New Left support for the CIA all of a sudden. Because there hasn&#39;t been a Vault 7 revolt? Because Trump supposedly opposes the CIA (even though he just granted them full drone privileges, probably because he can&#39;t be bothered with the task?) Your post is full of distortions and false equivalencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can disagree about what &quot;many&quot; means.</p>

<p>Non computer scientists were aware of what the CIA was capable of.</p>

<p>My commentary does not concern whether or not people knew about it but rather the way the CIA dictates a narrative to the MSM to help shape public opinion about the Vault7 leaks as well as suppress dialogue concerning the nature and scope of the CIA&#39;s power.</p>
