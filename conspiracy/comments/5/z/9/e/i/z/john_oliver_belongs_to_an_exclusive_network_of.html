        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Include fellow sell outs The Daily Show , Bill Mayer, Chelsea Handler, Colbert, and Samantha Bee. There&#39;s literally an entire comedic talk support network for the deep state . And every one of these personalities employs an army of writers carefully scripting every word. Guarantee they have covert agents issuing talking points in the writer&#39;s room enforcing the latest narrative to spin. And the globalist supporters watch, look no further, and go to sleep felling smug and wise. </p>

<p>Also notice how easy it is to find their latest propaganda memos? </p>

<p>Every show, even the HBO personalities are in my face all over social media with a full high def video free and one click away. </p>

<p>Try posting the latest Walking Dead or Game Of Thrones episode on youtube. Watch how fast the upload get shut down and your account banned/locked.</p>

<p>Some people like to be ostriches with their head buried. Globalist supporters are the one who don&#39;t even realize they can&#39;t see shit. </p>

<p>This club is NOT concerned about improving America or the lives of Americans. They want people feeling smug and self righteous while they watch the wrecking ball hit their communities. </p>

<p>What do you think would happen if one of these hosts had a change of heart and exposed reality?</p>

<p>How fast would the feed get cut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats are currently the only viable method to combating anti-intellectualism in our government and when faced with the dilemma of support politicians that are anti-corruption or taking blood money to continue the status quo, they chose the status quo and they do it over and over and over. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so tired of hearing about the scary Republicans when it&#39;s the Democrats that are actually doing the most damage. </p>

<p>Anyone with two brain cells can tell the Republican approach to our government is short sighted and self defeating.  The Democrats actively lie and manipulate their constituents into thinking they have their best interests at heart when in reality they are just as corrupt if not more so than Republicans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you can only fuck so many women.  Think about this dude&#39;s situation.  He&#39;s in a prime location with the absolute pick of the litter.  He can go to bed with just about any kind of woman on any given night.  How many years does it take before you get bored and develop some kind of weird perversion?  It&#39;s not a good situation.  That&#39;s probably why you see celebs getting caught with trannies n shit like that.  The pussy is plentiful, but becomes too easy for them.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find out Maher has some darker secrets hidden there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientists for the past 20 years or so have gone with the party that has the best (in their opinion) stance on climate change. Look all around the world you will see the same thing time and time again. They must feel threatened when people says stuff like &quot;the chinese invented climate change&quot; and in my opinion rightly so. </p>

<p>They would literally be betraying their profession if they sided with the candidate that had this stance.  &quot;Turkeys voting for thanksgiving&quot; springs to mind.</p>
