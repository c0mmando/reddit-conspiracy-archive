       I read on here Merkel's trip was suspended because of the "Blizzard"...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in NYC today, borough of Queens, by the beach...today's event went something like this (hopefully someone else in NYC today can add to this) :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Small flurries begin around 11P.M. and steadily progresses into full Snowfall accompanied by high winds (some reports stated winds at about 60 mph; I cannot verify those speeds but can state experiencing some fairly high winds) at approximately 3 A.M.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After about 6 A.M., Snowfall begins to turn into hail/rain...steadily turning into rain; gusts of wind remain consistent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         10 A.M. heavy/dark clouds begin to dissipate...overcast still present (Sun is not visible, however daylight pierces through)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Current observation as of 2:07 P.M. (EST), light rainfall (not to be confused with drizzling rain), heavy winds have calmed to lighter winds and the overall status of NYC'S "BLIZZARD" has become just a rainy day
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I should state again that I'm right by the coast. If I look outside, I see the ocean.

       Ugh ok I know that everything messes up and breaks all of the time lol I do understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was just that it's odd to see something that is such an important symbol go dark when it wasn't a citywide blackout or something. I mean we don't see the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben randomly going dark although I'm sure at some point it may have happened, it just doesn't seem to have recently according to DuckDuckGo but who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I'm sure I'm just a bit too used to looking for deeper meaning in coincidences, it just gave me an eerie feeling lol that was all I meant.
