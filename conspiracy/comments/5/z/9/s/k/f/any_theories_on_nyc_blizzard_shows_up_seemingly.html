    <div class="md"><p>I read on here Merkel&#39;s trip was suspended because of the &quot;Blizzard&quot;... </p>

<p>I&#39;m in NYC today, borough of Queens, by the beach...today&#39;s event went something like this (hopefully someone else in NYC today can add to this) : </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Small flurries begin around 11P.M. and steadily progresses into full Snowfall accompanied by high winds (some reports stated winds at about 60 mph; I cannot verify those speeds but can state experiencing some fairly high winds) at approximately 3 A.M. </p></li>
<li><p>After about 6 A.M., Snowfall begins to turn into hail/rain...steadily turning into rain; gusts of wind remain consistent. </p></li>
<li><p>10 A.M. heavy/dark clouds begin to dissipate...overcast still present (Sun is not visible, however daylight pierces through)</p></li>
<li><p>Current observation as of 2:07 P.M. (EST), light rainfall (not to be confused with drizzling rain), heavy winds have calmed to lighter winds and the overall status of NYC&#39;S &quot;BLIZZARD&quot; has become just a rainy day</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I should state again that I&#39;m right by the coast. If I look outside, I see the ocean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh ok I know that everything messes up and breaks all of the time lol I do understand that.</p>

<p>My point was just that it&#39;s odd to see something that is such an important symbol go dark when it wasn&#39;t a citywide blackout or something. I mean we don&#39;t see the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben randomly going dark although I&#39;m sure at some point it may have happened, it just doesn&#39;t seem to have recently according to DuckDuckGo but who knows.</p>

<p>Yes I&#39;m sure I&#39;m just a bit too used to looking for deeper meaning in coincidences, it just gave me an eerie feeling lol that was all I meant. </p>
