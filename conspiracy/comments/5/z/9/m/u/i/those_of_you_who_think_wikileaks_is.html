        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Interested in seeing peoples perspective: </p>

<p>What is your explanation for the fact we&#39;ve gotten leaks since then.  if they had been compromised who is leaking this stuff?  And if its compromised, are the current leaks fake?  Why would a compromised wikileaks, presumably run by the CIA, leak information about the CIA monitoring and spying on us all?</p>

<p>How did they get all these news organizations that JA has been interviewed at since Oct to agree to not let out the secret?  He&#39;s done interviews with mainstream press (Fox) but many of the interviews have been independent small press.  Pilger is the big one.  </p>

<p>Why have other WL staff not outed the CIA or whoever took over WL?  As far as I know not a single WL staff member has even hinted that WL has been compromised or that JA was anywhere but the embassy.  </p>

<p>Do you foresee any scenario where this gets resolved?  Where we see definitive proof either way?  In many ways this could be like Bin laden or something.  If JA was indeed tortured, killed, taken out of the embassy, we&#39;d never know.  And we possibly may never know.  If the compromised WL is a reality, the CIA or whoever now runs it has no reason to ever tell us the truth about what happened.  They could lie for decades and act as if WL is stuff JA run.  </p>
