    <div class="md"><p>Here is Wikipedia on &quot;Information Technology&quot;:</p>

<p>Information technology (IT) is the application of computers to store, study, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data,[1] or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.[2] IT is considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level &quot;contain some degree of commonality in that they are related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information and various types of electronically mediated communications.&quot;[3]</p>

<p>The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several industries are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.[4][a]</p>

<p>I am interested in their proximity to each other, as well as, there proximity to lots of sensitive data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, Seth Rich&#39;s job <em>technically</em> fits the definition, but it does not align with what people would normally consider IT to mean. They didn&#39;t work the same jobs, and I can&#39;t imagine why they&#39;d know each other. I&#39;m not saying not to look into this, since it could be interesting, but I want to point out that the connection appears weaker than you may think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically speaking. And they were hired by Wasserman Schultz,  same as Seth Rich.  You think it&#39;s conceivable that after the DNC breach, Wasserman called on the Awan&#39;s to find out who was responsible for it and to tie up any loose ends? </p>

<p>Do you suppose that Rich found out about the Voter Database getting manipulated and then made it his business to get the emails? Sorry for creeping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal belief has been that Seth Rich stumbled onto something regarding the voter registration tampering. However, I&#39;m not so sure that it led to him taking the emails. I&#39;ve personally found the theory that he was the email leaker a bit dubious, since he wasn&#39;t a sysadmin for the DNC and shouldn&#39;t have had access to them. What I think is that he leaked or planned to leak details about the registration tampering.</p>

<p>As national data director of the voter expansion project, he had access to the NGP VAN database of voter info. This database was quite likely leveraged by the Clinton campaign following the December 2015 breach to figure out who the Bernie supporters were and target them for disenfranchisement. It would also reveal any registration tampering that occurred: NGP VAN periodically reimports from the state voter rolls, so if a lot of former Democrats had their parties change all of a sudden, it would be noticed. And Pratt Wiley, director of the voter expansion project, told me via email that they investigated accounts of registration tampering in the primaries.</p>
