        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As everyone around here knows, Obama&#39;s birth certificate was proven fake, yet nothing happened.  The deeper mystery is why release an obviously photoshopped birth certificate?  Why did Hillary start birtherism in the first place?</p>

<p>It took about 5 years into Obama&#39;s federal political career and over 2 years into the presidency before the web of lies began to unwind publicly with Wayne Madsen&#39;s reporting on Obama&#39;s CIA past.  Grandparents, parents in the CIA.  Worked for CIA front companies.  Missing years, few witnesses to &quot;events&quot; in his life.  It goes on.</p>

<p>A similar sort of story exists for Bill Clinton.  Years in the political scene, but only about two years in office did the Mena, Arkansas -&gt; CIA connection start gaining traction.  The CIA let this one get ahead of them, with the appointment of Ken Starr as special prosecutor coming on the heels of, rather than ahead of, significant mainstream circulation of Clinton&#39;s problems in Mena.  Thus begins the synthetic drama of the 90s in the same fashion as the birtherism of Obama: a fabricated scandal courtesy of the CIA to keep you from looking at the CIA.</p>

<p>Finally we arrive at Russiagate.  Sure, there is <em>something</em> there: it is a bit weird that Wilbur Ross (Commerce Secretary) invested in one of the Russian oligarchs favorite laundering hubs, the Bank of Cyprus.  It raises eyebrows that he brokered the most expensive home purchase to date  (Trump&#39;s 2006 $40M buy sold for $100M 2 years later for a cool $60M laundered to the future president).  But, frankly, this is small potatoes: if the worst we had to say about Trump was that he was greedy, he&#39;d be a welcome relief from the war criminals of late.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is yet another CIA distraction from a CIA past.  Trump was mentored by Roy Cohn, a CIA sex trafficker.  Trump purchased known trafficking fronts throughout his career: modeling agencies, beauty pageants, etc.  Trump has numerous times been accused of rape, spotted on Epstein&#39;s pedoexpress, said Epstein was &quot;great fun&quot; and &quot;likes them on the younger side&quot; in the same breath.</p>

<p>You&#39;re dealing with a CIA blackmail ring operator who has had multiple serious accusations of underage rape leveled against him.</p>

<p>If the media was truly against him, we&#39;d see Roy Cohn&#39;s picture every single, we&#39;d see the faces of girls Trump raped every single day, we&#39;d see hear the classic stories of teens brought to the USA without work visas and made to live in constant fear for working illegally (step 1 to compliance with being pimped), and so on.</p>

<p>But the cold, hard reality is that the media is in the bag for Trump, same as they were with Hillary&#39;s stirring up birtherism or Monica&#39;s dress.  It is the CIA backgrounds where the nasty stuff goes down, not the the pettiness that the CIA&#39;s mouthpieces (Operation Mockingbird) tell you to focus on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe that the women coming out against Trump was simply a political smear job (which, honestly, based on the very limited information that we have, is a reasonable thing to think), then you basically arrive at the conclusion that our HLI is actually a fraud - this is the angle that they appear to be memeing pretty hard - but, like all other bits of banter thrown into this straw pile, there is no hard evidence provided.  Why is it so hard for them to provide a bit of evidence to help substantiate their meme?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean DB Cooper ;) but really, Bill was CIA also. I understand that may seem far fetched, because a lot of what he said was true. If you read between the lines though, what he presented was done in a way to distort the truth rather than to give understanding. His work, in my opinion, is misleading in the same way that the Matrix movie and Star Wars are misleading. All are based on fundamental truth but presented in the same bipolar, good vs evil, us vs them, frame. None of them explain why they are presenting this information in the frame that they are. None of them, especially Cooper, ask the obvious question of why are these two sides opposed to each other. Why do the Satanist want to hurt people? If they have all of this knowledge, would they really keep trying to divide us and get us to kill each other? Also, does he talk about how the Bible was changed over and over through the years to suit varying agendas? Does he talk about what parts of the Bible may have been altered to conceal the truth from people? Does he talk about what a New Testament even means or what&#39;s the purpose of it? Why would our creator put a tree in front of us with fruit on it but tell us that if we eat that fruit he will hate us and kick us out of his house? That doesn&#39;t sound like what a real parent would say or do to their children. Honestly that sounds like what the CIA says now &quot;don&#39;t look at our knowledge plebs, it&#39;s just for us.&quot; Mmmm. If Lucifer means &quot;Light bringer,&quot; and we are trying to promote free inquiry or expose corruption, then would the CIA or Elite really be followers of Lucifer? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>they murdered folks like Bill Cooper for simply telling the truth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, Bill Cooper first actively disseminated the UFO materials and <em>only later realized</em> that he was used as well, and that all the UFO stuff was fabricated, a masterful psy-op? Do I get the basic facts right in this respect?</p>

<p><em>Cooper, Behold a Pale Horse, 1991</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 live aliens. Of the 10,4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South Africa. There were hundreds of sightings. </p>

<p>Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien problem. He knew that he could not do it by revealing the secret to the Congress, Early in 1953 the new President turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller. Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the secret structure of alien-task supervision, which was to become a reality within one year. The idea for MJ-12 was thus born. </p>

<p>It was Nelson&#39;s uncle Winthrop Aldrich who had been crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The whole Rockefeller family and with them, the Rockefeller empire, had solidly backed Ike. Eisenhower belonged heart and soul to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family. Asking Rockefeller for help with the alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever made for the future of the United States and maybe for humanity.</p>
