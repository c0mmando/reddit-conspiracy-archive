If its not obvious by now there is and always was an Agenda behind This powerful elite couple. The year Year the Clinton Foundation was founded is 1997. Coincidentally <a href="https://youtu.be/8PnCXkDiL2s">this</a> aired the same year. its mission statement is thus:&quot;To bring people together to take on the biggest challenges of the 21st century&quot; I believe there may be evidence or at least enough of a trail of crumbs that will REVEAL that the foundation was involved in orchestrating 9/11 within its emails. Ever find it strange that it seemed TO obvious that Bush/Cheney were behind 9/11? </p>

<p>It was not made obvious in those days or the first few years following 9/11. </p>

<p>Dissenters were cast aside for years and years before it became okay to even flirt with the idea. Please don&#39;t trivialize the truther movement.</p>

<p>Edit: also, in your final sentence, use &quot;too&quot; to express TO...that&#39;s what the word was made for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OBVIOUS because it is obvious now that all evidence points to bush/cheney from a conspiratorial standpoint never mind how i spell things it conveys the message. take all of what I&#39;m saying with grain of salt. Trump is a Truther. isnt funny how TRUTH is being disregarded by the media and our government as some kind of conspiracy. Maybe it is a conspiracy to usurp the usurpers.</p>
