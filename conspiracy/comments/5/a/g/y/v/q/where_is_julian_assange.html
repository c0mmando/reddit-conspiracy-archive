       That question is asked many times a day on this sub. 
Unfortunately none of us "officially" know where he is or how he's doing. We can speculate, but nothing solid yet.

       Exactly, and any speculation about him is just distraction from the actual solid content that Wikileaks continues to release daily regardless of Assange being cut off from the world. Maybe after the election is over we'll find out he was just hiding out with no way to keep in touch with us all or maybe we'll find out he'd been captured or killed... but there's nothing we can do about it now and worrying needlessly doesn't help anything. Worrying about Assange
       <em>
        when there's no actual evidence one way or the other
       </em>
       only hurts Wikileaks' goal of getting information out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, check anyone who demands to know about Julian Assange. Especially if they're not also vocally supporting the Wikileaks releases that are proven to be legitimate. They're likely to have a brand new sockpuppet account, no karma despite having an old account (which could be a sign of being a bought account for shilling), or they may have a history of shilling for Clinton.
       <strong>
        In this case, op's account is 4 years old and this topic is apparently the only place they've ever posted.

       They tried to silence him by putting pressure on the embassy he is living in to cut off his internet access..they can silence him but they cant silence the organization of Wikileaks...they cant silence the truth.

       You're absolutely right. But if I was in his shoes, knowing they had sent the Secretary of State to beg Ecuador to extradite me, and was dealing with the Clinton Family (40-50 unusual deaths) i'd become a ninja for two weeks, and just become an information jockey.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he may be dead, but he is in a life or death situation right now. Especially considering, as of pre-FBI announcement, he was the biggest thorn in Hillary's toe. If the Clinton's really did move 1+ billion dollars into a Qatar account, what's to prevent a contract for his death upon her Amerexit to Arabia Express? Everyone knowing exactly where you are 24/7/365 isn't exactly comforting.
