So I decided to do more research and found out how there&#39;s so much theories about Antarctica. So I was wondering if you guys can share all the stuff you know about this topic because I find it so intriguing. Thanks </p>

<p>Antarctica is the key to the big earth shape debate IMO.  I contend that the earth is a concave shell and there is an opening in Antarctica.  Perhaps it is a portal to a matrix of similar concave openings.</p>

<p>I lean towards extra terrestrials being a distraction considering that I believe we live inside the earth.  I&#39;m happy to discuss that further if you would like but I realize your question was about Antarctica.</p>

<p>If the earth isn&#39;t round, what benefit is there to covering that up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is round.  It is the exact same size and shape as the one we were taught.</p>

<p>The only difference is that instead of living on the outside with an infinite space around us, we live inside a closed system designed for us.  With the standard model you reach conclusions like Sagan so eloquently states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AKA, you don&#39;t matter so go work so you can enjoy your free time.  Oh and we&#39;ll take 35-45% of what you make to keep you safe.</p>

<p>There is a funny thing about humans that separates us from other animals.  Animals (for the most part) can live in a closed environment so long as the environment is large enough for them to have everything they need.</p>

<p>Humans on the other hand, if faced with the realization that they are in a cage, will do nothing else but seek out why they are in the cage and ask what lies beyond it.</p>

<p>The standard model eliminates the concept of a cage, and allows for a passive and easily malleable population that believes that we have no purpose but to reproduce and work so that we can be comfortable in our short and meaningless lives.</p>

<p>If the human species knew that they lived inside a closed environment, do you think they would spend more time working than they do anything else?  </p>

<p>TPTB can only maintain their power by convincing the masses to work.  The harder we work, the more power they achieve.  The standard model is the perfect paradigm for this sort of mass manipulation.  </p>

<p>There really wouldn&#39;t have to be that many people in on it.  They have thousands of honest scientists analyzing the imagery from satellites, probes, and rovers that they believe to be authentic.  Compartmentalization is a powerful tool that has been perfected by our military industrial complex over a very long period of time.  Think about how many people you know personally that have been to space.  </p>

<p>I am not religious, I assure you.  I have tried to articulate the answer to your question many times and I still do not feel that I have quite done it sufficiently, but perhaps you see where I am going?</p>

<p>For me, all of these things come down to two issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why would they lie about this? There has to be an advantage to it. And for a lot of these, I can see one.  The moon landing - I understand why they would have lied about that at that particular point in time. 9/11 - I see an advantage to doing that.  A lot of the space stuff, I don&#39;t see one.</p></li>
<li><p>Could they keep this a secret? And here a lot of it comes down to how many people have to be in on it.  And in this case, I still think it&#39;s too many too keep it a secret. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would they lie about this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I attempted to answer.  The advantage is that each person is more likely to work hard doing something that they hate, which is necessary for TPTB so that they don&#39;t have to do anything that they hate.  It frames each persons existence as meaningless.  It breeds a society of nihilists that argue about whether or not there is even such thing as truth, given that we just sprang about randomly out of nothingness, a slightly more advanced version of a long lineage of &quot;non intelligent&quot; ancestors.  It is deeper than any convenient lie told during times of apparent crisis such as 9/11 or the Moon landings, it is a true underlying method of control on our mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could they keep this a secret?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without a doubt.  Let&#39;s take the people that are floating these satellites by balloon from my earlier post.  These people probably don&#39;t think they are floating <em>all</em> satellites.  They aren&#39;t holding meetings tapping their fingers together and scheming about their deception.  In fact, they probably have meetings to watch the &quot;real&quot; satellites like the ISS.  I&#39;m sure they are some of the most devout fans of space.</p>

<p>They (NASA) carefully vet society for the best and brightest that rise to the top and place them in a position to analyze data from &quot;space.&quot;  Their peers respect them and would testify about their character, and they believe it is a life&#39;s worth of accomplishment that earned them the privilege.  There would only have to be a small group of overseers that fed this information to the honest and brilliant staff that they have accumulated.  </p>

<p>Think of what you would have to do to actually do to examine the shape or appearance of the earth for yourself.  You would have to travel extremely high, dig extremely deep, or travel all the way around it.  (It is common and commercially available to circumvent the globe at its equator, so you would really have to do this as if you were traveling in polar orbit.)  </p>

<p>If you travel extremely high it gets very cold and you can&#39;t breath.  Also without propellant you can really only get as high as a helium balloon allows and where the atmosphere we live in ends.  </p>

<p>You could dig really deep by boring a hole in the earth using a drill, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">Russians already tried that.</a>  They reached about 7 and a half miles (12km) after only one year, and then proceeded to make no significant progress over the next <em>two years</em> at which point they gave up.  They were unable to penetrate the &quot;crust&quot; and reach the mantle that we all know for a fact exists.  The scientists involved were puzzled by the result:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To scientists, one of the more fascinating findings to emerge from this well is that no transition from granite to basalt was found at the depth of about 7 km, where the velocity of seismic waves has a discontinuity. Instead the change in the seismic wave velocity is caused by a metamorphic transition in the granite rock. In addition, the rock at that depth had been thoroughly fractured and was saturated with water, which was surprising. This water, unlike surface water, must have come from deep-crust minerals and had been unable to reach the surface because of a layer of impermeable rock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you try to circumvent the globe, you must pass through Antarctica, which is the topic of this post, and we all know that not just anyone can do that.  It is perhaps the most controlled place on the earth on top of being extremely cold and unfit for human survival.</p>

<p>So really only a few people would have to funnel this information from a few probes, satellites, and rovers and for anyone to refute it, they would have to accomplish that which only TPTB have achieved.  (And told us that there is no reason to try to do it again.)  </p>

<p>There are a few public figures that likely would have to know such as the Apollo astronauts, but I suspect that this is also why they refuse to place their hand on the bible and state that they stood on the moon.  Perhaps because they have actually witnessed the handy work of our creators.</p>

<p>Either way, I find this sort of limited thinking rather boring.  What is more interesting is the actual evidence that the surface of the earth is concave.  Have you ever examined it?</p>

<p>No. I&#39;ll be happy to take a look.  But I&#39;m very skeptical that this is a &quot;managable secret&quot;.  I know people who have seen space shuttle launches.  If all this is fake, where do they go?  Civilian companies launch satellites now.  I really have my doubts you could cover all of this up.</p>

<p>They take a parabolic path over the ocean and disappear into the distance.  They likely crash into the ocean.  They don&#39;t have $500M+ satellites in their nose cone so this is still quite profitable, nor do they have human occupants.</p>

<p>Civilian companies pay for satellite launches from companies like SpaceX, but they do not actually launch the rockets themselves.  This is why it is such a great racket.  The technology that GPS&#39; provide can be replicated very easily by the cell towers that cover the &quot;civilized&quot; world.  </p>

<p>Take a look at this <a href="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4fd758fb69bedd9472000000-867-745/bilderberg-group.jpg">map.</a>  What do the few at the center of this map need in order to maintain their immense wealth and influence?  Many many loyal workers.  Their network is vast and immensely powerful, but no one part is knowledgeable of the full picture.</p>

<p>So really my response can be broken down to two points:</p>

<p>1)  It is virtually impossible to authenticate for yourself so at some point you must take someones word for it.</p>

<p>2)  Not as many people would need to know as you are assuming.  Compartmentalization is extremely powerful, and remember that the initial scientists that put men in space were masters of propaganda. </p>

<p>There wouldn&#39;t have to be such a vast <em>active</em> coverup at this point.  </p>

<p>Even the ones who are actively faking space such as the artists that depict the &quot;blue marble&quot; photos, or the balloon operators in Antarctica, or the shitty actors on the ISS, don&#39;t believe that they are doing so because space isn&#39;t real.  They likely have some sort of other validation or justification for what they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.  </p>

<p>I think there is something floating in the sky that resembles the ISS.  I do not believe that there are people on it.  The two that ended tragically played a very important role in our view of space travel.  SpaceX just reinforced this lesson recently when they blew up poor Facebook&#39;s half a billion dollar satellite.</p>

<p>The satellites in the sky did not get there riding on rockets, but I do believe there are objects up there.  </p>

<p>NASA is doing something.  I do not think it is simply all show.  They do know something about the nature of the area above our atmosphere.  They do know how to give the appearance of a geostationary satellite, so they must know something about how it works up there.  I have my suspicions as well.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you leaning towards the flat earth?  I admit that I explored the flat earth theory for a long time.  (My post history will show you.)  </p>

<p>The flat earth theory does a good job of dismantling the standard model, but it does not quite paint a full picture.</p>

<p>It explains all of the blatant NASA fakery.  It explains why we feel absolutely no motion at all.  But it doesn&#39;t explain why people in the southern hemisphere see the <a href="http://oldweb.aao.gov.au/images/image/aat006_6x6.jpg">celestial south pole in the sky.</a></p>

<p>The concave model makes it work.  It is rather poetic IMO.  The heavenly bodies reside within the celestial sphere that spins directly above the heads of each and every person on earth.  Gravity is a propelling force outward from the center and source of all light AKA the heavens.  </p>

<p>Compasses actually point to the top of this celestial sphere, which is why they point north even in the southern hemisphere.  If the earth was as we are told, in the southern hemisphere a compass would have a stronger attraction to the south pole, yet the needle still points north.  This is actually another point that flat earth proponents will bring up.</p>

<p>There is a user that put together a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q3rfu/flat_earth_is_a_zionist_psyop_to_discredit_the/">post that goes into depth on this.</a>  I highly recommend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The North and South Poles basically have giant holes in them, mainly the North Pole. In the Antarctic it&#39;s a cave actually. It revolves around the hollow earth theory which in itself is very hard to believe but when you find things like the fact that nobody can actually fly over the North Pole and other oddness&#39; you tend to wonder. After WWII the much respected Admiral Bird went to the North Pole and actually flew over and discovered a huge opening in the North Pole and another supposed race that lives within who is more technologically advanced, it&#39;s absolutely fascinating stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is round.  It is the exact same size and shape as the one we were taught.</p>

<p>The only difference is that instead of living on the outside with an infinite space around us, we live inside a closed system designed for us.  With the standard model you reach conclusions like Sagan so eloquently states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AKA, you don&#39;t matter so go work so you can enjoy your free time.  Oh and we&#39;ll take 35-45% of what you make to keep you safe.</p>

<p>There is a funny thing about humans that separates us from other animals.  Animals (for the most part) can live in a closed environment so long as the environment is large enough for them to have everything they need.</p>

<p>Humans on the other hand, if faced with the realization that they are in a cage, will do nothing else but seek out why they are in the cage and ask what lies beyond it.</p>

<p>The standard model eliminates the concept of a cage, and allows for a passive and easily malleable population that believes that we have no purpose but to reproduce and work so that we can be comfortable in our short and meaningless lives.</p>

<p>If the human species knew that they lived inside a closed environment, do you think they would spend more time working than they do anything else?  </p>

<p>TPTB can only maintain their power by convincing the masses to work.  The harder we work, the more power they achieve.  The standard model is the perfect paradigm for this sort of mass manipulation.  </p>

<p>There really wouldn&#39;t have to be that many people in on it.  They have thousands of honest scientists analyzing the imagery from satellites, probes, and rovers that they believe to be authentic.  Compartmentalization is a powerful tool that has been perfected by our military industrial complex over a very long period of time.  Think about how many people you know personally that have been to space.  </p>

<p>I am not religious, I assure you.  I have tried to articulate the answer to your question many times and I still do not feel that I have quite done it sufficiently, but perhaps you see where I am going?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you leaning towards the flat earth?  I admit that I explored the flat earth theory for a long time.  (My post history will show you.)  </p>

<p>The flat earth theory does a good job of dismantling the standard model, but it does not quite paint a full picture.</p>

<p>It explains all of the blatant NASA fakery.  It explains why we feel absolutely no motion at all.  But it doesn&#39;t explain why people in the southern hemisphere see the <a href="http://oldweb.aao.gov.au/images/image/aat006_6x6.jpg">celestial south pole in the sky.</a></p>

<p>The concave model makes it work.  It is rather poetic IMO.  The heavenly bodies reside within the celestial sphere that spins directly above the heads of each and every person on earth.  Gravity is a propelling force outward from the center and source of all light AKA the heavens.  </p>

<p>Compasses actually point to the top of this celestial sphere, which is why they point north even in the southern hemisphere.  If the earth was as we are told, in the southern hemisphere a compass would have a stronger attraction to the south pole, yet the needle still points north.  This is actually another point that flat earth proponents will bring up.</p>

<p>There is a user that put together a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4q3rfu/flat_earth_is_a_zionist_psyop_to_discredit_the/">post that goes into depth on this.</a>  I highly recommend.</p>
