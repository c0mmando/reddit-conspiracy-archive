        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I like a good conspiracy theory, and it&#39;s halloween, so...</p>

<p>(a) IIRC, Hillary had a bonk on the head right before her testimony about Benghazi. A bonk on the head that disrupted her memory, and kept her from testifying for a time. And that appears to have been a real injury.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem interesting that Hillary had a brain injury... that impacted her memory... right when she was supposed to talk about Benghazi? And that seems to be a real injury, and not some fakery? </p>

<p>So how did she get injured? Did she just accidentally fall down? Or was it some other factor? And who would want to do this? Or be able to do this?</p>

<p>(b) What really was going on with Benghazi, and Hillary&#39;s activities overall in the State Dept., that was so nefarious that she needed to have a private server? And continue to cover up what happened even when it became a serious liability?</p>

<p>Apparently they were arming the Libyan resistance and the Syrian rebels IIRC through that facility. OK, but that sounds kind-of-nefarious, not horrifically nefarious. </p>

<p>I feel like something else is going on, something severe enough to warrant someone getting Hillary to &#39;forget&#39; all the details of the situation. Severe enough to entail Hillary risking all her ambitions to keep it covered up.</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>It&#39;s an entertaining set of ideas if nothing else.</p>

<p>She was there to continue trying to clean up the situation in which Stinger missiles from CIA were supplied to Al-Qaida, the same mission Ambassador Stephens died trying to perform.</p>

<p>(b) They were running weapons to Syria through an arms dealer named Turi.  The weapons were at the Benghazi embassy.  What they were doing was treason, a very big deal.</p>

<p>We know there were Stinger missiles at the embassy, what we don&#39;t know is what other illegal shit was there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it may very well have been.  but, the statement stands, Sorcha Faal is not a reliable source, due to many instance of pure bullshittery in the past, maybe in the 99.9+ percent range.   The Sorcha Faal template is easy to follow, step one requires an outrageous headline such as &quot;Obama Threatens Nuclear War to Hide Gay Past&quot;   Step two: &#39; According to sources within The Kremlin/ FSB Headquarters/Russian Army Intelligence/Moscow Department of Motor Vehicles&#39;   Step 3 provide verifiable links to real events that have zero relation to the headline or tone of story, step 4 provide links to back up unubstantiated claims that bring up other sorcha faal posts. step 5 tie the entire story into the urgent need to purchase a complete compendium of the Sister of Russian Stuff Starring Sorcha Faal information which ends up being a manilla envelope of printouts of basically screen grabs of the website.   Sorcha Faal is purely trash, no matter how much truth is contained due to past shennanigans.   the name and associated info are tainted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s the thing you can&#39;t talk about on the conspiracy subreddit....  Anything about Russia and you&#39;ll be mocked and down voted...

Funny how he in the past bragged about him being friendly with Putin and doing business in Russia, to now flat out denying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why did HRC need a private server when the other organs of government did not? I don&#39;t believe the CIA director needed a private server. So why did she? </p>

<p>People are coming out stating that they consider the Clintons and their Foundation as one big mafia type enterprise. If HRC was up to that type of shenanigans as SoS then yeah I could see her wanting to cover her tracks.</p>

<p>Trump? I think he basically recognizes that the Cold War can end. Nixon did too, with detente, before he got forced out. So did Reagan. I think he figures that the US and Russia can respect each other.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine a guy with his ego would ever be on anyone&#39;s payroll or their puppet. Or shill.</p>
