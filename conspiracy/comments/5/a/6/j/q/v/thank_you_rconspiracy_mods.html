       They also have to deal with conspiracy types who are constantly analyzing them and questioning their decisions.  It is not an enviable position IMO.
      </p>

       People complain about the rules of this sub, but I think they are quite brilliant.  This sub is called "conspiracy" but really it is what all of reddit
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be.  IMHO of course.

       That's probably not the best way to phrase it.  I certainly don't mean it in a derogatory way, I consider myself as included in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just mean people that don't take people words and actions at face value. People that challenge the information they recieve.  Perhaps critical thinkers is a better term.

       No, because the two words together do not make any sense in the English language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is a legal definition in criminal law,  when someone conspires or agrees with someone else to do something which, if actually carried out, would amount to a crime.

       What. The person is talking about people who like r/conspiracy, people who are regulars here, etc.
       <em>
        Critical thinkers

       , like they said. It's quite clear what they're talking about in context even if one of their earlier comments used the word "conspiracy" in a colloquial way that is technically wrong.

       Objectively, I have observed this to be true. In groups of hardcore conspiracists, they will tend to eventually turn on each other and suspect the others of being compromised by the conspirators.

       I think the moderators appreciate seeing these posts on occasion so thank you OP. It's easy to say moderating can be a thankless task at times and we do get a fair amount of shit slung our way but ultimately it is worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the moderators here know that freedom of information is paramount to the subreddits values and we endeavour to uphold those values. We don't always agree, we don't always get on but the team unit is strong and all of us believe in the freedom to discuss controversial topics and issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's important however is that we caretake the page and leave the important stuff to the community. Ultimately the important stuff is the content. The community make the page and as the years have rolled by, subs like r/conspiracy have more than proved their worth. We aren't the last bastion of free speech however, that claim would be egotistical.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we are is a platform for open discussion and transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moderation team will always strive to keep it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all appreciate your support.

       We really do appreciate the compliment, and as moderators that is something we view as an accomplishment above all others. In spite of troll brigades attempting to sow discord between this userbase and modteam, admins openly mocking us at every opportunity, and a years long campaign by some irc trolls to submit vicious anti-Semitic propaganda as a form of libel, this subreddit continues to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, places like
       <a href="/r/undelete">

       ,
       <a href="/r/worldpolitics">

       , and
       <a href="/r/altnewz">

       (shameless self plug lol) also put forth an ardent commitment to the free flow of information and deserve support as well :).

       there's so much Hillary imagery that is Hitler-esque, it's amazing people don't point it out more often.  Maybe it's a good thing though, considering all the anti-Zionist, anti-Semitism that exists.

       Here, here. Thanks for this sub. Otherwise I'd still be sifting though all the bullshit on twitter. This sub has stood strong in the face of adversity more then once. At this point TPTB maybe scared of this sub and all of its amazing people who contribute. I'm sure we are all on many a list. I wish you all the best. We have made a difference.

       I agree, the mods here are excellent. I hope that with time, the other subs will realize the mistakes they have been making and use this as an example of what a real sub should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit could be a powerful tool for humanity, but it has been reshaped into a propaganda machine. I admire the mods for allowing the community to discuss and post their views, without fear of being banned as long as they follow the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often read about the "Hive Mind" as being this thing we should regard with disgust, but I don't see it that way. I see lawyers, accountants, taxi drivers, nurses, dish washers, and self made business owners. This is where they are able to have discussions and receive responses by others who may or may not share that view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could contribute more to this sub and am always amazed by information I obtain from here. The amount of work that the community does is humbling, and it would not be possible without the Mods of conspiracy.

       It's no mistake.  The other mods are CTR or Donald Shills.  There probably are 1 or 2 on this board, but at least most of the big stuff hits the front page and most of the dialogue goes unpunished.

       It's ironic because I feel that this sub has been completely overwhelmed with you homeless redditors. Sure it's great content for r/politics but for r/conspiracy this is way over blown analysis because we're dealing solely with the intrigue surrounding one person. We're not progessing to any sort of big picture view.

       First off, thanks to all the mods here. I'm sure you all put up with a lot of shit and it can be a thankless position. Special shout out to
       <a href="/u/mr_dong">
        /u/mr_dong
       </a>
       , best mod on reddit and one of my favorite posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, not sure if any mods are still lurking about in this thread but I figure since this post is directed at you all this may be a good place to bring this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure many remember the strangeness which happened awhile ago with
       <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">
        /u/Sarah_Connor
       </a>
       . I won't go into the details, but last I remember hearing about it was that the mods were going to try speaking with the admins to see if they could get them removed from the mod list.
I guess that didn't pan out though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash forward to about a month ago. I checked the users page out of curiosity only to find that the post history had beenwiped wiped. Thought that was pretty odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       After seeing this thread I looked over the mod list and decided to check out said user once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems that as of two days ago post have started being made with the account again. Which I find troubling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone been in contact with them? I worry about that user being a weak link when it comes to keeping the integrity of the sub intact. After the post they made on an alt and the long absence, it just seems like an account that may be a prime target for, I dunno, the FBI, or other groups like ctr. With them being so high on the mod list, it would be easy to cause major problems if that account fell into the wrong hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to toss that out there.

       when people say "conspiracy" in those contexts they really mean "paranoid" but don't want to call it that.
