Not to mention that videos like Daisy&#39;s Destruction get streamed for tens of thousands of dollars -- only a very, very small subset of people can pay for that. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the deal? Are lizard people into underage kids? Is it some sort of initiation right by gate keepers to be used as potential future black mail? Does power corrupt you to that point of perversion? I&#39;m just at a loss for an explanation.</p>

<p>Either every single person that works there is a pedophile or they didn&#39;t want anyone opening their mouths on what they witnessed in the Pentagon the morning during 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be careful about that.  A lot of 17 year olds will lie about their age to make money.  The customers don&#39;t know about the age. They just want to see hot girls having sex. It&#39;s very likely that there are some widely distributed videos out there which the FBI knows are underage but the customers do not. They never go into the details.  There&#39;s a big difference between pre pubescent and underage.  But the law does not differentiate.  So just bear in mind that the vast majority of these are probably &quot;normal&quot; porn so far as the viewer knows. </p>

<p>I have another theory as well. Finding child porn on someone&#39;s computer is a sure way to get instant dismissal and arrest.  So I can see some government agency planting illegal material on as many computers as possible so that if someone gets in their way over something they can just make a phone call and they are gone. All it takes is to get the word out about this hot porn site with emails containing a virus which sends out offers to everyone in your address book.  So pretty soon everyone has been exposed to the honeypot.  Most would not even be aware. &quot;Oh, yeah, I saw that and deleted it&quot;. But the damage has already been done.  Some inconspicuous files in computer that you don&#39;t even know about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that doesn;t matter, the fact is that if a porn website has models on it with no USC18 document of their reported age, technically its &#39;child porn&#39;</p>

<p>many an official or politician, or celeb will have fallen prey to this blackmail avenue, once they are threated with exposure or court they are compliant.</p>

<p>back in the late 90s in the UK there was a BBC radio 5am news report on a child porn bust, 100s of worthy professionals caught on the books of a website, no follow up either MSM or courts, all became MI5 assets after that.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>another early morning BBC radio 4 news item back then was about some drug cartel dude arrested and held at Heathrow airport, dude <strong>needed</strong> his TV in his police station cell, so they left his cell door open and ran a mains extension cord into his cell, so he could watch TV, ahhhhhhhhh.</p>

<p>big surprise he went missing when they checked on him in the morning, no follow up on the news, no firings or arrests of corrupt Heathrow police.</p>

<p><strong>the ruling elite and their minions are corrupt to the core, they deserve no automatic respect</strong></p>

<p>Some of the Clinton Foundation investigation over on 4chan was finding allegations that our leaders are also taken to strange parties where, after a few drinks (and perhaps some suggestigens or other drugs) someone comes through with an underage girl and a camera, and afterwards everyone at the party is susceptible to blackmale. It was alleged that the top positions of the different government bureaucracies are controlled in this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye. It may go deeper then that. Perhaps the only way to get into those positions is to engage in pedo activities while being knowingly recorded. Sick fucks.</p>

<p>I recently had to explain to a fellow theorist that this is not a satanic activity. Satanists have a code, and pedophilia is strictly forbidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to derail the conversation but the term &quot;satanist&quot; is rather generic and in reality self-identifying satanists run a gamut of behavior, ideologies and moralities. You can&#39;t really pigeon hole them any more than Christians or Muslims. </p>

<p>Ritualized sexual abuse can indeed be &quot;satanic&quot; in the terms most of us would agree. Yes, many outspoken and self-identifying Satanists are really atheists with the spirit of practical jokers but certainly not all. (See also Jimmy Saville who was a real-deal black Magician of the very worst kind.)</p>

<p>Source: have studied the occult for +20 years and have personally known satanists including members of the council of 9,  Anton Lavey&#39;s inner circle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is some magical realism bullshit. I hear this a lot, but there&#39;s no proof of it. You might wanna say that child abusers that get caught are more likely to have been victims, but, I&#39;ve always had a theory about this: they leave things a bit messy so that they can be caught; a call for help for somebody to stop them (so to speak). I have heard this expressed in as many words by paederasts in prison documentaries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting thought.  I don&#39;t think its a stretch to think that people of similar social status who share a perverted secret would form a secret group and help each other gain success and power. Alternatively, you could say that maybe these people are just bored and, being sociopathic and above the law, experiment in horribly illegal and immoral acts. Also though, framing someone for pedophilia would be a great way to off them without actually killing them.  Maybe a bit of all three.</p>

But what is the biggest, most fucked-up taboo that no-one could get away with? Sex with children. I dont think its about being attracted to children, at least not for most of them, I think its because they know that they can get away with it.

    <div class="md"><p>95+% of the mis-leaders are sociopaths / psychopaths. They do not have any empathy at all and do whatever the fuck they want to. They all like to fuck. So, most people prefer to have sex with young, fertile people, but not everybody can. I have to mention that the legal age of consent in the US is 18, but it is lower in many other countries. Some women are fertile and ready to give birth as early as 14 yo. The sociopaths who have no fear and are constantly bored want some excitement. Fucking a minor just might provide that for them. Also, it is easier to control a young person, physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Yes, they are scum, but this has been going on for millennia. I blame useful idiots who idolize the likes of Obama and Clinton just as much as the psychos themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really not sure but I have a theory: </p>

<p>-- I think there really is child rape going on among these groups of people. for example I think baby prince george was brought  to australia to be raped. weird -- but there were just so many clues, &amp; if they are doing it to their most prized child -- they must WANT to do it and value it&#39;s effects . I think it&#39;s a systematic system of control, they mess with the kids formative psychology when they abuse them at such a young age, like foot binding or something -- it&#39;s a way to shape the psychology of the person from basically before they form memory.  - perhaps to make them psychopaths -- so they never feel guilt about the damage they do to the populous at large -- but also maybe just to wire them to take orders from whoever wants to use them as puppets. </p>

<p>I suspect mostly it&#39;s about establishing control on the victims for life. if they can inflict messaging along with the trauma and abuse - they can essentially program people. I doubt it&#39;s fool proof -- but it&#39;s probably pretty effective, and highly developed over the years (ugh gross), trauma will shape you and the younger it happens the less chance you have of overcoming that shaping. it can also make you feel compelled to victimize others as you were victimized, </p>

<p>&amp; it just sounds SO horrific -- makes me pity the &quot;elite&quot; more than hate them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it has to do with illuminati family mind control. they use a practice called &quot;trauma-based mind control&quot; to split the minds of children into several parallel personalities, each of which can be individually raised or &quot;programmed.&quot; this practice goes back a very long way, to the mystery cults of greece and egypt, and commonly involves sexual abuse and sexual traumas to cause traumatic personality splits. this abuse is passed down generationally, parents to children, where the adults are left with a fascination with the kind of sexual violence that was perpetrated on them as children, and they in turn take it out on their own children, and others. it is very integral to the bond of secrecy of the overarching elite conspiracy; everyone knows everyone can out them for pedophelia so they stay silent.</p>

People tend to die while investigating this topic similarly to those investigating the clintons, and this never aired in the USA although it was scheduled to. I wanted to post the documentary here because it shows there were whispers about this type of ring existing in the establishment in DC as well as outside it, in elite circles decades ago. It&#39;s definitely not just the Clintons, it&#39;s infected power circles in general. I hope that - if this is what the unpublished clinton material shows, that it does get exposed - so that hopefully it might get stopped. Too much suffering has gone on for too long. </p>
