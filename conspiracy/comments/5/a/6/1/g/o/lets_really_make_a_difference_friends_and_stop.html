<p>here is some Bill Hicks for you.</p>

<p>“If you want to understand a society, take a good look at the drugs it uses. And what can this tell you about American culture? Well, look at the drugs we use. Except for pharmaceutical poison, there are essentially only two drugs that Western civilization tolerates: Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in.” - Bill Hicks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying caffeine or alcohol are good, but it&#39;s kind of relative and most importantly people need to know their limits.
Personally, I drink a fuck ton of coffee(pot a day or dark roast) and drink 4-6 beers(7-8% alcohol Ipa&#39;s) 2-3 days per week. Most certainly this will effect my longevity, but I work/study for school over 125 hours per week. However, quitting smoking cigarettes and weed was extremely beneficial for me. For 8 years I was pro weed and anti-alcohol and gradually as I got older things changes. Most importantly people need to take agency and know their limitations, which unfortunately, is generally realized through painful lessons learned in life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3-4 hours sleep per night and a pot of coffee per day.
It&#39;s kind of like fight club, many times a blur. I take 21 Units in school but I am able to do the majority of my work out of the office. My Professors are relatively relaxed about my attendance because I do exceedingly well in my class, and generally speaking I try to stay 2 weeks ahead in lectures, so attending class is a waste of time. So between having 4 extra hours per day(sleep) and not having to commute more than 3 days per week I save a considerable amount of time. Also, I use Amazon for everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, agree but I mean, we could make the world a much better place if we stopped using their currency and grouped up in communities and worked for each but that is kinda pushing it right? Not going to happen right? right. Things won&#39;t change unless everyone takes extreme measures into their own hands... </p>

<p>But we all have to eat and some of us have to feed our families (not talking about me).
All of us are in fucked situation. Even if we have a high living standards we are slaves and will continue to be slaves to the system/currency for it&#39;s our survival technique.</p>

<p>EDIT: And some of us use drugs to cope with the survival techniques (thats me) so we don&#39;t have much choice....</p>
