<p>HRC campaign decides to hide their proposal for mandatory drug screening for kids until after election so it&#39;s not used against them during the general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went on a rant, don&#39;t feel obligated to read it, this is just an awful idea for so many reasons, I&#39;ve seen these policies fail before.</p>

<p>Fuck that, I wouldn&#39;t have graduated high school if I hadn&#39;t self medicated my Bipolar/Severe Anxiety Disorders/ADHD with marijuana. Seriously, my life was awful from as early as I can remember until self-medication and once I was sort of backed into a corner and had to stop my life went back to shit as I spent years having doctors shove pharmaceuticals down my throat; obviously that didn&#39;t work until very recently. My current psychiatrist who is amazing, undercharges and has been willing to experiment with anything and everything to get me to the point where I&#39;m now stable, he&#39;s even open to letting me use weed, once it&#39;s legal in an adjacent state or my state, in place of everything but the Depakote/Valproic Acid/Divalproex Sodium. I mean random or regular or semi/annual drug testing without cause is imposing on the lives of teenagers who are simply experimenting or self medicating, especially if it&#39;s only pot and occasional alcohol, that&#39;s normal for a teen. i mean if kids are nodding out in class or having nose bleeds as they look super jacked up, then it&#39;s time to drug test, but drug testing adolescents that don&#39;t do drugs is simply a waste of money and offensive. It should be at the request of the parent at most or the requirement of a private school. Also it depends what the consequences are, if they are going to be sent to mandatory government rehab or required AA for failing a drug test for marijuana is a waste of taxpayer dollars/waste of time for the kid and it sends the message marijuana is as bad as heroin. That type of lie is what results in people trying heroin. Alcohol and cigarettes are legal so kids think they&#39;re not a huge a deal, despite be two of the worst substances for you, not saying I don&#39;t love them both. It&#39;s why teaching kids incorrect facts about drugs is harmful, because then they don&#39;t know what is safe-ish to do and what isn&#39;t. I mean if we told the truth about drugs to adolescents we&#39;d have way less drug problems, and mandatory drug testing sends a message that any drug on the test is equally bad (sort of). Idk if I hadn&#39;t been straight up lied to about drugs, I might not have wanted to try all of them bar meth/crack after finding out pot was really helpful to me. I turned into an opiate addict do to experimentation that led me to the epiphany that opiates were the solution to my mental health problems, they were, temporarily, I&#39;m in recovery but as my psychiatrist says there is no better mood stabilizer (at least temporarily) than opiates for Bipolar people. Either way I just went on a rant because this is both imposing, unethical, and likely to exacerbate problems when adolescents become adults and are n longer required to get annual drug tests or random ones. Its a bad idea, that obviously non mental health professionals came up with, they&#39;re probably all high and mighty that they don&#39;t have addiction problems and think they&#39;re wonderful policies can prevent them, but they&#39;re obviously pompous idiots as I&#39;ve seen similar policies fail at private schools and institutions. don&#39;t mind me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re preaching to the choir, brother. Funny enough, in the email itself the person writes that they would have failed the drug screen in their youth. Just more of the Democratic mantra &quot;do what I say, not what I do&quot; or better yet, &quot;Different rules for me&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel like this is nothing, but the fact it didn&#39;t have a title was interesting. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42747">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42747</a></p>

<p>Huma Abedin is in this conversation. Again, probably nothing though. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42754">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42754</a></p>

<p>Marked confidential. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42759">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42759</a></p>

<p>Now this seems odd. Lots of collusion with Walmart a year before she announced her campaign. Seems fishy. Also Abedin is back at it. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42769">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42769</a></p>

<p>CTR shit. However, I looked at the date. Fourth of July 2014. That&#39;s at least a year before CTR was even in full use. Something fishy about that. </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42550">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42550</a></p>

<p>This is just odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First one is just a political spam e-mail for a congressional candidate in 2014. There are a lot of these in his e-mails.</p>

<p>Second one relates to: <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">https://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction</a> and the CIR, which is: <a href="https://www.barackobama.com/immigration-reform/">https://www.barackobama.com/immigration-reform/</a></p>

<p>I think that e-mail discussion is Hillary wanting to come out in support of it in a bid to increase publicity around her for her future campaign. Hence the &quot;We need to start getting used to saying things on camera, might as well start now.&quot; reply from Philippe Reines.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing (I could be wrong) that the third one was a discussion on this: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/fec-ruling-hillary-clinton-shadow-campaign">http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/fec-ruling-hillary-clinton-shadow-campaign</a></p>

<p>Fourth one is a letter from Ralph Nader asking Hillary to leverage her ties to Walmart to help push for an increase in wages for Walmart employees (to $11/hr). The way that it reads is that it&#39;s also political and would help her in her campaign if she came out in support of it.</p>

<p>The fifth one is just one of many from 2014 from CTR. They were already in full swing long before the campaign started.</p>

<p>The last one is George C Paine II, a federal judge, imagining that Republicans bow down to Netanyahu, who he calls a &quot;turbaned Israeli mullah&quot;. There are different ways that this could be interpreted, but it&#39;s definitely a jab at both Republicans and Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Tara McGuinness, <a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/press/advisory/2012/11/07/44179/statement-the-grand-old-party-of-men-cap-actions-tara-mcguinness-on-womens-role-in-the-election">Executive Director of the Center for American Progress</a> (CAP, an organization with ties to almost everyone at the heart of the Clinton machine including several millionaires who fund superPACs) engaged in emails with John Podesta and David Brock (from Correct the Record fame) under an email address for <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Progressive_Media_USA">Progressive Media USA</a>, a branch of CAP that acts as a dem &quot;war room&quot; regarding <a href="https://g.co/kgs/LjG2gJ">Chris Sillizza</a> (an MSNBC analyst and WaPo blogger) and a statement he will be posting on behalf of David Brock. </p>

<p>The subject of the email seems to be about Gerald McEntee, of AFSCME (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees) and the need to return their <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/basics.php">527 money</a> (political organizations, in this case perhaps the AFL CIO) back. Possible conflict that they want to avoid with the IRS?</p>

<p>On the distro are Paul Begala (former Bill Clinton adviser, and President of &quot;<a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mm88934/hat-creek-enterprises-inc">Hat Creek Enterprises, Inc.</a>&quot; which is listed as a PR firm with 2 employees. <a href="https://twitter.com/tommatzzie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tom Matzzie</a>, former alum of MoveOn.org, CEO of Cleanchoice Energy and &quot;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/tom-matzzie">at the intersection of politics, media and technology for more than 10 years</a>&quot;. Another one on the distro is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_McCue">Susan McCue</a>, who holds some of the most amazing sounding titles, such as Broadcasting Board of Governors, President and CEO of The ONE Campaign, Chief of Staff to Harry Reid, Vice Chair of Humanity United and member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  </p>

<p>And, of course, our good friend John Podesta.</p>

<p>Quite an interesting group of people here, with far reaching influence across several vectors. Hopefully this information will be useful in progressing investigations into the power structure behind the campaign and the party in general.  </p>
