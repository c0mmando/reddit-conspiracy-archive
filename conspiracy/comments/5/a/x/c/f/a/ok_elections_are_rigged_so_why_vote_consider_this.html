        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think most people on this sub would agree that the US elections are rigged and HRC is set to win the election, so why even bother to vote? why does it matter?</p>

<p>What if the elections aren&#39;t rigged, what if the elites have tried to rig the elections and failed to do so without leaving a trail behind them, just think for a minute of the alternative. </p>

<p>Instead of rigging the elections directly why not leave the proverbial &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; lying around for alternative media sources and investigation officials to find, if you own the MSM and you have direct influence on the sheeple who follow its every word your only concern would be for the &quot;free thinkers&quot; and how would you trick them into voting for you??</p>

<p>The answer my friends is pretty simple, you leave just enough false information lying around which points to a rigged election and convince those &quot;free thinkers&quot; the voting system is rigged. you have then indirectly influenced them to not vote at all.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve rigged the voting system without rigging the voting system and if there were ever a thourough investagation into it they would get away scot free. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not in America but I think go and vote regardless of whether the system is rigged or not, just on the small chance its what the elites have led you to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the paradox I can&#39;t figure out.  If it is completely rigged, why do they go through the trouble of the 2 years campaigning?  I know they skim money from donations, but why go through that much trouble for that amount of time just to keep us distracted?  They are on the go every day making speeches somewhere.  We have signs everywhere you look, tv ads every commercial break; this is a major expense.  Then there is the Electoral College issue.  Something doesn&#39;t add up with this whole process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its mostly to build up a case of ignorance, if it were proven to be rigged by independent investigations its all lined up for a specific organization to take the fall, the questions will be exactly what you mentioned, how could it be rigged if this was the case? its a need 2 know basis and the HRC campaign might have been told not to worry about the details and to just get on with their daily business.</p>

<p>then secretly leave these &quot;emails&quot; and bits of fake clues leading the free thinkers to think you really do have that much control and that your vote is pointless which would then mean you could legally win the election as the only ones to believe their votes matter will be the people who are voting for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and my thought is that the rigging and voter fraud is not a 100% fix. My guess is they are able to manipulate a portion, but not all, of the votes... therefore requiring the massive campaigns to 1. Keep the show going and 2. For actual
Campaign purposes. </p>

<p>But I also kind of assume that a lot of the Electoral College ends up getting paid off too... to ensure the win. Could be wrong though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really an expert, but watched this election a bit closer than I should have. Most ballots are feed into a counting machine. You don&#39;t need to change the ballot. You only need to change what the total is on the counting machine. Most machine manufactures have donated to the Clintons. Not sure why this is legal, but welcome to law making in the U.S. Sequoia voting systems use the same Intellectual Property software parts from Smartmatic. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Voting_Systems">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Voting_Systems</a></p>

<p>Here is what leaked diplomatic cables state about Smartmatic:</p>

<p>&quot;The Venezuelan-owned Smartmatic Corporation is a 
riddle both in ownership and operation, complicated by the 
fact that its machines have overseen several landslide (and 
contested) victories by President Hugo Chavez and his 
supporters..... The identity of Smartmatic&#39;s true 
owners remains a mystery.  Our best guess is that there are 
probably several well-known Venezuelan businessmen backing 
the company who prefer anonymity either because of their 
political affiliation or, perhaps, because they manage the 
interests of senior Venezuelan government officials.&quot;</p>

<li><p>When you use the term &quot;rigging&quot; are you using it in reference to people being selected and not elected (meaning the order comes from <em>them</em>), voter fraud (ballots tossed, machines hacked) or a combination of both?</p></li>
<li><p>Who would be capable of doing a &quot;thourough investigation&quot;, would they have direct access to the elites and what would be the end result(s)?</p></li>

<li><p>I spefically left the term &quot;rigging&quot; up for debate as there are many ways to rig the election but in essence its having the end result determined by the elites (see answer 1)  and not the public</p></li>
<li><p>If you look into history you would see that there are many instances of the public rising up against the establishment, if this were to happen again I would expect for trusted anti-establishment skilled personal to conduct a transparent thourough investigation on the elections to prove once and for all the people were right! it would be much harder if the election &quot;rigging&quot; was fake in order to prevent independant thinkers from voting at all... and allowing the establishment to get away with influencing the public in this way.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>please elaborate? as my conspiracy theory was that the voting is being made to look as if it was rigged in order to prevent independent thinkers from voting and letting the sheeple do what sheeple do?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ve just countered my theory as if it plays out that way there would be nothing to investigate as they&#39;ve successfully and legally rigged public opinion rather than directly rigging the election.</p>

<p>Because if the game is rigged it doesn&#39;t matter what independent thinkers do as their votes don&#39;t/won&#39;t matter--it&#39;s rigged. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t make any sense because you can&#39;t &quot;mislead&quot; them into thinking the elections are rigged because 1. They are rigged and 2. They already have the belief that they are rigged. </p>
