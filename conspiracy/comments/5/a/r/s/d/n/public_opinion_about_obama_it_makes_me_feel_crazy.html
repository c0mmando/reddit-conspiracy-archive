<p>I can&#39;t help but think that these incidents, like him singing purple rain, are just excellently crafted PR. Even if it happens to be sheer coincidence that a kid dressed up as prince and obama sings to him.... the White House is so effective at getting it out on social media. </p>

<p>The result is a lot of people swearing up and down he&#39;s the best president ever. People completely over look him turning his back on campaign promises. He said we would get us out of 2 wars but now we&#39;re fighting 5 wars. </p>

<p>Then there is the outright propaganda aimed at kids. Publishers have made children&#39;s books about Obama and there is one about Hillary (Hillary: some girls are meant to lead) that reminds me of North Korean propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really buy into what I see as a false left, right dialectic but here&#39;s my take.</p>

<p>If I was a Democrat I&#39;d be fucking livid with his performance just based on his campaign promises alone. <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/">Just take a look at the list and realise that they&#39;re not at all weighted.</a> In terms of actual impact and meaningful implementation and practical change he did fuck all really. The Ideological the moral centre and backbone of everything he stood for during his  campaign in the eyes of the public was ditched at the door to the Whitehouse, watered down to the extent it was worthless or left for another time that time being never. </p>

<p>If you set aside the emotion of &quot;hope and change&quot; and what is no doubt the truely historic act of having the first black president I think he&#39;s been a pretty shit Democrat and legislator and President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, all it takes is a quick Google search for &quot;things Obama did&quot; to see all the stuff he has accomplished (seriously, just look up lists of his accomplishments, they&#39;re everywhere, and extensive). The economy is functional again after the 2008 crash and it&#39;s better than when he got into office. He passed a bunch of reforms, including health care,  which is obviously imperfect but he had to work with a Republican Congress thst underfunded him. I think the fact that he is so chill is literally the icing on the cake, and has only recently started REALLY letting himself shine because his term is almost over and it doesn&#39;t really matter anymore. He&#39;s a funny dude and did as much as he could imo. No president is going to accomplish everything their platform promises because they are not the sole political actors. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a fallacy which Obama himself has been pushing recently. All that has changed since 2008 is that the Federal Reserve&#39;s balance sheet is now over $4.5tn compared to the $800bn in 08 and the national debt has almost doubled. The problems of 2008 were, quite literally, papered over with huge deficit spending and thus massive debt creation.</p>

<p>The next crisis, which has been brewing all the while under Obama&#39;s tenure, will make the 2008 financial crisis look like a picnic. The underlying problems are far greater now and with interest rates still at emergency lows there is very little ammunition left for the Fed (and other CBs across the world too I might add) to fight such a crisis.</p>

<p>Yes the debt has doubled but look at all the other stuff that&#39;s lowered since, for example, the unemployment rate, homicides, etc,and look at the gdp increase since the great recession. How do you expect to get a country out of a recession without putting in money towards it? You think it&#39;s just going to heal itself in eight years like nothing happened? </p>

<p><a href="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/01/BO_percchange.png&amp;amp;w=480">https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/01/BO_percchange.png&amp;amp;w=480</a>
Also, when you look at the debt PERCENT increase, it&#39;s not even that high. Just look at Reagan and other Republicans. Also, what matters is the debt as a percent of the gdp. For example, if I make a billion dollars, a one million dollar debt to someone is nothing. If I make 100k, a million dollars would kill me. Because the gdp of the United States has also increased over time, the debt will also increase. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a problem, and it does need to be addressed. But taking into account the fact that the economy is going again, yeah, I&#39;d say Obama has done a great job. </p>

<p>As for Obama care, I already pointed out that it was underfunded. It&#39;s the first step in the right direction, and it&#39;s difficult to just completely introduce an entirely new system all of a sudden especially when a significant portion of the population is against universal health care </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes the headline number has indeed decreased but if you look beneath the surface you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s mostly low-paying service sector jobs, with a great deal of them being part-time. The labor force participation rate is actually at 40 year lows, indicating to me a labor market in which many people have simply stopped looking for work - and one must remember that those who fall into this category are excluded from the official unemployment figures after 6 months (or so) of job searching. A more accurate figure for <em>real</em> unemployment is the U6 rate which is hovering below 10% currently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... and look at the gdp increase since the great recession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been anemic at best. In-fact, this so-called recovery has been the weakest post-crisis recovery since the Great Depression. Also, take it or leave it but I do not trust the official inflation figures and suspect that they are significantly higher than reported - in which case <em>true</em> GDP growth has likely been flat or even receding ever since 2008.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you expect to get a country out of a recession without putting in money towards it? You think it&#39;s just going to heal itself in eight years like nothing happened?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No but huge debt creation is not the solution, the solution is actually to let the free market reach true price discovery over time instead of allowing huge government interventions and bail-outs. If all those institutions had been allowed to fail in 2008-09 (as they should&#39;ve done in a true, free market economy) then the US economy would be on the real road to recovery by now with GDP figures several times the current average - sure the immediate aftermath would&#39;ve been more painful but a drug addict can&#39;t quit without going through some pain first.</p>

<p>As for the obamacare comments, I won&#39;t address them as I&#39;m on the other side of the pond so don&#39;t really know a great amount about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the labor force participation has increased since the start of his tenure. Look at the FactCheck link I sent. Comparing the lfp over the past forty years is a bit ridiculous tho considering the recession. Did yoh expect it to be better than the past forty years after the shit fest that happened? </p>

<p>And no. The GDP has increased since he came into office, from it being in the NEGATIVES to being positive. The gdp had slowly been declining over time anyways (talking about the past fifty years),  and yes, it&#39;s not back to what it was before the recession. If you don&#39;t believe the numbers than there&#39;s no point arguing. I get this is r/conspiracy and I only commented on it because OP said he didn&#39;t understand how people can support Obama&#39;s policies and I just wanted to offer a differing a view. Kind of off point but it&#39;s sad that people stick to their own political subreddits. For example there&#39;s barely ever any discussion on r/thedonald since everyone on there is a trump supporter. Without discussion you don&#39;t really learn anything! And I do enjoy seeing the other point of view. </p>

<p>And its funny that you say the bailout shouldn&#39;t have happened and then bring up the lfp because if those bailouts wouldn&#39;t have happened way more people would currently be unemployed and the gdp would probably be even lower currently. Really, as a politician, you can never please everyone. And that&#39;s why I like Obama: he did his best, tried to get shit done, and stayed cool while doing it. </p>

<p>If you look at the amount it&#39;s been raised historically, it doubled during the Bush era too, and has been constantly increasing. This is a problem with the current economic system because it&#39;s based in fiat money. The entire economic system is fucked up, but that&#39;s not Obama&#39;s fault for playing the game the way it was set up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1-2% GDP growth with interest rates near 0% is nothing to brag about. </p>

<p>He outright lied to people about ACA (you can keep you plan. Rates will go down) and people who actually pay for their health care are getting completely fucked. Penalizing poor people for not being able to afford health insurance is absurd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesnt penalize poor people for not being able to afford Healthcare - it&#39;s penalizing them if they don&#39;t sign up for it. Because when poor people end up in the hospital and then they don&#39;t have any insurance or money to pay for it, the money still comes out of tax payer pocket. This is why it&#39;s more efficient to have universal health care. Obamacare is far from perfect but at least he got it going in the right direction. You guys want a president to come in and perfect everything like he&#39;s the only one has any say and like stuff doesn&#39;t take time to get done. Entirely overhauling a health care system is difficult, especially considering Republican attitude towards it. </p>
