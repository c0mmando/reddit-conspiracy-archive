       financial industry anon went into this a little bit about the ancient knowledge/secrets that they hold, which is why they have such power. He/She said that the history of our species is the greatest lie ever told. Apparently we are on our third iteration, which helps to explain the mysteries of the Egyptian pyramids, etc.

       Take it for what it's worth, but check it out and make your own decisions about it.

       Edit: I'm looking for the 4chan link about our species history - I only started lurking there recently. It may have been another insider and not the FBI anon, just to be clear. Will report back when I find it.
       <strong>
        Okay, found one of the threads

       </strong>
       This is someone who works for a thinktank in the financial industry that specializes in US daytrading markets - privy to good intel from reliable sources. He/She says the 8 goddesses (who are controlling the South Korean president) are working for 1 of the Eastern Families. (I assume Li). He/She also discusses our species being the 3rd cycle of mankind in this thread.

        Here is a quick report on the South Korea president being taken "body and soul".

       The cult they are really talking about without knowing it, is the above satanic cult. We understand this "possession" to be modern day MK Ultra, however "soul possession" or mind control has its roots in the

       Well we are apparently going through a coup and counter coup at this very moment. In the FBIAnon posts he said the house would fall Tuesday at 11am. Yesterday at 11 the FBI started leaking docs on the Clintons and

       It is broad, but it also gets the point across. There are other interchangeable terms such as cabal, illuminati, archon network, etc. The point is that there is some organized group that conspires in dark acts based upon some kind of ideology or influence.

       The best explanation I have is that the NWO/Illuminati/Cabal whatever you want to call it has broken into factions and is fighting itself for control.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that there is a genuine insider "good guy" effort to  seize this opportunity to take back control of our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if the latest coup/counter coup video is really the good guys or not though.

       Lots of people were playing the same game, suddenly a handful of people made alliances to one another because they got sick of helping another few players cheating. A guy whips his dick out and everyone loses their mind and a couple teams are trying to flip the table in opposite directions causing it to just go straight up in the air while the cheaters are saying "We didn't cheat! The russian players cheated!" while the russian players are in another room entirely playing parcheezi.

       Trump isn't woven into this fabric of Luciferianism and pedophilia. He's not what I would consider presidential material, but is at least a chance for change (which is more than we have had for decades).  Im not holding my breath though.  No one comes into power and keeps it unless they play ball with the cabal.

       I haven't seen evidence, but it is pretty well established they are friends, and there is testimony saying Trump was on a flight. I'd say it is a safe bet to say Trump has been to the island. I can post you links to stuff I don't take as evidence, but again, we have seen almost no evidence for any of this yet... ie

       Not a savior, just a game piece no one expected to enter the game so everyone went of the deep end. One thing is for sure though, no matter who wins the election their WILL be MASSIVE change.

       Both parties bought and paid for, clinton's crimes can no longer be contained and mainstream is beginning to dump her.  We know from wikileaks that clinton campaign pushed trump and told the media to start telling the public to treat trump like a serious contender because he would be the "easiest to beat".  Alex Jones today schilling hard for trump by hittiing this Clinton issue first.  Even if it is the truth, its going to be a smooth transfer of power to the same money.  That's my speculative take.  I think we just might clean house, though.

       I literally heard sirens go off at 10 this morning. FBI going rogue and abandoning corrupted Comey. John Titor is Trump. Nikola Tesla documents leaked claiming time travel is real. Satanic sadistic pedophile ring operating on the deep web, Clinton foundation connected to massive global corruption and debt slavery, human, weapon and drug trafficking. They want to literally destroy America by attacking Russia and Syria with tactical nukes. Who knows what is going on in the highest rings of the military right now what with an intelligence cout de tat, they want to trigger the American people to rise up and stop the rigged election. Disinformation is everywhere, claiming Trump and Clinton are connected and colluding.

       I'm at work but, search for FBIanon 4chan leaks, and a tweet 3 days ago by FBI vault Twitter on Tesla allegedly losing some documents from a hotel Tesla owed $600 to. Mike Pence is from a further timeline. Look at Ann Holton, then look at Mike Pence. Tell me the resemblance isn't fucking crazy.

       I want this to be true so badly. It would be so exciting and give so much purpose and motivation for me and I'm sure so many others that are so disillusioned with the establishment.

       I want to believe collective consciousness exists, because I was just telling my father I wanted to learn more and experiment with electricity beyond my basic physical science 101 knowledge. Then I found the Tesla files and felt compelled to dig through them. I did not get all the way through unfortunately, but it seems significant, and I want to believe 4chan and The_Donald are memeing shit into existence. What a fucking time to be alive, I hope I'm not just manic and going bonkers. I feel like I have a firm grip on reality, and my father heard the sirens as well, and joked that he saw a missile, definitely got my heart beating because I firmly believe that we are on the edge of total annihilation, or a revitalization of our economy, a la Hitler's Germany style.
