       This is big. Could bring down the entire Clinton Foundation, and anybody whose touched it, if a RICO case is brought. This is ACTUAL PROOF of Clintons selling favors to foreign governments during her time as SoS.

       EDIT: I just got back from eating, and this thread has gone off the charts. I'm really having trouble keeping up. From here on, I will only be able to reply to comments directly on my own comments, or ones that I am tagged in via "
       <a href="/u/dataphreak">
        /u/dataphreak
       </a>
       ". In the mean time, it's time to start digging. We've exposed the Dow angle for motive to access the Secretary of State at the time, but there are plenty of other companies and dates. Each one deserves its own thread. Find stuff, post it, tag me in the comments, and I'll come check it out with you.

       She's not an anti-vaxxer, and doesn't think wifi causes cancer. She's a doctor, not an idiot. She's trying to get all the voters she can, surprise, she's a politician. And many people are too scared of the two party system resulting in the other team winning to actually affect change. So she has to take what she can get. She doesn't want nuclear plants because of things like Fukushima or Chernobyl. I think climate change is enough of an issue to necessitate nuclear power, but the president is not a dictator. Unless they change the system.

       Can't say I have. I expect Jill will disappear after this election, barring something insane. So it matters less. But other people have presented more detail beyond the usual "wifi causes cancer" complaint I've been hearing, and reasonable thoughts about the nuclear energy, which I also understand. I'd rather have someone who wanted to be more careful with nuclear power than less so (as Donald Trump appears to be considering his thoughts about nuclear weapons and Japan and South Korea) and is in favor of a peaceful foreign policy (unlike Hillary Clinton considering the aggression we are seeing toward Russia) and understands the problems of our criminal justice system and climate change, and has plans to fix it.

       Things like Fukushima and Chernobyl were directly caused by people going against the advice of the engineers and scientists. In Chernobyl they turned off all safety measures and ignored all warning signs, at Fukushima the company which owns the plant were told they should increase the height of the Tsunami wall and move the backup generators to a nearby hill, but that would have cost money and Tsunamis are rare, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, both those reactors are 1960s vintage, they're old, and have positive void coefficients, meaning if cooling fails they melt down, modern reactors have negative coefficients, meaning if cooling fails they just generate more electricity for a bit, which is entirely safe. They cannot fail beyond shutting down for a few days.

       Never said that Jill Stein thinks wifi causes cancer, they said that she thinks it causes "sickness."
      </p>
      <p>
       On wifi Jill Stein said: "A number of scientific studies have raised red flags about possible health effects of WiFi radiation on young children. I do not have a personal opinion that WiFi is or isn't a health issue for children. There is not enough information to know. I do however believe in science. Scientific research should go forward and find out. Countries including Switzerland, Italy, France, Austria, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Israel, Russia and China, have banned or restricted these technologies in schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       These concerns were ignited by a recent National Institutes of Health study that provided some of the strongest evidence to date that exposure to radiation from cell phones and wireless devices is associated with the formation of rare cancers. "
      </p>
      <p>
       She then links to an article which provides no citations and draws its information from an unpublished, non-peer reviewed paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, wifi sends out radiowaves, which are just photons of a wavelenth not visible to the human eye, so essentially, she is scared that light causes cancer in children.

       I was around for the whole Boston Bombing incident, and it's weird how Reddit gets solely blamed for that fiasco when I distinctly remember the majority of the witch hunting threads were based on screenshots from 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a whole lot bullshit flying all over the net for the couple of days after the bombing yet the blame for the aftermath seemed to only settle here.

       I remember reading a conspiracy that stated whenever Boston bombings come up on reddit, there's always an account that shames us (reddit) for pooling our resources and working together. IIRC the conspiracy is that the gov't didn't like how effective so many random citizens can unite and cohesively operate. That's why they shame us, so we remember our 'mistake' the next time we think of doing it.

       He's not wrong about it literally being treason, but only if you're coming from the perspective of a preserver of status quo, or a British loyalist in that time.

       From the perspective of the American revolutionaries, the way Britain was treating the colonies was a betrayal, and therefore treasonous.

       The simple way I see it is that people fall into one of two categories. They either value freedom more than security or vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government wants power and control and it feeds on the desire for security to get it. Eventually it will overstep it's boundaries, and the people who value freedom more than security will take action.

       What do you think is going on? The city of Rome itself was essentially a sovereign nation ruling over vast territories. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire it was an incredibly centralized authority rife with corruption and bureaucrats ignoring the will of their outer colonies. If you want to understand Rome read up on the history and politics of Rome the city itself, not just Rome the territory it ruled over.

       the fact that a handful of users went on to leave voicemails on that (already deceased) person's parent's telephone is very unfortunate, but CANNOT be used to discredit reddit and/or crowdsourced investigations.

       And if she gets in you can forget about it. But everyone keeps saying how many laws she broke, which she did. Who is arresting her? Either they are afraid or part of it. No justice is being done. Information is being released. What she has done disqualifies her, but here she is still on the ballot. It's now obvious to everyone who is paying attention that this government and the heads of agencies that enforce its laws are protecting eachothers interests. As bleak as that is, there is at least one positive. It's exposure. This is the most exposed our government has ever been.

       Wait what?? Screw that, why would you even obey??? If you're prepared to fight someone, you know where the White House will be... If not then do a Muhammad Ali and sit it out. Seriously if HRC is elected and declares a war, you'd literally be a terrorist marching off to fight under the orders of a corrupt criminal if you listen. We're humans, not drones! The Russian population consists of humans too, and Putin seems far superior to HRC right now. If it comes to it, I hope not a single bullet is intentionally fired for Hillary, what a tragedy that would be.

       It would do no good to arrest her or bring forth any legal action while Obama is still in office. He can just issue pardons like Halloween candy. Surely, this is why he's campaigning with her now: so he can be close in case the hammer's about to drop. So close that the pardon is probably already written and just waiting for him to sign, so when agents come to cuff her, Obama waves the pardon at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI needs to wait until Trump wins because then Obama's pardon wouldn't work. If Trump doesn't win, Hillary rigs the elections, or the electors just baulk, I'm sure Trump will cry foul, but then what? At that point, if he were to demand an investigation, we'd be in the same exact boat, but without any chances left.

       You say that as if you know it will actually happen.  Not just a single war but multiple wars, major wars at that.  Why do you think this will happen shortly after she's elected?  No doubt she broke some laws, but how bad was what she did?  I'm honestly asking, it doesn't seem like anything that she did really matters besides the fact that she lied about it.  She's a politician, that's what they do.  I would think if the information was that sensitive it would have some kind encryption, or is important info sent just as other email?

       People have lost their security clearances for less.  A lot fucking less.  Losing your security clearance cost you your livelihood since generally speaking your skills are all tied to you having a clearance.

       Exactly this, but to completely understand the duplicity involved, you need to know this fact.  The US Federal Government operates several internet structures, which are completely independent of the internet everyone else uses.  They each have different classification, so you have a SECRET internet access, a TOP SECRET internet access, and some number of CLASSIFIED internet systems which are only relevant for specific areas, ie Afghanistan has it's own classified internet access (at least it did, don't know if it is still up and active).  To access these different internets, you have to have a computer, a special connection point (ethernet port), and an account to access the computer.  So you login to the computer, the computer has the correct stuff (protocols and what not) to talk to the classified network, and can communicate securely to the rest of the classified network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton was bypassing that encryption by having her people access the data from a classified networks, transfer it to a USB drive, and then removing any marks detailing the the clearance level required to view the material.  This gave the impression that everything sent over her server was not classified.  However, removing it from a classified system is still a felony offense and punishable under anti-terror and espionage laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you may have seen or read the term "SAP" (Pronounce each letter, it is not sap like the tree goo).   SAP stands for Special Access Program.  An SAP is not something that anyone with a specific clearance can access.  Even if you have the highest level of security clearance, (TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION) doesn't mean you have access to everything.  Think of it as being need to know, like our drone program.  The details of our drone program are a heavily guarded secret.  You have to have a need in order to know those details.  They are not given out all willy nilly to any one with a TS/SCI.  Anyways, Clinton had SAP files on her server.  Most people, myself included, just don't understand how you can have SAP files and not know what they are.  SAP files are an entirely different monster from any other classified material.  Dealing with classified information as long as she has been, she should have immediately recognized them for what they were, and not stored them on a system so easily compromised.

       So how do we know that she didnt set this server up as a way to sell government secrets? Just make it vulnerable enough where they can be 'stolen' and if there is any fallout you can blame it on the server meanwhile a large sum of money is deposited into the clinton foundation. Selling classified info with a measure of plausible deniability...

       Also, the thumb drive thing is a logical conclusion.  They could've also printed off documents and then retyped them.  Or have taken pictures of the screen.   However, because of how SAP works, which to the best of my knowledge, all SAP files are on their own individual networks completely separate from any other network.   Literally you walk into a room with a computer and the only thing on this computer is SAP files.

      <p>
       Sure, so at the top of every government document it tells you the classification.  By default, 99% of all documents are C:FOUO, which means Classification:  For Official Use Only.  FOUO is some legal bullshittery that means the government can stop you from giving this piece of paper away or punish you if they find out you did it after the fact.  I've never heard of Uncle Same doing this, but it's there if they really want to go after some poor schmuck and have nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classified material will be marked C: SECRET or C: TOP SECRET or C: CENTRIX (Afghanistan specific classification).
      </p>
      <p>
       On a memo, which is most communications, this is generally placed in the header area of the document, with the highest form of classification of the document.  Then below in the body of the memo or document, you have paragraphs labeled very specifically with "S" or "TS" off to the side.  These stand for, you guessed it SECRET and TOP SECRET.  HRC was asked about those, and she said she didn't know what they were.  However, most people know what they are, and if you can't deduce it you ask.  They are every where, and they stick out.  You don't miss them.  They are in place because of how classifying documents works.  A document might be marked TS, but the information contained within may be only secret or FOUO.  It's only when it is all brought together that it becomes a higher tier of clearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for images and other non-word documents the classification is even more in your face, since it is color-code.  Green = FOUO, Red = SECRET / TOP SECRET, Purple = CENTRIX.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, Team Clinton scrubbed the header marks from memos/docs and deleted the color coding on the other things.  Government email even comes encoded.  If you are using the FOUO system (normal unclassified everyday running of operation system) all your emails are flagged as such.  However, on higher clearance systems, which HRC should have been using for government business, you can set classification label.  So your emails get marked appropriately.  You can talk about things like overthrowing other governments or selling arms to rebels in Africa and flag it as being Top Secret.  HRC's email system CANNOT have that system in place, since it is literally against the law.  People in the email chain could probably guess they were dealing with classified information, but had no way of knowing for sure.  So, the other people involved could feel free to share this information with any Tom, Dick, or Harry on the street, further jeopardizing US security interests around the globe.

       Wow. I've been reading about this scandal for a while but never herd anyone describe it in such detail. So thank you sir. Any chance you'd share your background with us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Clinton has used the excuse that she is technologically challeneged  but I think it's clear that she
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a smart lady and probably knew exactly what she was doing and what the potential consequences could be. So why would she do it? If you chose to editorialize would you have any working hypothesis? "For the sake of convenience" doesn't really sound legit to me.

       As stupid as this sounds, it's because she thinks she is above the law.  She has people she need to answer to, so she setup a system where she could communicate with them.  Well she also had a need to conduct business with the government so she combined those two things into the entity she could control, her email server.  It was a convenience thing, but the only reason you would do that is because you don't think national security protocols would ever apply to you.

       I don't think it sounds stupid, I think that sounds like the most logical explanation. There are so many conflicting viewpoints that I often feel like I don't know what to believe. And they span from her being a good person trapped in a bad situation(due to some level of arrogance) all the way to her being power hungry, corrupt to the core and possibly involved in some of the most heinous crimes &amp; conspiracies imaginable. But yeah the truth probably resides in the most logical explanation. At least I hope so

       They are supposed to sacrifice themselves for the republic, rather than sacrifice the republic for themselves.  For a President, or someone seeking that office, this is that much truer.  Hillary Clinton has, time and again, sacrificed the Republic for her own gain.  Do you think when she becomes President she will cease aggregating power and money, at the expense of her constituents?  Becoming President is merely a notch on her ambition belt that opens the door to checks with more zeroes on them.  She is using all of us for her own personal gain and it's sad that some people refuse to believe that because it's clear as day.

       It doesn't matter if it's private or political, ambition is ambition.  Especially the way you worded it "a notch on her ambition belt that...for a check with more zeros". That's exactly what Trump has been doing for years.  Hell most successful people are ambitious, but some (Clinton and Trump) go to any lengths to do so.

       He's a BUSINESSMAN.  In business the goal is to make money...PERIOD.  She is a civil SERVANT.  Her job is to work hard to make sure the country runs smoothly.

       I think you are missing the point.  If you go back and read your original post, you describe Clinton as ambitious to the point of not caring what has to be done to gain power.  You say it just another notch on her belt.  The whole thing describes Trump very accurately.  Ambition does not equal money, he's a business man, she's a politician.  This doesn't change the fact that both are ambitious.  He was after money while she was after power.  Now that Trump is also a politician, hes using that same ambition to gain political power just as Clinton does.

       The attachment is the most important thing I've seen on reddit. Have you checked the TYT video which Wikileaks retweeted? It refers to an email which mentions these "for-profit" activities and TYT point to it as the smoking gun. It is the one where they complain Chelsea is asking too many questions about her parent's activities and they tell Podesta she needs to back off.  What you've found is more damning than that email. You should tweet it to Cenk and the team at TYT.

       Nancy Schaefer spoke out against the use of CPS to kidnap children en masse and blamed a law that the Clinton administration passed in aiding the practice. She and her husband were both dead very soon after. Maybe she was on to something? Maybe the Clinton Foundation has programs that involve CPS? I think it's worth looking into.

       He wasn't asking how to delete emails. He wanted to change the to/from information in the emails. He was told that reason why what he wanted to do was difficult was because messing with records like that could potentially be illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same guy who they blamed as having an "oh shit" moment and used BleachBit to wipe the server after the subpoena had been issued. Supposedly he deleted all that information on his own, with no instructions from anybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he received immunity from the Department of Justice. Because apparently you just hand that shit out like candy. He was summoned to answer questions in front of a Congressional oversight committee but he chose not to come, citing the 5th Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, why a guy can't testify after he's already been given immunity, I have no idea. However,
       <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4622326/combetta-lied-immunity">
        one member on the committee
       </a>
       believes he lied to the FBI, which would void his immunity agreement. So, it looks like the federal government has handed out a bunch of immunity and received nothing from it.

       Usually: If you cooperate with our investigation and help us catch a bigger criminal by testifying against them, we'll ignore the crimes you committed under that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with Hillary: Fuck it, you get immunity. What do you know?
Guy with immunity: My boss is innocent. I did the crime all by myself
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it's a way to to get underlings to testify against their boss. This way you can jail the mob boss instead of just all the smaller fish who are easily replaceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Combetta, the guy who came to reddit for help, received immunity, said he was the one responsible for deleting emails in an "oh shit" moment. Then refused to even come in front of Congress to answer questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Put in the wrong corrupt person in for Combetta.

       Taking a drill is prudent, but properly wiped files are irrecoverable, regardless of what scaremongers will have you believe. Data wiped with 0s has never been retrieved with greater than 50% accuracy (ie no technique to recover data on hard drives wiped with BleachBit is better than a random guess at what that data may be)

        This guy claims to have done it

      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing which they mention in that thread. These guys put up a contest for $500 for anyone to recover it. This procedure is much more expensive to do. You use a scanning electron microscope apparently to produce the image and it's months of work.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It's months of work
       </em>
       . Who the hell wants to win $500 for months of work? Who the hell is going to spend months of work to prove a point that people pretty much already believe? Generally the unpopular argument here is that it's fine to zero out a disk once, not that you can recover the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is there, and apparently they have done this. It's prohibitively expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, how secure does your data need to be? Really you don't need to worry about this shit if you use full disk encryption anyway. And it's extremely easy to overwrite with random data with more than one pass and make it practically impossible. It's not an issue people will worry about if they encrypt their disk ahead of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're storing emails of this much importance, yeah, you should probably do more than overwrite once with zeroes. There's a chance someone might be willing to spend thousands and months on recovering it. But you're already an idiot if you didn't just use full disk encryption for shit like that. It's really a dumb situation to be in - you have data that someone might spends thousands and months to recover and you didn't bother to just overwrite it two or three times with random data? Or you didn't realize ahead of time that Hillary's emails should be on a fully encrypted disk? It's pretty fucking amateur, but if these guys do it for money, I guess it isn't that infrequent.

       There's also over a dozen women accusing trump of sexual assault, and a 13 year old of rape. Plus there's multiple videos and recordings of trump admitting to and bragging about sexual assault.

       there's as much evidence of Trump touching little girls as there is Hillary touching little girls, so don't start with that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for sexual assault...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that something like 75% of Trump accusers have been proven either false or to be directly tied to the Clinton team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the fact that Clinton has done a whole lot more than delete emails (like being instrumental in destroying the balance of power in the Middle East, rigging the democratic primary..........just took a look at your post history, you're obviously ctr so I'm done with you.  good luck on the 8th, champ.
oh and google "Hillary Clinton 1 in 77 billion"...there's also a study out of Stanford that backs up that notion...it's been 4 months and neither of these studies have been refuted or challenged.

       there exists, quite literally, one single video of Trump JOKING that he grabs women inappropriately.  And technically, there is no "video evidence", you weak shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I don't believe any of them, either.  This guy has been in the public eye since the 70's and apparently these women waited until 1 month before the election to even mention a single word about it?

       O and you want to know why women waited until now to come out? Are you that dense?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they come out earlier, not a single person would believe them. Trump is rich, in the public eye, he's not someone who would assault a woman...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he gets caught on video bragging about assault. Coupled with interviews of him bragging about going into the girls locker room at pageants and watching them dress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then one girl finally gets the courage to come out because people would understand what happened and believe them now. Then the other woman come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens ALL the time. But hey. You go ahead and believe the pathological liar trying to save his sinking ship.

       I like how all you Trump supporters are moping about how Hillary spilled government secrets with a private email server, while at the same time demanding that she release the emails. I'm sure The_Donald has been to at least a couple Eyes Wide Shut parties with Saudi princes. Don't investigate those ties though. It might disagree with your world view. Which is the neighborhood immediately outside your mom's basement.

       Actually, I'm one of the people who thinks Trump's Lolitta expeditions need to be looked into, if in fact they exist.  I am, also, however, a person who believes DJT is an incremental step in the right direction.  He'll get enveloped (if he isn't already) but there's hope that the rampant corruption in DC can be abated somewhat... will it give rise to a new form of corruption?  I would imagine believing anything otherwise would be quite naive.  Either way, on the current course, there can only be one of a few outcomes (very few of them positive).

       Thanks for the blind assumptions though.  Good job.

       Release them to the fbi. And its FAR more than that these days. Practically every day there is a new discovery of her shittiness. Now if anyone can provide as solid of evidence as the podesta leaks about trump, then so be it. As of right now, all I really see are accusations and him saying mean things.

       Fun fact: if no one is shoving the Trump's time with Epstein in the public's face via the mainstream media, it's probably because it's fucking nothing.

       I wouldn't put to much over trump even if this is true, id hold the politicians much more responsible for takeing the bribes. Still bad on trump IF he did bribe them but not nearly as bad as accepting the bribe.

       Working within a corrupt system to get stuff you need done is no where near as bad as being the person who helped create and enforces a corrupt system. Trump wants to win because he knows the system is corrupt and he genuinely seems to care about normal people. Clintons are so out of touch with reality its insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clintons are proven to be corrupt, Trump may not be corrupt, and Id rather have a shot at no corruption than no shot at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus all the propaganda and missinformation from the Democrats, combined with the corruption. Who could support that.

       No offence but that's ridiculous. The sub rules say it is explicitly for Donald supporters. If you got banned it's because you announced you weren't a supporter.

       Its laughable how many people honestly think Trump is a clean non corrupted outsider businessman. If you can invite a president to play golf and to a wedding and they show up then you are part of the establishment. You can not make  me believe an outsider can do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can pay off AG's, Senators, and state officials for favors and get away with it then you are not someone to fix the problem, you are a part of it. Especially if you brag about it. Trump seems human, but both him and Clinton are corrupt liars. He just is more persuasive.

       It's because it's all vote manipulation on that sub. It's the only reason why they have dozens of post on the frontpage and the rising page constantly. Quite literally impossible to be that "high energy", it's mostly bots. 6k+ upvotes and less than 100 comments? Right...

       “Air America meets  Traffic meets Pineapple Express”
      </p>
      <p>
       A steady diet of movies like the upcoming ‘Mena’ starring Tom Cruise playing the supposedly-swashbuckling former Air America  pilot Barry Seal, has given the movie-going public the idea that the real action in the illegal drug trade is in drug trafficking.

       So giving you the benefit of the doubt on the acts -- I think you misunderstand the purpose and scope of RICO.
      </p>
      <p>
       x1. That's for state bribery laws. I'm not sure what state bribery laws you'd suggest she broke. I believe they generally apply only to state officials, and she hasn't been one since she became SoS.
      </p>
      <p>
       x2.  Money laundering -- I know you don't like the way the money moves here, but I don't there there's anything in the materials here (and yes, I read them) that suggest money laundering. Racketeering? Unless you explain further, I have zero idea what you're getting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       x2a. Bribery is a bit strange -- but if what you and the people around here assert is true, I think there could be a RICO charge. My first thought was that the predicate offense was giving bribes, but the law (18 USC 1961) is drafted so that any violation of 18 USC 201 counts, and indeed, RICO has been used to prosecute such crimes. (edit: when I say "if what you assert is true" I mean the assertion that there is prosecutable bribery. I'm not convinced personally and don't think the info provided adds up to a triable case.)
      </p>
      <p>
       x3. You don't get to rewrite the law. It's embezzlement of union funds, not any funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       x4. Again, this is for securities fraud, which is a pretty narrow term and almost certainly doesn't apply to the administration of a §501 non profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       x5. Are you saying that her purported goal of "open borders" = adding or assisting aliens in illegally entering? The link you provide seems to suggest that any failure to perfectly police all US borders is tantamount to "assisting aliens to illegally enter."
      </p>
      <p>
       x6. Well, I'm not gonna go there.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say it takes a lot more effort to rebut/ refute than to make up accusations -- and I guess they're right. In your shotgun spray of random guesses at the law, you hit exactly one thing.  The receipt of bribes, as a violation of federal bribery laws is a cognizable RICO predicate act.

       I think you know there are plenty of people who don't think there's anything prosecutable there. I probably should have expected that you'd take me literally, such that citing a whole mess of people who dislike Hillary seems useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not be useful for me to cite political friends of Hillary saying she's innocent, and it's not useful for you to cite her enemies saying she's guilty. If you've got a respected and at least nominally non-partisan legal source, I'd love to hear it.

      <p>
       And not even because I doubt you, but because I'd love to hear a thorough and professional analysis on either side.

       edit: incidentally, my guess is that this sort of vague influence peddling is so much "the way things are done" (read: lobbying) in congress and the rest of Washington that most of the elected government would not be keen on setting a precedent here.

       Dude, she's talking about
       <em>
        changing

       the law, not
       <em>
        breaking

       the law. Also, she claims she was just talking about trade, not people, but even she wants to change the law for people, that's not illegal, just dishonest.

       Could you be more specific about securities fraud, embezzlement, bribery? I can't see what you're talking about.

       There's plenty of that in the rest of the thread. I've already answered your question. Further, the video in the first link eli5's it all for you. You think this thread just magically got to the front page?

       You'd either need to spend an unreasonable amount of time on this, or have a glossary. There are some many acronyms and terms that imply things, but one needs a glossary to reasonably parse this. Unless theyve followed every detail of the email crap, which most people on Reddit have not done. I skimmed your links... which one shows any of these things? I'm still not seeing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I mean, seriously, there's nothing anywhere about securities or other investment vehicles other than thise typical with non-profits. Im not asking you to provide the burden of proof - though, if these things do exist in the emails, it would be easy to point it out - but to perhaps link to what, exactly, has anything to do with securities fraud.

       Wikileaks is a primary source, not a verification. Someone has to say, "yup we did what that thing says." Glen Greenwald also seems to not trust your source material either. And Google is a search engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know what CTR means and I had to look up Glen Greenwald. Honestly I'm just seeing this stuff on my front page and it concerns me as a believer in journalism.

       I'm no CTR but you've lost me at your comments here.  Had high hopes. I lost all hope you had real proof when you said Clinton RICO'd on illegal immigrants because she stated dreams of a world beyond borders. You know talking about the future isn't a crime right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a crazed loon, and I hope people scroll this far, to see how silly the "real charges" are.

      <p>
       Seriously, your link for cover up is just a bunch of emails talking a memo, for Bill? Right? Jesus dude. There's zero evidence here, unless you do a better job of presenting it. I agree with the mod that deleted your shit.

       First off, your argument is

        a logical falacy

       .

       Secondly, even if you exclude the the borders issue, it does not invalidate the other issues. You don't have to hit every point on the RICO dartboard in order to have a case brought against you. If your only arguement is that she didn't bring aliens over the border, then you're not doing a very good job.

       Then why present false ones with your shit?? Lol you realize that to convince people, you have to try? You drop all this here and circle jerk, and snap back at anyone challenging your "evidence".  Even now, you're not trying to convince me, you can't even defend I just made that shows a huge part of your comments to be idiotic, the immigration shit. Why bother posting it, if you know it's wrong, and it's not a key part of your argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       Right, because you'd be ok lying and twisting the facts to suit your own message. And I'm supposed to spread your message? How would I look? Pretty stupid if I think Clinton could be tried for bringing in illegal immigrants based on the quote about green energy and open borders in a future pipe dream.

       Never said it was false. Just said that without that particular point, the RICO argument still stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say this: That argument is not directly drawn from the evidence presented here. It is, in fact, over 20 years old referencing the Clinton activities in Mena, AR. That is probably well past the statute of limitations. You'll learn more about that after Hillary is indicted, when they do her documentary. Yes, her campaign wants open borders, and that's their selling point. That's not why they want open borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mean time, feel free to actually come up with an argument that invalidates the grounds for a RICO case against Clinton Foundation.

       You really don't understand how accusations work. You can't just say someone is guilty of something and then claim "the evidence is out there go find it!". The burden of ACTUAL proof falls on you as the one making claims that someone has broken the law..don't get lazy now bud you're so close to bringing her down!

       Lmao sure if that's what you need to believe to maintain your superiority complex. I read the post, I don't necessarily disagree with everything OP said. I was simply stating that an argument with sources (as in actual links to evidence or quotes) is going to be more valid and taken more seriously. But this sub only cares about circle jerking not making arguments that might actually convince someone to change their vote or volunteer for Trump.

       Honestly I was just being a dick because all your comments were malicious. I've never been a fan of this sub but the amount of evidence, proof, sources they provide now revolving around the Clinton investigations and the email leaks are unprecedented (for this sub).  I thought op drew rational conclusions from the sources provided.  Also the new FBI statement that just came out kind og gives it more traction.

       This sub has never had more posters of valid and well sourced and researched material than right now. I've lost count this last few weeks of the sheer number of people who have found their way here with your exact same story. Welcome to r/conspiracy aka r/politicalreality.

       I think it was yesterday, maybe the day before but there have been a few previous discussions of possible RICO investigations into the Clinton Foundation over the last few days.  If you use the search feature you should be able to find them maybe you can find other points and documents you may not have seen.

       For me, it's not percentages. It's significance. There is false flag CT all the time to impact those percentages. There are things we are flat wrong about constantly. But that one time MKUltra, or falsified yellow cake WMDs, or project mockingbird... I'm not going to list them all. But these are significant. And I don't mind, in fact, I would rather  be wrong all the time.

       While the basis for the argument is factual, the way of dismissing and otherwise derailing the argument regardless of the point of view of the other side has put the shill at a stumble.

       John Kerry was never swiftboated?  I hope you're joking and I just can't see the context.  The term "swiftboating" is named after political attacks that were used against Kerry in his presidential run to demean his opposition to Vietnam despite being a veteran.  The swift boats were mentioned in an ad and were the crux of the attack.  That term wouldn't exist without Kerry and that election.  So, again, I hope you're joking in saying "Kerry never got swiftboated".

       Come the 8th I'll carry on moderating without all this political asshattery clogging up the sub. As a Brit I don't really think it particularly matters which representative of Goldman Sachs, the Deep State and the M.I.C you vote for, you're all fucked either way. I'm always OK with banning rule breaking though, like yourself. One more down.

       OP:
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn how to present a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like when my clients send me an email with like 11 attachments and say 'Here's the supporting evidence.' I say: 'Fine. It'll take me at least an hour to peruse each of these emails, taking notes, cross-referencing one to another, trying to work out
       <em>
        which
       </em>
       bits of each attachment
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       think are relevant to the case you are trying to make, and then producing a written summary for my own use and finally responding to you to check that I've understood everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        OR
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You could put your argument in writing, referring to the attachments, so that I can understand in a few minutes what would otherwise take me a long time to work out.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of these is going to cost you £100s, the other about a tenth of that.'
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same here. I have limited time to follow arguments people are making on reddit - I have a job, and a life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say you have "proof" of wrongdoing, make your argument, and link to the supporting evidence as you go along. I'm not trawling through great chunks of text in the hope that I can work out what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       think is 'evidence' - let alone 'proof'.

       Edit: I don't watch 18 minute long videos produced by people I've never heard of allegedly setting out theories about wholesale conspiracies which run counter to my extensive experience of real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       do is read a paragraph summarising the allegations because that takes me 30 seconds and not a third of an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I take that approach is that in the 20 odd years since I first had access to the internet, too many of these videos that I have been invited to watch have been (quite apart from sometimes being almost unwatchable) complete and utter bollocks from start to finish, sloppy arguments, inadequate evidence, begging the question, logic fails, unjustified assumptions, jumping the gun, every sloppy technique.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Proof' that Harold Smith got a blow job from Elaine Jones is a video in which they are both clearly identifiable and there's no evidence of tampering via Adobe Premiere Pro. Demonstrating that they were once at the same party and seen talking together and that Elaine has given blow jobs to other people and that Harold has had blow jobs from other people and that Daryl Hackenback wrote an email to his mother saying that he thought there was something fishy about them being at the same party - there's nothing there.

       So - time consuming and inconclusive. I'm not a speed reader, but I can certainly read an email a bloody sight quicker than someone reading it out aloud.
      </p>

       I wouldn't dream of linking to an 18 minute video without either i) saying exactly what the video is and probably ii) giving a time check for the relevant clip.

       The Young Turks are liberal/progressive smart guys who have quite a following, and have for a while, although their popularity have fallen off. I watch them from time to time because they do their research, even if I don't share their politics and, therefore, their conclusions. You do yourself a disservice not to know them.

       There are at least a thousand things I want to do. I'm currently working through the kings of England on Wikipedia, one at a time from William of Normandy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some things, therefore, I don't have time for, and 18 minute conspiracy videos
       <em>
        at first blush
       </em>
       are one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt I had to go and watch the O'Keefe video, because it was referenced so many times. Afterwards, I felt I'd probably lost some IQ points. So, if someone posts 'Proof! Somebody you know has been accused of fifty things she never actually did, has done something wrong', I'm going to want something more direct than a link to an 18 minute video before investigating.

       Up to you.  You've spent the same time arguing that it was a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Washington Post article is a bit sanitized. The TYT vid actually shows the actual email snippets, but it doesn't constitute legal evidence.  It shows that the lawyer, Band, being upset at Chelsea asking questions about things, stating that his clients don't really care about the fund, shows the millions that the firm has made for both the fund and Bill Clinton broken down by year, and he points out that they stand to earn $66M over the next decade, and that Chelsea's interference jeopardizes should the media find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable people can see the veiled threat, but it obviously it can be argued differently in court because the essential point, what the Clintons have done in return, is missing.

       Still unlikely to watch anybody's 18 minute video linked by someone saying 'ACTUAL PROOF' (hey, block caps - it must be significant, right?) of fundamental wrongdoing by someone who's regularly accused of wrongdoing by people who have a a grudge and a mental block but it always turns out that they're adding 2+2 and making 41, and the alleged proof is hardly even evidence, let alone proof.

       Lol so maybe do your own research like everyone else? If you've noticed, there have been several Clinton dumps over the last few weeks. It's in the examination process, notice how most of these posters are adding info they have found for themselves on top of what is posted. If you want a tl;dr than you have to wait until the evidence is examined more, you can't expect instant gratification in this it takes time. All these leaks add a few more pieces to a puzzle, it's impossible to give definitive answers at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr people really need to take some time and examine the evidence for themselves and draw their own conclusions with the facts laid out in front of them.

         Is it likely that Hillary Clinton has done things that some people won't approve of? Of course. In the history of the human race has probably never been a politician whose every act met with universal approval.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is it likely that Hillary Clinton has been involved in wholesale financial fraud or political deceit, as she is frequently accused of? No. It's not impossible, but it's highly unlikely. This is a conclusion which one would reach
         <em>
          prima facie
         </em>
         about any senior politician.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Therefore, if I'm browsing Reddit and I read the thread title "this is ACTUAL PROOF…" I am motivated to look and see whether – against likelihood – someone has produced solid evidence, or even proof, that Hillary Clinton is indeed the sort of person that Republican diehards accuse her of being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have absolutely no intention of spending hours trawling the World Wide Web in an effort to discover something which I consider to be highly improbable. But I will look at a Reddit post to see what it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far every leak has turned out to be wishy-washy and every accusation has turned out to be unfounded, except for the original allegation that she used a personal server for her emails against department regulations.

       Shouldn't the fact that there is a new leak on her every other day point to the direction of scum? The fact she knowingly broke the law by having her own unsecured server in an attempt to keep control of information should be enough to disqualify her from any political position, especially considering she very much ordered destruction of evidence. This is fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the actual security concern she ignored. That guy Guccifer wasn't a hacker, he was some guy who read Hillary's autobiography and guessed her password. He read her emails every fucking morning with his coffee, and gets extradited for imprisonment. All the while saying that she has no reason to believe annnnyyyone in the world could have possibly read any emails besides that one guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political and presidential candidates shouldn't openly say politicians should have a public side and a business side, because they just shouldn't. It's immoral to lie to the people you represent. So much for having a president that inspires you.

       There's no evidence of that. You are imposing your own conclusion on a fact. As a matter of law/logic you have to demonstrate that that was her motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, there were breaches of security. But the head of the FBI, a known Republican, was unable to find the evidence necessary to prosecute her.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no evidence she lied, either - so far as I am aware. People say, e.g. 'She said there were no confidential emails, but there were, she said there were not emails marked confidential, but there were'. In fact, she said there were no emails with 'confidential' headers and there weren't; the FBI accepted that she didn't realise that a portion header 'C' could mean confidential. And only 3 emails out of the bunch had even a 'C' portion header.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, she made mistakes. Yes, she was culpable for those mistakes. But to constantly assert - as has been happening for the past six months at least - that she has lied and that she had some ulterior motives is simply to state a belief that is not grounded in the evidence, but represents a personal conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should say I'm English, living in England, so my assessment is as objective as it gets. (Apart from the fact that the prospect of a Trump presidency is truly terrifying.)

       Okay so even though there are X many emails still unreleased, not a matter of national national security - ok. Just knowingly set up an insecure server. Whatever. How about the fact that she obviously rigged this election against the person that ACTUALLY was beating Trump in the polls. What's the precedent for the head of the DNC stepping down after being implicated in being unbiased towards candidates, and then immediately made head of the campaign for the person she was accused of favoring?

       She's a snake, and a liar and a cheater. It really doesn't take a genius to figure out she's scum. Stop arguing like a lawyer and think like a person. Just because something is in the grey area of legal doesn't make it right. I just can't see myself ever supporting a candidate I consider immoral.

       I've tried to get my dad interested in reddit but at 80 years of age he's mostly interested in gardening and hanging out with his friends. My mum's a little younger, but she goes on the internet almost entirely to check the lottery, send and receive emails, and buy stuff.

       First off, genuinely nice deflection. 2 how many friends can your dad really have? And 3 your mom would have better odds playing online blackjack than winning the lottery, why do you let them set their money on fire?

       My dad has quite a lot of friends. There's a couple of ladies that used to come over for 'doll classes' with my (deceased) step-mother - they used to make replica dolls, right through from making the heads out of clay and firing them, through to making their clothes. Then there's the widow of one of his best friends from the RAF. Then there's the six or seven people in his Thursday evening art group (more wine and gab than art, but still), and then his neighbours on both sides. Come to think about it, his social life's better than mine. (Although he grumbles a lot more.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My mum gets several hours of pleasure each week thinking about what she'd do with her winnings: a £million to me, a £million to my sister, a nice new house with a big garden not more than a couple of miles from where she lives now, a new car for my step-father, a £million to my step-brother, a £million to my auntie... at £2 a throw it's better value than a cinema ticket!
      </p>
      <p>
       I forget what we were arguing about. This is more fun. How about your parents?

       If your mom was smart she'd study poker theory and get addicted to something a bit more rewarding, buy her tournament poker by Sklansky and maybe a hook her up with some poker forums, maybe she could make a return on investment instead of hoping.

       My dad is actually manically depressed lately, on SSI for bipolar and living by himself. I'm the only person he has and I really don't know how to help when he reaches out to me as I'm 23 and supporting a household and struggle with bipolar issues as well. My mom's better now than when I was a kid and enjoys the freedom from having to support me as she had me at a very young age. I asked her if my gf and myself could move back home if we ever got behind on our rent and she assured me that would not be possible, so our relationship is strained. Poor families suck.

       My mum's not addicted to the lottery. My stepdad goes down to the shop once a week to buy two tickets.
       <em>
        Then

       she luxuriates in all the pleasurable fantasies. Poker would be too-oo stressful.

       Sorry to hear about your dad - and your mom. Also, that you are at risk of falling behind in your rent. That's rough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not entirely comfortable, but at this time I'm in no danger of being unable to pay rent. I have had problems in the past. One time while I was studying law my landlord said 'If you can't afford the rent, skip it for a while until your on solid ground'. He was a good bloke. (His father was a very nasty East End gangster.)

       Bipolar - wow. I have no end of health issues but fortunately no mental health issues (is that acceptable terminology now?) I had a client who'd been diagnosed with schizophrenia - actually, my clients were his parents. His mother could not bring herself to accept that her son was really unwell - he'd stabbed his father in the neck and talked about aliens making him kill his brother - she thought that all he needed was regular meals and a mother's love. I suppose I'm trying to say that we all have shit to deal with and although you gotta play the hand you were dealt, other people know and sympathise with what you're going through and may be going through similar shit as well.

       Eh not truly complaining just indulging my weaker side. I have my girlfriend, cat and weed to keep me happy, life is genuinely better than it ever was at home. I've spent a lot of time helping people in worse situations than myself these past few years, and appreciate I live much more comfortably than many others. As someone who grew up poorer than anyone I know, and being as observant and informed as I have always been, that's why I feel the way that I do about politicians being a shit show. Everyone my age knows the system is rigged against us so it makes it much harder for people like me who come from garbage. It's too easy to get trapped in the same ghetto you were born in, never seeing the world, never really living. Our country is broken, and it makes me sad how far conversations can stray without accomplishing anything. That's why I'm so sad about this election, nobody wins, just everybody loses.

       I don't think it's right to say that
       <em>
        the system
       </em>
       is rigged. What it is, is that the rich and powerful have more ability to exploit the system, and the poor and powerless have very little.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important because this provides context. The rich and powerful have always exploited the system (or, nearly always). It's how England turned from a Saxon country to a Norman country, it's how the Confederate south funded the war, it's how Spanish and Portuguese royalty carved out empires in the new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But things are getting better. No-one was worrying about elections in the fifteenth century, because governments and administrations were monarchies and dictatorships. It might not have arrived quickly enough for you and your family, but the introduction of democracy is pretty much irreversible (like the appearance of atmospheric oxygen on Earth) and eventually societies will be fair - perhaps not totally fair, but enough so that it doesn't make a big difference.

       Very true, and your point isn't lost on me. But at the same time, the people who have been in control have stood by as the world was destroyed, who support the people making the most money off of the most immoral things. We as a people can do far more damage in a much shorter time than at any point in history, thus requiring us to be more responsible as a whole because the failures would be more devastating now than they have in the past. Which we are not doing now, this entire election is irresponsible as fuck. Either way rights will be lost. The only thing the candidates agree on is that people on the federal watchlist (a list that requires no due process) should not bear arms (constitutional right). Hillary supports fracking and Trump doesn't even believe in global warming. This global climate is a travesty.

       Believe me, if Hillary is elected, the US will be far more responsive to climate change issues than it has ever been. Plus, while I wouldn't want to encourage people in power to act as if global warming isn't a threat, the way it will work is this: as the problems get more imminent and more serious, more money and effort will be spent in solving the problems. People like Elon Musk are leading the way, but where I am - for example - they are constructing a huge wind farm out to sea - dozens of giant wind generators in long rows. Eventually, there will be a tipping point and suddenly renewables will be cheaper than oil, and then it will all change.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are already working on atmospheric scrubbers, which will remove greenhouse gases from the air and do something useful with it; they'll do the same thing with sea water.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is enough; already there are serious threats to peoples lives and livelihoods all over the world. But there isn't going to be a global disaster.

       I'm not entirely convinced that she would say no to big oil and yes to climate response. You're likely right about waiting for disaster before reacting but it's so frustrating watching these people piss our tax money away while people like me have never even come close to getting ahead. We could probably talk for days but it's really not getting anywhere. I understand she is the lesser of two evils, but I refuse to say I support either of them. It's just hypocritical by nature.

       Back when Adam Vs The Man was actually worth watching, you know, before the Tea Party RNC merger, TYT was also reputable. Now they're in a fishbowl, with only their own constituents to provide feedback. That being said, you're right. Perfect summary. And remember, he's only talking about the Dow deal, there's plenty of other material there, and I expect we'll be hearing about soon. I can't keep up with wikileak's release schedule now. 2 dumps today alone.

       which brings us back to the whole conspiracy theory that Trump is actually hired by Clinton to run against her so that compared to him she will look like a good choice.  I laughed the first time I heard that, now it seems to be making more and more sense every day....

       Im honestly glad its Trump. As bad as a person people think he is, he is not a politician, nor had had a real career in politics. I think that adds a dimension to him that gives me hope.

       Doug Band asked Bill Clinton play golf with CEO Kelly of Dow Chemicals for which he was paid 500,000, AND to give a speech at a DOW dinner, for which he was paid 150,000. Clinton did it in 2009 but word leaked out in 2011/12, causing the Foundation to cover it up by relinquishing Band's services.

       Oh yeah, I left that part out on purpose. Shortly there after, in 2009, Kelly was given special access to then Secretary Clinton at the same time he was embroiled with litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint venture that would have netted Dow 9BN$ in cash.

       I don't see a video anywhere in the OP. She was the ruling party at the trial? She influenced the judge to rule in favor of Dow? She threatened the opposing council? How did anyone in the Clinton foundation get involved. Paying for a round of golf with a big wig is not a crime.

       That was ...incredibly weak. Deleting emails does not, in and of itself prove that misdeeds were committed. It's extremely common in organizations that are subject to public records requests or are political in nature. These are all extremely shady characters to be sure but if that's the best anyone can come up with for prosecutable evidence I'm abandoning this thread.

       we have here cenk ugyur explaining that donations to the clinton foundation were rewarded with a favorable ear from the politicians involved.  this is a pretty regular occurrence, actually, politicians are given money and in return those who give money are rewarded with attention.  this process is called
       <em>
        lobbying
       </em>
       .  generally, this attention is rewarded for contributions to campaigns rather than charity, which seems like pretty much strictly better.  dont tell me you're naive enough to think that this sort of scandal isn't commonplace in DC
      </p>
      <p>
       this ranks as a 2/10 on the conspiracy scale (2/10 for "Unsurprising or expected result, leak is ignored by mainstream media for lack of public interest, or is buried under other second page news within a few days", for context, Snowden was more like a 4/10).  It's not a major conspiracy, nor the root of all evil, let alone a world-government level discovery.  nobody died, nobody was killed and buried in a park, and nobody bribed somebody to stop investigating them in court... this is not even the biggest conspiracy to break this election season, not even the biggest clinton conspiracy this season.  if i were you i would be a little bit less melodramatic and dig deeper to find something a bit more exciting

       My retort is that this isn't just lobbying for votes in congress on some pet charity case, this is bribing the executive branch to take actions against a foreign entity.

       That's fair, it's still pretty uncomfortable and like definitely we need reforms to the political system to prevent stuff, but it's hardly remarkable.  Clinton and insiders will continue to pull shit and nobody will be able to do anything.  Honestly, for all the problems with Clinton i can't really hope she doesn't win the presidency, as Trump would most likely be worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need to really continue to put pressure on the government over the next four years to have an independent leftist movement and so that we can start reforming at midterm season.  Or I suppose I could move to somewhere with condorcet voting or something

       Remember, most of the people wrapped up in this scandal are leftists. Brazile, Kaine, et al. For all our pressure we've had so far, the government has proven to be far more adept at stopping us. (Read: occupy wallstreet.)

       The clintons have their tendrils in everything, DOJ, FBI, MSM. That's who they refer to in the emails as surrogates. I dived into this a little bit here:

       There's been talk of a movement to oust these plants by the intel communities, as well as speculation that the leaks themselves are provided by none other than the NSA. Perhaps the nsa are like that batman movie, and all this 5 eyes prism shit was really just to trap hillary and when she's in jail and the gov't resets, they'll enter the destruct command and dismantle the data center in utah.

       I mean, in a narrow sense, yeah, but I would imagine that things expand far beyond the level of quid pro quolitics.  As far as the email thing, if there's anything here, it's something big.  The question is how much is connected.  Kaine seems like a petulant child, so I doubt he's involved, and the Brazile thing is frankly just stupid (wait you mean there would be questions on the flint water poisoning in flint michigan?!?!?), but as for the emails are we looking at a huge structure or several small structures.  Comey is a republican and the timing of the Weiner thing seems designed to affect the election, but it seems ineffective to the point that either Comey is relatively unimportant in the underlying structure, or he's a fool, or he's a fall guy for a conspiracy designed to look like the Clinton left is under attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the efforts by the citizenry have been pretty pathetic up to this point.  Like you don't even need a masterful conspiracy to deal with a bunch of dudes chilling in central park grilling hot dogs and filling out FOIA requests.  Really if there's real change you want somebody deep on the inside, not a mook like snowden, but somebody with real power and influence, to go public and do damage, while becoming high enough profile that they don't just accidentally light their flat on fire

       <li>
        Kaine, after being promised VP, steps down as DNC Chair

        Debbie Weisman steps up as DNC Chair, colludes to get HRC nomination

       <li>
        DNC and HRC team collude to rearrange primary dates to favor HRC

       <li>
        Donna Brazile feeds HRC questions from upcomming debates. (The flint question was not the only time she was fed questions)

       true, but is that ring of conspirators doing anything that doesn't get done constantly in washington.  if you want to tell me that the government is corrupt, fine, if you want to present examples of crime under our noses, great, but dont' assume these people are dumb.  if this were the worst thing out there, the real secrets, it wouldn't have been leaked.  this is essentially the scraps that get tossed to the dogs on the outside to misdirect us from the real newsworthy stuff

       I think you're falling victim to the either or bullshit. Most redditors, and people for that matter, think that you either HAVE to vote Hill the Shill or Donald Dickhead. So because you posted anti-Hillary stuff, you must be a Trump supporter. It happens to me on here all the time. I can't stand either. They both should be in jail. Yet as soon as I point out any documented wrongdoing by either, their fanatic acolytes jump down my throat armed with fervor and willful ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we're also in agreement that the current predicament's fault lies with the dems. They colluded to oust Bernie. They did their best behind the scenes to get Trump the primary win because they thought he was the most beatable. This is the election the establishment dems colluded to give us. I don't think I've ever been so angry at the political climate in this country than I am right now.

       That's such a line of bullshit, though. Just look at the damned subreddit. It's entirely made up of crossposts from
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       From their sidebar: "THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT CLINTON HAS COMMITTED TREASON LEVEL CRIME... WE MUST CONTINUE TO EXPOSE THESE SEVERE CRIMES SO THAT THE CLINTON ESTABLISHMENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY SEIZE POWER UNDEMOCRATICALLY." (Caps theirs, as apparently the entire subreddit is populated solely by people with broken Caps Lock keys).
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't some even-handed, sane, reasoned attempt to sift through released emails to determine the truth. This is a witch-hunt, plain and simple. It's ludicrous to claim that it's apolitical, when the clearly-stated goal is to destroy one candidate.

       The sound of a sizzling load of incoherent conspiracy bullshit just like this subreddit. Reddit managed to fuck up pretty badly in their hunt for the Boston bomber, why should I believe any of these capslock tabloid headlines? I've already seen and called out many Trump supporters making completely unbased claims while they, in the same sentence, link to an article that completely counters their argument. It's pretty clear these guys are just making shit up to instill some subliminal mind-control propaganda strategy. Come on. People are real quick to out Clinton trolls when nobody bats an eye over the garbage spewing out of

       He will win the popular vote by 4 million votes, and electoral votes by 40.. he'll get 305.. this is brexit 2.0.. why would you believe any polling? The media is covering up everything for Clinton, im not basing anything off what CNN says. I actually have a strong belief New Jersey is going red. I put 1k at 10-1 odds on it

       I believe in the polling because frankly saying otherwise is bullshit. Obviously some polls are going to be biased, so I use 538's Poll Aggregate to average the good polls and weed out the bad ones. It was the most accurate estimate in the previous two elections.

       Keep in mind that the majority of the current Trump upswing is largely from Gary Johnson loosing 50% of his support over the past week.

       TBH he would have had to win every "battleground" state to have a chance, but that conclusion was made before this crazy map started to unfold. Mind if I ask why you decided to vote for Trump?

       Well to start off, she is the most corrupt and criminal politician I've ever seen. She should be in jail, it's amazing her followers were ignorant to this. I don't agree with everything Trump says but for the most part I agree with his philosophy. Cut corporate taxes, lower income taxes, increase fiscal stimulus, get the illegal immigrants out of our country.

       I agree that Clinton was a terrible choice in candidate, and has some serious scandals that need to be resolved with her. If she was facing Romney I would have stayed home. However, saying supporters were "ignorant" of this is like saying you are "ignorant" of many of Trump's outlandish statements (which he either won't or can't act upon as president, which is why I'm not worried about the future like other people). Both sides took the flaws of their candidate and decided that they weren't as important as the other issues at stake, which is why they made that decision in the first place.

       the highest margins I can find in Trump's favor are about +5 (+1 among polls carrying any weight), and way more of the polls have shown him down by more than that.

       You're not wrong. Trump is a fuck up. No doubt. He sticks his foot in his mouth at every chance he gets. I could say the same thing as he is with the same intention and nuance it so it would be politically correct. He just is a hamfisted blowhard.

       However, I will vote for him because the alternative is horrendous. What is the choice, a jerk who says shit that is offensive and cringey as hell or a corrupt, pathological liar who may or may not get her enemies dead. People sure as hell have a penchant for dying after crossing the Clinton Crime family.

       hell, most of the folks people claim the Clintons killed didn't even have anything to do with the Clintons.  like that dude who got killed in a weightlifting accident- he wasn't set to testify to the FBI, there was nothing connecting him to the email case before it showed up on online rags after he died.

       Another one of his dumb "dad" jokes. Unlike Hillary who has had so many associates die they actually refer to the phenomenon as "Arkacide" . I wonder how long Huma is going to last before she has a chance to speak to FBI again.

       Trump is just one giant Poe's Law. He and his campaign staff haven't given any indication as to whether he really meant that or not, his supporters assume he's kidding and everyone else is getting nervous. Especially since he followed up with "Why are we even having an election, why can't we just award it to me right now?".

       Hillary wanted to use a drone to kill Snowden, or was it Assange? I forget which. Her staff thought it was a joke but she didn't crack a smile and continued on as if she meant it as a question for planning and discussion.

       Well, these sorts of comments are dangerously toeing the line of what is acceptable for anyone in modern society. What he describes as "locker room talk" is not really something people should be saying in the first place. Furthermore, several cases have arisen regarding past interactions of exactly what he described, that he will go to court for on November 28th. A few of the assumed victims have received enough death threats to back out of press conferences, which is not something I would consider normal human behavior.

       In all the videos of rally violence I've seen, Trump supporters scream obscenities at literally everyone else as police try to hold them back. This is further supported by Trump edging some of them on personally, claiming that he would pay their legal fees if they choose to do something more violent.

       Well, he's done worse things with his foundation, has managed to insult every minority that has more than 1% of the voting block, refuses to release his tax returns, is currently under investigation for a number of alleged sexual assaults, plans on draining the federal budget $1 trillion, and has backpedaled on almost all of his major talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile his supporters continue to use violence and intimidation tactics, including burning churches and booby trapping campaign signs at election offices. He has also made statements to the effect that these people should not accept a Hillary victory if it happens, encourages them to physically attack protestors that show up, and say that they should try "exercising their second amendment rights" (AKA shooting people). He has been claiming that the election is rigged for moths before the election even started so that if he looses he already has a narrative spread out for people to latch onto.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that hard to see why people would think he's worse off. Hell, I've talked to people who think his entire campaign was based off of controlling people through pandering, violence and fear.

       I'm normally an independant. What I've said so far are valid complaints that I've heard from people. Clinton's foundation scandal is also a valid complaint. I'm not spinning this in either direction, I'm just pointing out a rather common opinion who apparently hadn't heard it before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly your reaction is a little over the top. One would think a supporter would be okay with the faults of their candidate, otherwise how could they justify making the decision they made? Nobody's perfect, so you have to take candidate's flaws into account as well.

       I'm pretty sure the Clintons weren't in charge of the CIA in the 80s... what are you even talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what's nuts about what I said?  The first part was just talking about the Spanish-American and Phillippine-American Wars and that was following up on a century of state-sanctioned slavery (350 years total) and a century and a half of state-instituted genocide.  And Trump's suggested we kill the families of terrorists for... revenge(?) and that we stop giving civilians warnings (because that worked out so well in the early drone strikes right?)- between that and his hatred for nation-building how is that gonna un-destroy the Middle East?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        President Clinton was asked at his Oct. 7 press conference about Mena, a small town and airport in the wilds of Western Arkansas. Sarah McClendon, a longtime Washington curmudgeon renowned for her off-the-wall questions, wove a query around the charge that a base in Mena was "set up by Oliver North and the CIA" in the 1980s and used to "bring in planeload after planeload of cocaine" for sale in the U.S., with the profits then used to buy weapons for the Contras. Was he told as Arkansas governor? she asked.
       </p>
       <p>
        "No," the president replied, "they didn't tell me anything about it." The alleged events "were primarily a matter for federal jurisdiction. The state really had next to nothing to do with it. The local prosecutor did conduct an investigation based on what was in the jurisdiction of state law. The rest of it was under the jurisdiction of the United States Attorneys who were appointed successively by previous administrations. We had nothing - zero - to do with it."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       okay, so not only was he not in a position to tell the CIA what to do (because it was the 80s), he didn't even know about it?  what was this WSJ editorial supposed to prove?

        In a mix of wild rumor and random fact, Mena has also been a topic of ubiquitous anti-Clinton diatribes circulated by right-wing extremists - an irony in that the Mena operation was the apparent brainchild of the two previous and Republican administrations.

       Further, the server handled both private and work-related messages if I'm not mistaken- sending her either of those, but especially the former, does not constitute "depositing a document with a clerk or officer of any court of the United States"

       Taking money for favors from a government official is bribery, which is illegal. Using an organization to collect this money is a racket, and also laundering it through that organization. This can be prosecuted under a RICO indictment.

       Alls I can say is I have not seen anything negative about Clinton on reddit in a few weeks. All anti Trump posts or posts that are trying to sway whoever said opinion on him to the negative.

       There are a few subs that are constantly posting anti-Hillary stuff.  Just go to r/all and look at all the pro Trump subs.  It's such a disparity that i can't be certain what the truth is.

       That's not evidence of a quid pro quo. It creates the opportunity, but, for instance, what do you think DOW got in return? The Clintons have very specific and unique knowledge about how government works and it's not too far beyond the pale to think that people and companies might pay for their input.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's certainly the possibility of corruption, but one would think that would be pretty easy to identify if true. We should be able to see DOW getting preferential treatment in public documents.

       You have to wonder how someone goes from ok to extremely rich in a few years without inventing an iPhone, social media website or being a hedge fund manager. 
My biggest fear is that the people that gave money will want something worth more than the money they gave. That would hurt anyone who didn't give and since that's most of us, we would lose.

       Oh okay so I should go through your post history? I can't wait for this election to be over. The only problem is if Clinton wins we'll have a thousand posts about election stealing. If Trump wins his supporters won't be happy till Clinton and most progressives are locked in The Hague.

       Lots of ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. But most recently

       I absolutely read. In fact, I searched for the New York Times article it
       <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html">
        referenced.
       </a>
       Because I'm interested in truth and facts. Did you bother to read that article? Of course not. If you had you would have realized:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The F.B.I.’s inquiries into Russia’s possible role continue
       </p>
       <p>
        Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead — which they ultimately came to doubt — about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You found the first article that vindicated your traitor candidate. That's called confirmation bias. Which is exactly what the emails thing is all about.

        Another article. Dated the same day as your FBI announcement.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a great example of citing sources and evidence. You're either incredibly biased or incredibly stupid. Either way, you're not interested in facts. You're not even able to provide then to back up you "ACTUAL PROOF" claims.

        First off, not my candidate. THAT is called confirmation bias

       Confirmation bias - the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first article you found confirmed your beliefs that Trump isn't communicating with Russia. But you didn't even bother to read the article it was referencing.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Article is as credible as the "Hillary suggested droning assange" article, and all sources predate the FBI report.

        Maybe NBC is more credible to you. But then you'll just dismiss it as msm being against your candidate

       Notice your inability to attack the validity of the claims while shifting the conversation away from original claim that you're unable to backup.

      <p>
       Also, caps do not make your statements any more believable.

       Oh soros and clinton are old news. Plenty of emails in Podesta leak from the soros.com domain where the only thing sent is "Lets meet" or "can we call". They've definitely got something to hide, and soros and his team are old cards at this.

       That doesn't make it ethical, but it's hardly the scandal of the century and hardly reason to allow someone who is quite probably an actual medical psychopath into the white house, just be two cents

       None of this will happen.  It would be great to see anyone that has been above the law for so many years finally get taken down but there are just too many tiers of protection for people like that.

       I hate Trump but I hate him less than the US government politicians. I hate Hillary more than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess, Trump is likely going to win and whatever scheme Hillary pulls at this point will be her undoing. I'd rather see this country burn down as a result of its own inaction and elect Trump than see this country fall victim to the people like The Clinton's and ignorance as a whole.

       You mean like how clinton wants a no fly zone in Syria against russians? Yea trump wants peace buddy. And world wars always start over a stupid conflict and drag allies in. The situation in Syria is just that. Putting in a no fly zone is playing chicken with the lives of our military. Trump doesnt want war unless we get directly attacked.

       I figured out the current Trumppette strategy today. Find a whole bunch of nothing, connect it to Kevin Bacon then Clinton, claim conspiracy, hope everyone reads the headlines and doesn't read what's actually there or they'd see there is jack shit.
      </p>

       If it's an actual court case and a judge sees enough SOLID evidence for Trump raping kids to hold a court case, they'll just ignore that.

      <p>
       The real conspiracy is r/conspiracy becoming a Trump megaphone and infested by a bunch of on-the-knee, slobbering, idol worshipping fools.

       If you're referring to us being CTR hacks (which there are many), based on your ability to write, my reddit account is older than you, which would more than likely preclude me from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative is, you are older than six but some how learning how to coherently construct an idea has evaded your mental grasp. Possibly leading us to our current interaction and what I might presume is your support of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to know the difference between the left and the right at this moment? The left hates their candidate. They know she's a political sack of corrupt shit, but still think she's the better alternative, and it sickens them. The right praises Trump as god emperor worthy of all, redeemer of America, alpha male extraordinaire, faultless supreme leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't see the pile of steaming shit right in fucking front of you! I swear to high hell trumpettes do not deserve to be on this sub. You all lack the ability to think for yourselves in any meaningful way. Look at that sub...
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a failure as a business person, he has admitted-boasted about sexually assaulting women, he does not pay his debts to contractors and Americans, he has raped women and most likely children, he is a free loading moocher that doesn't pay taxes, racist, ignorant, liar by which the country has never seen, embroiled in more lawsuits than possibly any other individual, and uglier than the predator without a face mask. We have evidence for all of this. It's in front of you! You don't even see the Trump-Russia connection which is point to point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're all tripping over some emails and struggling to prove intent and playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real conspiracy theorist, not a Trumppette, would see the ENTIRE INCLUDING TRUMP SYSTEM is corrupt. They would know Russia has bought and paid for Trump. They'd know Clinton is the political tool the U.S. powers have chosen for both parties and the election was already determined and we have no choice in the matter. They might even know the Trumps and Clintons are actually close friends, and Trump just happened to get himself into some trouble because he can't manage businesses or money for shit and he's trying to get out of it.

       You are a fool to believe there was ever any real election. It's the rich versus the poor. There is no left versus right, Reps vs Dems.

       You could also be brainwashed into seeing an illusion.

       When two people see contradictory things, it is usually the person who is seeing additions to reality that is imagining them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand: Trump supporters don't see him as anything other than a fantastic salesman. Emphasis on man: not a god, not a figurehead, just a man. You hang out with a man, talk shit with him and about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see Hilary as deeply flawed and corrupt, and now I convince you that the bad things you are hallucinating about Trump (thanks marketing departments!) are just that: hallucinations. I'm not going to go over them point by point, you can do that yourself one you're aware you could be hallucinating. So now who do you pick?

I'm asking for a single source that can be verified. For all the work shown above there is not a single verifiable source if you dig into it.

       It looks like among other methods you can send an email from Podesta's account from that time period to any address and then reuse that key to fake whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is just one of several DKIM vulnerabilities, all of which would be accessible to a sophisticated and motivated organization. This could all be hand waived and I could apologize for wasting people's time if a real human source collaborates this on the record.

       So the Russians have been planting emails for 8 years to keep Hillary Clinton from becoming President? That they planned for this, to completely undermine her in the 2016 race? I think the burden is on you to explain how they planned and executed all this. And then maybe you can back it up with some kind of forensic evidence showing this to be true. Maybe one little piece, and not the dude from CrowdStrike! saying it's so (since, you know, he's talking his book and not building a real case).
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple security blogs have validated the DKIM on the wikileaks emails. The Russian story is pure baseless propaganda.

       I'm taking way less logical leaps than OP is if you take a step back. The OP thread is insisting that A is true unless B has happened, but ignore B because it definitely hasn't happened. I'm saying that A is true if C is anywhere. So just find me that verified source and I'll be so happy for you.

       He hasn't. His argument mostly hinges on a loose understanding of DKIM which can be completely ripped apart by a quick internet search of "DKIM vulnerabilities" and the assumption that since there are a crapload of ways to fake it and a crapload of parties interested in faking it and no real people verifying this stuff with their real names and publications that there aren't any real world verifiable sources.

      <p>
       Dismissing evidence out of hand without any basis or reasoning or justification is not an argument. Maybe if you said "I think this is fake because" or "How do we know this is real" there would be a basis for a real discussion, but instead you're just being contrary, flipping up your nose and saying "Nuh uh, not good enough" careful not to mention any way to satisfy your nebulous standards in case someone tries to hold you to them.

       tl;dr this thread: OP gave proof, either disprove that evidence, undermine that evidence by questioning validity, or give opposite evidence. You can not just say "I disagree, prove me wrong." Because he did by providing the evidence in the first place. I want september to be over already.

       I'm not the accuser. I'm accusing the accuser. That would be like if CNN said that Donald Trump was a Muslim, you disagreed, and then I said you needed to prove that he wasn't a Muslim and that CNN was doing great.
      </p>

       If OP wanted to state something that was widely accepted as true and then I told him it wasn't, then it would be a different situation. The burden is on the OP to verify before presenting. That hasn't been done.

       but... that... .... you're serious, huh. Burden of proof doesn't shift because you asked a question. The accused doesn't suddenly get the burden of proof because you decided they have to. ... especially when their evidence was already provided.

      <p>
       huh? I don't see how that's relevant. in your example CNN just made some oddball claim with no evidence...  OP made claims and has links to his evidence, hosted courtesy of wikileaks. His burden of proof is done and over with, it was provided. CNN's was not in your example and you're the idiot taking it at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP presented his evidence and all I see in this specific thread is people saying "But no, it's not" with absolutely no thought behind it. No evidence to the contrary. Just, "Shut up you're wrong".

       Is that really how debunking should be?

      <p>
       Here's a good example of someone debunking this thread:
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is what a well laid argument looks like.
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is what debunking
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       look like. Research, thought and maybe even citations. Links to trustworthy sources at bare minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       E: I am in actual awe that someone thought your argument was worthy of an upvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's more:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If OP wanted to state something that was widely accepted as true and then I told him it wasn't, then it would be a different situation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No. OP presented his evidence and beliefs on what that proof alluded to. it doesn't necessarily
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be 100% verifiably true, this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       not
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In conspiracy theory forums it works like this: OP posts evidence and beliefs, users debunk to the best of their ability. You do your own research based on their evidence and debunk from there. You can't just outright ignore that it's there - as you seem to be doing throughout this conversation - and you
       <em>
        should not
       </em>
       take it at face value. That's why you do research. To get informed and prove or disprove something for yourself. Debunking is the process of sharing that information with other interested people so they don't have the same misguided beliefs as OP.

       No it wasn't good evidence or good sources. There are no collaborating sources. I can say any dumb thing I want to and it will hold the exact same amount of weight. If it's true however there should be no problem finding collaborating sources.

       If it was slam dunk sourced there would be more sources by now. It's unequivocally false and you can't defend it. Save this and look back at in twenty years and you'll be ashamed that you thought this way and worked to mislead people.

       I'm sorry but you'll have to prove that for me. Another person did in this thread but you're making the claim so, you know. Go ahead. Again though, I don't have any intention of defending the claims. but why should I take anything you say at face value if you can't even read my response to you? how can i know that you actually read the wikileaks emails or have absolutely any idea what you're talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why debunking should take serious thought and research. Through research you learn and through learning you will gain the ability to actually know what you're talking about. This comes with the ability to properly source your findings like any intelligent human being would if they intended on being taken seriously.

       Nah man. This is a conspiracy, and not just that a weak political game that is just extremely misleading and quite frankly, just sad. Trump campaign and Trump politics are all over this stuff and they have used this to make false claims by overreaching and making connections about things from very questionable sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Post actually went out and did the research to see if these claims hold true.

       Unlike the sources you have provided, they actually went out and gathered information, talked to relevant individuals, established oversight to the information collected, and published it in a sensical manner.

       The podesta emails are rife with falsehood:

       Not to mention that wiki leaks has lost a lot of credibility and a lot of what is "leaked" is arguably injected by agendas.

      <p>
       Edit: I got gilded. Thanks! Goes to show... Stop swallowing these conspiracies. Do your research people and downvote me, I give 0 fucks. And for those that accuse me of "CTR" I had to google what that was. Sleuth my profile, I live in Canada. As far away as you can get from this filthy election. So no, I would actually rather gouge my eyes out then become a CTR. Don't stand too close to the microwaves, your tin foil hats might get ruined.

       WikiLeaks had never been wrong though and each of those emails has an intact DKIM key verifying authenticity.  Why doesn't clinton scream from the rooftops that they are lies? She may lose an election over this and all they can say is how concerning it is that Russia would interfere with a US election.

       I think it was yesterday, maybe the day before but there have been a few previous discussions of possible RICO investigations into the Clinton Foundation over the last few days.

       Oh yeah, I left that part out on purpose. Shortly there after, in 2009, Kelly was given special access to then Secretary Clinton at the same time he was embroiled with litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint venture that would have netted Dow 9BN$ in cash.

       Dismissing evidence out of hand without any basis or reasoning or justification is not an argument. Maybe if you said "I think this is fake because" or "How do we know this is real" there would be a basis for a real discussion, but instead you're just being contrary, flipping up your nose and saying "Nuh uh, not good enough" careful not to mention any way to satisfy your nebulous standards in case someone tries to hold you to them.

       I can make any dumbass claim and ask you to prove me wrong if that's how people think it works. You need primary and secondary sources, and a reputation to stake to say anything like this. It's what they teach you at journalism school.

       tl;dr this thread: OP gave proof, either disprove that evidence, undermine that evidence by questioning validity, or give opposite evidence. You can not just say "I disagree, prove me wrong." Because he did by providing the evidence in the first place. I want september to be over already.

       Someone needs to verify that someone said the thing that someone else is saying that they said. And then probably another person needs to do that too. Two sources would be great. Maybe we'll get them. Until then this isn't news.

       forgive me for being skeptical, but....
where's the beef.  what do we have here?  what is it evidence of?  it doesn't look like much of anything to my untrained eyes.  you obviously seem like an expert, but you haven't explained anything.

       He will win the popular vote by 4 million votes, and electoral votes by 40.. he'll get 305.. this is brexit 2.0.. why would you believe any polling?
