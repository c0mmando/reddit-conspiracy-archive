       On November 1st,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pieczenik">
        Steve Pieczenik
       </a>
       released
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM">
        this video
       </a>
       which is well on its way to a million views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik claims that the Clintons are attempting a coup by using corruption and political cronyism to infiltrate and influence the White House, CIA, FBI and Attorney General.
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes on to state that a counter-coup has been initiated by members of the "intelligence community" from over a dozen agencies with the help of Wikileaks. When Comey brought the Weiner emails to light, this was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the entr√©e in the counter-coup to say to the administration: "we have your number." Not only do we have your number, we're going to stop you from making Hillary the next POTUS, and at the same time we're going to convict and indict the POTUS, Loretta Lynch and many others who were involved in the massive coverup that occurred under the Clinton Foundation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He goes on to state that this may be the first time both a coup and counter-coup was initiated via the internet. He stresses the need for a peaceful transition and that indeed this is a very important historical moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q">
        A second video
       </a>
       was uploaded by Pieczenik on the same day, this time detailing the Clinton's ties to Jeff Epstein and the global pedophilia network.
      </p>
      <p>
       He continues by stating that there's much more to the Weiner emails story, and that the NYPD has information about Hillary Clinton and many of the elites and their predilection for pedophilia.

       Real deal? Psyop? I don't think we can ever be for sure, but I think justice is waaaaay over due for the clinton crime family. So let justice be done and follow the money and ALL the connections . .  obama, the bushes, etc, etc. Where ever it leads and arrest, prosecute and jail or execute as required. This is a serious time in American history.

       Problem is this guy is associated with Henry Kissinger and has a history in psyops.  Kissinger did meet briefly with Trump earlier in the year and he has heavy links to Hillary Clinton.  Unless there's been a riff between Kissinger and Piecnizik this is just the ultra elites putting a subordinate in their place.

       Quite right. I think typically what happens is BOTH sides of an election are rigged, just in case. In this case, I'm thinking that the principles, bushes, clintons, etc, were becoming a liability because they all got too arrogant and obvious, and trump was/is played as the ultimate outsider. Maybe he played them, maybe he slipped the chain. maybe pieczenik is also playing for the globalists--a long term mole. No one KNOWS for sure. But at least it is time for the clinton's to be brought to justice, and whomever else the trail leads. Look for obama to pardon them, though, also look for last minute deus ex machina false flag ops; riots, shootings, terrorist attacks, etc, etc. at this point ALL bets are off. cheers

       My theory is that Trump started off as controlled opposition and then saw inside the ark of the covenant and decided to buck these people for the good of the world, or at least the US. I hope I'm right.

       While I like the narrative, in my humble opinion many people believe this because they cannot concede that Trump and Hillary are not friends(he donated money, like all Wealthy Business men do, and attended social function, they were rubbing each others palm, no less, no more.) And now that it's appears more and more like they aren't friend and he has stayed in the race, against all odds, people are left to conclude that his motives progressively changed. The reality is that Trump has been serious from the start, it's just that it took quite a while for most people to accept that he is sincere in lieu of donations and photos of him and Hillary together. It's all part of going through the varying degree of emotions until we finally accept reality, well at least to the best of our abilities.

       Trump's 'donation' to the Foundation was simply a bribe (like all of those donations). The week after he made the donation his building permits in NY--where Hillary was Senator--were approved. Having said that, Trump sincerely seems to be sick of the corruption and I think even more so than the average American. I really hope he can save us.

       When the people look to the rich to save them you will know that the rich have succeeded in their manipulation.
 Edit- You know what... I really don't think Trump is in on it at all. My mistake was lumping him in with the moneyed elite. But I'll tell you why I now I believe Trump is really on his own thing and not an establishment *agent provocateur * - it's the ego.
A guy with an ego like that wouldn't be able to keep his lid on their covert bullshit when he's under attack. They've really gone out their way to paint him as the devil and he's responded with unrestrained aggression. Can't really see him being secret society material. I think Trump has always been for Trump but now he's found himself in a position worthy of his ego: the guy whose elected President by defeating corruption in American politics.
You'd be lying if you said he'd be a competent President, but I'd back you all the way if you say he's the President America needs at this very moment in history. Because of Hillary wins- War with Russia, the never ending wars in the ME ... its all on the table.

       I think there is a possibility he has 'seen the light' or otherwise chosen to do good.
      </p>
      <p>
       but if not, it does not matter, my core belief is that there must be a forced revolution, because I believe there are secrets so great, so important and life changing, none of us will be allowed to know until we destroy the false gods reigning above us and steal all their deepest occult knowledge
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem there is, separating the good from the evil, and repurposing and restructuring all of this for a new good goal. most people would be seduced to evil simply by knowledge of the truth. it would take a strong individual to see the truth, and turn away from the path already accepted by our leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       the path of sharing that knowledge with everyone on earth, and then burning it away forever, ensuring absolutely nobody can ever use such methods for such selfish gain ever again in all of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       they would have to gain the power of the world dictator, by defeating any and all opposition across the world, and instead of using the secrets for power, open up all the previously hidden/closed libraries, release all secret documents, open source all patents,
      </p>
      <p>
       and basically ring the death knell for society instead of rising up to be its dominator like those before them.
      </p>
      <p>
       because society needs to be rebuilt. much the way it was to begin with -- although without an elite who somehow have secret ties to an older civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       now we all can be educated, so there is no place for an elite. period. they must be removed, and at best, everyone needs a max cap set at 'middle class'.
      </p>
      <p>
       this would create massive wealth for all, ingenuity/creativity that hasn't been seen since the beginning of capitalism, and a new world, a better world. for all of us who remain (those who do not are unfortunately going to be burning in hell for all eternity for their evils in life)
      </p>
      <p>
       the truth is, in the ancient days, the kings and queens got their education from somewhere -- that was why the elites weren't peasants back then -- they could read and had limited understandings of science and history that often times nobody else had access to at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was an experiment to try and separate the government from those elites, so that people could start their own businesses (and a society like I mentioned) however, over time (pretty quickly after its inception, there were members of the founding fathers who were moles like alexander Hamilton)
      </p>
      <p>
       because in Europe, you had to go to your local authority to get a permit to do.. well.. anything at all. so all the good businesses were monopolies like the 'east india company' or similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       obv this was killing the businesses in Europe, because new American competitors were now emerging to fields that were once owned and operated solely by the elites -- thus impacting their 'projected' or estimated profits -- first a little, then a lot (this is probably why such clauses are in the TPP to prevent small businesses from existing if they compete with a 'sanctioned' monopoly, even if the estimated loss is a dollar, they are liable to pay the competitior and have  their business shut down, and the local government will also be fined for not preventing you from doing it to begin with)
      </p>
      <p>
       so they started several wars, convened in secret, and basically killed anyone who disagreed in the two world wars, and severely lied about it to everyone making themselves look like the good guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       the people doing this however, are not comprised of every successful rich person. there is much infighting as to who will survive, and who is to continue being 'elite' once the plan goes active and the war goes from cold to hot.
      </p>
      <p>
       saying 'the rich' and 'the poor' is too simple. however, the evil ones always get to most of the rich and brainwash and deceive them into joining anyway -- so often times you have these stupid cronies (like the talking heads on the news) who think they are important and gonna live when shtf but they aren't. they are useful idiots and their employers cant wait to have them murdered and replace them with someone who thinks a lot less money is a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       so its not all the rich. actually a lot of the poor are equally responsible for what is occurring, because they wont accept they and their family are already dead and the hand outs wont save them. that it is already too late and their wife/kids/themselves are dead or screwed into poverty and slavery forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       if they understood that, and understood they had to fight now or die, then they wouldn't be as responsible as they are (because they alone hold the power to stop it, by believing the truth rather than the comfortable lie)
      </p>
      <p>
       so really, there are quite a few formerly rich - moderately wealthy or even bottom elite status people who are actually against this and on the right side of history.
      </p>

       they stand to lose their businesses and wealth to the global monopolies. they stand to lose their freedoms with the rest of us -- and be on the top of the hit list for people to execute because they have resources like guns food and vehicles, and a strong education on the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is not really rich vs poor. its  -- super elite rich + brainwashed rich +  brainwashed masses Vs Moderately Wealthy/middle class + average citizen who is too strong willed and smart for brainwashing (or willing to sacrifice themselves and their little happinesses for the greater good) + the impoverished masses who beyond all odds still are intelligent and disagree with their entire socio-political group.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you see we are vastly outnumbered, but more intelligent by several orders of magnitude. exponentially more creative and intelligent than any other than those at the absolute top (which is why we are the true group who is fit to survive best, and why nature has chosen us even the the artificial system chose them)
      </p>
      <p>
       it comes down to those chosen by nature to destroy the artificial system entirely. I don't think it can happen, now, because no matter how crafty and ingenuitive and different our group may be, it is vastly outnumbered, and also would be fighting against a robot army at some point along with the massive inequitable manpower.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only way to really change things truly, without the insanity I spoke of, would be if god personally came to earth and made people see the light. made people see and accept the truth regardless of how painful it might be to that person at the moment. how difficult to believe or accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       only then, with all the sides at peace with one another, could the world take a step back and see whos really responsible and remove them.

       so? hes a hero. not only did he manipulate the evil ones by bribing them for his own uses (the mark of a mastermind genius) but also betrayed them later.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes he was always serious. its well known he always had some level of interest in the job -- he even in youth believed he would win if he ran and would do good but didn't want to be part of the nasty corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       and political corruption is worlds away from business corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course he is aware of how corrupt it is, he has admitted his advantages were in fact unfair to begin with, but does not take responsibility for being eligible (he did not write the laws)
      </p>
      <p>
       if he is saying the truth, he will remove many of these unfair exemptions, or rather change them so they benefit the country like in the old days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure the Chinese will stand for it if he wins though. if we rebuild our economy we are basically declaring war on china, economically, by competing for the industries that now feed billions of Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Chinese will begin to starve if we out-do them in business and are already itching to go to war and take over all the earth, especially the US and Europe. destroying their economic hegemony over the world would guarantee a nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I say bring it. if our opponents cant deal with it, they can deal with the fact that our side will salt the earth and clean it of all life forever if the other side refuses to back down. Better burn ALL the earth to a cinder than allow one continent of psychopaths to rule as tyrants. Better that everyone dies than suffers slavery forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think there is a way out without open war, and a declaration of atomic world war. IMO in order to really fix shit, we'd have to lead a violent revolution, and then IMMEDIATELY hack the nuke codes and send messages to all world leaders saying to step down and hand over all wealth, property, land and means of production, all tangible and intangible assets and titles, Or face the ENTIRETY of your nation and all your allies face key infrastructure, food, and shelter destroying tactical nuclear strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       the goal would not be to win a war, but to ensure that even when they get revenge and nuke us back, nobody will have the means to survive, produce food, or escape the radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, I am proposing a violent coup followed up by a demand that all world leaders and industry captains step down for a great restructuring. or else the world ends. period. all of humanity, gone. forever. Your choice -- you always were going to destroy the world anyway, the only difference is, now you will be destroyed too, and if not, there will be nobody and nothing left to rule over anyway

       to make more sense of what I said, I think these 'trade deals' are more like deals with the Chinese that allow us to live without war. by allowing them to control manufacturing and basically usurp the role the US had in the world. especially since they are communist they can cook the books and make it unfair to compete even if they DIDNT own our politicians personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       by switching paths, we are basically nullifying every treaty since WWI, and displacing billions of starving useful idiots, and angering the wealthy and powerful who spent several generations trying to rig things in their favor, bribing, threatening war, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only thing is, the American people were never privy to the deal. so they think its just a matter of policy, not a nuclear war threat in itself to bring our jobs back (bringing our jobs back would indeed cause such a horrific war for multiple reasons -- and the lower classes would be begging for it out of starvation and disease)
      </p>
      <p>
       that's why the final ultimatum of entire earth destruction including you or step down is necessary. and even if they agreed, youd still probably have to round up their families and friends and 'disappear' them, to make sure they didn't try to sabotage the free system again.
      </p>
      <p>
       although, youd pretty much need an insane tactical genius of a leader, who would be as fascist as it gets to make this happen, especially without world doom.
      </p>
      <p>
       this battle is not among flesh and blood, but the principalities and powers of the air. it is not a battle against individual people either, but a battle of cultures, of ideas. the idea of whether all humanity is the 'main character' or just the chosen elites. the idea of superiority of one man over another -- not through natural selection, but by artificial means.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is a war against the culture of the elites. the entire culture, belief system, and everything that goes along with it must burn to the ground entirely, along with any and all who believe in it,
      </p>
      <p>
       it is not the middle class I speak of, or even normal industrial captians. but those who wish to monopolize all economic and political power. those who wish for control only for the sake of power -- those who created our banking systems, and are rich off them, those who start wars and break laws they write, believing themselves to be above them.
      </p>
      <p>
       those who knowingly in the secret decide to fuck over their fellow man, and bring the world into dark and selfish tyranny. those who view the rest as cattle, not eligible for the prizes of life, because they keep those prizes locked in a vault where no mere mortal can see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       what we need is Apollyon -- we need him to ascend Mt. Olympus and tear down the godhead. annihilating each individual god and creating a new world -- devoid of their influence, desires, and goals. a world untouched by their influence, and completely controlled by those they oppose most.

       Thing is Pence seems all too ready to show some differences, and more likely to toe the line with those behind the scenes. I'd be worried of another JFK scenario, when the loose cannon that the people want ends up too far off-script. I'm wondering if Trump is clever enough with plans to stay one step ahead of them?

       Indeed. For me it is now ALL about watching, in sheer schadenfreude, ALL those clinton apparatchiks, minions, toadies, etc, etc, frog marched off to prison ala the meskin drug cartel mode. However, already the ground work is being prep'd to let her off the hook; "do Americans really want to see a defeated candidate for its highest office in prison?" and the pol-hack would not answer with a fucking resounding, "FUCK YES!!!" In my mind JUSTICE must be done. These people are ALL evil and vile criminals guilty of all manner of heinous crimes against America and humanity. sorry, I do get pissed when I think of the magnitude of it all. Cheers.

       I hate to think your right but you are. My own grandfather is one of them. He simply would not listen as I laid out all of Clinton crimes. Mind made up refuses to believe it. Says he doesn't like Trump so will vote for her for that reason alone. Pretty sad. However everyone else I know is voting Trump. So I feel that even though there are some hopeless souls they may be outnumbered.

       Regular Americans love Trump that's obvious. Only dumbasses who eat up corporate media and the corporate establishment itself find Trump distasteful. Everyone else appreciates the no bullshit approach.

       I agree.  I never thought I would be I saying this about trump.  At first I just thought he was the lesser of two evils,but the more entrenched I become in this shit show the more I am starting to see a change in trump for the good.  I think for the fist time in trumps life he is the "good guy" ...and I think he likes it.  He no doubt has done his share of down right shady/ illegal things but is seems as though he likes his new persona.  I think if he puts his business experience with his new found drive to make a change into trying to make a positive difference the country can seriously turn around.  Keep in mind there is still some selfishness in it by trump in the sense that he will go down in history of one of the greatest if not the greatest potus if he is able to change his ways and accomplish this.  I think at this point it is almost impossible for someone to resist the temptation of money and to eventually be bought out....unless you are already filthy rich.  Which he is.  You see it happen amongst the ultra rich all the time.  They are looking for gratification just like the rest of us.  Unfortunately they have everything so they end up giving the vast majority of their wealth to charities in a search for that gratification . Trump just might be looking for just this opportunity and didn't even know he was.

       I think it is trumps ego that can confirm this idea. It is his unwillingness to be wrong that lends him to be himself has the puppet master. So while a person thinks they're pulling one string on trump, trump sees that as an opportunity to reach back and pull 2 strings on them. His whole career has been built on coming out ahead in deals and the presidency will be his ultimate testimony to that mindset.

       not only does the guy have a history in psyops (and is basically a stereotype bio when it comes to people of a certain political agenda)- but he's advocating for the overthrow of the democracy by a military/ intelligence cabal.  why would anyone possibly be on board with that, even if they didn't realize a military intelligence cabal is already running foreign and domestic policy?

       Except Nixon was originally Prescott Bush's boy and Nixon started trying to do his own thing and "resist" those powers that put him into office.  Nixon was set up by the CIA... clearly this is E Howard Hunt's involvement.  So he was forced to resign and the CIA maintained the office with one of their puppets when someone started to resist.

       What I see is the forces that back the CIA, at least the old regime, are either under attack or have decided they need to destroy Clinton for some reason.

       Who knows?  This could very well be actual good people trying to resist that cabal.  Or it could just be the same old cabal turning on Hillary for some reason.

       It's hard not to hope there are some true patriots out there that are looking out for the common citizen.  Pieciznic did an interview yesterday with Alex Jones following up on this and when Alex starts mentioning his operations he performed for the State Department he looked really ashamed and didn't brag on it.  He puts off an air of a man with regret that is trying to right his wrongs.  He also says God bless your listeners at the end of the interview but doesn't direct the same statement at Alex at the end of the interview.  He seems really irritated with Alex the whole time, which is understandable, but when he didn't say God bless you to Alex, too, I found that interesting.  It almost was like saying, I know Alex is a shill, but I care about his listeners.  I'd like to see anyone else's take on this.  I want to believe, but it's hard with a guy that is so steeped in psyops and cunning.

       He's jewish.  He doesn't believe in a god that blesses, but knows that most of Jones' listeners are "christians" and he's playing to that audience. that should clue you in right there on what he's doing.

       Alex Jones is a paleoconservative shock jock who will give the podium to anyone who agrees with him and promotes the concept that the US is on the brink of imploding. That's why he has so many of these spooks/ handlers on his show selling disinfo to his audience.

       In the Colin Powell emails he was talking about partying with him at Bohemian Grove.  They're both part of the elite Mandalay club there.  There's some pics of them getting pretty loose there, too, online.  I think they were from his emails.   If you watch the documentary ,"Conspiracy of Silence", on YouTube, you'll see that not only is this most probable, but that their type of swinging is much more sinister.  Never forget forced edits were made to Stanley Kubrik's Eye's Wide Shut after he coincidentally died, right before the release of this movie.

       Clyde Lewis actually talked about this a day or two ago in his radio show Ground Zero.  Funny coincidence.  Great minds think alike I guess.  Anyways,  the episode is called Sex and the Citadel on Ground Zero media.  He's all over most podcast apps if you're not familiar, just look up ground zero media or ground zero Clyde Lewis.  He's pretty awesome.

       That's where I know the post is either by a disinfo agent or misinfo by someone who's been duped like the rest. A coup was undertaken a long long long time ago. The government has already been completely bought and paid for, in some cases literally, since the Federal Reserve was installed. Since then, the rest has just been swept into the same bag.

      <p>
       In the late 1700s Mayer Amschel Rothschild began a banking empire and discovered it was insanely profitable to loan money to governments. He had 5 sons, and distributed them throughout Europe to continue his legacy and build the Empire.

       They became so rich and powerful that they have formed the nexus of world power up until now, and are the true government of the West. All nominal western governments are merely puppets of the global banking elite.

       I recently listened to a Catherine Austin Fitz interview stating that 50 trillion is missing. These guys are not about to give it up and would be more than happy to circle up the wagons and throw the Clintons under the bus. Remember how systemic the corruption is and the Clintons are just public pawns in the grand scheme of things.

       Time will tell. Healthy skepticism is, well, healthy, but when the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do? Dr. Pieczenik is the real deal, though precisely with whom and for whom he works for is a good question, and IF we had a REAL news media--objective and not co-opt or corrupted--then we could have better information on all this.

       It's not because they can't interfere with the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because they want us to sniff out the CIA's role, and they are not allowed to expose CIA agents/informants. This whole cyberwar fiasco is NSA vs CIA vs FBI. They are all at fault too, right alongside Hillary. So naturally they are all going to have Hillary and the Clinton Foundation take the fall instead of big government. Obama has the power to sidestep most of this, and he can also pardon Hillary or Assange if he wants to.
      </p>
      <p>
       NSA has ALL of Hillary's emails, they spy on everyone, they could do something about it if they wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA does the ground work for Hillary's foreign policy shit, so they could do something about it if they wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI is covering for the entire government at this point, so they could do something about it if they wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Booz Allen Hamilton has used two operatives to infiltrate the highest echelons of national security. Harold Thomas Martin and Edward Snowden both worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, contracting for the NSA. Who is Booz Allen Hamilton? Are they some kind of United Nations global spy agency?
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we have the Wiener laptop with bombshell underage sexting allegations. It just teleported into his possession from the void? This is an old skool play right out the intelligence agency handbook!
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote this earlier today:
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how the CIA hasn't even been a topic during the whole time this scandal has been unfolding? CIA are the head honchos of proxy armies and drug/gun running, all for controlling resources (oil), which the Clintons and this whole scandal is about. Obama Co. were using private servers to dodge FOIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       A while back there was some material that briefly mentioned the CIA, but it was pushing blame
       <em>
        away
       </em>
       from the CIA and onto Obama Co. for botching an arms sale which ended up being used against our own military. Reading that I thought...oh how convenient the CIA is slipping out the back door again and taking no blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Law prohibits the government (including FBI) from acknowledging most CIA activities. But FOIA requests can expose them. This is the FBI's way of telling us we need to FOIA, because there is information still out there
       <em>
        they know about
       </em>
       but are not allowed to expose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going deeper, this is government agencies fighting themselves internally and using us as pawns, as Caesar-era Colosseum spectators in the whole ordeal. We likely have no clue what the depth of the situation is.

        We may be witnessing a power struggle between the COG government and the Publicly recognized government.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who can entertain that thought and contribute to the thread is encouraged to do so. This is the direction the theory I've laid out here naturally leads us to, but it is going to need a lot more research and connecting many dots. We should definitely be asking ourselves what the COG and Neocons are up to (Genie Energy is the first hint). And that 7th Floor Group / shadow government could use some research as well. Are these all related?

       You must build your own world view. Build your own understanding of the world. How it works, how these things are interconnected. Sadly, those without the long term awareness of the macro-situations going on around them as they grow will suffer most. And it is noble to lift them - but sometimes you cant. And the thing is that when you cant... over the years it takes a toll on those who can and results in "enlightenment fatigue"
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets take a note from the FBIanon BS that happened recently....
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a question from one user asking if HRC was involved in "black magic" and the response was "yes'
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets talk about Black Magic for a sec....
      </p>
      <p>
       It is really the understanding of the lessons of all the secret societies; Thought Creates Reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do you think politics comes from. Why do you think they call television show scheduling "Programming" - its all managing thought-at-scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are witnessing if you view it objectively and critically - the political system is DESIGNED to control thoughts of BILLIONS of minds - which, in turn, results in the cultivation of the reality of the archetype that dominates that thought population....
      </p>
      <p>
       So, double-speak is an allusion to this magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weird shit starts happening with the association of weird physical rituals with the actual thought manipulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, lets take the extreme view here: "lizard people and aliens capture and torture and mutilate our people/cows/babies"
      </p>
      <p>
       What if "lizard people" and "aliens" are just an archetype of power - not
       <em>
        actual lizard/aliens
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But a "race" of humans that are just so above the law and systems of the common man, with incredible perverse views of how they can accomplish/retain their power that they fall down some crazy rabbit holes of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for instance the statement from, I believe, David Icke - that the queen used to sacrifice babies/subjects via a dagger to the anus... that is ONE FUCKED UP VISION - and who knows if that is true - but the point is that the image of those that are in power are free to do whatever they want and have the authority to be satiated in their desire for power in any manner they choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to BC and HRC... these guys are known to be corrupt for many decades. And it was stated that HRC only discovered the power of absolute power corrupts AFTER her marriage to BC - I dont buy it. I thought she actively sought it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK so thats some background a little bit - bt sorry for the following as it would take whole books to fill in the cracks of what I am about to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there are many secret societies in the world that have different focus... but the basic premise of ALL of them is the same.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       You have the Masons, the Mayans, The Rosicrucians, Essenes, Bohemians, and many many many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the basic premise of ALL of them:
      </p>
      <p>
       THOUGHTS ARE THINGS.
      </p>
      <p>
       You control one's thoughts - you control the things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the thing that the elite don't want you to know is the above. Thoughts are things... words are formed from thoughts - they affect thoughts, they therefore, when heard, can control the thoughts of others, and thus create the thing (outcome) that they want. Look into NLP (Neuro-linguistic-programming - especially how Obama does it)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are the base levels of it, like how HRC does it, she cackles off tough questions, which will make the listener associate the "hard question" with her "telling" you that
       <em>
        "that question is such a joke, so much I don't have time to respond to such baseless claims"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have to understand this is not just simple deflection... it is FUCKING DELIBERATE. It is telling those that do NOT understand thought, language and power to shut their perceptions down and move on...
      </p>
      <p>
       (I wrote a piece on this YEARS ago, but it has been scrubbed from the site apparently)
      </p>
      <p>
       OK - so back to the lesson on thoughts are things.
      </p>
      <p>
       All secret societies start by teaching their students that "Thoughts are things" and that "everything that you see before you has started, originally as a thought" -- then those thoughts become energy to perpetuate action... then those actions make outcomes - or things...
      </p>
      <p>
       [Going to stop here to judge reaction, let me know if you want me to continue]
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Ill talk more about the black magic part...

       Justice Scalia was in the presence of multiple leaders of the Order of St. Hubertus when he died, but he was not a member. He was a Knight of Malta. Both have some freemason undertones from what I've been reading.

       Well, satan is evil but lucifer wasn't, niether was enki. We all know the prometheus story, zeus punishes prometheus because he gave man fire.

       Well, lucifers name means light-bringer, not something you'd associate with twisted malice. Feels like the oldest myths tell the true true, atleast before mass-produced indoctrination.

       The center of our myths deal with giving up your will, one demanded to be adored, the other asks us too think for ourselves, fight for ourselves. Against  natural order?

       No it's not that. Christianity is about living your life for others, a life of sacrifice. Lucifereanism or the light is a false light that drives people to live for themselves and make selfish decisions. It's that simple, the false light destroys, the true light heals.

       But what about prometheus and lucifer and enki, 3 major cultures are mentioned here, the Egyptians(Enki), Romans(Prometheus, and Lucifer, which is from the old testament
      </p>
      <p>
       The common theme makes me wonder, because as evidenced by the bible, god being wrathful many times, the flood, or Sodom and Gomorrah.

      <p>
       One demands our love, the other asks us to ask why.

       I'm not religious btw, but there is a deeper meaning being displayed here i believe, just me.

       I dug up a couple pdf's for you to explore. The authors are/were very religious Christians, but studied this stuff for decades to unearth the truth about satanism. This is probably the best we have right now for well-researched documentation.

       Be very careful delving into satanism, because at its very core is deceit. This is how the baddies become baddies. They are deceived by other baddies who say "this totally makes sense and is perfectly fine". Then you get seduced and introduced into lower and lower levels and start to debase yourself with their rituals or magic practice. This eventually erodes your moral compass and life force - or soul. But this is not the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is the "The Flower of Life" as I noted in another post on here and as OP mentions: The source of reality is your own mind. Thoughts are things. For more on this, read the best seller "Beyond Biocentrism". It will knock your socks off.

       I'd rather be in an army full of individuals rather than a programmed army, both need free will to operate, but the one is more easily compromised then the many.

       People commit acts of barbarism all the time, it isn't a satanic force..its just poor application of free will. People do good without needing religion. Can religion do any of the good without people?

       You are correct. You have free will. That's why I just said to be careful with it (satanism), because it is
       <em>
        seducing
       </em>
       . My suspicion is that satanism is actually the perversion of the "Flower of Life" and those principles (used for evil), which is why it's so deceptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, we can use it for good. We've been deceived for a very long time, because the baddies at the very top have been hiding this ancient knowledge. I also think it's possible that the baddies invented the bible to further twist us up and confuse us. The story of Babylon, for example - they invented that, because THEY did that to us with the english language. Check out
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIkoVsmVK9A">

       . It blew my mind.

       Honestly, I've been on this quest for about 25 years now and feel like I'm getting closer to our historical truth than ever before. I'm just here to give you some resources to check out on your own and then make your own conclusions.

       I think your characterization of christianity is way off. In your comparison justifying a luciferian view, you said "one demands our love, the other asks us to ask why."  There is no demand for love in christianity. Christianity says God offers unconditional love, you can choose through your free-will whether to accept it and to extend it to others.  Perhaps organized religion has led you to believe there is a demand and that it is not okay to ask why, but I dont see that in the new testament.  The luciferian principle, to my understanding, is based around serving the self and separating oneself and elevating oneself over others.  If it's truth you want, deceiving yourself into believing that you are superior and separate from others is a path to deception, not illumination.

       Enki would be Sumerian and their culture predates that of Egypt. The word you're looking for is not "stole" but
       <em>
        syncretism

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for two different "gods" when it comes to the OT and NT, the gnostics had an answer for that. They identify the Demiurge as YHWH (OT god) and, for the most part, identify Lucifer /Prometheus as the god of the NT. So, if you want to look further into this you can look into
       <em>
        gnosis
       </em>
       and
       <em>

       Do you understand mala in se and mala prohibita? If you do you'll have a bit more insight. But to straight up answer your question, it's an Abrahamic religion but dogma and doctrine have changed over time to suit certain agendas and groups.

      <p>
       No. All the things you mentioned come and go and, usually, they are replaced with something when the victor raises his hand. Since it's an Abrahamic religion, it's going to have it's roots in Judasim and the Torah/Pentateuch. But even there it's sketchy. You ever see Lilith mentioned in any Garden of Eden stories from Christians? No. Now google, "Lilith Garden of Eden" and see what you find.

       I'm not religious either but I can promise with you 1000% certainty that living your life for yourself only leads to an unhappy state of mind. Living your life for others trying to improve the lives of others is the only way to achieve real happiness. It's an immutable law of existence that's more than just about religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get bogged down in the details and analyze every little piece of scripture or you can see the bigger picture and the actual things in reality that are absolute. This is the one thing that never ever changes no matter what. If you help others out unconditionally eventually you will find the universe rewarding you at unexpected yet desperate times. Someone else will help you for no reason at the exact moment you need it because that's how it works, the effects of your actions last on a long term scale and it comes back to you at crucial moments in your life.

       You're right.  He was an MI6 spy who used occultism to make a mockery of Hitler, that's why he popularized the V scissor fingers because scissors beats paper of heil hitler.  But here's another question, why study him at all?  Why not study something provably worthwhile AND magical AND transformative to self/other like music

       In my opinion the root of all of this stuff comes from the mysticism of ancient Egypt and Thoth a.k.a. Hermes Trismegistus and the Emerald Tablets which contain the 7 Hermetic Principles. I believe this is the root of all mysticism/occultism/black magic whatever you want to call it. It only gets more perverted and adulterated as it gets further from the source.

       You're close, it's older than Egypt. Back in Babylon they worshipped Gilgamesh, that's where the story starts. All of the Egyptian gods like Thoth directly relate back to the cleepoth (I know that's not how it's spelled but I can't remember the spelling right now), essentially the book of 66 fallen watchers or whatever. The watchers story created an archetype that's permeated society for some 5000 years now.

       The V stands for 6, the satanists believe in numerology and the power of number sequences. It's mostly bullshit, the only numerology that matters is in synchronicity and that occurs to send you information in a one way exchange. He wasn't mocking anything, he was seeking immortality through ritualistic sacrifice.

       it wasn't Christ or true Christianity (which barely exists today, and there are zero records of in written sources)
      </p>
      <p>
       Protestantism is the best youll get. but the bible itself is compromised. the unseen hand goes very far back and this conspiracy was here before jesus even was born.
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact, the truth probably is (to the best of my own guess ability) that Christ came down and saw that secret socieites were manipulating and enslaving mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       they believed the messiah would come to guide them and their elites to heaven, that they had divine right to rule having known the truth about the real origins of human history and other occult secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       where did the ancient kings get their educations from? where did the trade guilds and stuff start? clearly mankind didn't just develop things at a fast rate until things were somewhat stable and we had real superiority technologically over the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       it even thrived in ages where the masses weren't allowed to have knowledge -- in fact, they slowly let us get education back after rome, but they bred us for many generations without It so we wouldn't know our history or our past only their lies we were brought up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, after Christ called out the roman emperor, all world leaders, the bankers, and the Pharisees (read, all world leaders in religion/politics) for being LITERAL sorcerors and using ancient rites and other brainwashing techniques (which in our time are highly developed, yet ancient techniques)
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe not with 'magic' like casting fireballs -- but magick in the sense that they are causing effects In their external environment in according with their will -- i.e. someone is gay and wants homosexuality normalized, so they go out of their way to cause scenes of differing extremes, and pay tons of money on publicity/social causes, and they gain support from others who are hurt (rather than stopping the hurt, they seek compensation for it)
      </p>
      <p>
       this person has done a magick act -- they have performed a ritual. inducting others to support their cause, funding things that affect the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is only a minor act, I will not speak of the insane rituals  (which do exist, I do not know if there is true power behind them or it is just mental and they are insane -- I theorize, sacrifices and rape rituals are only there to separate the individual from other humans in believing they are above them, while also separating them from their conscience and literally willingly choose to turn sociopathic by exposure to trauma)
      </p>
      <p>
       but these things also play roles, especially paedophilia and injesting the blood of the young.
      </p>
      <p>
       again, very intense stuff you wont believe until you truly know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       but back on topic -- Catholicism co-opted the Christian movement. replace rome with the word USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       imagine in your USA (or rome) there is a religion which basically states all the powerful are absolute evil and enslaving and killing you while living in luxury and that the world will be better without them.
      </p>
      <p>
       they say the religious leaders don't believe what they preach and secretly practice sorcery to manipulate you and steal from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       that the kings only care about themselves and their larger schemes, and not the subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       they also heal people, and share previously secret knowledge with you you weren't supposed to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       obviously the FBI (jews) and the CIA (rome) get together and say -- fuck, what do we do with this guy. he is calling us out (imagine they are Hillary, without a MSM to protect them) and they BELIEVE him. they gonna slaughter us like little piglets for what we done!
      </p>
      <p>
       easy there FBI (jews) the CIA (Rome) is totally capable of acting in secret and making sure it looks like we never colluded here at all! we can even have two groups to manipulate them with later because we will sterilize his writings and remove the important truths and start our own church, then burn the libraries and kill all the teachers and breed them into slavery after making deals with the mongols and barbarians to stage a fall! we will even start a war and conquer Jerusalem to make it look real! don't worry guize we will give it back in a thousand yrs or so :p."
      </p>
      <p>
       so they call up old Pontius, he was a good soldier, he never questioned his orders. very loyal. that's what they needed here. this Yahshua dude is a pretty nice guy, and only the most loyal heartless SOB out there will be able to torture and kill him"
      </p>
      <p>
       they killed jesus, staged everything. destroyed the libraries intentionally, killed the professors, started the dark ages, then slowly gave us knowledge again so they could use us to develop their evil things without knowing who we were working for an dwhat we were doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       life is a huge satanic manhattan project, and none of us know the end goal. the catholic church was always run directly by satan -- or rather his pawns. it was the continued roman empire. this is most likely the reason napoleon attacked the Vatican, and why they gave it back without investigating its catacombs so quickly afterward. the other world leaders were playing ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       true Christianity was not this programming religion. Christ came to release people from suffering and from the programming. he came to reveal that the bible was a lie - that it was not the word of god at all anymore. that it was so warped as to be an entirely new work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ would've gathered the people to rebel and build a new world. but he failed at the time. I don't know that he will come back literally, but figuratively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he did know god directly and the future. I think he knew he would fail then but sow the seeds of discord that would spell doom for tyranny close to our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       that the system would fail, and those capable would be able to rise up against the false masters and build his kingdom -- the kingdom of the ideal of god -- of our true purpose in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       not for the benefit of the few over the many, but for the benefit of all, because its the right thing to do. because in peace man was able to build a tower to heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was not god that cast down the tower of babel, I say, it was satan. he confused the languages and separated people through disasters.
      </p>
      <p>
       the old atlantis, the wars spoken of in hindu scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       the old powers from which our leaders gained their initial education and supremacy over the unwashed masses who had little 'pure' blood in them and no knowledge of history or the self.
      </p>
      <p>
       this was why they interbred. to keep the secrets in the family line -- to ensure the ordinaries would never know the truth and be slaves to the master race.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the bible there is some hidden truth, but it is so warped as to be an entirely different take on history with many lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       the scary thing is, god is the devil and vice versa, because the god they worship is the evil one. the other entity that told the truth Is the true god.
      </p>
      <p>
       this itself becomes twisted by the cults -- they say Lucifer is god.
      </p>
      <p>
       alas it is true, our Lucifer is god. but Lucifer was always god and 'god' was always Lucifer. light and dark had their names switched in ancient times by the followers of evil who wished to finish the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       the ancient new hope of the new world order empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       that the war of the ancients failed to accomplish. they destroyed all of the world in their attempts, and thought the few who rose from the ashes could rebuild it, better this time. that they could keep us stupid powerless slaves instead of our ancestors who knew the truth and said "NO!" who weren't afraid to hit that big red button and end it all to save the idea of goodness and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       unlike our generation of cowards and fools. who seek not to buck the trends, or be individual because it is far too easy to believe the lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you see there is a god that is good, and the creator of all -- I don't know if creator is correct here - he is all. we are inside of him and part of him all at the same time. every molecule and every potential space to hold a molecule is a piece of him or it.
      </p>
      <p>
       and there is a devil. an evil force in this universe that drives things.
one that was once necessary, but out of vanity refused to accept its role ended, and cause a rebellion against all creation. and cause 'death' or destruction, or excessive negative energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       they are not two sides of the same coin at all. freemasonry,crowley, rosicrucianism, O.T.O, Theosophy may seem to hold secrets, but it is among the greatest of lies of them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       the true elite, at the very top, do not partake in the sorceries of the apparent elite. they are above that, knowing only that the rituals they gave those below them to control us, also control them fully.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is why they cannot turn against one another, because if one goes down, the dominoes all fall. each is compromised by the dark lords above merely for partaking in the rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only ones not compromised are those at the very top of the pyramid. I hope one day to know their names and see their faces. and challenge them in a duel. but it probably never would happen,
      </p>
      <p>
       even if we got out from under their control, they may weasel out.
      </p>
      <p>
       perhaps revelations is true, and the devil will be 'cast out' for a thousand years (or rather, in hiding) only to attempt to rise again one more time -- although having had to act directly without the veil of secrecy will expose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot say. I don't know what to trust or not to trust. I take my own feelings as my guide. I study all I can about history, conspiracy, occultism, not in attempts to use them for control, but to understand and fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       this long rant states much of what I have come to believe about history.

       It is my understanding that this is the core to "The Flower of Life", which was initially used for good (in the simplest of terms), but the "baddies" took it over and now use it for evil and have actively hidden this truth from the human species as best as possible. This is just my own interpretation of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       But....drip, drip, drip....here comes the internet and the sum total of human knowledge is now doubling EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Beyond Biocentrism" explains this concept as the source of reality (your own mind) in scientific terms using quantum physics and real world experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we "low level peeps" collectively learn how to harness this power for good, the whole world will flip upside down. I believe this is the only way to take down the forces of evil and change our world.

       but this whole Clinton ordeal has made me interested in all of this, so just wanted to chime in..
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the "Flower of Life" reference and it's very fascinating to see spirituality tie into all of this mess because I've seen it appear in my Ayahuasca vision.. I think that through collective healing of traumas and ridding the spread of darkness on a macro and micro level, whether that is through plant medicine/psychedelics, therapy, yoga/meditation, etc, will eventually flip the whole world upside down.

       Agreed! I think most people see The Flower of Life in deep meditation or during psychedelic trips. It's a common vision, which tells us something. I'm very science-minded and am becoming a big believer in all the things you mentioned for healing, etc.

       If you all want change, start using your imagination like you were before they changed you. Be child like again. Question everything, what really is reality? Many of us have been experiencing the "Mandela Effect" which shows me that reality isn't what we think it is. Figure out what kind of future you want, see it in your mind. I like visualizing news anchors announcing that Hillary is under investigation. Matt Lauer saying that Hillary is going to jail. Get specific. Ask and you shall receive. Be around children who have a different world view. Help others change their thoughts and change the collective. Think good thoughts for those around you and wish them well. What you give comes back to you.

       This is one of the most interesting things I've read in a while. I've noticed some of these things, especially how politicians manipulate people with their speech and mannerisms. They do it well too I guess cause people actually believe them.

       Yes, on a collective level the CIA is fundamentally an evil organisation, in terms of its' initial intentions, and most of its' behaviour.  I do not, however, believe that the organisation is completely devoid of positively intentioned individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we trust them?  Of course not.  There are several species of predatory animals that I regard more highly than spies.  If one of them makes a statement that he is trying to prevent his country from being completely destroyed, however, then I am probably going to believe him.  Aside from anything else, that
       <strong>
        <em>
         is
        </em>
       </strong>
       part of the CIA's genuine mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, does said spy have selfless intentions?  He may very well not.  He may simply have the attitude that the reason why he doesn't want the world to end, is so that he can have a nice retirement next to a beach somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         That is fine.
        </em>
       </strong>
       Obviously, I am going to prefer it if people are
       <strong>
        <em>
         not
        </em>
       </strong>
       psychopathic, yes; but if a few of the spooks suddenly realise that the ship is sinking, and they'd prefer not to go down with it, and even better, that they are willing to render valuable service as a means of atonement, then we should by all means accept said help.

       Yes. They want us to be mad. They want us to have lost faith in our gov't and leaders - from the Bill blowjob scandal - to the Bush election in 2000 that demonstrated the complete disregard for the popular vote and the MSMs role in that debacle by declaring the winner - to the failure of Obama to be anything but change - to the obviously rigged DNC primary and the crazy parade of RNC primary candidates.

       I think the origin of what you are talking about comes from ancient Egypt, Thoth a.k.a. Hermes Trismegistus, and his Emerald Tablets a.k.a the 7 Hermetic Principles. You sound like you have done a lot of research so I'm sure this is nothing new to you. What do you think about these things? I think the other forms of occultism/black magic are just adulterations of this original understand that become less pure as they get further from the source.

      <p>
       I'm just touching the surface here with speculation, I doubt it's that simple. Remember in the debates when Hillary mentioned they had "17 intelligence agencies" confirming the leaks came from Russia? I'm guessing that is what Pieczenik is referring to, but I don't know what it all means yet.

We're Colosseum spectators giving the thumbs up/down when we deem it appropriate, based on very very limited info trickling out in various political formats. I'm just a monkey trying to piece together a puzzle, with a million pieces and a thousand new pieces every day. Kinda frustrating actually.

       I noticed of late the police where I live have acquired and begun cruising town in a M113 APC. It's pretty excessive for the crime levels in my area and there isn't anything here that would make for a good high value target for an attack from outsiders.  Pretty sure I can guess what they really have it for.

       Holy shit. That just seems... condition-y; like they're getting people used to the idea of a militarized state. Then again, given what I've been hearing about the military and various PD's, it seems pretty transparent. Still.. shit.
       <br/>
       Sidenote:
       <br/>
       Is it just me, or is all of this coming together nearly seamlessly? Think about it; all of the shootings (the latter half fueled racial divide-- BLM), militarization of police, the wars in the middle east, the active bias of the media (keeping us distracted from the real issues), divide between men and women (i.e. New Age Feminism), all effected by the same people? Even more incredible was that they openly discussed most of it in the public eye. 
It isn't above these people to incite full scale unrest that would spread quickly in metropolitan areas (which the media has been fueling between whites and minorities, men and women, etc. for years now). What better stage for all of it to go down than election day? I can only hope that things go smoothly and that my mind isn't just running with all of this, but given the level of deceit I've witnessed, I'm not sure that's possible.

       I don't have time to look into this in-depth, but I know quite a bit about the energy industry and looked over Genie's wikipedia page.  Selling natural gas into the northeast US is a huge economic opportunity, and laden with government regulations, so it is absolutely not surprising to see politicians and even Rothschilds directly involved in this type of company.  Energy prices in the NE are insane, even hinting at building something like a (pipeline) is political suicide, and no one wants to have to liquefy NG and ship it over oceans TO THE SAME FUCKING COUNTRY.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say "huge opportunity," I mean "lots of people will die and entire states will become depopulated if it doesn't happen and isn't planned-for decades in advance."  So, I know, 'Dick Cheney' and all, but just take it with a grain of salt.

       Now I know this may make me look like a shill but take it for what it's worth. I can't reveal too much as they may be able to determine who I am. But all this talk about Booz Allen being a global spy agency is a little exaggerated. I'd say one thing that is notable about Booz Allen is that it's part of the Carlyle group. Now just to provide a little background info for where I'm coming from the company is divided into a couple of subsets. The DIG, SIG, HHS, and one other that I can't recall of the top of my head. The DIG(Defense Intelligence Group) would consist of individuals who are contracted by the FBI, NSA, etc. Now this subset of the company could be labeled as a spy agency but it's misleading to say the rest of the company is as well.

       This would explain the "follow the foundation" push, as this is exactly where they (CIA) would be involved. And it also is how the emails would be just a distraction.

       The truth is that order does not come from leviathan, but order comes from God organically in the universe.  Societal best interest is achieved through maximum daylight and transparency.  Not selective secret keeping to preserve some pseudo "for the common good" leviathan state.

       Agree with everything except this. The United Nations is basically the United States. There is no difference in practice. The U.S is the leader, the headquarters are in N.Y, the U.S sets the agenda and the policy positions and everyone else just nods and agrees.

Having said that, it sounds like a great excuse to initiate a full lockdown and curfew scenario (martial law).

       the cia instituted a coup against kennedy in the 60s and we have been living under a cia dictatorship ever sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       as an international spy agency centered in the west and part of the anglo model for global domination, of course they are deeply connected with the financiers and supporters of financial capitalism.

       this is simply an extension of the battle we have seen since the 60s but the cia is it seems increasingly facing pushback.

       What's happening is a factions war at the highest levels, not just here, its global.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find most intriguing is this video plays on the "good guys" insider angle which we've been tracking for some years now and I believe they exist, but I don't think this is them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact they are acting like the "greenlight" right exactly when we expect the good guys to drop the hammer is very suspect.

       FBI Anon from 4 chan said that the release of information had to be "transparent".  That stuck with me because I wasn't really certain what transparent meant in that context.  When the FBI started those cryptic tweets and releasing files I think that was the "good guys" telling us "The only way this will work is if the everyday people of America are the ones to call shenanigans and expose what is happening"

       We should never assume that any coup or counter coup will be to the benefit of the American people.  These are power plays by powerful entities in an attempt to maintain their power......over us.  Never forget that.  There are no good guys.  They are all bad.

       Divide and conquer. When you control the questions and conversation, it doesn't matter whether you're on one side or the other.  What matters is context and ego, if someone is trying to get you to identify with something, you gotta just laugh and remember that's not how leaders are made, that's how lambs are lead to the slaughter.

       That has as much credibility as saying, all Redditors are good.

      <p>
       We'd like to think so, but the simple fact of complexity means there are different agendas, over time each person has different beliefs and polarities (negative to positive) towards others and differing opinions on different events.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's over symplifying to say they're all bad. Just take whistleblpwers as a simple example of someone who's beliefs have changed after discovering new details about their employer.

       Hey, if I wake up in the near future to an America that gives a shit about its borders, language and culture I will admit I was wrong and you are right.  If I wake up and the clinton cabal have been hung for treason, Ill dial you up and buy you a drink and admit I was wrong.  If I wake in the near future to a freer country (less surveillance, fewer taxes, less military, better education, cleaner air and water, less government, and a bigger/stronger middle class) then I will admit I was wrong.  Until those things happen, I will maintain that none of this matters and they are all bad players.

       Everyone thinks they're the good guys. The problem is that there isn't widespread agreement on what is "good" and what is "evil", or maybe deep in our heart we do "know" the difference, but the all conflicts and politics shuts that down.

       No. You are actually not factoring in the controlling mechanism behind these people. The guy is right. Even if there are people with different beliefs and polarities those attributes become party to the controlling force behind the system, through co-opting the person though persuasion or real or political murder.

       which is why we need to shift our attention away from this and to community driven stuff. The paradox of this situation that nobody gets is power is distributed by consent. If you stop giving credence to the power players they lose all legitimacy. Its very similar to the great wizard in the wizard of OZ, pulling the curtain back and seeing its just a small man creating the illusion of an all-powerful entity.

       Once you accept that these people are just players in a great illusion, there authority dissolves and thats when people can take back the power they have given to the illusion.

       Are we meant to be excited that the "intelligence community" is deciding our leader? To be honest, i dont believe any of this is happening... but even if i did, why would i want the dragnetting , FISA courting, intel community having this much power?

       Brand new subreddit created to crowd source information pertaining to the FBI doc without the bias of other subreddits getting in the way, I'm hoping this can be the what the DNCLeaks were for the Wikileaks emails and apply it to going through and finding information on the data dumps from the FBI.

       Any and all supporters are welcome, though some of us have different factions to represent (Bernie, Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, Trump, or Harambe) we all can agree that Hillary Clinton and the rest of Washington have to go. It's a broken system and it needs to be replaced fast. That can only come with a proactive and informed citizenry spearheading it. Once you subscribe I ask you ignore where you came from or who you are voting for and think in only interested in helping the FBI solve this puzzle. That goes for me too, no MAGA in this sub, only democracy.

       So I have really been trying to analyze Steve Pieczenik and what he's attempting to do here, and here's what I suspect is happening.
      </p>

       First of all I believe Julian Assange is either dead, compromised, or being tortured in a CIA black site somewhere. There has been no REAL proof of life that I have seen that can corroborate date, time, and real picture or video.  The video released today by RT had no verifiable link to what day it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may also be a body double that will be used.  His internet was shut off, heavily armed guards raided the Ecuador embassy the same day, and many online are claiming the 650,000 emails are in fact his "dead mans switch" which was released to several people when he knew he was going to be terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter Steve Pieczenik.  He's never shown his face on camera in 25 years, and has been on the wrong sides of several events, like Sandy Hook.  He however was spot on
       <a href="https://youtu.be/aliZCRSIWf0">
        on his analysis of the Boston Marathon Bombing
       </a>
       and it being 100% totally fake. He went further then even Alex Jones's claim of a false flag, and called it fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he is now claiming that the US Intel agencies have been leaking the info to WikiLeaks all along, and that Julian Assange has been very effective at damaging Hillary Clinton.  I disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have yet to see a single damning, news making email sent or received by Bill, Hillary, or Chelsea.  Only Huma, Mills, and Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steve Pieczenik claims it's coming, and it will come from WikiLeaks, who in my estimation has been totally and fully compromised by the deep state, most likely the CIA, who Steve Pieczenik did many many operations for, including for Henry Kissinger, one of the very top globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am holding my breath that any bombshell information will be released specifically implicating any of the Clinton's before next Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll get some more sizzle, but the steak is not coming.  My guess is that Julian Assange WAS going to leak information which implemented the entire leadership of both parties, or something so damaging it had the potential of not only taking Hillary Clinton down, but the entire government, perhaps some evidence of 9/11 foreknowledge and or perpetrating by the USA.  CIA can't let that happen, so they put Steve Pieczenik out there, who is reliable just enough to the politically awake, that we will all listen to what he's saying and not anyone else who may also have those 650k emails that really will bring down the entire government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact the NYPD is involved in all this, is a clue to me that 9/11 info may have been released in those 650,000 dead mans switch documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       They killed Assange to stop it, they're now co-opting through Steve Pieczenik, who may actually release some damning emails to or from Hillary Clinton that may then get her arrested, but it will not be until after the establishment steals the election for her, and she wins the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steve Pieczenik may very well be an American patriot who loves this republic and is leading the counter-coup of CIA / FBI / DIA / and the other agencies who only now have decided they are all of a sudden going to draw the line at Hillary Clinton presidency, and expose her, but yet these same agents were / still are complicit in 9/11, Sandy Hook, BMB, Orlando, and the many other hyper-reality trauma based mind control events or hoaxes we have had post 9-11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't you think these same "good guys in the government" now trying to instill Donald Trump at any cost, including leaking info out of their new found conscience, would have done this for 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Never ever fully believe an admitted accomplished spy who was on the inside for so long, supposedly gets out, and is still breathing.

       i agree with your assessment of WL being compromised (or maybe WL/ -insert alphabet agency- have always been synonymous) -- like you said it's weird that all of a sudden they'd be drawing the line at hillary. if they didn't want us continuing down our current path, it seems like there were a lot of opportunities to stop it, cause the writings been on the wall. so, what conclusion does that leave us with? is donald trump a plant? to what end?

       I don't buy it.  They've had plenty of time to release something on Clinton that would have taken her down without a doubt, and have yet to do it.  If there is any information of that sort in existence, the NSA and CIA and probably FBI already have it, so if they were planning to bring her down, what are they waiting for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the FBI leaving subtle hints - that doesn't make sense either.  They could just have an anonymous leaker be explicit about the info.  No need to hide things behind a subtle message about an FOIA request.

       I think they don't yet have all the info they need, but can't get it due to a justice department roadblock and that they're trying to push past a justice department roadblock by using public opinion as a bludgeon.

       Correct, but they won't fight back unless they have a leader, somebody as president to protect them, otherwise they all get outed (and possibly die) in the event that they lose. They have Trump.

       Loretta Lynch at the DOJ has roadblocked the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       IE, the FBI could release a videotape of Hillary Clinton eating a baby and Loretta Lynch would still scuttle the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So right now the FBI is trying to get the public to vote Trump, so Trump will appoint a replacement for Lynch. That's about the only scenario where Clinton is prosecuted.

       Until the military/police openly stand down from their current mob leaders,   until a transition government is in place,   talk of coup is way,  way the fuck premature.   First of all,  "they" are not going to let Trump or any other outsider have the White House,  because he/they will put the current mob leaders in prison,  and second,  they will not step aside until they have their replacements picked or are on the verge of being arrested or killed.    Anyone who can pull off 9/11,   and then when the whole world knows that Syria was regime change for the purpose of a privately owned mob oil pipeline,  these liars can stand up to us and the whole damn world and keep saying they wanted Assad out for humanitarian reasons!!!!  While they used Al Qaeda and ISIS as their mercenaries!  FUCK this shit.    We are not yet close to the stage of the coup that is necessary.    This guy is putting shit out there like we are closer than we are,  which tells me he is part of the Alex Jones disinfo people that are first in line to get bribed,  coopted,  and say all the right bullshit that is going to keep us in the hole.    Beware.    Don't settle for another con.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Besides,  Trump might just be a ploy to handle the people who think they are getting fresh leadership,  when he is actually just as much an insider as the Clintons,  just a competing mob family.    Once in, (if) the corporate masters will probably pick his cabinet,  and tell him what to do.   And the efforts to keep real third party alternatives out will continue unabated,  or even intensified.

       This is true. I was pretty excited about the whole Trump thing, occasionally watching here from Europe how the elections are going, and I was really psyched seeing just how much foul shit Hillary is responsible for, according to WL. But then it kinda hit me on the "this is too good to be true" side...so I started digging...didn't take much to find the Israel connection with Trump. Went thru videos on his positions about Israel...
      </p>
      <p>
       Larry Silverstein is his "good budy, great guy, believe me", he even mentioned one state solution, and all the ISIS talk makes me think that what he's actually saying is "we will fight YET ANOTHER Israel war, plenty of enthusiastic fresh US goyim meat".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's depressing and it makes me nihilistic, but I guess the only answer is to turn everything off and STOP taking too much intereset into politics, just enjoy life and fuck anyones ideals and race philosophies. First of all, money walks bullshit talks and actions speak louder - you know how it goes. Anyone here concerned with his race, go out and do something, but you won't because you can't, because the system is sealed tight.
      </p>
      <p>
       So people are basically left with internet bickering, engaging in endless, pointless YouTube / chan wars, investing HOURS of your time and energy into producing material that either serves to your echochamber or to get the other side triggered and engaged in a childish shitstorm - until the next thing pops up, by the time next chan or snap or tweet appears. But I guess we all have to get enthusiastic reading "official government secrets". Delusion high energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting for Hillary means you're either an idiot who is obsessed with sex and therefore sexist, just like Obama voters were nothing but racists who thought that supporting Obama is some kind of "I'm not a racist - I voted for a black guy" token - or you're maybe playing chess and thinking "I vote Hillary, WW3 emerges, catharsis - purge - world gets a fresh start". Doubt it lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, voting for Trump will be, in reality, a different blend of Bush senior coffee.

       I'm not ok with labeling Trump a fascist. I understand that it's one of the go-to "ists" that mainstream media pundits use to stop a conversation in its tracks, along with the gold standard "conspiracy theory" and, the king of all, "holocaust denier" haha, try making your point after you get shell shocked with that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Trump is, at its most extreme, a nationalist demagogue. You will see that, and I might be in desperado nihilist mode now, but I predict he'll be a flamboyant mascot for the neocons.

       God you people. Trump is a fucking salesman. That is what he is. A FUCKING SALESMAN. He talks like a used car salesman. Look at his mannerisms his speech patterns, its blatantly obvious. This is what Trump is and always has been.  Americans are pretty stupid. Trump and HRC are both apart of the 'globalist' agenda. They are crass opportunist who will kill their own for more money/power. I mean shit, Ronald Reagan was elected fucking twice. A D-list hollywood actor from California was elected twice and is revered as the savior or the conservative movement. Let that sink in. The presidential election DOES NOT MATTER. If HRC or Trump gets elected the same things will be done. The only difference is the person who is selling it. You have a guy who owned and ran a casino as the savior of the evangelical right.

       Go over to the askhistorians subreddit and ask about the influence of Reagan on this country. Even they admit that he was as influential as our most iconic presidents, regardless of his failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are only showing your ignorance by reducing his political complexity to statements like, "Guys he was in movies like come on seriously? It's 2016." You are not the awakened sheep you think you are.

       In what way?  How was Ronald Reagan extremely influential? Because he talked tough? Because he used made up tropes to appeal to his constituents? Because he, like alot of other presidents ran guns and drugs in order to fun extremist in South America? I am saying that people like you buy that bullshit. He was a salesman, just like every president.  This is what actors do. They sell a story/character. THIS IS WHAT TPTB THINK OF YOU. They think you are dumb and that they can sell you anything and for the most part they are right.

       No, its called realism.   Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are followed by a reasonable plan of action taking the reality into consideration.    Along the way,  we have to bury the lies that we have been believing,  and stop carrying a corpse of false beliefs around.   Now that is depressing,  to still be hung up on denial at this stage.   The truth will set you free.   It will also allow you to act,  and act appropriately to the reality.

These guys are bringing us the insider info and telling us about how they are struggling to save our republic and these disinfo agents are all over them trying to discredit the whole coop scenario.

       Bro, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that this is a bogus claim. People that are working in the intelligence industry dont just switch to the side of the people without some kind of demonstrable change in behavior before this all happened, out of the blue he just comes out and says he's on the side of the republic. Use your gut, this does not pass the smell test by a long shot.

       So I have kind of an out-there theory. That some of the latest moves by intelligence agencies isn't so much that they support Trump, but that they need to ensure there's a much more even distribution of electoral votes (or even a Trump win). This could yield the following scenarios:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          No one gets 270 electoral votes.
         </strong>
         Evan McMullin (ex?-CIA) gets Utah. That puts him in the running for the Congress-gets-to-choose bake-off and they get their boy in (again, I've always kind of thought Obama was an asset). Due to both Clinton's and Trump's voluminous issues and standing investigations/trials, McMullin could be easily justified even if his appointment is against the will of the people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Trump wins.
         </strong>
         Intelligence agencies drop their REAL oppo on Trump (which is voluminous and sordid). They get Pence, who must somehow be controllable (he's scarier than Trump legislatively, TBH, so I don't know about the safety of this scenario).
        </p>
       </li>

       Clinton will win, but they'll have her pinned like a bug to a wall for the entirety of her term. Military conquest projects re the Middle East will be allowed to proceed, but no recognizable national Demo project will--just things that augment and the expand the post-9/11 internal security state apparatus and concomitant war/surveillance industries.

       Yeah, probably the most likely outcome. But if she wins, I wonder if she'll even stick it out for a year...she didn't hang around the full-term as Senator

       </em>
       Secretary of State. Republicans probably don't even need to impeach her...

       I still expect to hear that "russian assassins" took her out solidifying the push for war with Russia.  We know she's sicker than is let on, so it'd be an easy sell for her ego to go out from assassination rather than illness.  Bill isn't looking to healthy either, so maybe a plane shot down or car bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were writing the script, I'd say a surface to air missile to a private jet out of San Francisco International would have the most political pull.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigating the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's campaign shortly after her assassination would be politically suicidal, as would calling for any such investigation.

       Yeah Pence is extremely scary. Not because I care about about abortion or religion or anything like that. Observing people is what I do, and his face has this "off" look to it that's consistent with all the authoritarian genocides. For one thing he's completely dead in the eyes. But also there's this kind of homely look that fantasizes day and night about being alpha. He has this deep-seated inferiority complex, a chip on his shoulder, and no true sense of morality. He clings to Christianity because it's his one grip on humanity, the only thing that keeps his inner beast contained. But once someone like that has power, that inner beast leaks out with mass power abuses. You can see the same look in most of the intel bosses, in Duertete over in the Philippines, and in most of the Nazi command. It's impossible to unsee once you've looked at it long enough. McMullin seems to have it too, but he's one of those hard to read ones. I come from a very similar background as him and I find it hard to believe he would knowingly commit war crimes, but you never can know.

       My main concern with McMullin is that he's so smart he never had to learn how to sin. That sentence wouldn't even make sense to him. But it made sense to Lincoln, who said that in his experience, those with no vices have very few virtues. McMullin never learned to be human, and he doesn't know it. I'm most afraid of someone who can survive the vetting process, rather than those who can't survive it.

       I don't have any problems with Russia, or the Russian people. Their government is a corrupt one due to many factors that are out of the people's hands. Their state is historically authoritarian due to environmental, geographic, and in all likelihood genetic, factors. I appreciate their bravery they've mounted given the odds they face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no opinion about Zionism, except that it's typical tribal warring. Nobody is all right or all wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have an opinion about people who claim their opponent is mentally ill, though. This is a Stasi tactic, utilized by the lowest of the low human garbage. It betrays that you're authoritarian, so now I understand your allegiances. You'd be best shoved off to East Berlin sometime before 1989.

       They haven't fired shit, they've been suppressing the model management stories, the mob stories, the Epstein stories and god knows what else the FBI has after over 50 years of Trump's activity.

      <p>
       They WANT Trump as opposition. They misjudged people's ability to drop to their knees and lap up bullshit, true, and it's a way closer race than they imagined it would be: but they in no way want Trump disqualified and replaced with someone actually plausible/qualified

       You can say "anybody that you know who is voting for Clinton over Stein or Johnson is a lost cause," but that denies reality: These people never would have voted third party, they're rank and file Republicans who can't bring themselves to vote for a mentally deficient Liberal clownshow. So they're voting for an intelligent, highly corrupt, career criminal Republican (Clinton). And yeah, they're sick and angry and saying "God help us," but they're voting Clinton and holding their noses.

       The venom with which the MSM talks about Trump makes it hard to believe that they're just unwitting tools for the elites who actually want Trump as qualified opposition. The MSM's attitude wrt Trump matches what's been leaked in the emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, now that Trump does seem to have a lead, why wouldn't the elites finally let loose on Trump? You think it's so that if he does win, they'll have something to control him with?

       Sorry bro. Your logic would mean that instead of hitting Trump with actual dirt she opted to him him with fake rape and sexual assault cases as well as fake accusations that putin is working along side trump. You have no grasp on reality, keep wasting your time pushing that narrative, have fun.

       Jeffrey Epstein was the pedo blackmail guru. His partner in crime was Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell's sister created the FBI search engine they use:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Christine Maxwell is an Internet content pioneer, best known as the creator and co-founder of Magellan, one of the first professionally curated online search/reference guides to Internet content.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Magellan was acquired by Excite, (a competing search engine) in 1996,[5] she went on to co-found Chiliad:[6] a software company involved in the advance of on-demand, massively scalable, intelligent mining of structured and unstructured data through the use of natural language search technologies. The firm's software was behind the data search technology used by the FBI's counterterrorism data warehouse."

       I've heard rumors (nothing definitive; to clarify) that Epstein could be a piece of Mossad used to blackmail VIPs. But I cannot confirm this. If anyone has something solid pertaining to this subject; please throw it down.

       If Epstein was Mossad, I don't think he would be a convicted sex offender, but I'm guessing myself. No doubt that Mossad is helping to run ISIS though.

       Hmm, more than that I think the deep state is infighting, one faction likes Clinton and the other faction fears the nuclear war they think she'd bring. Both factions are throughout the intelligence apparatus, they're just having a hard time figuring out how to fight (or are doing it in secret) besides supporting their favoured candidate.

       Well, part fear. But I think they'd rather not sit in and have their progeny stuck in a bunker for a few centuries--they'd rather have people to rule over. It's less concrete what exactly would happen to them if people abstractly got out of their control, so I'm not sure what they'd think about that.

       All the people reading this sub should know that this is all planned, everything is a charade and the ultimate goal is one world governance. We are in the execution phases in my opinion and it is very near, do not be distracted by politics and debating what candidate is worse, open your eyes and wake up be prepared mentally/spiritually above all else for what's to come.

       The whole narrative of white knights waking up from within the government just stinks of a classic bullshit coup plot more than something I'm inclined to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the FBI had been all over the suppression of the 28 pages, or if they were bringing down the entire gov't showing how both parties are corrupt, it would be one thing.  This just looks like a genuinely partisan interference.  After Bush and all of the Iraq shit - we are supposed to think that emails and pay to play pissed off FBI agents so much that they had to go after this more than the bullshit oil wars?  It's just not genuine outrage.  If it were, they would have investigated all of this sooner and not be performing timely leaks.  I'm truly outraged at all of this but I am very reluctant to believe this convenient story.  If some sort of coup takes down Clinton only and not the rest of the gov't, the only way I feel better is if we get the whole truth about MLK JFK etc.. right then.  Basically I'm not down with trading one group of liars for another.

       I would say that there is more NSA vs Clinton , CIA vs Clinton , FBI vs Clinton that mentioned in these posts.

      <p>
       Very few people who work in intelligence have enjoyed the last 14 years.  Both Clinton and Bush threw them under the bus ( in many ways she was worse when it came to rationalizing her Senate Vote - putting it on US Intel &gt; GWB ) .

       It seems there was a "carnal" triangular nexus between Bill Clinton, Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein: i.e. they were all allegedly screwing the same underage girls. Indeed, maybe it was during one of those occasions that Clinton and Trump first seriously discussed how to rig the election for Hillary.

       <li>
        <p>

       There is definitely a massive last ditch effort to turn the vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the purpose of propaganda is to gain consent, that consent can be gained by propaganda or violence or any combination of both as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without consent (the support of our thoughts) power crumbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it will be which side wins this war for the support of our thoughts who is the winner.

       It sure would be nice to see their paid gunmen and intelligence people stop being used as anti-democratic, anti-US instruments in the scams of criminals in power. Then again Clinton is running against her own donor and family friend.. so.. they've made sure that nobody can really get in and rock the boat. Millionaire boys club member Trump is not going to change the game for anyone - no more than Obama did after all his great speeches and catchphrases. "Drain the swamp" says the Clinton donor and golfing buddy "running against" a Clinton for president.

       from Steve's wikipedia article:
       <br/>
       "At the US State Department, he served as a "specialist on hostage taking"."  Seems appropriate...
       <br/>
       Alex Jones aired "an interview in which Pieczenik claimed that Osama bin Laden had died of Marfan syndrome in 2001 shortly after the September 11 attacks, and that the attacks on the United States on 9/11 were part of a false flag operation by entities within the American government, the Israeli leadership and Mossad."  Not exactly an insider anymore?
       <br/>
       Who's to say this retired psychiatrist isn't on his own meds these days? And who is giving him 'permission' to talk about this stuff?
       <br/>
       At any rate, it makes a great deal of sense that the leaks came from within the US government, rather than fucking Russia! I'm not sure what else you can take from this though.
       <br/>
       As a specialist in hostage negotiations, and as a psychiatrist, he is the perfect person to take the stage and calm the citizens. This must be even worse than people realize...

        In the age of Satya [truthfulness] your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women, and intoxication.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The deluding energy, or material nature, can act upon the living beings proportionately in terms of the living beings' falling prey to the deluding attraction of mƒÅyƒÅ. Moths are captivated by the glaring brightness of light, and thus they become prey to the fire. Similarly, the deluding energy is always captivating the conditioned souls to become prey to the fire of delusion, and the Vedic scriptures warn the conditioned souls not to become prey to delusion but to get rid of it. The Vedas warn us to go not to the darkness of ignorance but to the progressive path of light. The Lord Himself also warns that the deluding power of material energy is too powerful to overcome, but one who completely surrenders unto the Lord can easily do so. But to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is also not very easy. Such surrender is possible by persons of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. These four principles of advanced civilization were remarkable features in the age of Satya. In that age, every human being was practically a qualified brƒÅhma·πáa of the highest order, and in the social orders of life they were all paramaha·πÅsas, or the topmost in the renounced order. By cultural standing, the human beings were not at all subjected to the deluding energy. Such strong men of character were competent enough to get away from the clutches of mƒÅyƒÅ. But gradually, as the basic principles of brahminical culture, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, became curtailed by proportionate development of pride, attachment for women and intoxication, the path of salvation or the path of transcendental bliss retreated far, far away from human society. With the progression of the age of Kali, people are becoming very proud, and attached to women and intoxication. By the influence of the age of Kali, even a pauper is proud of his penny, the women are always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men, and the man is addicted to drinking wine, smoking, drinking tea and chewing tobacco, etc. All these habits, or so-called advancement of civilization, are the root causes of all irreligiosities, and therefore it is not possible to check corruption, bribery and nepotism. Man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and police vigilance, but he can cure the disease of the mind by the proper medicine, namely advocating the principles of brahminical culture or the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity with the result of blackmailing the consumer's commodities. If the leaders and the rich men of the society spend fifty percent of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in God consciousness, the knowledge of BhƒÅgavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to entrap the conditioned souls. We must always remember that false pride, or too high an estimation of one's own values of life, undue attachment to women or association with them, and intoxication will divert human civilization from the path of peace, however much the people clamor for peace in the world. The preaching of the BhƒÅgavatam principles will automatically render all men austere, clean both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering, and truthful in daily behavior. That is the way of correcting the flaws of human society, which are very prominently exhibited at the present moment.

       Personally didn't understand why Assange threw himself into the middle of US politics in the first place. I guess to expose the fraud and crime that takes place right under our noses. Makes sense the coup was initiated through WiKiLeaks. Not like intelligence agents could come out and speak against the Clinton Foundation, they would've been silenced immediately. They outsourced plain and simple. By the way Trump2016

       Do I believe it is a possibility? Sure. I actually think it's not been planned and has more come about from Comey's own arse covering and then evolved into more of an internal grassroots movement in the FBI from there.

       Do I trust that this guy has the inside track on it? Nope. I'm fairly confident that this is about the $'s and exposure then cashing in for a future book deal.

       If the intelligence community is staging a counter-coup, they could very easily win just by having the NSA involved (if they are).
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA could (and probably already can) get inti voting machines nationwide and just change results. They have the power to do that - they're just computers hooked to networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same can be said for the Clinton coup, though. If they have the NSA on their side, they win.

       Guys, it's PAINFULLY obvious the people behind the video are behind Trumps candidacy. This answers all of your questions. I know, I'm sorry Trump isn't a leftist but maybe if they're successful you'll get a chance to have a Bernie type in 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys wouldn't be fighting back without a candidate in the election about to win so they can seize power (away from the estab).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video they talk about how they are dealing with Obama to ensure a peacful transition. Yesterday, Obama/Michelle/ &amp; chief queef elizabeth warren deleted their twitter support of Shill-dog &amp; unfollowed her. They are getting ready to ditch her once the child fucking info drops.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump wins, they win.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man on the video: Pieczenik, he was Alex Jones show less than a month ago and said that Trump is the revolution. He also eluded to that Trump was approached &amp; encouraged to run from patriots inside the government. Trump is a hot head maniac but he's the only one powerful and crazy enough to do it.

      <p>
       At the Department of State, he served as a "specialist on hostage taking".[11] He has been credited with devising successful negotiating strategies and tactics used in several high-profile hostage situations, including the 1976 TWA Flight 355 hostage situation and the 1977 kidnapping of the son of Cyprus' president.[2] He was involved in negotiations for the release of Aldo Moro after Moro was kidnapped.[12] As a renowned psychiatrist, he was utilized as a press source for early information on the mental state of the hostages involved in the Iran hostage crisis after they were freed.[13] In 1977, Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Mary McGrory described Stephen Pieczenik as "one of the most 'brilliantly competent' men in the field of terrorism".[14] He worked "side by side" with Police Chief Maurice J. Cullinane in the Washington, D.C. command center of Mayor Walter Washington during the 1977 Hanafi Siege.[15] In 1978, Pieczenik was known as "a psychiatrist and political scientist in the U.S. Department of State whose credentials and experiences are probably unique among officials handling terrorist situations".[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 17, 1978 the Camp David Accords were signed. Pieczenik was at the secret Camp David negotiations leading up to the signing of the Accords. He worked out strategy and tactics based on psychopolitical dynamics. He correctly predicted that given their common backgrounds, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin would get along.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1979, he resigned as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State over the handling of the Iranian hostage crisis.[4]
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early 1980s, Pieczenik wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he claimed to have heard a senior United States official in the Department of State Operations Center give permission for the attack that led to the death of United States Ambassador Adolph Dubs in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1979.[16]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik got to know Syrian President Hafez al-Assad well during his 20 years in the Department of State.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1982, Pieczenik was mentioned in an article in The New York Times as "a psychiatrist who has treated C.I.A. employees".[17]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2001, Pieczenik operated as chief executive officer of Strategic Intelligence Associates, a consulting firm.[18]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik has been affiliated in a professional capacity as a psychiatrist with the National Institute of Mental Health.[19]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik has consulted with the United States Institute of Peace and the RAND Corporation.[20]
      </p>
      <p>
       As recently as October 6, 2012, Pieczenik was listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).[21] According to Internet Archive, his name was removed from the CFR roster sometime between October 6 and November 18, 2012.[22] Publicly, Pieczenik no longer appears as a member of the CFR.[23]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik is fluent in five languages, including Russian, Spanish and French.[2][3][4]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik has lectured at the National Defense University.[7

They will pay as well.  They will pay dearly so if you or another loved one happen to know an astroturfer, do the right thing and tell them to run for their lives immediately, to the nearest cave or whatever.

       How does a conspiracy group largely fall for Trumps nonsense?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's on tape numerous times supporting Clinton. He was a major contributor to her. Their kids are friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't know if he's a plant, but he sure as shit is completely fake. I don't claim to know what he believes, but this group has bent over backwards going after the plain jane corrupt politician claiming she's satan incarnate, when there is a legitimate fraud opposing her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, what's worse, the fraud seems to be getting the most support in the conspiracy sub. WTF? Take like two seconds and watch some YouTube clips on Trump about abortion. How gullible can people be?

      <p>
       Ever since Clinton died and was temporarily replaced by a clone they've been working towards a way to have her drop out without all us figuring out what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you make a conspiracy to hide the deeper conspiracy and roll on with a change in plans and nobody is the wiser :)

       I dug up a couple pdf's for you to explore. The authors are/were very religious Christians, but studied this stuff for decades to unearth the truth about satanism. This is probably the best we have right now for well-researched documentation.

       Be very careful delving into satanism, because at its very core is deceit. This is how the baddies become baddies. They are deceived by other baddies who say "this totally makes sense and is perfectly fine". Then you get seduced and introduced into lower and lower levels and start to debase yourself with their rituals or magic practice. This eventually erodes your moral compass and life force - or soul. But this is not the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is the "The Flower of Life" as I noted in another post on here and as OP mentions: The source of reality is your own mind. Thoughts are things. For more on this, read the best seller "Beyond Biocentrism". It will knock your socks off.

       As for two different "gods" when it comes to the OT and NT, the gnostics had an answer for that. They identify the Demiurge as YHWH (OT god) and, for the most part, identify Lucifer /Prometheus as the god of the NT. So, if you want to look further into this you can look into
       <em>
        gnosis

       and

      <p>
       At the Department of State, he served as a "specialist on hostage taking".[11] He has been credited with devising successful negotiating strategies and tactics used in several high-profile hostage situations, including the 1976 TWA Flight 355 hostage situation and the 1977 kidnapping of the son of Cyprus' president.[2] He was involved in negotiations for the release of Aldo Moro after Moro was kidnapped.[12] As a renowned psychiatrist, he was utilized as a press source for early information on the mental state of the hostages involved in the Iran hostage crisis after they were freed.[13] In 1977, Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Mary McGrory described Stephen Pieczenik as "one of the most 'brilliantly competent' men in the field of terrorism".[14] He worked "side by side" with Police Chief Maurice J. Cullinane in the Washington, D.C. command center of Mayor Walter Washington during the 1977 Hanafi Siege.[15] In 1978, Pieczenik was known as "a psychiatrist and political scientist in the U.S. Department of State whose credentials and experiences are probably unique among officials handling terrorist situations".[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 17, 1978 the Camp David Accords were signed. Pieczenik was at the secret Camp David negotiations leading up to the signing of the Accords. He worked out strategy and tactics based on psychopolitical dynamics. He correctly predicted that given their common backgrounds, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin would get along.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1979, he resigned as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State over the handling of the Iranian hostage crisis.[4]
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early 1980s, Pieczenik wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he claimed to have heard a senior United States official in the Department of State Operations Center give permission for the attack that led to the death of United States Ambassador Adolph Dubs in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1979.[16]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik got to know Syrian President Hafez al-Assad well during his 20 years in the Department of State.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1982, Pieczenik was mentioned in an article in The New York Times as "a psychiatrist who has treated C.I.A. employees".[17]
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2001, Pieczenik operated as chief executive officer of Strategic Intelligence Associates, a consulting firm.[18]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik has been affiliated in a professional capacity as a psychiatrist with the National Institute of Mental Health.[19]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik has consulted with the United States Institute of Peace and the RAND Corporation.[20]
      </p>
      <p>
       As recently as October 6, 2012, Pieczenik was listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).[21] According to Internet Archive, his name was removed from the CFR roster sometime between October 6 and November 18, 2012.[22] Publicly, Pieczenik no longer appears as a member of the CFR.[23]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik is fluent in five languages, including Russian, Spanish and French.[2][3][4]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenik has lectured at the National Defense University.[7

       Well, part fear. But I think they'd rather not sit in and have their progeny stuck in a bunker for a few centuries--they'd rather have people to rule over. It's less concrete what exactly would happen to them if people abstractly got out of their control, so I'm not sure what they'd think about that.

       You guys are fucking delusional to think Trump is the good guy. You are all being played for fools. Trump is playing the ROLE of the good guy. This is with the purpose of inciting chaos when Hillary steals the election. Phase 3 of ideological subversion = orchestrate nationwide crisis.

       I'm not religious either but I can promise with you 1000% certainty that living your life for yourself only leads to an unhappy state of mind. Living your life for others trying to improve the lives of others is the only way to achieve real happiness. It's an immutable law of existence that's more than just about religion.

       You can get bogged down in the details and analyze every little piece of scripture or you can see the bigger picture and the actual things in reality that are absolute. This is the one thing that never ever changes no matter what. If you help others out unconditionally eventually you will find the universe rewarding you at unexpected yet desperate times. Someone else will help you for no reason at the exact moment you need it because that's how it works, the effects of your actions last on a long term scale and it comes back to you at crucial moments in your life.

       Clyde Lewis actually talked about this a day or two ago in his radio show Ground Zero.  Funny coincidence.  Great minds think alike I guess.  Anyways,  the episode is called Sex and the Citadel on Ground Zero media.  He's all over most podcast apps if you're not familiar, just look up ground zero media or ground zero Clyde Lewis.  He's pretty awesome.

       So we can have a cohesive and extended conversation about an important topic.

      <p>
       I think the number of skeptical voices in here is a testament to

       's ability to remain cogent and critical of extraordinary claims.

       A sticky isn't an endorsement...it's about fostering discussion. Too many posts create a fractured conversation and this helps consolidate, resulting in fantastic comments and insight.

       You may have misunderstood my question. I understand the point of stickying posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm asking is why was
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       stickied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I.e. What makes this video more important than the other topics being discussed here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, where's the proof that the video's claims are even legitimate in the first place?
