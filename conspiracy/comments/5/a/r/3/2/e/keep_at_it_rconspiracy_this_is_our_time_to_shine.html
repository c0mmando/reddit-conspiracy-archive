    <div class="md"><p>They changed it this year...self posts now get link karma.</p>

<p>When they fudged the voting algorithm a few years back to hide the actual vote count, I decided to stop posting for link karma and for years only submitted self posts. </p>

<p>When they decided to award karma to self posts I stopped posting completely. </p>

<p>Now things are just way too juicy and I&#39;ve decided to rejoin the fray :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has been attracting thousands of new subscribers a week recently. Many are refugees from zombie subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, but in general the election has served as a tipping point for people who knew the political establishment was corrupt, but didn&#39;t want to think about it too much. </p>

<p>The recent whistleblower revelations on the internet, and Donald Trump&#39;s &quot;speaking truth to power&quot; have awoken people the fact that the Washington elite, embodied by the Clintons, were much more corrupt than they realised. </p>

<p>I think also the blatant collusion and dishonesty of the mainstream media (and mainstream subreddits) has shocked and angered a lot of people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will quite reach 400,000 subscribers by election day, but it won&#39;t be far off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a little luck my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ana95/anonymous_hacks_and_releases_30gb_of_bradley/">Bradley Foundation leak</a> download should be done by this evening. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really anyone looking at it right now so that&#39;s my first stop. First port of call is establishing validity and trying to get a sense of it&#39;s authenticity. As soon as I&#39;ve done that I&#39;ll try to cross reference it to the other established leaks and info on the whole HRC, DNC, Foundation, Whitehouse, Epstein, Soros, Weiner, middle East, ISIS, murders, voting machine, Assange, FBI, DDOS, DOJ, 7th floor, Biden, Obama, Kimdotcom, DHS, NSA, State department mother fucking insanity!</p>

<p>Fuck me, like October didn&#39;t already have enough surprises!</p>

<p>edit: Is anyone else looking into this one? </p>
