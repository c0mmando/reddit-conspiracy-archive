       Exactly. But I would offer one small difference. Information is much more freely available now than in 2001. It took time to gather the evidence about everything that occurred under Bush, and the republicans who considered the evidence with an open mind eventually turned on the party. A lot of these people flocked to Ron Paul, and we can see a similar scenario with the Bernie and Jill Stein supporters on the liberal side, so there are many Democrats who are awake to the charades as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence of corruption and collusion in both parties is painfully obvious now, and anyone blindly following either side is simply ignoring reality. Cognitive dissonance is strong, but I would say the truth movement has the momentum now.

       The history of the Democratic Party going back to the 60's where lots of people felt that the poor and minorities were more represented by the Democrats and the Republicans were the business owners and the rich,  this kind of thinking still persists even though in fact,  the Democratic Party is now just as sold out to big money as the Republicans are,  and 99% of the time they screw the small guy including minorities.    But old myths die hard,  and old fart,  life time democrats loath what Trump has represented his whole lifetime,  gambling,  flashy loud mouth lying cheater that he was,  and is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope the Democrats lose,  and I also hope the Republicans lose.   All voices criticizing Hillary are right,  but the only voice that is really anti establishment is Jill.

       I actually thought about that as well and have come to the conclusion that I wasn't privy to any of the 9/11 stuff that had gone on during the time and news never mentioned anything, it wasn't until someone mentioned building 7 a couple years ago that I began to suspect and actually question it. So the short answer would be, the Interwebs wasn't as readily available as it is today back then and Media was much more controlled and honestly? I believed what I saw on the news without question.....nowadays it's much harder not to questions things like Clinton Ethics with all the alternative media that has evolved from the Internet.

       Partisan politics are ridiculous, it like rooting for your home team in baseball to most people, no matter what they do you will always blindly support them. It doesn't matter anyways because to be a politician is to be a scumbag to start with anyways. The smartest person would never ever run for president to busy  so the most qualified person would never be president to begin with.
