    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Did you watch the next video he posted?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q</a></p>

<p>If true, it confirms what I&#39;ve been thinking.  </p>

<p>I heard from my own sources in 2012 about the US running guns through Benghazi, in regard to the embassy attack there.  All the recent news about Turi, Qatar, and Stingers, are consistent with what I was told then, although those details weren&#39;t provided.  The background to Stephen&#39;s mission there was related and is consistent with what has come out.</p>

<p>Other things I&#39;ve been aware of have been corroborated by Wikileaks, and none of my best sources have been contradicted, either.  So, I have come to trust Wikileaks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following it closely, and one thing is that it does appear that a coup-counter-coup is being waged between Wikieleaks and DoJ.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s apparent that Pieczenik is correct that an information and control coup was implement 11/1/2016 by DoJ, and his description of it being done by the administration&#39;s agents in DoJ, CIA, FBI, and other agencies are all in agreement with my first-hand observations that such agents of the administration do exist in those agencies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it&#39;s apparent that DoJ swung a cover-up machine into place yesterday.  They literally promised Congress there would be no further public talk about this.</p>

<p><strong>The Emails aren&#39;t Duplicates</strong></p>

<p>One of the Coup&#39;s PsyOp Talking Points is as follows:</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know whether the 650,000 emails are merely duplicates of the already-investigated 33,000 emails.</p>

<p>Yes, we do know that, with almost complete certainty.  Here is how we know:</p>

<p>Remember that the NYPD reported the emails to the FBI.  The FBI only had interest to <em>metadata</em>.  &quot;Metadata&quot; is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subject line</li>
<li>Date Sent</li>
<li>Who it was To:</li>
<li>Who it was From:</li>
<li>Number of Lines in the message</li>
<li>Route taken through the Internet</li>
<li><strong>Unique Message ID</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s right, <strong><em>every metadata record includes a unique message ID.</em></strong></p>

<p>OK?  The first group of emails also had message IDs.  Does this mean that the new messages found are not duplicates?</p>

<p>Well, the FBI would already have noticed if the 650,000 emails From: or To: Hillary Clinton had the same Message-IDs as the 33,000.  They have databases, but you could sort that difference out with Excel Programming Hacks.</p>

<p>Surely, with Palantir and so on, the FBI sorted the Message-IDs out quite quickly.  I believe the NSA calls that kind of data a &quot;selector&quot;, but FBI probably didn&#39;t even need them.</p>

<p>So, we can guess that the messages aren&#39;t exactly the same set of messages.</p>

<p>It still could be possible that they have different Message-IDs but no new content.  For example, every single email could be a forwarded email with nothing substantial added.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s possible.  <em>cough</em>  We have to work with the benefit of the doubt here, but we can certainly question the narrative that the messages might all be duplicates.  Maybe they all say &quot;Print Dis&quot; or &quot;Delet This&quot; on top.  It could be. </p>

<p><strong>Why Did Hillary Call for the Release of the Emails</strong></p>

<p>Hillary knows that the emails are part of two ongoing criminal investigations: hers and Weiners, at least.</p>

<p>She therefore knows that the emails <em>cannot be released</em>.  The evidence in ongoing investigations is never released, for so many obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Clinton called on the FBI to release the emails to mislead the voters.  She believes voters will think the FBI is hiding the emails to create doubt, when the truth is that the FBI can&#39;t release the emails without compromising their ongoing investigations, and it&#39;s also illegal. </p>

<p>Just from this maneuver alone, one can see that strange things are afoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there have been victims who spoke out, and even tweeted about the NYPD investigation on Saturday.  So, that&#39;s one thing.</p>

<p>For another, there are the US Secret Service logs indicating that Bill Clinton went on several such trips, and there are flight records from the Lolita Express which corroborate them.  So, it&#39;s fairly well established that Bill rode the Lolita Express (and it&#39;s less well established, but highly plausible, that Trump did, too).  The DoJ settlement with Epstein over the Lolita Express is one of the most questionable resolutions of an investigations since yesterday.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with all that background on Epstein?</p>

<p>Putting together all of the available info, I haven&#39;t looked into whether they actually went to the Bahamas, but the rest of this guy&#39;s info corroborates what I have looked into.</p>

<p>If one wanted to be more certain, one would obtain things like FAA and foreign agency logs of the comings-and-going of the Lolita Express itself.  One would cross-reference those with Secret Service records, Bill and Hillary&#39;s calendars and public appearances, the logbooks from the Lolita Express, and make an effort to corroborate the different pieces of information, or to disprove various statements.   Some of those documents are in the public record.  The Secret Service logs from Bill Clinton&#39;s administration would be, and the logs from the Lolita Express are in a court record.</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s all that.</p>

<p>Finally, the guy seems to have had a pretty credible career.  His claim that he is in touch with people from intelligence agencies is believable.  Especially to the intelligence community (not to be too general) 8 of 10 people are going to understand what he&#39;s saying and 0.05% of the general public will really understand 100% of it.</p>

<p>In other words, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really anything wrong with taking him at his word, so don&#39;t get the idea that you scored a point with devil&#39;s advocacy.  If people don&#39;t know what to think, or haven&#39;t looked into any of this conspiracy, they should feel welcome to take this guy at his word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my first reply to you, I mentioned some of the court records about the Lolita Express.  I can&#39;t vouch for this file I found on the Internets, but it was linked from Gawker.  It&#39;s supposedly a scan of &quot;Exhibit MM&quot; in a civil case naming Epstein.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the flight logs of Pilot David Rodgers, which multiple reports say was entered into evidence at the civil trial.</p>

<p>It says the Lolita Express is this plane:</p>

<p><a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N908JE">http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N908JE</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting in the log book that they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boeing 727-31 <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N908JE">N-908-JE</a></li>
<li>Gulfstream G-1159B <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N909JE">N-909-JE</a> 
&quot;exported&quot; on or before 15 days after 12/02/2014.  (Note that the Gulfstream is also listed as N-908-JE on several dates, apparently by error (?))  EDIT: Exported to Venezuela</li>
<li>October 15th, he flew 3/3 touch-and-goes in a Cessna-172-R.  That could be normal pilot training, to stay current in a type of plane, or it could be providing flight instructions.  The tail number does not look up to the same model of plane, but it is super hard to read and rewritten a couple of times.</li>
<li>N-907-JE seems unrelated and </li>
<li>N-910-JE is not assigned.</li>
<li>(EDIT) <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N212JE">N-212-JE</a>  is the replacement Gulfstream, a nice black-painted thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;JE&quot; designator in the end is interesting considering that the Boeing is owned by a &quot;JEGE&quot; company.  I dunno if he got vanity numbers somehow, or sequential numbers by registering both planes in one correspondence.</p>

<p>Anyway, these records appear to span from 1999-2004.  Can you convert them to Excel for us?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Here are some more records, the planes registered to JEGE, Inc.  <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=JEGE&amp;amp;sort_option=1&amp;amp;PageNo=1">http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=JEGE&amp;amp;sort_option=1&amp;amp;PageNo=1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean, how does he know this because he&#39;s no longer an official?</p>

<p>They all stay in touch.</p>

<p>Not to be too mysterious, you can see this when, e.g., the Plumbers were taken out of CIA and into RNC, then brought back into agencies later.  The agencies have a revolving door with the administrations.  When the politics change, the administration executives pack up their offices and move into private offices until the next time the administration swings back.</p>

<p>People in the military keep in touch.  People in the police keep in touch.</p>

<p>The NYPD keeps in touch with the FBI, and they both keep in touch with the CIA.  Everybody&#39;s keeping in touch.</p>

<p>Even Microsoft hires &quot;ex-&quot;CIA people, e.g., their head of facility security.  That&#39;s the normal situation -- big corps. hire people in touch because they were former agents, former officials, former etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least on this point:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On October 20, 2011 in an interview with Alex Jones, Pieczenik claimed that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was alive, and said, &quot;There’s no way they killed Muammar Gaddafi, that’s not our operating mode and I’ve been involved in 30 years with the takeouts and regime changes.&quot; He also criticised President Barack Obama, calling him an &quot;obsessional pathological liar&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His most recent videos would indicate that he no longer believes we didn&#39;t kill Qadafi.  I can see why he would have fallen for the reasoning that, &quot;we don&#39;t operate like that.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the other 4 claims, at least 1-2 are arguable that he might have been correct.  </p>

<p>Finally, the guy seems to have had a pretty credible career.  His claim that he is in touch with people from intelligence agencies is believable.  Especially to the intelligence community (not to be too general) 8 of 10 people are going to understand what he&#39;s saying and 0.05% of the general public will really understand 100% of it.</p>

<p>In other words, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really anything wrong with taking him at his word, so don&#39;t get the idea that you scored a point with devil&#39;s advocacy.  If people don&#39;t know what to think, or haven&#39;t looked into any of this conspiracy, they should feel welcome to take this guy at his word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my first reply to you, I mentioned some of the court records about the Lolita Express.  I can&#39;t vouch for this file I found on the Internets, but it was linked from Gawker.  It&#39;s supposedly a scan of &quot;Exhibit MM&quot; in a civil case naming Epstein.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the flight logs of Pilot David Rodgers, which multiple reports say was entered into evidence at the civil trial.</p>

<p>It says the Lolita Express is this plane:</p>

<p><a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N908JE">http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N908JE</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting in the log book that they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boeing 727-31 <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N908JE">N-908-JE</a></li>
<li>Gulfstream G-1159B <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N909JE">N-909-JE</a> 
&quot;exported&quot; on or before 15 days after 12/02/2014.  (Note that the Gulfstream is also listed as N-908-JE on several dates, apparently by error (?))  EDIT: Exported to Venezuela</li>
<li>October 15th, he flew 3/3 touch-and-goes in a Cessna-172-R.  That could be normal pilot training, to stay current in a type of plane, or it could be providing flight instructions.  The tail number does not look up to the same model of plane, but it is super hard to read and rewritten a couple of times.</li>
<li>N-907-JE seems unrelated and </li>
<li>N-910-JE is not assigned.</li>
<li>(EDIT) <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N212JE">N-212-JE</a>  is the replacement Gulfstream, a nice black-painted thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;JE&quot; designator in the end is interesting considering that the Boeing is owned by a &quot;JEGE&quot; company.  I dunno if he got vanity numbers somehow, or sequential numbers by registering both planes in one correspondence.</p>

<p>Anyway, these records appear to span from 1999-2004.  Can you convert them to Excel for us?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Here are some more records, the planes registered to JEGE, Inc.  <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=JEGE&amp;amp;sort_option=1&amp;amp;PageNo=1">http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Name_Results.aspx?Nametxt=JEGE&amp;amp;sort_option=1&amp;amp;PageNo=1</a></p>

<p>What does the metadata of this image say about time/date?  It was taken at Albuquerque, NM.</p>
