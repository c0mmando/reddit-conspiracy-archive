    <div class="md"><p>look I hate those Shillarys as much as anyone but if anyone truly thinks Donald trump is even close to a good president they are so politically and mentally inept I don&#39;t even want to carry on a conversation with them.</p>

<p>Also pro tip if your going to accuse someone of being a shill look into their profile to make sure they either only post to political subreddits or if they have a throwaway account. If you checked mine you would have found me calling out a CTR and busting his balls. You are the type of people hillarys campaign love to parade in front of normal people to show them how fucking stupid Donald trump supporters are.</p>

<p>I dont know how much janitors are paid, but you cant expect a business that employs thousands of people to dole out mucho dinero to clean toilets. And once again, even if they are paid close to minimum wage, it doesnt mean Trump thinks those people are pigs.</p>

<p>I mean, do you even know how much they get paid? Not that it matters at all, but for all we know to starting rate might be like 14 bucks an hour. Thats close to what i make and im in stonemasonry</p>

<p>His establishment running mate would probably fall in line quite nicely. He was a strange pick for someone who really wants to change the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you have here is a bunch of Skeptics and people to smart to get fooled into believing in a savior. We here on the sub are for the most part wise to the bread and circus theatre known as politics. We also don&#39;t have our heads so far up our ass we forget 4 years ago, 8 years ago, 12 years ago. Trump has never been in this position or any government position, so taking his &quot;word&quot; at face value before he has proven shit is just dumb and naive. He&#39;ll it&#39;s hard to believe a politician who has a track record, it&#39;s harder to trust one who doesn&#39;t. There are more than two options for any sane person, Trump is an unknown, and you believing he is your savior just means the political system worked for you. So what if Trump gets in and turns his back on th3 people and everything he promised like oh I don&#39;t know EVERY PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM? Will you then lose faith until four years down the road when your new savior emergencies? Trump could change everything, or he could change nothing. When the gun is to his head we will see if he plays ball, until then fuck your salvation, it ain&#39;t coming from a politician. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is no savior. But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a satanist either. And I do think Clinton is a satanist. </p>

<p>His presidency is probably going to suck. But I don&#39;t think he actually wants to kill people, like Clinton does. After 4 years of Trump, we&#39;ll still be basically okay. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll run for another term if he wins. He may even pull a Palin. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see more hate for Trump on this sub than I do Clinton. But I never go to &quot;HOT,&quot; so maybe that&#39;s where you see it. </p>

<p>Nobody should get complacent, either. When I see Clinton in handcuffs, then I&#39;ll feel we&#39;ve &quot;won&quot; something. But we can&#39;t think the game&#39;s over, either, because it&#39;s not. It never is. It never will be. And that&#39;s okay. </p>
