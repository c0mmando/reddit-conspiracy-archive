    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it. This seems to be doing more damage than Wikileaks or anything else up to this point. It looked as if Hillary was going to cruise to victory before this, so it doesn&#39;t make sense that they would add more fuel to the fire. I honestly think we&#39;re witnessing internal battles finally coming to the fore over endemic corruption that is plaguing our country. It&#39;s a powder keg just waiting to go off</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, this will just compound on those - this is the final week, everyone is pulling out their final plays. It&#39;ll probably all culminate in Friday&#39;s testimony by Comey. He can&#39;t easily dismiss 650,000+ emails to clear Hillary&#39;s name in that time frame - the fact is that she&#39;ll be under criminal investigation as voters go to the polls and even if she wins, she&#39;ll still be under investigation leading up to the inauguration...</p>

<p>She can&#39;t win now without an all out assault on election fraud following the results. It&#39;s most likely over, one way or another, but at this point, I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ever be able to govern legitimately in the eye of the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The interesting thing to me is this. Okay, Comey gets a lof of pressure from within the FBI and said he caved in to that. Okay, but what about the pressure you&#39;d get under if Clinton became president? That would be lights out real quick. </p>

<p>What I assume any other FBI director would have done is to just ride it out for two weeks or so, after which they contact the Clinton administration to let her know, hey I covered your ass during this campaign, now these guys around the office are giving me a hard time, you owe me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just hard for me to believe he dreads the pressure from within the FBI more than the prospect of having a president who will be out for his blood. So all I can wonder is, what is he doing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thea are questions I struggle with too. The only explanation i see as plausible is the silent hand/nsa theory. People are starting to put together how deep this goes. I think the mishandling thing is all a lie, and I think the relationships to the donors was not just peddling influence, but actually operating retail operations to sell American secrets. Anyone who has really looked at the podesta emails pertaining to Scalia with an open mind would have a very hard time denying their implications.</p>

<p>All being said, I think this shit goes so deep the only way to prevent upheaval is to try and cut the cancer without removing the head</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My idea is that &#39;the elite&#39; are on board with getting rid of Clinton, and they contacted him in that light. </p>

<p>A few months ago Hillary Clinton was a goddess, nobody was allowed to say anything bad about her. And now in recent days we have low profile guys like Guliani saying bad things about Clinton? Doug Schoen withdraws his support of Clinton on FOX news? I think it&#39;s clear the word is out and that it&#39;s understood she&#39;s going down, and it&#39;s not just Comey who&#39;s responsible, but he is the executor and maybe ends up being the fall guy for this. </p>

<p>It all sounds whack, I won&#39;t lie, I&#39;m aware of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bottom line is giving the public reasons to snoop around is not good for business. Hillary was such an effective conduit of the powerful because of the fact she&#39;s played the liberal card and gained trust of minorities etc. even if she gets away with everything,  eyes will be on her the entire term as president and that means she&#39;s no longer a Trojan horse and therefor useless to her controllers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the next 48 hours are going to answer a lot of questions. Either Comey is playing both sides to eventually cover for Clinton or he is all in for an indictment. If the revolt inside the FBI is true then I think he might be all in. He can&#39;t tell them internally one thing and then switch it up without some massive blow-back that will be too big to hide. Maybe he hasn&#39;t even made up his mind yet. He may be waiting to see what comes out of Wiki-Leaks to make his final decision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the real deal.. just look at the way hillary, podesta, huma look.. in their photos.. interviews.. so on.. they are fucking DESTROYED..they are not actors, they couldnt act this distraught.</p>

<p>the FBI could no longer hide it.. the multitude of good agents were inside looking at all this shit, and seeing their politicized leaders blocking the investigation.. they got fucking pissed off.. add in the NYPD doing their own investigation and turning it over to the FBI, the FBI could no longer hide it.. now a secondary law enforcement agency (NYPD) had seen some shit and could go public about it..</p>
