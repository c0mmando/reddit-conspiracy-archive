        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m someone who has been into the occult and conspiracy stuff off and on for a long time, and sometimes I get confused by the overlap between those two things. I see a lot of conspiracy theorists talking about occult symbolism, claiming that the elites are into Satanic rituals and things like that. However, I myself have been into things that could be considered &quot;occult&quot; (rituals, Tarot cards, talking to dead spirits, spells, etc). And I don&#39;t see that much overlap on the occultists&#39; side of things. But the bizarre shit like Bohemian Grove, the symbolism and secret societies makes me think that at least some of the elites have some occult interest and knowledge, though whether they actually believe in it is anyone&#39;s guess. I just can&#39;t see what they do connects with regular run of the mill people who practice witchcraft or occultism because most of those people aren&#39;t rich or powerful, nor are they doing anything all that sinister. And honestly, there are so many occult texts out there freely available to everyone. </p>

<p>So how do you feel about conspiracies and occultism and how do you think they intersect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s certainly enough Saturn associated symbolism worldwide and in history to give some credence to it. I would say a certain group holds Saturn in very high regard. Unless some people just really love black cubes.. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so cut and dry that everyone worships,  or interprets things in the same way.  I do believe that the common source is definitely the ancient mystery schools (which I interpret as advanced consciousness from pre-history - I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions on where the source of that advanced consciousness came from).  </p>

<p>This wisdom has either been distilled and kept from sight in secret societies,  used by ancient elite to create oppressive religious institutions,  spread freely by spiritualists throughout history,  and more recently by modern elite oligarchs for globalist/imperialistic purposes. Some groups have used the wisdom for good,  while others have not. I also believe there has been conflict between these groups throughout history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my comment is based upon what i&#39;ve read. i&#39;m aware that &#39;occult&#39; means hidden. if the elites have been worshipping Saturn with full knowledge while the public has been kept unaware<br/>
(note pics of the black cube, worldwide <a href="http://www.apwin.org/wp-content/uploads/books/Vigilante&#x27;s%20Articles/Occult%20Symbolism.%20Saturn%20Worship.pdf">http://www.apwin.org/wp-content/uploads/books/Vigilante&#39;s%20Articles/Occult%20Symbolism.%20Saturn%20Worship.pdf</a>); there must be a reason. many agree that the so called elites the are not on a positive path. </p>

<p>i have no extensive knowledge, just my opinion (from what i&#39;ve read).</p>

<p>&quot;The Beast Aleister Crowley left a heritage of Thelema followers and one of them was the Brotherhood of Saturn. This magical order was similar to the other occult groups, whether it be New Age, Freemasonry or Thelema; they all revolve around the idea of mastery of occult knowledge (e.g. axioms like “As above, so below” which emphasize the duality aspects of man and world) in order to advance and evolve one’s self in a series of steps and rituals. The Brotherhood of Saturn incorporates 33 steps to achieve the full spectrum of enlightenment, similar to Scottish Rite of Freemasonry who also incorporates 33 degrees.</p>

<p><a href="http://illuminatiwatcher.com/decoding-illuminati-symbolism-saturn-black-cube/">http://illuminatiwatcher.com/decoding-illuminati-symbolism-saturn-black-cube/</a></p>

<p>&quot;. . . The Greeks and the Romans also worshiped Saturn as a cruel deity. Here’s a 
brief summary of the mythology of Saturn in the western world:
“With the deposing of his father, Saturn became the ruler of the Universe 
for untold ages and he reigned with his sister, Ops, who also became his wife. It 
was prophesied that one day Saturn would lose power when one of his children 
would depose him. </p>

<p>. . .Saturn always had a negative, if not evil significance. In ancient times, it 
has been called “The Greater Malefic” which was opposed to Jupiter, “The Greater 
Benefice”. Saturn is esoterically associated with man’s limitations,
restrictions, death and decay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you probably know,  the term occult means nothing more than &quot;that which is hidden from sight&quot;. It is neither a positive or a negative,  although we have been conditioned to associate it with &quot;evil&quot;. There is a reason for this,  as there is a tremendous amount of wisdom and knowledge to learn from ancient teachings. The powers that be hate competition. </p>

<p>Those in power are aware of this wisdom, have passed it down for thousands of years, and they apply it every day.  Not for the good of humanity,  truth and freedom, but to oppress and control others in their sick sense of self preservation and quest for materialistic authority - to become gods among men. </p>

<p>I highly recommend you spend some time listening to Mark Passio&#39;s podcasts to get a greater appreciation. Start at the beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are Fascists.  This is actually validated by history.  What I mean is that they hate communists and socialists.  If you observe what is happening in the US, we are becoming more and more like a fascist state.  The police are being militarized and corporations and banking are gaining much more power and control.  Banks and corporations want certain rights enjoyed by individuals (Citizens United), but they do not want to be liable for any wrongdoing.  The means of production have essentially been moved to outside the US, outside the control of the workers.  If you read about Socialism and Communism, then you will see the significance of this.  </p>

<p>I have heard that certain fascists, like Hitler, were into occultism, but I never looked into it.  Have you read about the Bohemian Grove?  There is the owl, Molech, and The Cremation of Care ceremony.  This is clearly occultism to me.  </p>

<p>As for them being Satanists, I believe it is easier to answer that question.  No, they are not.  </p>

<p>Have you read the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth?  </p>

<p>People can characterize the rituals and symbols of the Bohemian Grove as being Satanic, but these people are typically very religious so any worship that is different is considered to be &quot;satanic&quot;.  Hell, they consider the Freemasons to be satanic.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I don&#39;t view Bohemian Grove as Satanic but it definitely seems  occult-like, just from my own experience. Sometimes these claims about Satanism by the conspiracy theorists make me kinda uncomfortable because honestly, they would most likely see ME as Satanic, even though I have no affiliation to satanism at all. </p>

<p>I have read though that much of conspiracy thought as we know it came out of right-wing Christian propaganda and a lot of stuff I see in these circles definitely seems like that has at least an ounce of truth.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that you consider them fascists. Others consider them to be &quot;cultural Marxists&quot; or people who are somehow secret communists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do consider them to be fascists.  I have been on a tear recently with reading and watching videos.  I came across these videos by Daniel P. Sheehen, and he explains it very well in his college lecture.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeNQixRRUCo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeNQixRRUCo</a></p>

<p>When the US overthrows a country, they usually take out the democratically elected government and install a fascist regime.  There are plenty of examples in Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.  </p>

<p>I am reading up on Marxism and Leninism because I am not the expert on either of these.  </p>

<p>Fascism seems to work well for them because they can subsidize their companies using taxpayer money.  The problem with communism and socialism, from their point of view,  is that the people are subsidized, not the corporation.  See what I mean?  </p>

<p>So, the banks and other industries were bailed out in 2008 with taxpayer money.  </p>

<p>They actually tried to overthrow the US government in the early thirties because FDR was essentially socializing the economy to bring it out of the Depression.  This is discussed by Daniel P. Sheehan in some of his videos, and it is also discussed in War is a Racket by Smedley Butler.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a bit about this in a personal way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a complicated answer. Technically, thy are not Satanists. That is, they do not necessarily worship someone they&#39;d call the devil and what they do religiously bears no resemblance to something called &quot;the church of Satan&quot;. </p>

<p>However from a Christian perspective or even a theoretical good/evil perspective they worship a being that very much is the definition of a devil. </p>

<p>Occult is just hidden information. There is a lot of that but none of it is ever represented overtly in the mainstream so those that &quot;dabble&quot; in the occult are being rather contradictory. If it is occult, you&#39;re not advertising.It&#39;s the cracker-jack version you get.</p>

<p>You will however see real applications of real occult power in the &quot;hidden in plain sight&quot; context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well all the available texts and grimoires do not work. So the occultism of the elite and normal people are completely different.
