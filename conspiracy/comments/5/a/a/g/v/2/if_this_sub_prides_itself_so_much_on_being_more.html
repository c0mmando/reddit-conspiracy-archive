<p>People here have different opinions about different things, if those different groups of people want to organize about their shared beliefs then more power to them.  But the subreddit of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not itself in the business of organizing a resistance movement.  Our stated goal</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the publicâ€™s imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is to provide a platform for anyone to discuss these things, and in that regard we have succeeded.  If the mods here start trying to organize the users into action than we can not possibly maintain a bias free environment for future discussions because whichever cause we would decide to organize behind would instantly become dominant and our stated goal would then fail.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is functioning appropriately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a horrible point.  We <em>do</em> need to come together and work against the corruption we KNOW is happening.</p>

<p>Too many of us are either too scared to actually do anything about it, or we&#39;re simply too overwhelmed with what it would actually <em>take</em> to fix the problem.</p>

<p>And what would it take?  It would take all of us coming together as one united citizenry.  It sucks because there are too many of us that <em>don&#39;t</em> want to come together and that <em>aren&#39;t</em> willing to do what&#39;s needed in order for we the people to work as one against the corruption coming down upon us.</p>

<p>And some of us know that so long as we don&#39;t ALL come together as one, then we don&#39;t really stand a great chance of toppling the evil empire that exists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tough situation to be in because even though a lot of us know what&#39;s going on and ARE willing to fight, we&#39;re willing to fight if ALL of us do it together.  The prospect of being a lone Christopher Dorner type (who I think, even though he seemed a bit misguided, had balls of fucking STEEL and I wish we all grew a pair like that) and going out and fighting against corruption, but ending up <em>just like</em> Christopher Dorner doesn&#39;t seem too inviting to too many people - and this is understandable.</p>

<p>I mean if we were all in it together and some of us end up dead in a fight?  Then okay.  It&#39;s a fight.  That happens.  So be it.  I think there are a lot of us that would be willing to do that (i.e. fight and possibly die) if we knew all our fellow brothers and sisters had our back.  The idea of risking your life, but possibly standing the <em>real</em> chance of winning the day and winning your rights IS indeed worth fighting for.  However, the idea of not having <em>everyone</em> fighting together toward the same goal, you fighting on your own, and then ending up SURELY dead because you&#39;re not backed up by your fellow brothers and sisters makes one a lot less willing to stand up and fight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the whole &quot;You first.&quot; &quot;No <em>you</em> first.&quot; kind of scenario.</p>

<p>We ALL need to go first.  Together.</p>

<p>However, we must first all COME together...and we haven&#39;t really even gotten that far yet.</p>

<p>We&#39;re just not organized.  We&#39;re not united.</p>

<p>TPTB have made sure that we&#39;re very disorganized and not coordinated as a citizenry.  They do this so as to make us dependent not upon each other and ourselves, but upon <em>them</em>.  That way we cannot fix our weakness through our own efforts.  We can only keep depending upon them.</p>

<p>And that keeps us weak.  Weak of body, weak of mind, weak of heart, weak of spirit.</p>

<p>And it keeps us from rising up and being free of these manipulating forces and organizations over us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christopher Dorner was a police officer who discovered some seriously bad shit going on within the police department, got rail roaded when he tried to expose them, and as a result, he decided to try to take them all down himself - like expose and then kill them.</p>

<p>He ended up shooting some unintended civilians as far as I understand, and I&#39;m not saying he was a &quot;hero&quot; out and out, but my point is that here was a man who simply couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t stand for the corruption he came face to face with, and put his balls on the line to fight it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people that will vilify him and say he was &quot;crazy&quot; or whatever, but my point is that - again - he was a man who was willing to go &quot;all in&quot; on his convictions to fight the blatant corruption that he was subjected to.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any of us should necessarily have Christopher Dorner&#39;s <em>mind</em> - since it seems he didn&#39;t think through his plans as well as he should have - but, again, he had a heart that was unwilling to back down from the corruption he directly witnessed, and he was willing to put his life on the line to try to do something to stop it.  He was, of course, unsuccessful - as he was only one person against an entire PD going after him - but imagine what, say, 10,000 citizens all of one mind, with a disciplined plan of action and with Dorner-like conviction and courage could accomplish.</p>

<p>I referenced Dorner only as it regards his willingness to see his plans through to the end is all.</p>

<p>So it turns out that everything that is above is just like that which is below.  Infinity not only extends itself in distance that we can see with our own eyes, but it also extends itself in scale which we can not begin to comprehend.  Time is so infinite that it doesn&#39;t even exist, its a function of our existence and only exists because we came into being and now measure it.  </p>

<p>The true nature of things is so incredibly simple and complex and the same time that our human intellect isn&#39;t capable of comprehending it, its functions and its scale... anymore than an ant is capable of comprehending that its walking down your forearm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the principle characteristics of conspiracies is that they are hidden. Often obfuscated by being conducted with side stories and distractions, intentionally, to put you off the scent. A conspiracy is  equally known by its limited access, participants, secrecy, need to know, dupes, dead ends, and non-existent counter theories.</p>

<p>Example of dis-information in a known conspiracy: when they first started atmospheric spraying (commonly called &quot;Chemtrails&quot;) they began with the false story that the Aurora Space Plane had a distinctive &quot;soap on a rope condensation trail&quot;. This was spoken of on Art Bell in as early as the &#39;80&#39;s. </p>

<p>So we&#39;re left with speculation and drawing conclusions based on vapor, gas, bullshit, lies, and evidence that can be multiply interpreted. </p>

<p>If you have a discerning mind, and enough coincidences smell fishy you can be quite satisfied by your own conclusions <em>because they fit!</em></p>

<p>As you all know, however, from this forum any such conclusions routinely get aggressively hacked to bits, on purpose, or out of pure cussedness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to bed so I&#39;m not going to engage any fanatics so once again, <em>many reasons for chemtrails:</em> Mostly military experimentation, new forms of chaff, stealth. Projected power, beam weaponry. Disposal of industrial poisons: coal ash. Mood, not necessarily mind control. Mass dosing of vaccines, biological warfare. Weather control and speculation on the CME (if you know who&#39;s going to get rain, when, you can buy commodity futures). Increasing flood claims, disaster declaration fraud, insurance fraud. Population control, chemical decerebration, dumbing down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you consider that .01% own about 60% of everything, you can be sure they have filtered air, organic food, know sourcing of everything. When a Saudi prince visited recently he had 70 limousines  including his food and cooking staff, so rich they might as well be space aliens. The dusting is for &quot;us fleas&quot; and the preparations can be as demonic as nano-mettalics so small they pass the blood/brain barrier and can be &quot;excited&quot; by radio frequencies, or &quot;parts&quot; of a poison that can be activated when needed, say when they install Clinton and the nation goes crazy and threatens the real power structure. It has been said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about chemtrails until they <em>stop</em> because that means... they&#39;re ready.&quot;</p>
