       Yup, they should postpone the election 2-3 months, name Bernie the Democratic nominee, and schedule one last debate between him and Trump. Boom, America is feeling the Bern and he gets what was stolen from him.

       I'd still be concerned then, though, that the DNC would still be pulling his strings. It's honestly like in an ideal world I'd prefer for Trump to be in for 4 years to clean out as much corruption as he can, and then have someone more left-wing come in and take over.

       I would hope Trump would win in that situation, anyone hand picked by Hillary almost certainly can't be trusted. I'm just not sure people get that yet unfortunately.

       Why would the Democratic party hand over the presidency to Bernie Sanders? What they care more about than anything is keeping their political power, and while Bernie is popular he's anything but a team player. If the need to replace Clinton were to arise they wouldn't even consider Bernie, it would have to be someone like Biden, Gore, or Pelosi who they can control.

       There is no Constitutional precedent to cancel the election because a nominee gets arrested/dies/disappears. Votes for them would simply be null and void in those events.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the DNC could replace her at anytime with anyone they wanted. If they put Kaine at the top of the ticket, any votes currently cast for H at the top would also be void. Let's just say, if anything happens to her in the next 8 days we will have President Trump.

       Actually not true. They can replace a candidate with another right up until the election, and even though the ballot may still say Hillary, whoever is in her place would be receiving the vote, and it would count.

       So you should trust someone that can be compromised because his family is in danger? That should make you trust him less imo.

       Your replacement after the election. Not before. They could suggest someone else entirely with a different VP. 
I think if she did step down and the establishment picked someone else besides Sanders (who they would never pick obviously) it would destroy the dems. The Sanders supporters would break down after a second betrayal.

       Yeah I could easily see it. Trump almost split the GOP. If it wasn't for people disliking Hillary so much (if anyone else had been running for Dems) it would have. Now the Dems could be closer to a split. The fact that either party could split is a good indicator of how messed up our country is politically. I would much rather have 3 or 4 parties, because they more there are the smarter the people get. The more tempered the candidates have to be. You will see candidates who are conservative but pro gay rights and pro choice, because they can afford to shed the more extreme voters since they don't have to go after 50 percent.
It would be nice, people would vote on issues and people would get smarter.

       This is actually a time that having the process of an Electoral College benefits us.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you vote for President, you're not voting for a person. My ballot, for example, actually reads "the electors of Hillary Clinton" and "the electors of Donald Trump" next to the check-box. Each candidate hand-picks a certain number of people to submit their ballots to the Electoral College in December. They're usually party insiders, trusted supporters, or otherwise highly connected people. For example, in California, had John McCain won the 55 electoral votes, Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been one of the 55 people submitting a ballot to the Electoral College.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, those electors can put whatever name they want on the ballot. Some states have un-enforceable requirements that they go along with the popular vote, but, no one has ever tested these legally. We've had several "faithless electors" in the past, I know one voted for John Edwards for President instead of John Kerry in 2004. They are never challenged or prosecuted. That's why only party insiders and trusted faithful are ever picked for the job--because you really don't want one "going rogue".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event that Hillary steps down, is forced out, incapacitated, or in any other way removed, all that has to happen is the 270+ or whatever people who are the Electors voted on to vote for her will gather and go along with whatever the plan is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC can tell them to vote for Bernie or Kaine or whoever. Their case would actually be strengthened should Hillary step aside before the election: they could put out a press statement beforehand saying "All Voters: A vote for Hillary will be counted by her Electors as a vote for Bernie", and the Electors would feel bound to honor the public's wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same process that would be used should a candidate die between election day and the date the Electoral College votes... the Electors who were bound to that candidate could convene with the party and decide on a replacement candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR:
       </strong>
       technically, anyone could be the fill-in, because of the indirect process of the Electoral College makes it easy to change to another candidate.

       It benefits the Republicans because they control the House. If the Democrats try a name swap, it might split the Democratic vote within the Electoral College, which might then cause no one to receive 270 electoral votes, which would send it to the House of Representatives to decide, which is Republican.

       The election is so close that even if Wikileaks were to release an audio video recording of Hillary selling nuclear weapons in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation the Democrats would drag out the indictment until after the election was over.

       Hillary wins and resigns making Kaine president, then he pardons her. Case closed.
