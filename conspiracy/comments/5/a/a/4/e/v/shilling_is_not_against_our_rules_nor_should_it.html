       Oh but try saying it that way. If you give even an inch to pivot, then it's weird, the conversation will seem to never stay on point. I thought I'd say "do shills really have an opinion when they are paid to repeat another persons'?", and that alone, but even then, it's "well if you look at our rules, they don't break them". I asked "why is it not a rule, and further, why do you not care, as a mod?", and he chose to focus entirely on something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is all painfully obvious.

       I have been here over 7 years and have literally never had issues with mods until this last 8 months.  There are a few that think their shit doesn't stink.  People will be leaving this sub after the election for the most part.  It has gained quite a few new users in just the last few months... These are most likely disinformation agents from all sides, although ctr attacks the most from what I have seen.  The best thing you can do is link up with like minded users and vote the new submissions.  That's the only place I go anymore.  There are alternatives popping up all the time as well.  Keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting.  Fuck the noise!

       I won't remove it but another mod may. Personally I have no problem with readers watching this guy try to spin everything I say to fit his agenda. He literally even called the mods shills and I let that go too. He's just here trying to create drama where there really is none. It'll pass just like all of the others before this.

       First, you can still call someone a shill, you just have to be creative about it, that's all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a sub that should not care if there are shills or not is this one. Most of us are suspicious/paranoid enough as it is that I wish those shills good luck (we are ALL shills). Shills only help us prove that all those "conspiracies"...may be true...or at least a good part of them...so keep shilling, the users will know better, and the mods seem to have done a good job so far (at least compared to many other subs).

       If it ever gets to the point where I think the shills have made headway, I'll say something. But I don't think they have. The people on this subreddit--even the kind of asshole-y ones--are much smarter than most other places. I mean, the TMOR, Conspiratard....just not very bright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most shills are sussed out fast, down voted and/or blocked. I went through a three day period where I blocked like seven people who were revealed as shills pretty fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the tide turns, I'll rally troops and try to lead a revolt. But CTR threw their full weight against this place and lost. Their benefactor may well be arrested in days, though that sounds almost too good to be true. But after election, even if she wins, even if the strategy is to keep it up to support her false presidency, they will fade. But I don't think it's going to come to that.

       I was being sarcastic. 
I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you are either relatively new to the sub or just messing around. Once upon a time shill accusations were thrown around so frequently that it derailed discussions everywhere on the sub. Damn near all shill accusations were against people with different opinions, or newbies to the sub. 
So rule 10 was added.
Nice title, misrepresenting the mods words and the rules.
Also the point of shills is to fuck up discussion and derail stuff, and to that end the flood of Trumpsters are more successful than any shills/trolls have even been. Still won't last long, election is right around the corner.

       Nope, long time user. And yes, I see that Trump supporters overwhelm threads organically, and I
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       that. I hate Trump, and his supporters are a mixed bag for me, but damn if I don't respect real live unpaid passion. It's natural, and it's human, and even if it's wrong, it's not contrived and manipulative, which is worth the world to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This new wave of CTR shills, though.. They're something else.. I don't care about people who spout rhetoric they've heard somewhere else. I care about people who are paid to subvert us, and who have a massive budget with which to do so. There is a very big difference, and I'm sure you can appreciate it without having to go into the specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thread I linked, if you'd care to check it over, isn't just filled with people calling others shills for no reason, it was people calling out CTR shills from accounts that were, in all fairness, suspicious. You know what it's like after you've been on Reddit for a long time: you don't really get upset when you read things that are counter to you, or when others disagree. You try to out think the thunks, like this, until you both get to a place where you're gaining. That's what was so magical about this place. You could actually change large swathes of people's minds, and have yours changed, too. You still can, but there are small groups of people whose job it is, now, to subvert certain things and prevent certain topics from being talked about, and that is something that I will very much stand up and fight against. The spirit of this site is directly opposed to censorship, or even shill-based ads, because we were a community built on trust and sharing, and that the administration (in the form of seeking to further "monetize"
       <del>
        you
       </del>
       Reddit) is now seeking to undermine that is disheartening, but that the
       <em>
        mods of a conspiracy subreddit are actively working on behalf of political shills to the point that they would explicitly state that shills are okie doke by them
       </em>
       is soul-crushing..
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you see? If we disallow accusations of shilling across the board (and just for the record, nothing I've written has been removed from this sub), then we force ourselves to argue with them, or ignore their obviously inflated scores/influence on others' scores, and finally be forced to scroll through the nonsense in order to get to real reddit. That is terrible, and it would be the death of this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't even be that hard to enact a system that compares a profile to a number of metrics in order to suggest a probability that they are a shill, and then allow users to simply report other users. Say the system was designed to deliver a % likelihood of being a shill to a mod after a certain number of unique flaggings took place within one sub, and that it derived it's answer from things like IP address referencing/pattern analyses (admin would have to provide support for this system, I know; mods still wouldn't have access to IPs, they would just be delivered a % for being a shill); running samples of their text from the same sub, months apart, through a text analyzer; or any number of other things that some people much more specialized than I am could think of. I'm saying that if we wanted to, we could do something about shills, and it's really, really, really sad that the site-wide mod/admin approval for them has reached all the way here. I don't want to feel this way, but I can't look away from "shills aren't against the rules, nor should they be".. If you can help me understand why he would say that, I would be genuinely grateful.

       It's telling that you would take the question that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm.. Let's all think about this for a minute.. Guy says I'm a rabble rouser for quoting a mods opinion on shills. I ask guy if he agrees with the mods position on shills. Guy thinks I'm "turning [it] back on [him]", because, we can only assume, he knows that shilling is by nature indefensible, so he can only agree with the mod in a roundabout way, and when pressured specifically, he says the question was an attack. But that's speculation. Speculation that could be done away with with a "yes" or a "no" from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you agree with shilling as a practice, and if so, why do you take issue with all of those who don't? Why are you upset that we all care about this?

       I'm not a coder that works for Reddit, or a coder at all, but I can, just sitting here, come up with some reasonable ideas that might help (referencing IP addresses, for instance, seeing as CTR has a centrally-located office) find them out. I'm sick and tired of people saying things like "well can you
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       that Russia didn't hack the DNC??".. I'm just sitting here like no, no man, I don't think I could prove that right now, but I work at a hotel. What this is is an appeal to authority, who are in place supposedly to prevent things like corruption. It's the same here. We're all metaphorical citizens of the city of Reddit, crying out "help us! Look, we can see that we're being infiltrated, so governors and mayors, maybe you could maybe build us a fence or something?". Have you never felt "this post is an ad"? Have you never thought "this user is a marketer"? Have you never wondered at how two comments with exactly the same wording, in two separate threads, can come from two separate users with virtually no time to copy pasta? Have you really not been here as we've outed CTR conspiracy after CTR conspiracy?

       Yeah and then I said all of what I said in response to your placing the burden of proof on me, and we could pick up there. Or I guess I could go and google a list of CTR accounts first..

       Since you can't prove any certain individual here is a shill then WTF is this really all about? What's your real reason for doing this? It's looking like you just want to make sure you can get people you don't like banned by just calling them shills.
