    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that these people have careers and families that they have to take into consideration. They&#39;re walking a fine line by trying to get any type of information out, because their job is entirely dependent upon not divulging secrets. There is undoubtedly a lot going on behind the scenes that we&#39;re not privy to, but it at least appears that a concerted effort is underway to stop these people. They have to be careful how they go about it, but the fact that we&#39;re seeing this much information is likely a sign that some long-thought-out plan is now operational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if they&#39;re untraceable, then you can be certain Obama and Hillary would blame it on Russia and potentially drag us into WWIII. There are so many variables to take into consideration, which is likely why this has been so long in the making. But like I said, it looks as if something is now operational. Be patient and watch it all unfold. And if you haven&#39;t seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM">this video</a> yet, check it out.</p>
