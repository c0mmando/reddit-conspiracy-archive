       I feel like I am not an American, and to be specific. I don't think I even know what that means. In this year alone, I feel as though our country has become a "watch after you own back", rather than a country that says "we have each other's back". I get that the position we are in will defy who we are as a nation. Given that our current state of "democracy" is really about who can tell the biggest lie. I'm not out to prove a point. I'm not out to make up everyone's mind on who they should vote for. I just want to say that we as a country, is bullshit. I'm tired of saying I don't want to vote for this candidate or that candidate, but is there really anything anyone will do about this? Probably not. We have a week exactly for people that are on our side to decide how we do this election this year. This is our defining moment. Wether or not we take to the streets to protest or lash out at our government is pretty much up to the people, and right now. I feel like amongst all you other "conspiracists". We are all that we have left. Those of us going thru piles of emails, or inside of servers we "shouldn't" be in. Take a moment, please. Appreciate that everyone putting in work to be able to "try" and take back our country are the ones that are actually doing anything about it. I don't expect this post to get anywhere. I honestly expect to get down voted, but good fucking job to those that are working your ass off to find something, anything. That we as a nation can still be saved. Anyway, I feel like I needed to say something. I'm a long time lurker. I'm a bit buzzed, but I do appreciate you guys being eyes in reading this. Any comments are welcome. I definitely want this to be an open discussion.

       A more sobering, albeit frightening fact/thought is that this country never won it's independence, and has been taken over since 1783 via the Treaty of Paris, and all of what know about the country is a lie and propaganda. Also, there is no way to fix this country, short of a revolution like some of the founding fathers imagined.. Pour that into your glass and sip it...

       Indeed. I suppose this may all be because of the Great Awakening, that was the end of the Mayan Calendar. I think a few of the founders truly wanted freedom and liberty for all men, hence the Constitution and Bill of rights, it was just hijacked and neutered.. It was a real mind fuck when I came to this possibility, and there is some compelling evidence for it..

       I hear ya, man, personally all this over exposure at once is nudging me to "go back to sleep", but I won't.

       I've been hoping that we would develop
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       transparency in our elected government rather than less.

      <p>
       Now that the biggest corporations have, or are soon to be, consolidated down into a few big "families" we are losing our ability to speak freely to each other. This is probably the last subreddit I trust, CTR ruined /politics, I'm not for either puppet candidate, I need a reason to care to even vote, fer cryin' out loud.

       I can't stand r/politics now. What it has become. Regardless if you're a Bernie supporter or not. When people flocked to it to see how all candidates were doing. This is when it was great. Now with CTR there. It's trash. I can't believe anything anyone has posted on the page. I have to come here to get some kind of truth. Which is bad. Really bad.

       It used to be a bunch of bickering between Bernie and Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters would mock Bernie and perpetuate the "he can't win" narrative. Bernie supporters would drown them out with voting and only pop in to try and defend him when they would venture out of their s4p safe space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of safe spaces, that's where Clinton supporters resided.
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       hated her. Everything would get downvoted. Comments were filled with Trump and Sanders supporters just going after every scandal, conflict of interest, and lie that came out of her campaign. So their little tiny community at hillary's sub remained delusional until the SuperPAC money for CTR was received.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they invaded
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . Brigading and deflection on everything. Shifting the narrative instantly with anti-Trump propaganda 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just goes to show that Reddit can and will continue to be compromised as long as there is organization and money to influence it.

       Ephesians 6:10-18
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

       It only takes a small percentage to make a difference. I am confident that when all this shit is over, we will have taken our country back. Or at the very least, slowed the theft of the nation.

       I agree. 100%. I guess my issue is that I turn on the tv, and it's business as usual. People still have in their minds that what we are currently going thru, is just moving with the times. It's sad that we've gone from a popularity contest (who people like most to be POTUS) to whom won't fuck yo his country the most. Thank you for your input. I actually wasn't expecting a response.

       It doesn't really matter
       <em>
        who

       wins.  The social change is upon us, and (T|t) hey know it.  Both sides.  So a new power has been birthed - the power of immediate collective expression.  It's still nascent but it now has a voice.  And as such, lies and narrative changes just don't work anymore.  The PTB are having issues coping.  They are conceiving of blowing the planet up.  And they continue lying, leading us into needless conflict.  All our military, worldwide, frankly should make a gentleperson's agreement that conflict happen over a pingpong table from now on, and the rest is all for shits and giggles and showing off to mom on the 4th/1st/Cakeday.

       The military and conflict world wide, granted will not change. It still reminds me however we still have a chance at deciding who's really in control. I don't expect this to be resolved over night, but given how hard people have to work to make ends meet is baffling. Yet congress and all those that think they are high and mighty think everything is fine, at least this is what is said not behind closed doors. Thank you for your input.

       Thanks for yours.  I think the military, worldwide, will manifest common values.  After all, it's mostly run by common people.  It's the Heroes who are sparse.

       In all honesty. I believe it will be the people of the military that will take the final stand. Yes, we as the people will do the same, I really thought the line would of been drawn with their bonuses needing to be paid back, but I was wrong and I understand why (I have two special op friends that explained this) deep down inside. I want this to be corrected. I'll even take a new way of life because of what has happened. I just want this fixed. I know it won't be a quick fix, but hopefully once everything is out there. People real realize. We can do better.
