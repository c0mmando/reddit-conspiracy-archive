        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I feel like I am not an American, and to be specific. I don&#39;t think I even know what that means. In this year alone, I feel as though our country has become a &quot;watch after you own back&quot;, rather than a country that says &quot;we have each other&#39;s back&quot;. I get that the position we are in will defy who we are as a nation. Given that our current state of &quot;democracy&quot; is really about who can tell the biggest lie. I&#39;m not out to prove a point. I&#39;m not out to make up everyone&#39;s mind on who they should vote for. I just want to say that we as a country, is bullshit. I&#39;m tired of saying I don&#39;t want to vote for this candidate or that candidate, but is there really anything anyone will do about this? Probably not. We have a week exactly for people that are on our side to decide how we do this election this year. This is our defining moment. Wether or not we take to the streets to protest or lash out at our government is pretty much up to the people, and right now. I feel like amongst all you other &quot;conspiracists&quot;. We are all that we have left. Those of us going thru piles of emails, or inside of servers we &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; be in. Take a moment, please. Appreciate that everyone putting in work to be able to &quot;try&quot; and take back our country are the ones that are actually doing anything about it. I don&#39;t expect this post to get anywhere. I honestly expect to get down voted, but good fucking job to those that are working your ass off to find something, anything. That we as a nation can still be saved. Anyway, I feel like I needed to say something. I&#39;m a long time lurker. I&#39;m a bit buzzed, but I do appreciate you guys being eyes in reading this. Any comments are welcome. I definitely want this to be an open discussion.</p>

I think a few of the founders truly wanted freedom and liberty for all men, hence the Constitution and Bill of rights, it was just hijacked and neutered..

<p>I&#39;ve been hoping that we would develop <em>more</em> transparency in our elected government rather than less. </p>

<p>Now that the biggest corporations have, or are soon to be, consolidated down into a few big &quot;families&quot; we are losing our ability to speak freely to each other. This is probably the last subreddit I trust, CTR ruined /politics, I&#39;m not for either puppet candidate, I need a reason to care to even vote, fer cryin&#39; out loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be a bunch of bickering between Bernie and Trump supporters. </p>

<p>Trump supporters would mock Bernie and perpetuate the &quot;he can&#39;t win&quot; narrative. Bernie supporters would drown them out with voting and only pop in to try and defend him when they would venture out of their s4p safe space.</p>

<p>Speaking of safe spaces, that&#39;s where Clinton supporters resided. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> hated her. Everything would get downvoted. Comments were filled with Trump and Sanders supporters just going after every scandal, conflict of interest, and lie that came out of her campaign. So their little tiny community at hillary&#39;s sub remained delusional until the SuperPAC money for CTR was received.</p>

<p>Then they invaded <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Brigading and deflection on everything. Shifting the narrative instantly with anti-Trump propaganda 24/7. </p>

<p>Just goes to show that Reddit can and will continue to be compromised as long as there is organization and money to influence it.</p>

<p>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>

So a new power has been birthed - the power of immediate collective expression.  It&#39;s still nascent but it now has a voice.  And as such, lies and narrative changes just don&#39;t work anymore.  The PTB are having issues coping.  They are conceiving of blowing the planet up.  And they continue lying, leading us into needless conflict.
