    <div class="md"><p>I think most people on this sub realize that Trump was at some point friendly with the establishment. Otherwise, he wouldn&#39;t have been able to make it as far as he has in not just the election, but in business.</p>

<p>However, a discrepancy comes to fruition when you see and hear Donald Trump saying things and exposing things that does not benefit the globalists in any way. </p>

<p>Most people did not even know what TPP was let alone understand what it was about before Donald Trump started using her support for it as a reason to attack Clinton. </p>

<p>It would be very counter-productive of the elite to continue promoting someone who is getting dangerously popular on &quot;fringe conspiracy theories&quot; which could topple the whole system.</p>

<p>I think it is more likely that Donald Trump has at some point gone into business for himself and is now rogue. </p>
