        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This will be a work in progress, I am constantly finding new and interesting information. </p>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/01/police-raid-liberal-groups-pennsylvania-office-over-voter-fraud-allegations/">Today the FBI raided the Pennsylvania field office of petition management firm &#39;Fieldsworks LLC&#39;</a>.  They have been accused of voter fraud both in <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Fieldworks">2008</a> and <a href="http://mediatrackers.org/ohio/2012/11/04/echoes-of-acorn-from-liberal-campaign-company-fieldworks">2012</a> elections. </p>

<p>One of the more memorable controversies was the young Ohio canvasser for <a href="http://www.fieldworks.com/clients/">Fieldworks client &#39;Voters First&#39;</a> Timothy Zurieck, <a href="http://mediatrackers.org/ohio/2012/08/17/voters-first-canvasser-arrested-for-submitting-fraudulent-petitions/">who was investigated and tried in regards to 22 counts of Signing False Signatures and one count of &#39;Election Falsification&#39;. Long story short he plead insanity and avoided jail time.</a> - Edit - (This is not entirely accurate Zurieck initially plead insanity in 2012, but in 2014 was sentenced to a total of 7 Non-Consecutive Days for his crimes.)</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with Hillary? Well just a quick google search will show that the Clinton Campaign not only have a long history with Fieldworks, but also have poached some employees of Fieldworks. </p>

<p>Exhibit A- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-hendricks-0351a2122">Tyler Hendricks</a> Worked at Fieldworks as Office Director, went on to be campaign manager for John Lehman&#39;s failed run for Lt. Governor of Wisconsin in 2014. <a href="http://www.p2016.org/clinton/clintongenwi.html">It looks like Clinton grabbed a few people from the Lehman Campaign: See Kory Kozloski.</a></p>

<p>After this he went on to work for...you guessed it...Hillary Clinton&#39;s &#39;Hillary for America&#39; campaign. For unknown reasons he left in May 2016 and now holds the position of &#39;Regional Organizing Director&#39; for the Iowa Democratic Party....A position which I am sure is far more useful to Hillary Clinton.  </p>

<p>Exhibit B - <a href="https://johnnywunder.info/mywiki/index.php/Fieldworks_LLC">Here are a list of FEC Filings in regards to Fieldworks.</a> You will notice that all of these are either for Pro Clinton or Anti Trump canvassing and are all donated by the PAC known as &#39;For Our Future&#39;. <a href="https://johnnywunder.info/mywiki/index.php/For_Our_Future">Here is a FEC dump of records in relation to For Our Future.</a> You will notice a history of &#39;sugardaddy donations&#39;, including some large donations from Facebook Co-Founder Dustin Moskovitz.</p>

<p><a href="http://columbus.craigslist.org/csr/5854686236.html">Craigslist Ad Posted Yesterday, 10/31/16, by Fieldworks looking for Clinton Canvassers in Columbus Ohio.</a> - Edit - (Keep in mind the Ohio office is the same one responsible for the 2012 controversy.)</p>

<p><a href="http://fieldworks.com/our_team/laurie.asp">Laurie Moskowitz</a> founder of FieldWorks and worked on the <a href="https://www.one.org/us/press/one-taps-campaign-veteran-laurie-moskowitz-to-lead-u-s-campaigns-house-foreign-affairs-committees-dr-pearl-alice-marsh-as-u-s-policy-director/">Clinton Inaugurals in 1992 and 1996, and also served as the DNC&#39;s national coordinated campaign director.</a> She has served in senior level positions with the Democratic National Committee, campaigns, and advocacy organizations for over 23 years, including as a consultant to the 2004 and 2008 Presidential campaigns and the Principal of FieldWorks for the last ten years. The collusion and coercion is insane.  </p>

<p>The other founder of FieldWorks is the, now deceased, <a href="http://fieldworks.com/our_team/susan.asp">Susan Blad Seldin</a>...whose husband is David Seldin <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/16/AR2006101601245.html">a former Press Aide for the Clinton Whitehouse.</a> (Before you ask if Seldin was suicided, the answer is no...she had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and died after complications from a bone marrow transplant. At least that&#39;s what <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/20/local/me-passings20.2">the media reported</a>.)</p>

<p>Brigette Eisenkeit is also <a href="http://fieldworks.com/our_team/dessari.asp#">listed as a Fieldworks Senior Staff member.</a> (Currently her link is not working, but you can see her name listed.) The only connection I could find between this person and the Clintons is that she was <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pres/2007/YE/C00431569/B_PAYEE_C00431569.html">listed as a &#39;Payee&#39; of the 2008 Clinton Campaign.</a></p>

<p>TBC</p>

<p>Current Spokesman representing Fieldworks is Matt Dorf. He is the only one to give a <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-01/pennsylvania-state-police-raid-offices-democrat-advocacy-group-seeking-evidence-vote">statement regarding the raid so far.</a> From some quick research I&#39;ve deduced this is <em>most likely</em> the same Matt Dorf of the now defunct <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/leading-pro-israel-pr-firm-splits-up?utm_term=.yjGNYm8Ep#.uqrjP8rlw">Pro-Israel PR Firm &#39;Rabinowitz-Dorf&#39;</a> and he now owns <a href="https://twitter.com/WestEndStrategy">&#39;West End Strategy&#39;</a> which is, &quot;a strategic communications firm that raises public awareness, influences policy and drives social change.&quot;</p>

<p>I think the next point of research should be that particular Pennsylvania Office, who has hired that office, and why it would be a target for the FBI. </p>

<p><strong>There is so much more to this story</strong>, I had totally forgotten about the August Raid (also in PA) which targeted <a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/breaking-fbi-conducts-massive-raid-hillary-clinton-supporters-office/">“two rowhouses, a pub, … and the political offices of a City Councilman.
A common link for all the search sites became clear immediately: the city’s most influential labor union, IBEW Local 98, and its powerful leader known by the moniker Johnny &#39;Doc&#39; Dougherty.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;John Dougherty, who played a major role in getting Mayor Jim Kenney elected last year and at the same time helped his brother Kevin win a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, paced outside his home as agents searched inside.</p>

<p>Dougherty and Kenney both attended “a very private meeting with Secretary Clinton” in April, Dougherty said in a statement at the time.&quot;</p>

<p>Voters First canvassers were caught on tape breaking election laws earlier this summer, and the group initially failed to submit enough signatures to place their referendum on the November 2012 ballot. Nearly 45 percent of the first batch of signatures submitted by Voters First were ruled invalid by election officials</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to do it, but the history behind each and every one of these people is just insane. Just look at Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she served in Florida State Legislature, the House of Reps as Chief Deputy Whip, Co-Chairman of the 2008 Clinton Campaign, and then after losing in 2008 replaced Tim Kaine as Chair of the DNC (Same Tim Kaine who is running for VP under Hillary) - Then stepped down as Chair after this whole 2016 E-Mail leak fiasco and was replaced by Donna Brazile who is also a Clinton lackey (who just resigned as well)... Do you see what I mean? The collusion is so thorough and deep a &#39;web&#39; would just be endless. They all wear 10 hats to work and people are constantly stepping down/up to take new roles or just disappear. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that crazy multi-role intrigue is what makes a flow chart such an intriguing idea. I&#39;m betting any player in the chart would have at least 5 if not more than a dozen links and you could get lost exploring all the different avenues.</p>
