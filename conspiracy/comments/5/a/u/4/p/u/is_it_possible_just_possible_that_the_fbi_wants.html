        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The state got him a secret deal with federal prosecutors because it was in &quot;the best interests of the state&quot; to do so.  </p>

<p>Is this the real secret that they are covering up?  From all accounts, it sounds like things are leading up to something that has to do with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is some background on the Epstein case for those unfamiliar:  <a href="http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/for-palm-beach-sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-house-/nMGds/">http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/for-palm-beach-sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-house-/nMGds/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A secret deal with federal prosecutors revealed Epstein could have been charged with multiple federal counts of sexual exploitation of minors, resulting in much harsher penalties. But the feds deferred to two state charges that got him an 18-month sentence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were the Clinton&#39;s involved in the cover-up because they were also implicated in his affairs?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the answers, but I am speculating that this is what is going to blow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your analysis is headed in the right direction. It certainly seems that something is brewing relating to Epstein. By the way, where did you get the first quote from?</p>

<p>On a side note (but related to the plans of submitting FOIA requests),someone posted a thread earlier suggesting that we submit requests for the 9/11 videos confiscated by the FBI at the Pentagon. Strangely the thread was quickly deleted, but I think it&#39;s a great idea</p>
