<p>So 1 Million fresh workers helps our economy a lot. It is very good for germany.</p>

<p>Nazis all around the planet spread bullshit about and idiots believe it ... at the end they are just a loud minority and we germans will be fine - like always.</p>

<p>And for people who can still think by themself: When in all Media the Vicitms (refugees) are the Boogiemans and not the people (USA) who made them to flee its own country than there is an agenda. Its Propaganda to manipulate the stupid sheeps to bring unrest to europe.</p>

<p>No - not the refugees are the bad people and not Merkel for trieing to help this people. Its the USA &amp; all Friends which bring Terror all over this planet and make this people run for their life ...</p>

<p>populations grow and decrease. not a big deal. </p>

<p>Apparently economists can&#39;t do basic math, because they say the sky is falling if the workforce shrinks.
quote from article: &quot;the population will dip... causing a significant labor shortage and decline in people’s standard of living due to reduced economies of scale.&quot;</p>

<p>if there are less people, then there is less demand for consumer goods. less demand means less need for workers. it all balances out. why is this difficult to understand?</p>

<p>They are vassals of USrael. It&#39;s an occupied state since WW2.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t even explain why the NSA is supported by the german authorities to surveil its own population, business and politicians.</p>

<p>And nothing &quot;happens&quot; when high party actors are outed as contracted by MI6 businesses or blatant assets of the USA like Özdemir or Fischer. The whole Green party is a complete USrael construct since at least the 90s.</p>

Initially planned for 1937, the 1939 census now also included the areas of Austria, Sudetenland and Memelland. About 750,000 counters covered 22 million households and roughly 80 million inhabitants.</p>

<p>It may, or may not help triggered people to not get triggered as hard as they normally would&#39;ve been by any such claim in any direction.</p>

<p>The people that get hopelessly triggered are currently beyond any help I can provide. My only wish for them would be an existential crisis of belief from going out and finding the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple sales tactics and over the past decades some surely were sold to parties for voter base reasons(Russian Germans  immigration for instance) but it surely never was the full truth.</p>

<p>Germany has the whole EU as a labor reserve with a lot countries especially in the south suffering from weak employment. There is no need for uneducated people for the german industry.</p>

<p>The latest one has a complete different vibe and &quot;cheap labor&quot; does not work nor were there any reasons for the &quot;left&quot; to change demographics for voter base reasons. </p>

<p>At the moment I see several potential <em>inter-connected</em> reasons.</p>

<p>o Create a cause for the foundation of an EU army/police/border protection. Like 9/11 was used to create Homeland Security in the USA.</p>

<p>o Breaking of what&#39;s left of the national ethnic sovereignty for their EU Empire construct.</p>

<p>o Eugenics based on Coudenhove-Kalergi&#39;s pan-european plan.</p>

<p>o NWO/Neo-Feudalism agenda pushed by the UN Agenda 21.</p>

<p>o Helping the Greater Israel plan by depopulate Syria.</p>

<p>o Trying to break the german social system</p>

<p>o Boogeymen for the time when the financial system folds.</p>

<p>o As most of these &quot;refugees&quot; are males it could be a group of foreign mercenaries/terrorists meant to protect the elite/terrorize the population or meant to be used somehow for WW3.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I think it&#39;s a combination of all of these things.</p>

<p>Of course these kind of things happens but I don&#39;t think Angela and her government has taken so many refugees assuming they can get vote from them through illegal means</p>
