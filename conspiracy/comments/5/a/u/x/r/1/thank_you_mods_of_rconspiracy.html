    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but a predominately <em>peaceful</em> revolution is what&#39;s needed.  Not saying defending ourselves via armed combat shouldn&#39;t happen.  I&#39;m saying we should all come together and support one another as we divest ourselves from the manipulative system, and use armed combat as an absolute last resort.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that people will doubt what&#39;s uncovered just because of the timing of it though.  I think regardless of when some damning information comes out, it will still explode like a bombshell for those with eyes to see.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  So that pretty much means that almost regardless of <em>when</em> any information is revealed - soon or later on - there will still be people that, like you just correctly stated, will deny, deny, deny.  smh.</p>

<p>I mean more so in the fact that almost every hour is a new &quot;bombshell&quot; (that&#39;s really nothing) it&#39;ll get to a point where even the most ardent believers will think ok there&#39;s nothing coming another release of nothing, enough of this shit. It will drive people away and they&#39;ll stop looking. Whenever it does come just hope there&#39;s enough people still around to see it and believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I see what you&#39;re saying now and agree.  I big reason for this phenomenon has to do with so many people&#39;s tendency to fucking <em>over exaggerate</em>.</p>

<p>Just state the damn facts.  Don&#39;t headline your damn video with &quot;It&#39;s finally here!!&quot;/&quot;Now FINALLY.  The biggest information EVVAAAAR!!!&quot;  or whatever tf.  Annoying really and yes, like you said, it tends to create an eventual &quot;Yeah.  Whatever.  Wake me when you have some <em>real</em> information&quot; attitude in people - which, of course, is <em>not</em> good either because then you can miss what&#39;s really important.</p>

<p>Although it is sometimes difficult to sift through the hyperbole in some posts, I appreciate the fact that our mods let (almost) everyone have their say, and leave it to the reader to sort the good from the bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, there was a post a few days ago saying How wrong Trump/Hillary supporters are for thinking this is the sub for them. It is the sub for us, when all others reveal heir true nature, this sub has become the last hope for truth seeking on any and all levels. I haven&#39;t looked at any other sub besides this one for the last 3 days. Can&#39;t wait to see how it all shakes out.</p>
