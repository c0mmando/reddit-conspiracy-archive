       Me too.  Her husband brought us NAFTA, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the removal of the Fairness Doctrine and welfare reform.  How was he a democrat?  She is the same.  Other than a very few matters, she's a far right republican, further to the right than Reagan and a big fat war hawk, ready to do anything Israel tells her to do.  She should make any thinking person shit their pants.  She's a terrible choice, and was FORCED ON US.

       Asking this question is buying into party loyalist tribal bullshit.

       Republican/Democrat are just bullshit labels. Bill Clinton's policy was always more "conservative", more authoritarian than the people who voted for him would have wanted if they knew. But they didn't know. They just voted for him because he's on their "team". And if they don't make sure their team wins, the other team might win!

       I understand, and will never vote democrat again.  But I did want people to realize, Bill wasn't really a Dem at all, and his wife sure as hell won't be (if given the chance) either.

       There will always be people like that. It's why party allegiance is bullshit. You say he wasn't one, but guess what, Bill Clinton is a Democrat. He is. And so is his wife. Your disagreement with them doesn't make them not-Democrats, it means that you shouldn't feel any allegiance to that party that they're in charge of. Just because you like your team but dislike your team's leader doesn't mean you can pretend they're not part of the team. Thats just no-true-scotsman territory.

       Yea, you see, that's the problem. People don't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       care, they care to certain limit, where ''caring'' is self-serving to their interest. An example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing about politics and choosing the ''right'' candidate; you are a conformed citizen, you have nothing to hide, you are obedient and you don't question authority, because
       <em>
        you don't question authority, ever
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a statement ''I support Hillary, because
       <em>
        blah blah(whatever sexist crap you can fit in here) blah blah
       </em>
       . They might as well say 'I'm right because you know damn well that I'm right.' It's like hive-mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking disgusting. I feel like I'm living in the 40's and everyone around me is a Nazi-sympathizer. ''
       <em>
        We know about Iraq, Libya, Sumeria and Afghanistan, but Syria is the worst because it's being bombed by Russians, and the Russians are the bad guys....

       Drop out/concede would be the words you are looking for. So, if she did, what would that mean? Who would fill her "role"? Maybe that is what people should be looking at? 4D chess...

       It's not about being an English major, it's about knowing English and words (common fuckin' sense). Resign would mean she has a position - title. She doesn't, in this context. Don't hate the player, hate the game, and learn proper English while you're at it. I know twitter has dumbed people down, but seriously...

       "I have resigned myself to the cause."
"You are resigned to your quarters until further notice."

       It's the only thing Hillary knows how to do. Calls Trump a Russian spy, but she literally took bribes from Russian sources in order to approve the transfer of 20% of US uranium to Putin. And the Podesta Group (connected to John Podesta, Clinton campaign chair) was lobbying for Russia during this shit too. Come on, it's fucking bonkers.

       back when the money rolled into the Clinton Foundation, it was reported it was from Uzbekistan Uranium miners for lobbying. came in 30 and 100 million installments.

       As FBIanon said, this is much bigger than HRC.  This investigation will show that every branch of the government is rotten to the core.  Congressmen, senators, SCOTUS judges, the media elite, the executive branch going back who knows how far are all conspirators.  If we actually get to the bottom (or top) of this it's going to involve the intelligence agencies, the military, the world financial elite and foreign governments.

        A lot of people would support Hillary over Trump, no matter what. They feel this way because they believe Trump is a racist, pedophile, serial rapist who wants to nuke the entire planet. If someone truly believes this, you can't blame them for supporting Hillary.

       Honestly, I don't know yet.  If she hasn't backed down yet, I don't know if she will, but given that I'm not the most "up to speed" or in the know person around, I imagine that there are quite a few people that know more about what's really going on than I do.

       Pretty much.  I've always known it was crap - even when I was a little kid (somehow) - but it's at least a good thing that it's becoming

       This is the entire problem with the Left, moreso than the Right in my observation.  The Left don't care what sort of person someone really is morally, as long as they have a tick in the politically correct checkboxes.  Hillary can be as big a monster as she likes, but as long as she verbally says that she is pro-evolution and pro-gay, no one will care what she does.
