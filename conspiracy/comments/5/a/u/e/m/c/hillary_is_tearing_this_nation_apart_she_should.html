<p>Me too.  Her husband brought us NAFTA, the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the removal of the Fairness Doctrine and welfare reform.  How was he a democrat?  She is the same.  Other than a very few matters, she&#39;s a far right republican, further to the right than Reagan and a big fat war hawk, ready to do anything Israel tells her to do.  She should make any thinking person shit their pants.  She&#39;s a terrible choice, and was FORCED ON US.</p>

<p>How was he a democrat?</p>

<p>Asking this question is buying into party loyalist tribal bullshit. </p>

<p>Republican/Democrat are just bullshit labels. Bill Clinton&#39;s policy was always more &quot;conservative&quot;, more authoritarian than the people who voted for him would have wanted if they knew. But they didn&#39;t know. They just voted for him because he&#39;s on their &quot;team&quot;. And if they don&#39;t make sure their team wins, the other team might win! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will always be people like that. It&#39;s why party allegiance is bullshit. You say he wasn&#39;t one, but guess what, Bill Clinton is a Democrat. He is. And so is his wife. Your disagreement with them doesn&#39;t make them not-Democrats, it means that you shouldn&#39;t feel any allegiance to that party that they&#39;re in charge of. Just because you like your team but dislike your team&#39;s leader doesn&#39;t mean you can pretend they&#39;re not part of the team. Thats just no-true-scotsman territory. </p>

<p>Yea, you see, that&#39;s the problem. People don&#39;t <em>really</em> care, they care to certain limit, where &#39;&#39;caring&#39;&#39; is self-serving to their interest. An example:</p>

<p>Knowing about politics and choosing the &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39; candidate; you are a conformed citizen, you have nothing to hide, you are obedient and you don&#39;t question authority, because <em>you don&#39;t question authority, ever</em>.</p>

<p>Like a statement &#39;&#39;I support Hillary, because <em>blah blah(whatever sexist crap you can fit in here) blah blah</em>. They might as well say &#39;I&#39;m right because you know damn well that I&#39;m right.&#39; It&#39;s like hive-mentality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking disgusting. I feel like I&#39;m living in the 40&#39;s and everyone around me is a Nazi-sympathizer. &#39;&#39;<em>We know about Iraq, Libya, Sumeria and Afghanistan, but Syria is the worst because it&#39;s being bombed by Russians, and the Russians are the bad guys....</em>&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>The proper forces will only be found amongst the citizenry - not amongst the elite.  Those of us with the right energy have to come up and assert ourselves against the dark forces that have been working so steadfastly on this planet.</p>

<p>That is the only way.</p>

<p>This is the entire problem with the Left, moreso than the Right in my observation.  The Left don&#39;t care what sort of person someone really is morally, as long as they have a tick in the politically correct checkboxes.  Hillary can be as big a monster as she likes, but as long as she verbally says that she is pro-evolution and pro-gay, no one will care what she does.</p>
