       They worship Molech, right?  The owl.  They are more into the Occult, and have ceremonies, like at Bohenian Grove.

       It gets MUCH worse than this. When you die you will be pulled into the "Fake Heaven" which is actually an Astral Holding Area. After a period you will be judged by the "Archons". They will then say you must return for "More Lessons" and to remove "Karmic Debt". Both are complete scams. Your memories will be erased and you will be reinserted into this hellhole. We are used over and over as "Energy Slaves". The Archons are Parasites, and the Earth Global Elite work for them.. Google: 1)Archons White Light 2)Archons Reincarnation 3)Archons Lords Of Karma 4)Archons Reptilians 5) White Light Trap 6)Gnostics Archons 7)Illuminati Archons 8)Illuminati Lords Of Karma 9)Reincarnation Memory Erase. If you take the time and google search all these, you will come across a large amount of information..  It is much worse than you could imagine. If you google search what I have listed, you will come across an enormous amount of information. Watching "David Icke" videos on youtube will explain everything and is something everyone should do..

       Ok.  I will search.   I was just reading about Boys Town in Nebraska and Larry King.  He would procure underage boys and girls for the rich and powerful.  There are allegations of sacrifices, torture, etc.

       That Nebraska story connects to many famous and powerful people. Sadly; It happens on a Global Scale. David Icke exposed the Satanic Pedophile Jimmy Savile and his connection to the Royal Family years ago. Icke was ridiculed and years later is proven completely correct..

       That was 25 years ago, and he never said he was Jesus. He said he was of the "Godhead" as are all beings. Who cares what he wore then. He was a pro soccer player, and maybe they were comfortable. Regardless it was 25 years ago and has nothing to do with his current work. Wake up, this is ridiculous..

       Interesting how it cuts off before he says afterwards the "godhead we are all from". the video is edited. What is your point anyway? That was 25 years ago. Anyone who has read his books, and seen his videos since then, knows his research is impeccable. I am not going to waste anymore time with you, and your absurd attempts to debunk. You have obviously never read his books, which are usually about 700 pages of rock solid research. Bye..

       Hi! Wiccans aren't Satanists. satanists worship the Devil, Wiccans don't believe in the devil, so "Wiccan type Satanists" is incorrect.

       The Global Elite has always exposed what they do, sometimes it is just very hard to see it. They consider that they are not violating our "free will", since they show it to all be seen. Sadly; The populous is either usually totally distracted or completely asleep..

       It felt to me that I wasn't really meant to be there. I mean, it is a gigantic airport, and I was the

       It could be just some fucked up art but the fact that the airport was created and dedicated to the man it was says a lot.

       The airport has been constructed in the shape of a Swastika when viewed from above. The Free Masons prominently displayed a capstone designating the building as “The New World Airport.”
  The AIRPORT features six underground levels, of which spokespersons claim are unused. That is: six, unused, underground levels; at an AIRPORT. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this facility is the mural of a military apocalypse painted on the interior wall for travelers to “appreciate.” The mural depicts oppressive fascist soldiers, fires, and a dead child in a casket.
  Some people express disbelief claiming this is simply conspiracy theory nonsense. For me too many coincidences exist when considering the planners spent billions of dollars designing and constructing a marvel such as this; one which was downsized from the previous international airport.

       On the Arkansas border is a massive underground fortress designed for surviving the end of the world. Billions of tax dollars were allocated to complete the project. Located along the Ozark Mountains is Ozark, Missouri; a little farm town in the middle of nowhere which features a bank for every fifty-one people.
  Tying in with the timing of this massive underground construction project is the number of earthquakes reported.  In 2009 Arkansas experienced thirty-six. Since construction began, Arkansas experienced 788 in 2011 alone. The facility encompasses fifty million square feet. It is climate controlled, has a rail system, a vast network of underground roads, food warehouses, offices, underground farming, on-site manufacturing, and stockpiles of oil.  Construction witnesses assert the facility connects directly to Denver International Airport using an underground tunnel more than 550 miles in length.

       Used to live in Denver...can't believe they're leaving one out.  Everyone focuses on the artwork, and it is creepy.  But it is also practically right next door to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  Can't mention underground tunnels without also mentioning the possibility they are connected to the former arsenal.

       Hi. It is all connected to the inner earth high speed rail system. The Global Elite will eventually go underground when we are in a Mad Max/Road Warrior type of scenario on the surface..

       I'll be called crazy but I think the article reasonably explained everything. A lot of artist are fucking weird and do weird shit. It's why they're so creative.

       Idk, I read the article and the art seems to convey what the artist says it does. The other issues were explained away in a reasonable fashion I thought.
