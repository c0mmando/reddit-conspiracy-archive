       For those who weren't born yet,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9COJXrrHHQ">
        here's TV news from 1979
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There is still no real proof of life since Julian Assange's internet connection was said to be cut off. All things you see on twitter or other websites are only cut sequences of old footage. Literally everything. The phone call to the CSIL2016 conference on Oct. 26  in Argentina is not a proof of life and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59m8ps/julian_assanges_intervention_to_the_cisl2016_was/">
        it is very probably a fake
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And if you want to be even more rigorous, it's more like Day 27.  You can look at the
       <a href="http://assange.net/">
        'Julian proof of life clock'
       </a>
       . As of now, there is no valid proof of life since an Oct 4 live video feed in Berlin. This website also thinks the phone call from Julian in Argentina was a fake and think it's 'a pre-recording of Julian Assange's voice' and that they could 'easily put that together' themselves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The video that
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/790406530738913285">
        Wikileaks proposed on Twitter
       </a>
       on Oct. 23  and that was chosen by the people has never been shown? That was 8 days ago, people. How long does it take to do a small video while holding a newspaper? 10 minutes?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't believe all those CTR shills who try to convince you that he has talked, that there is a video or some other bullshit. There has been no proof of life since hos internet connection was cut off. Not a single one.

       Maybe Julian is trying to make it look like something happened to him on purpose to influence the election and make it appear as if Hillary did something to him.
