    <div class="md"><p>Hillary&#39;s email scandal is extremely serious, involving matters of national security. Donald&#39;s is not anywhere near that serious. His is business related. He is being smeared by the MSM, not the FBI as you humorously suggested was my angle. The MSM ignores Hillary&#39;s extremely serious issue, while dragging an important bit of info about Trump out of proportion. It is that simple.</p>

<p>What need be further explained for you? Maybe my intellect isn&#39;t finely honed enough to swallow propaganda whole. The fact that yours is doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the reality of this situation.</p>

<p>So you think we shouldn&#39;t talk about one investigation, because it isn&#39;t as serious as a completely unrelated one? </p>

<p>Oh right, you meant the media. So you think because the US MSM is biased, we should refuse to discuss anything they cover? Does that not seem counter-productive to you? This investigation is happening you know. The MSM are positively covering it because it fits their agenda, but that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no fan of Clinton.. at all. I believe she is worse than Trump for the world. However, if you think that means I should avoid discussing her opponents fallacies, then you&#39;re just as bad as the folk on r/politics, who also only look at one side of the argument - just the other side from you.</p>
