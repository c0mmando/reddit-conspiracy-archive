       The glaring problem with

       Every day it's the same thing, over and over. What exactly can be done other than some forceful fantasy of going to whoever is typing in dark rooms or whatever. I don't go there. I'm not interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's bad enough it's EMAIL/LEAKS/EMAIL/LEAKS piling up the evidence. Which I concede is useful, but it's stale around here these days.

      <p>
       So no, I don't care what goes on in r/all or r/politics or another sub. We have enough problems as it is, as do other subs. I'm going to trust they will find a solution. If they don't; I'll accept that it's just unfair - and be done with it.

       Huh? If the FBI is running a smear campaign against Trumps ex-campaign manager (did they even announce this on the same scale at all?), then why would they also be announcing their investigation into  Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you think we shouldn't talk about one investigation, because it isn't as serious as a completely unrelated one? That's pretty close-minded, in my opinion.

       Well, your opinion is obviously gold! I guess I'll give the mental gymnastics necessary to make a peanut-sized turd equal the same weight as a five gallon bucket of shit another try. If you can do it, I might be able to muster the fortitude.

       Hillary's email scandal is extremely serious, involving matters of national security. Donald's is not anywhere near that serious. His is business related. He is being smeared by the MSM, not the FBI as you humorously suggested was my angle. The MSM ignores Hillary's extremely serious issue, while dragging an important bit of info about Trump out of proportion. It is that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       What need be further explained for you? Maybe my intellect isn't finely honed enough to swallow propaganda whole. The fact that yours is doesn't have anything to do with the reality of this situation.

       Allow me to repeat my question that you still haven't answered:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So you think we shouldn't talk about one investigation, because it isn't as serious as a completely unrelated one?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh right, you meant the media. So you think because the US MSM is biased, we should refuse to discuss anything they cover? Does that not seem counter-productive to you? This investigation is happening you know. The MSM are positively covering it because it fits their agenda, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no fan of Clinton.. at all. I believe she is worse than Trump for the world. However, if you think that means I should avoid discussing her opponents fallacies, then you're just as bad as the folk on r/politics, who also only look at one side of the argument - just the other side from you.

       Your SJW buzzphrases don't bother me at all btw. I'm flattered that I pissed you off enough to check out my post history in an attempt to find information about my person to attack me with. This is called Ad Hominem by the way, and you are full of it.

       Huh? If the FBI is running a smear campaign against Trumps ex-campaign manager (did they even announce this on the same scale at all?), then why would they also be announcing their investigation into  Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you think we shouldn't talk about one investigation, because it isn't as serious as a completely unrelated one? That's pretty close-minded, in my opinion.
