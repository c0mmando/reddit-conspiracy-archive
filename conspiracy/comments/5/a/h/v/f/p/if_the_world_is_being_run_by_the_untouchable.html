       Even millions of people protesting in the streets isn't enough.  Unless they are all named and brought before the world court at the Hague, our planet will continue on its course to oblivion, where we will be out scavenging for food from trash cans while they all dictate which trash cans we can scavenge from.  It's really hard to take power away from the powerful.  But we have to remember that in the end, they are human.  They are not gods, and they are not untouchable, despite what they would have us believe.  Something must be done before all out nuclear war begins.

       Stop. Using. Their. Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to preach but hard to do and I'm a sinner also of course, but this seem to be the only permanent solution. They print the money out of thin air and lend it to us with interest and make it illegal to use anything else. And they use the money they counterfeit to corrupt our elected politicians

       Honestly this is one of the more viable options we have but it's just hard as fuck to agree on. We either cease consuming or paying or taxes for a year and shit would start to open up.

       Oh yes it's borderline unrealistic which is of course by design but if taxes ceased for a period of time, thing would happen. I don't know if they would be good or bad but they

       Right. That's why we can't simply go off the dollar. We need to either slowly replace it, or take the dollar back from the fat cats.

       Your salary, likely not - unless you can make your employer see the light.
       <br/>
       Other services - a conventional line of credit is entirely possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument that this idea is a plant by 'tptb' suggests that they have something to gain by its implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only argument I see that makes this a concern throws encryption, in it's entirety on it's head.

       If that is the case, you have much more to worry about than the form of currency you're utilizing.

       Yes. This... and I think it would absolutely have to be a collective &amp; in unison effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to continue exchanging goods, citizens would have to work together to build, create, make, grow, etc and trade goods/services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this is far fetched and would be more complicated in the execution than just theorizing it.

       Just a reality check to everyone, and a reminder-the military is even more brainwashed than the police, so to all those people thinking that the military will one day step in and save us all, don't hold your breath. I'm not doubting anything that you say, I'm just piggybacking your comment and taking it a step further.

       I'm there. I'm at the point where I feel hopeless and that it's easier to just comply and work my basic job and travel and try to enjoy life. It seems pointless fighting against something so massive, and intangible

       Realistically: each of us doing our part to speak out, stay (truly) informed and stop participating in the behaviors and habits we know that fuel them and harm us all collectively.

       Hopefully: wikileaks / everything getting exposed both here and in South Korea leads to more shit getting exposed and the veil lifted at least a bit to weaken or (hopefully) bring them down altogether.

       I believe, and this is a somewhat controversial opinion, that the only way for us to truly win is to let them expose themselves completely. Not the little bit that they have so far for people that know like us who can see the truth but completely so people that are still asleep within the system are forced to see this reality. We have to let the elite's plans move forward and ready ourselves and wait for the moment when they believe that they are about to succeed then destroy them from within. Most people are still too confused to know who their real enemy is.

       You dont. Trust me dude. Theres a plan even they cant get. Its bigger than them. Its not up to us, never has been. They rig shit, but ultimately, theyre doing what they are told to do. Its bigger than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, they get their way, but all those who opposed will win. We arent the ones that "win" they have to be able to do whatever theyre going to do. If anything was to stop it, its just delaying the inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not preaching, but giving you an idea. The flood, everyone pretty much did what they wanted and did whatever, it was only noah who listened. It wasnt noah who was tasked with convincing everyone or trying to change anything else, his job was to listen, he did, and God got him out of there and wiped everyone else out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: clarification, basically those who Are evil, when stress is put on or there is less resistance or more resistance. Either having your own way, or being completely under pressure, people chose what theyre going to do. There will be no grey area anymore.

       If any one of them was found to be  a pedophile we could bring them down just by the use of  public pressure because  that's a taboo type of personality we don't tolerate.

       If any one of them was to be found to personally be a racist we could bring them down just by public pressure because that's a taboo type of personality in a leader or in a private person  that we just don't tolerate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any one of them was found to express himself as a homophobic it would be fairly easy for them to brought down by public pressure because that's the latest new taboo personality type we recently created by public consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaders can be brought down for being several other taboo personalty types such as witch hunters or  cannibals.

       We now need to turn our attention to creating a new taboo type of personality. That is clinical  psychopaths and sociopaths in leadership positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make every decision based on one single criteria regardless of other factors. That single thing they base all of their  decisions on is personal greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage they do is  far greater to the public at large than even the worst of the personalities  we already take out of power. All that's needed is sufficient public pressure and  a catchy, jingly new name for them that  the public can get behind .

       Maybe they're not human... That's what David Icke believes lol
I don't believe that lol so anyone that is about to mash on the keyboard relax. 
A lot of revolt in history was usually resolved with large estates and wealth granted to the top people starting the revolt, then, they either shut up or were hung themselves outside the public eye. That's why a lot of successful rebels like William Wallace were killed in such brutal fashion
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       the public eye, because they wouldn't give in, and become hypocrites themselves. 
I think in this day and age, with a literal big brother watching over us, or best bet is use our freedom of speech while we have it to keep spreading ideas to those still reading inside the lines. Through the internet, but most importantly from person to person in your daily lives. People don't want to talk to their neighbors any more, it any one for that matter, build up casual conversations with people you see, like the grocer you always see at the store, co-workers, the clerk always working the gas station, homeless always hanging out at places you frequent and spread ideas. They can't scroll past that like on Facebook or Reddit. 
From there..... Your guess is as good as mine.

       You idiots saying stop paying taxes don't know what you are talking about. Your employee will not allow this and even if they do, the government sends a "mandatory compliance" letter that requires them to take out taxes. Even if you don't file a return they are still keeping the minimum tax that has been paid in and you get nothing back even if you overpaid. Trust me, I have done this and it's only possible for a few years.

       Holy shit, you are asking the right question! (If I believed in supporting reddit, I would give you gold).

       To begin with, I don't believe insurrection against politicians or the government will do it. We could shoot them all, and their replacements would be there by next election. (and to be clear, I'm not calling for insurrection).

       I believe we can generally win by accomplishing only two goals: taking back the media and the Federal Reserve. Most people simply don't consider views that aren't mentioned on mainstream media, and taking control of the Fed would de-fund the fatcats.

       We may need to also re-take the elite colleges and universities, although I'm not sure if this is 100% necessary to achieve in the short-term. Once Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins, etc. start teaching people to think, this will trickle down through the rest of society.

       Barter, it's the way to do things, money is the root of all evil, digital or physical. Believe me, I know, it's true, very true. Barter is the best, the greatest, never has there been anything better, I give you milk, you give me butter.
