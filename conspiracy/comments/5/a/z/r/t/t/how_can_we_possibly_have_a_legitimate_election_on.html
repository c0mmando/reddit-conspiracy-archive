       We now know the Hiliary/DNC/MSM have all conspired to "elect" Hillary as the Democratic Nominee.
This make her an illegitimate candidate and possibly an illegitimate POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know from the "Pied Piper" emails that HRC and the MSM conspired to promote Trump and only release "good" articles and interviews about him because they felt out of all the RNC candidates he would be the easiest to defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember last last summer and fall? You couldn't get away from Trump in the news. He got way more airtime than any of the other candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in 4 days we are scheduled to have an election between 2 illegitimate candidates. (I know Jill and Johnson are still out there.. but either of them winning isn't realistic). Regardless of the outcome of the race - it could be argued that our POTUS is illegitimate... if it stops there we will be lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       The POTUS will be impeached and their VP will step in (or maybe the VP will be impeached too and the next in line will step in).
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in the corruption of the DOJ telling the FBI to stop investigating the Clinton Foundation and the 1st email investigation - and now our whole government is suspect and could be deemed illegitimate.. this is where the wheels fall off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other nations could consider our government illegitimate. Individual states could secede (Texas tried a few years ago.. with much less of an argument).
      </p>
      <p>
       This could get really bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need to postpone the elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton's legacy will be how they destroyed our democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I smoking too much pot or is this a possible outcome?

       Almost any election in our current representative republic is illegitimate. The vast majority of elected officials do not act with the best interests of their constituents in mind.

       That doesn't make the elections illegitimate though. If a congressman has no concern for his constituents and wins 100% of the popular vote in his district, that's a totally legitimate election.

       I agree with you, but before it's always been a "conspiracy theory".  Now it's in black and white, all laid out in these wikileaks.

      <p>
       As more and more of the "gems" get pulled out.. we will see Facebook post, email attachments and viral YouTube videos outlining the whole thing..  this could cause rioting, revolution or even civil war.

       Answer: shut down the machines installed by George Soros (sorrows) in 16 states. Shut down Diebold. Immediately implement a paper ballot replacement. Find the Soros plants infesting the system.

       I don't disagree with you statement but it begs the question:
      </p>
      <p>
       BOTH candidates are illegitimate.  What difference will a paper ballot be? ...Unless they are BOTH declared "illegitimate" BEFORE the election. Then it would be Jill Stein and Gary Johnson..

       But that wouldn't quiet down the masses who still want Trump and Bernie.

       A paper ballot is a paper trail. Observers should then husband the ballots and force the results to be known. There are no candidates beside Clinton and Trump so I don't know what
       <em>

       hairball is all about, there is no "begged question". We just want to know the legitimate will of the people.

       Your pot smoking has helped you to slow down enough to consider the facts. We fly on auto-pilot so often in life. I have long believed that if it doesn't turn around for the USA, the various States will begin to separate. And all the unique states are welcome to join the Confederation to the north.

       If we're lucky they push the election back a month, replace Hillary with Bernie, and hold new presidential debates. Anything short of that doesn't sound fair to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't know how much other nations will care if Hillary wins, especially the governments. It pains me to say but most of the governments in the world are probably corrupt. Many may even be supporting Clinton for whatever reason.

       Because the electoral systems that are in place have worked in the past and continue to work now. Supervision of the elections in highly decentralized in this country and primarily run by the same party that's crying wolf.

       Trump is not illegitimate even by your logic. Youre leaving out the part where Trump kicked the other  GOP Establishment goons ass's when he was conspired against and had less chance of winning fairly.

       Youre absolutely right. I dont want to be negative about the 3rd party politicians as I like Jill Stein.
      </p>
      <p>
       In different circumstances, I wouldn't insinuate as such, but the circumstances present today aren't amiable to voting for a 3rd party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leaves us with only 2 choices realistically...
      </p>
      <p>
       Vote for globalism and the destruction of Americas sovereignty
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Vote for the restoration of our borders, of our economy, etc.

       I agree with you, but before it's always been a "conspiracy theory".  Now it's in black and white, all laid out in these wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       As more and more of the "gems" get pulled out.. we will see Facebook post, email attachments and viral YouTube videos outlining the whole thing..  this could cause rioting, revolution or even civil war.

       That doesn't make the elections illegitimate though. If a congressman has no concern for his constituents and wins 100% of the popular vote in his district, that's a totally legitimate election.
