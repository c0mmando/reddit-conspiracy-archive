       I want the Clintons arrested and convicted for treason. But if there were exposed as pedophiles, this would mean that children would have been their victims, and I will never 'hope' for such a thing. The Clintons are really among the most evil people but I can't wish that we discover even more victims, just for the purpose to be able to convict the Clintons with a bigger sentence.

        First of all, she gave the order to waco, not reno.
       </li>
       <li>
        Secondly, she came up with obamacare 2 decades prior.  And we see how that went.
       </li>
       <li>
        Thirdly, she and Bill both were friends with the guy who gave 60,000 hemophiliac children AIDS, then had the nerve to brag about how the Clinton Foundation helps people with AIDS (in africa only) by colluding with pharma companies to keep the prices of aids medicine extremely high so they can pocket differences in bulk discounts and exploit any donation matching.  This is extortion.
       </li>
       <li>
        She claims to be a feminist but she has a weird 70s style open marriage where she and bill compete to see how many people they can use sexually and throw away, and they both have a relationship with people who have been caught as sexual predators (lolita express)
       </li>
       <li>
        This is only the most recent example.  This shit goes back decades.

       <li>
        They don't fund the Ryan White program which helps people in america.  They gave that little kid aids basically, then use him as a poster boy to brag about their charities.  They are literally the worst most wicked people on this earth.
       </li>
       <li>
        Her husband looked the other way when the CIA was importing drugs into arkansas.  They knew abut the drug running and became a part of it.  They are friends with the Bushes and they ran drug trafficking into america.  jeb for example is a cia agent who trafficked drugs from latin america...we know this in

        but the mainstream wholly ignores all this.  It's a known known decades now.

       <li>
        They took a lot of our money to help relief efforts in Haiti and built like 6 houses and all that money ended up funding other companies owned by their friends and didn't make it to actual real relief efforts.  Red Cross also culpable for this, their actual amount donated: 12.5% to actual people / housing.  Theyve made hundreds of millions over the years by not actually disbursing any of it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Clintons own the people running charity watch orgs, so their foundation gets a good rating, even though we know they are terrible.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hillary insulted Catholics, but this was a misdirection ploy, and it worked because people are stupid and don't do their homework.  Her husband is Jesuit trained, she's surrounded herself by jesuits, Trump is a jesuit trained, her running mate is a jesuit; Obama's intelligence advisors are all Jesuits (Catholic intelligence agency); the Clintons and tim kaine are all part of a paramasonic veterans org called "American Legion", ask vets what the Clintons have done for them (laugh).  Additionally Bill is is a DeMolay, you can verify by google image searching both bill clinton demolay and bill clinton american legion jfk.  You'll have photo evidence.  This is important because it means they are freemasons.  The reason this is a problem should be clear if you spend any time here on

        Hillary is clearly part of a 7 society because of the 7th floor group, and her donations that have at least 4 7's in them, which is a hallmark of that secret society.  The 7th floor group was exposed as a shadow government during the FBI investigation into Clintons' emails

       A DC pedo ring would be faaar worse than any of the public had ever thought. Instant Trump win if exposed, and the whole corrupt system crashes. However, the media would likely go full on coverup, andthe counter intel would be staggering.

       I think there is so much misinformation out here that we are being bamboozled. I couldn't believe she got this far in the election. Everyone knows it was rigged and she's still in the running. Do you all NOT remember that Bill got impeached and basically said screw you and stayed in office? 
She's going to win. And she will face no jail time and never have to face her crimes in a court of law. And it's freaking pissing me off. 
She's going to be the next pres, she's going to start WWIII and she'll continue her fleecing of America.
