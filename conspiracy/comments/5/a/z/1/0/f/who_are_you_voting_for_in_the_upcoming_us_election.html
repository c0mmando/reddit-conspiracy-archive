       Who are you voting for president? Who are you voting for state elections? And why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious because I'm just at a loss as to what to really do when it comes to voting this year. I've heard I should just turn it in blank, or write someone in. What are you US r/conspiracy people doing? Or even if you're not from the US, who would you vote for?

       Another vote is a wasted vote, that is true.  But some of his ideology is dead on, we have to close the borders and lower corporate taxes, and he would expose all the corruption in our country.

       What exactly do you think is going to happen by lowering corporate taxes??
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing will change except for the CEOs hoarding even more money for themselves and continuing this unsustainable quarter-over-quarter profit growth expectations.  They've gotten to the point where they make more money bribing politicians and actually running for president than they do by innovating their products.  This indicates a fatal flaw in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are at the stage of cutting corners left and right to keep up the unsustainable charade.  They don't need more money, the market needs lowered expectations and a return to a healthy system that rewards hard working employees instead of lazy-ass gamblers on wall street.

       I agree with you but by keeping corporate taxes high, Apple is keeping over 200 billion dollars in Ireland, you agree with that? If you bring that money back that Spurs innovation and growth.

       There is no evidence that reshoring will take place if taxes are lowered. That's what everyone assumes, but I think it will only help those who have stayed to become richer.

       Why even vote?  The government puppet head speaker you are voting for is for a corporation owned by Rothschild.  The citizens haven't had a representative government for a long time.  Not only that but both major candidates probably did some very horrible things to get where they are today, thats how it works.  You only move up if you are corrupted and controlled.  Your vote for them is your support for their crimes.   They tell whatever lie you want to hear to get elected and then its business as usual.  WAKE UP.

       Popular vote Trump wins.  Rigged election Hillary wins.  You can give support behind 3rd party to hopefully get 5% which gives them more authority for next time, maybe even in on the debates.  But what we need is revolution,  regime change and the end of the D.C. pedo-cult tyranny machine.

       I almost penciled in Bernie, but I voted for Trump in spite of knowing I'm probably getting played. Doesn't matter because it's a done deal that Clinton will get all my state's electoral college, but I really only showed up to vote for the people's friend, Mary Jane, anyway.

       No one. Trump is abhorrent, Clinton doubly so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect Clinton to win, but I won't contribute (if my vote even matters). I'm happy about a liberal SCOTUS appointment, at least, but I am also strongly pro-choice, pro-gay rights, and for marijuana legalization (though I do not smoke). I also love my guns and privacy, though, so we'll see how everything goes.

       The Clinton foundation is set up to monetise off politics. Billionaires donate to Clinton and then they can get policies past to increase profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump has been in the billionaire club. And he has seen their plans for America which is already well and truly under way.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are going to gut and destroy America for profit. Donald Trump loves his country to much to see this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe him or not is another story but after the wikileaks, fbi investigation,  journalist investigation etc there's no doubt that Clinton intentions aren't true and  no doubt an alliance of people wish to stop them.

       My state's electoral college (Tennessee) will almost definitely vote Trump, but I feel like the biggest voice against the status quo I can have via voting is to vote for the independent candidate who's likely to get the 3rd most votes.

       I was considering this myself. My state, Washington, will go blue. But I think it might help to have some votes for another candidate to show that I don't believe in the two party system.

       <strong>
        The politicians have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens, whom they oppress with heavy taxes in the form of income tax, sales tax and many other taxes—people sometimes have eighty to ninety percent of their income taken away, and these taxes are lavishly spent for the high salaries drawn by the officers and rulers. Formerly, the taxes accumulated from the citizens were spent for performing great sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature. At the present moment, however, almost all forms of sacrifice are not at all possible.

       <strong>
        As long as he remained at home, Dhruva Mahārāja performed many great ceremonial sacrifices in order to please the enjoyer of all sacrifices, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Prescribed ceremonial sacrifices are especially meant to please Lord Viṣṇu, who is the objective of all such sacrifices and who awards the resultant benedictions.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In Bhagavad-gītā (3.9) it is said, yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ: one should act or work only in order to please the Supreme Lord, otherwise one becomes entangled in the resultant reactions. According to the four divisions of varṇa and āśrama, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas are especially advised to perform great ceremonial sacrifices and to distribute their accumulated money very liberally. Dhruva Mahārāja, as a king and ideal kṣatriya, performed many such sacrifices, giving very liberally in charity. Kṣatriyas and vaiśyas are supposed to earn their money and accumulate great riches. Sometimes they do it by acting sinfully. Kṣatriyas are meant to rule over a country; Dhruva Mahārāja, for example, in the course of ruling, had to fight and kill many Yakṣas. Such action is necessary for kṣatriyas. A kṣatriya should not be a coward, and he should not be nonviolent; to rule over the country he has to act violently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kṣatriyas and vaiśyas are therefore especially advised to give in charity at least fifty percent of their accumulated wealth. In Bhagavad-gītā it is recommended that even though one enters the renounced order of life, he still cannot give up the performance of yajña, dāna and tapasya. They are never to be given up. Tapasya is meant for the renounced order of life; those who are retired from worldly activities should perform tapasya, penances and austerities. Those who are in the material world, the kṣatriyas and vaiśyas, must give charity. Brahmacārīs, in the beginning of their lives, should perform different kinds of yajñas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dhruva Mahārāja, as an ideal king, practically emptied his treasury by giving charity. A king is not meant simply to realize taxes from the citizens and accumulate wealth to spend in sense gratification. World monarchy has failed ever since kings began to satisfy their personal senses with the taxes accumulated from the citizens. Of course, whether the system is monarchy or democracy, the same corruption is still going on. At the present moment there are different parties in the democratic government, but everyone is busy trying to keep his post or trying to keep his political party in power. The politicians have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens, whom they oppress with heavy taxes in the form of income tax, sales tax and many other taxes—people sometimes have eighty to ninety percent of their income taken away, and these taxes are lavishly spent for the high salaries drawn by the officers and rulers. Formerly, the taxes accumulated from the citizens were spent for performing great sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature. At the present moment, however, almost all forms of sacrifice are not at all possible; therefore, it is recommended in the śāstras that people should perform saṅkīrtana-yajña. Any householder, regardless of his position, can perform this saṅkīrtana-yajña without expenditure. All the family members can sit down together and simply clap their hands and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. Somehow or other, everyone can manage to perform such a yajña and distribute prasāda to the people in general. That is quite sufficient for this age of Kali. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on this principle: chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra at every moment, as much as possible, both inside and outside of the temples, and, as far as possible, distribute prasāda. This process can be accelerated with the cooperation of state administrators and those who are producing the country's wealth. Simply by liberal distribution of prasāda and saṅkīrtana, the whole world can become peaceful and prosperous.
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally in all the material sacrifices recommended in the Vedic literature there are offerings to the demigods. This demigod worship is especially meant for less intelligent men. Actually, the result of such sacrifice goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa. Lord Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad-gītā (5.29), bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām: He is actually the enjoyer of all sacrifices. His name, therefore, is Yajña-puruṣa.
Although Dhruva Mahārāja was a great devotee and had nothing to do with these sacrifices, to set an example to his people he performed many sacrifices and gave all his wealth in charity. For as long as he lived as a householder, he never spent a farthing for his sense gratification. In this verse the word karma-phala-pradam is very significant. The Lord awards everyone different kinds of karma as the individual living entities desire; He is the Supersoul present within the heart of everyone, and He is so kind and liberal that He gives everyone full facilities to perform whatever acts one wants. Then the result of the action is also enjoyed by the living entity. If anyone wants to enjoy or lord it over material nature, the Lord gives him full facilities, but he becomes entangled in the resultant reactions. Similarly, if anyone wants to engage himself fully in devotional service, the Lord gives him full facilities, and the devotee enjoys the results. The Lord is therefore known as karma-phala-prada.
