       Has it been taken over by people that actually think that any of this election distraction matters? The first two pages of this sub are all about Hillary. We get it... You

       vote. Have fun with that. Can we quit playing small ball and get back to talking about the people that really run the show and other such topics that are really compelling. Aren't you all tired of this? Have all the people that used to come to this subreddit somewhere else?

       This is about taking down a global cabal.  Ending the largest money laundering operation in the world (outside the Vatican), and returning the United States of America back to its citizens.   I agree the election process is all distraction, but what is happening behind the veil could be the greatest event in the History of America.  Stay safe.  Be good.

       This is a huge conspiracy that's unfolding in front of eyes and as a result millions of Americans that otherwise wouldn't have been into conspiracies have now been redpilled and see that the system they once believed in is corrupt and rigged. Sorry if we don't discuss the illuminati, lizard people, and chemtrails in the meantime.

       Wouldn't be more productive to figure out who the Clinton's handlers are? Because if the Clintons do go down (they won't) another lackey family or two will take their place.

       Yeah, seems that the "can we get back to real conspiracies like it used to be in this sub" and the "leaving this sub" posts from accounts that don't even have a history of posting in r/conspiracy are the new CTR scripts.

       That's bullshit. I've been active in this sub for as many years. I'm just concerned that the exact same topic is posted over and over in the same day and takes up a majority of the subs front page. I'm curious about the emails too but there are certainly other things that seem to be getting ignored and or down voted that would have risen into more prominent discussions in the past.

       I was on pre and post 9/11. Pre 9/11 was the golden age. There was great stuff about political conspiracy, aliens, black projects, cryptozoology...there was little low hanging fruit online, so people spent lots of time researching their shit and presenting their work. Made for great reading, whether it was on lizard men or zero point energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post 9/11 it got weird. Anti-government talk seemed less popular for a while.  I swear to you the site bogged down heavy too. IDK if it was from monitoring or new users, but it became almost unusable. That's when I quit checking in.

       I can imagine, there was probably a lot of people that were actually involved in those things that went online with the internet being fairly new and all. Now with everything monitored and infiltrated being anonymous is much harder and everyone regurgitates what's already been said.

       Just looking at Gary McKinnon's case where he was able to "hack" into US Military NASA computers which had terrible protection at the time, it's obvious how much has changed since then.

        SB 4.14.17, Translation and Purport:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The saintly persons continued: When the king protects the citizens from the disturbances of mischievous ministers as well as from thieves and rogues, he can, by virtue of such pious activities, accept taxes given by his subjects. Thus a pious king can certainly enjoy himself in this world as well as in the life after death.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The duty of a pious king is described very nicely in this verse. His first and foremost duty is to give protection to the citizens from thieves and rogues as well as from ministers who are no better than thieves and rogues. Formerly, ministers were appointed by the king and were not elected. Consequently, if the king was not very pious or strict, the ministers would become thieves and rogues and exploit the innocent citizens. It is the king's duty to see that there is no increase of thieves and rogues either in the government secretariat or in the departments of public affairs. If a king cannot give protection to citizens from thieves and rogues both in the government service and in public affairs, he has no right to exact taxes from them. In other words, the king or the government that taxes can levy taxes from the citizens only if the king or government is able to give protection to the citizens from thieves and rogues.
In the Twelfth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (SB 12.1.39-40) there is a description of these thieves and rogues in government service. As stated, prajās te bhakṣayiṣyanti mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ: "These proud mlecchas (persons who are less than śūdras). representing themselves as kings, will tyrannize their subjects, and their subjects, on the other hand, will cultivate the most vicious practices. Thus practicing evil habits and behaving foolishly, the subjects will be like their rulers." The idea is that in the democratic days of Kali-yuga, the general population will fall down to the standard of śūdras. As stated (kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ), practically the whole population of the world will be śūdra. A śūdra is a fourth-class man who is only fit to work for the three higher social castes. Being fourth-class men, śūdras are not very intelligent. Since the population is fallen in these democratic days, they can only elect a person in their category, but a government cannot run very well when it is run by śūdras. The second class of men, known as kṣatriyas, are especially meant for governing a country under the direction of saintly persons (brāhmaṇas) who are supposed to be very intelligent. In other ages-in Satya-yuga, Tretā-yuga and Dvāpara-yuga-the general populace was not so degraded, and the head of government was never elected. The king was the supreme executive personality, and if he caught any ministers stealing like thieves and rogues, he would at once have them killed or dismissed from service. As it was the duty of the king to kill thieves and rogues, it was similarly his duty to immediately kill dishonest ministers in government service. By such strict vigilance, the king could run the government very well, and the citizens would be happy to have such a king. The conclusion is that unless the king is perfectly able to give protection to the citizens from rogues and thieves, he has no right to levy taxes from the citizens for his own sense gratification. However, if he gives all protection to the citizens and levies taxes on them, he can live very happily and peacefully in this life, and at the end of this life be elevated to the heavenly kingdom or even to the Vaikuṇṭhas, where he will be happy in all respects.

       seems the denizens of this edit say it's extra terrestrials and such and don't like that politics have invaded. I am thinking it is because the schrillary and politics edits are lousy with paid shills and they down vote EVERYTHING forcing compliant mods to ban folk and they come here. IOW, the lemmings are banning non-pc posters from the controlled media subedits, in violation of reddit policy, btw, and won't tolerate alternate views that they don't approve of. sad really.

       This right here is the difference between the average conspiracy theorist who thinks there is widespread corruption at the highest levels of government and the ones who are wayyy out in left field who think that the illuminati and the masons are just the first layer of a giant worldwide conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who thinks that this election doesn't matter and is all a big distraction is dooming him/her-self to a life of paranoia and helplessness and thinking that no change is ever possible.

      <p>
       I really empathize with you that you feel that way about life, and I really hope you're not right.

       No need for your empathy. I've been voting every election since 1993. I just think that this subreddit used to be a different place. I don't want posts about the Illuminati or lizard people, I just know a smoke screen when I see it and when I open up
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and over the span of two pages half the posts are about the same subject I become perplexed. Usually when anything gets like this there is something bigger being buried. That's all. I see Clinton as small potatoes. And there is a bigger picture and global corruption. If you don't see it that way than I have empathy for you.

       Do you really believe that the choice matters? Our elected officials haven't run shit for 100 years. Their handlers will be there to guide them no matter who is elected.

       I'm really not trying to fight you, I'm genuinely curious.  I guess my question is, how do you know when you've ultimately exposed/taken down the man behind the curtain?

       Change is definitely possible, but it's not going to come all at once by electing one president or the other.  There is a whole system in place that prevents such drastic changes from happening, by design.  And for good reason.  The exception to this is when someone goes above or around the law to make drastic change.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like plenty of people say: real change starts at the local level (starting with yourself) and grows outward.

       Of course change doesn't happen overnight!  But you have to believe that change is possible and that there are good people out there doing good work to stop bad people from getting too much power.  I think that's what we're seeing here. And its so rare these days;  so I'm happy to spend time talking about this Hillary email thing.
