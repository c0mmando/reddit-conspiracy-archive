<p>That was on purpose right?  </p>

<p>Anyway, monitor the threads, it does get posted, and I for one have been tearing into the Trump is great propaganda.  The fact is, that neither are saints.  However, most articles on Trump are bullshit.  If they were remotely credible, they&#39;d probably be posted more...Even ones that are fake get posted, but they just get called out.  Hillary has a bunch of shit surrounding her right now, so logically, she would have more articles out on her.  Your job, is if they are fake, is to call it out.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of reposts, because luckily, this sub is still free from censorship, for the most part.   It would be great if people glanced at new or hot before posting, but is not required.    If you see something that isn&#39;t true, make sure it isn&#39;t true, or else you will be downvoted, the community is pretty good about weeding out crackpots and bullshit.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to post Trump reports, and you don&#39;t want to correct falsehoods, then really I don&#39;t think your opinion matters all that much, since both things you could do yourself, you won&#39;t do.  You can&#39;t change others, you can only change self to achieve desired results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/">his lawsuits</a> are petty compared to what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LYRUOd_QoM">Clintons are involved in</a>. The Clinton Foundation takes the cake when it comes to corruption and crimes. People die around the Clinton family. The Clintons make deals with ISIS, sell weapons to other countries, launder money, send emails from private servers that were hacked (according to the FBI), rumors of pedophilia are running rampant, start proxy wars with Russia in Syria, Benghazi, they partake in moving drugs around, etc... The list goes on and on. Trump isn&#39;t smart enough to pull those things off. Clinton&#39;s actions affect way more people than Trump&#39;s stupidity.</p>

<p>I hate both candidates, but Hillary is way more corrupt than Trump and paints a much darker future for the world if she&#39;s elected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government corruption is a massive massive ongoing conspiracy theory, and Hillary Clinton is airing out all of the  dirty laundry related to it.  So you have a subreddit about conspiracy theories being rewarded with confirmation after confirmation, which is why it is all over the place.  And you are correct, Trump has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton being involved in such massive levels of infiltrated corruption into our government.</p>

<p>That was on purpose right?  </p>

<p>Anyway, monitor the threads, it does get posted, and I for one have been tearing into the Trump is great propaganda.  The fact is, that neither are saints.  However, most articles on Trump are bullshit.  If they were remotely credible, they&#39;d probably be posted more...Even ones that are fake get posted, but they just get called out.  Hillary has a bunch of shit surrounding her right now, so logically, she would have more articles out on her.  Your job, is if they are fake, is to call it out.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of reposts, because luckily, this sub is still free from censorship, for the most part.   It would be great if people glanced at new or hot before posting, but is not required.    If you see something that isn&#39;t true, make sure it isn&#39;t true, or else you will be downvoted, the community is pretty good about weeding out crackpots and bullshit.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to post Trump reports, and you don&#39;t want to correct falsehoods, then really I don&#39;t think your opinion matters all that much, since both things you could do yourself, you won&#39;t do.  You can&#39;t change others, you can only change self to achieve desired results.</p>
