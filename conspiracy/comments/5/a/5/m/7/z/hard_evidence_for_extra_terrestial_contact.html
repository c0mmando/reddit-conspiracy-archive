    <div class="md"><p>What about the native people of Australia? They have been around for roughly 30,000 years and have many ancient rock paintings that have been carbon dated and proved to be ancient, they depict beings from the stars who visited earth a long time ago. Even through their folk law, they talk about these visits.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not the only ancient civilisation to show that we&#39;ve been visited by extraterrestrial beings, it&#39;s common knowledge that the Mayan and Egyptian people show the above in their texts on structures.</p>

<p>Most of us don&#39;t believe these things due to the lack of first hand experience, which is justifiable, but why would ancient civilisations lie about it all? There&#39;s nothing to be gained from doing so.</p>

<p>The scientific method - To try to falsify an hypothesis (eg the moon landings) by evidence or controlled experiments. And almost each and every one paper there contradicts that hypothesis which means the moon landings <em>did not happen</em> no matter what the government tries to blow up your behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, none of us can present you with evidence you&#39;d accept. Convincing a skeptic is impossible, when the skeptic always defines &quot;hard evidence&quot; as that which is never available. </p>

<p>There will always be a big skeptic movement on this issue, and there will never be any kind of official disclosure that convinces the majority. The whole field will continue being ripe with disinfo, lies and fearmongering. </p>

<p>Instead of looking for physical artifacts or other kinds of evidence James Randi supposedly would accept, you should focus on meditation and actually reaching out to the Other with your own spirit and mind, when lying still in silent darkness. But if you&#39;ve decided to not believe in aliens, this will be impossible for you. You&#39;re not even gonna try, because it sounds like &quot;New Age mumbo jumbo&quot; and &quot;woo&quot; that only &quot;crazy people&quot; believe in. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to you. Reach out. Or remain unconvinced. </p>

<p>In general, people on this forum are more likely to believe in Flat or Concave Earth than space aliens. Most people on here don&#39;t seem to believe in the existence of outer space at all, let alone a round Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t had time to do a Geodetic mechanical survey, such as the Rectilineator experiment.</p>

<p>The best example of hard evidence I can give you is the fact that airplanes cruise with their nose up at about 3 degrees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a rule of thumb, passenger planes are designed to cruise with a two or three degree nose-up angle at cruise flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>An airplane cruises at around a 3 degree angle of attack. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://airfactsjournal.com/2015/04/archives-leighton-collins-angle-attack-1965/">airfactsjournal</a></p>

<p>Airplanes pitch upwards because the earth curves upwards.</p>

<p>If the earth curved downwards they would have to pitch downwards, and if the earth was flat, they would pitch at 0 degrees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there is some kind of mathematical equation that can solve the problem conclusively.</p>

<p>I thought that a planes lift is provided by the shape of the wings. I&#39;ve watched videos about how planes fly and there is no mention of needing to pitch the plane slightly upwards.</p>

I don&#39;t question the intellectual capability of those who have not looked into the evidence regarding the moon hoax and don&#39;t blame them for seeing no reason to investigate something such seemingly preposterous. But those who claim they have and still see no reason to doubt them, I regard incapable of real critical thinking and scientific work.</p>
