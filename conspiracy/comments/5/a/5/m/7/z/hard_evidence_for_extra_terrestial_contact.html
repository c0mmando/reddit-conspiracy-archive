       Is there any at all? not just quotes from famous people about supposed technology that is keot secret for god knows why, Not quotes from random astronauts/pilots who beleive they have seen saucers. Not arguements from the vastness of the universe. Not youtube videos someone in brazil recorded with a low quality shaky camera that was outdated 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like hard physical cooberateable evidence, the best I can think of is the WOW signal, and there is a very good chance that it was just a mistake.

       What about the native people of Australia? They have been around for roughly 30,000 years and have many ancient rock paintings that have been carbon dated and proved to be ancient, they depict beings from the stars who visited earth a long time ago. Even through their folk law, they talk about these visits.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not the only ancient civilisation to show that we've been visited by extraterrestrial beings, it's common knowledge that the Mayan and Egyptian people show the above in their texts on structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us don't believe these things due to the lack of first hand experience, which is justifiable, but why would ancient civilisations lie about it all? There's nothing to be gained from doing so.

       A circle around the head of a pictured person is for example not proof that it's someone wearing a space suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials is an extraordinary claim and those require extraordinary evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was an inside job or the moon hoax are also extraordinary claims but are in my opinion also supported by extraordinary evidence.

       The moon hoax has shite evidence &amp; has been disproven by other countries who would have loved to call bs. Amateur astronomers have also observed evidence left behind from the US missions. 
Not that there wasn't the possibility of fake footage filmed by Kubrick

       No. Actually it's first class. Go to aulis.com and read some of the papers and you'll see that if you are capable of applying the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific method - To try to falsify an hypothesis (eg the moon landings) by evidence or controlled experiments. And almost each and every one paper there contradicts that hypothesis which means the moon landings

       I'm well acquainted with scientific process and lab testing, which is what you're specifically referring to. Whatever site you're referencing would be using abstract reasoning as their lab work which just means math, which can be falsified as easily as any other logic system. 
There is fucking simply proof on the goddamn moon. Go look for yourself it's not that difficult.

       I would love to and I expect to find nothing. I don't question the intellectual capability of those who have not looked into the evidence regarding the moon hoax and don't blame them for seeing no reason to investigate something such seemingly preposterous. But those who claim they have and still see no reason to doubt them, I regard incapable of real critical thinking and scientific work.

       No, none of us can present you with evidence you'd accept. Convincing a skeptic is impossible, when the skeptic always defines "hard evidence" as that which is never available.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be a big skeptic movement on this issue, and there will never be any kind of official disclosure that convinces the majority. The whole field will continue being ripe with disinfo, lies and fearmongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of looking for physical artifacts or other kinds of evidence James Randi supposedly would accept, you should focus on meditation and actually reaching out to the Other with your own spirit and mind, when lying still in silent darkness. But if you've decided to not believe in aliens, this will be impossible for you. You're not even gonna try, because it sounds like "New Age mumbo jumbo" and "woo" that only "crazy people" believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's up to you. Reach out. Or remain unconvinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, people on this forum are more likely to believe in Flat or Concave Earth than space aliens. Most people on here don't seem to believe in the existence of outer space at all, let alone a round Earth.

       Absolutely nothing. We can bounce radio signals off the Ionosphere so we have no way of knowing whether any radio signals we receive are coming from outer space, or whether they come from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I believe that the Earth is a

       I haven't had time to do a Geodetic mechanical survey, such as the Rectilineator experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best example of hard evidence I can give you is the fact that airplanes cruise with their nose up at about 3 degrees.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As a rule of thumb, passenger planes are designed to cruise with a two or three degree nose-up angle at cruise flight.

       Airplanes pitch upwards because the earth curves upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth curved downwards they would have to pitch downwards, and if the earth was flat, they would pitch at 0 degrees.

       I see your point. I suppose planes pitching upwards could simply be due to compensating for the pull of gravity.

       Maybe there is some kind of mathematical equation that can solve the problem conclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought that a planes lift is provided by the shape of the wings. I've watched videos about how planes fly and there is no mention of needing to pitch the plane slightly upwards.

       If there was no gravity, a plane could fly straight with no pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is gravity, therefore a plane has to angle up slightly.

       The fact you hadn't even considered this tells me you're not worth my time, lest I bother talking to a puddle.

       I would love to and I expect to find nothing. I don't question the intellectual capability of those who have not looked into the evidence regarding the moon hoax and don't blame them for seeing no reason to investigate something such seemingly preposterous. But those who claim they have and still see no reason to doubt them, I regard incapable of real critical thinking and scientific work.
