    <div class="md"><p>Did you ask to really know, or are you just another Hillary person who wants to mock people with differing opinions?</p>

<p>I say this genuinely and with no malice:  it&#39;s hard to see our own biases.  I was jolted by my own this morning (when I read something about HRC and thought &quot;of course!&quot; and then realized nope, it was Trump-not that I like Trump, but I don&#39;t hate him with the fire of a thousand suns like I do HRC). It&#39;s jarring the hold it has over us.  </p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re a genuine HRC lover or bought and paid for, it&#39;s time for the American people to STOP IT with each other.  Because we are not the enemy.  We are neighbors, co-workers, friends, service people.  We KNOW each other- we are each other.  Our ideologies differ, sure. But it doesn&#39;t mean that we are so different that we should continue to be as divisive amongst each other as we are right now.</p>

<p>So, ask to understand, but if your goal is to simply reinforce to yourself that you&#39;re right, ask yourself why you feel the need to do that?  The answer is between you and you. We will all be better off if everyone of us did more soul-searching and less other-bashing.  Either way, I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what? I do wish I could understand the hate and the willingness to blindly accept anything anti-Hillary as fact, no matter how far-fetched and illogical it is. I am truly and completely bewildered by the amount of people who buy into this stuff, especially considering the source(s). It&#39;s partly fascinating and partly frightening to me. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m honest though, I didn&#39;t expect to gain any insight by my post. I guess another part of me was what could be called &quot;trolling&quot;; I anticipated being called a shill and &quot;CTR&quot; to be thrown at me more than actually learning something.</p>

<p>For the record (not to correct it, hehe), I&#39;m certainly not &quot;bought and paid for&quot;; if so, I wouldn&#39;t be worn the fuck out from just getting off my twelve hour shift in an industrial plant. I&#39;m a Hillary supporter by default; I don&#39;t buy into the ridiculous conspiracies about her; that&#39;s not to say she&#39;s never been involved in some shady shit, but nothing more than your average run of the mill politician (and certainly not murder plots ffs). I voted for Bernie during the primaries, but to me (and I believe the majority of Americans) this election is almost solely about keeping Donald fucking Trump out of the oval office. I believe the worst Clinton could do is reinforce the status quo and continue what we&#39;ve went through for the past eight years, and what&#39;s really wrong with that? OTOH, Trump represents the absolute worst tendencies of the American id; regardless of whether or not he could successfully enact his deplorable ;) policies, he still stands for everything I feel is wrong with America and at this point that means doing whatever in my power to make sure he&#39;s not elected, even if it means voting for someone who isn&#39;t my first choice (although I do believe Hillary is an admirable woman).</p>

The only upside I can see to Trump is similar to Obama where congress blocks him from doing anything meaningful.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I appreciate you being so genuine in sharing your thoughts. I&#39;ve been a democrat my entire life, so I certainly was not predisposed to dislike Hillary Clinton, and I probably would have never fallen down the rabbit hole I did until I found the primaries to be stolen (there are multiple lawsuits in several states in the works as well as journalists who have spent years researching this, so I ask you to consider, even briefly, that it is possible.  It&#39;s the hardest realization I&#39;ve ever come to).  Since I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t make an impression on you with the &quot;admirable woman &quot;part, if the evidence to the contrary hasn&#39;t so far, I&#39;d like to address the Donald Trump part.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is an idiot.  He&#39;s really a fool, and he has said some stupid things that the media has gone on to exacerbate and model a reaction to- still that doesn&#39;t excuse his words.  But that&#39;s what they are- words.  We cannot have any expectation as to how he might behave in office, because he&#39;s never been there, and I probably couldn&#39;t name five politicians who do what they promise.  </p>

<p>But we sure do know the plan if it&#39;s HRC in office.  As you said, it&#39;s more of the same- but worse.</p>

<p>The truth is we cannot afford more of the status quo. 80% of the American population is either in poverty or just above it. You&#39;re lucky that you were able to work that shift that you just came home from: lots of people can&#39;t find work that is life-sustaining, and they have no safety nets either because most have been removed (by Bill Clinton, under HRC&#39;s watchful eye, and Obama hasn&#39;t helped either).  The people in DC are all being sponsored by the corporations, who expect something in return- favorable legislation, and they&#39;ve gotten it, starting with, again, Bill.  This is why we can&#39;t get Hillary to commit to progressive legislation that Bernie believes in. Because Bernie is anti-corporation money, and Hillary is entirely funded by it (as well as Clinton foundation donations, of which only 6% has gone to actual charitable causes. 94% of the money donated to the Clinton foundation was salaries and money that went directly to the Clintons).</p>

<p>For me, a progressive to the left of Bernie, it is about the drones, war and bombings.  Trump may be a complete jackass, but he is not interested in fighting wars that are not getting us anywhere as a nation but still spending 50% of our taxes.  They&#39;re actually causing the people around the world to be displaced and killed, and they hate Americans for it, as well they should.  Truly, what part of our freedoms can be fought for overseas?</p>

<p>I think you should consider that if Bernie Sanders appealed to you, HRC&#39;s actual record isn&#39;t all that different from Donald Trump&#39;s rhetoric.  I hope that you look at what she does, and not what she says as your guide. And certainly, don&#39;t look to the mainstream media for answers.</p>

<p>Most importantly, though, is we Americans have these conversations with each other understanding we are more alike than different, and approach from that angle, instead of in anger that neither side deserves.  We all are just fighting for what we believe is best for ourselves and each other, and that&#39;s a good thing.  </p>

<p>Ps, I will be happy to link you to supporting documentation of everything that I said here. Let me know if you want me to, and I will try to get to it today.</p>

<p>First of all, this post is not about the legitimately concerning issues regarding the Clintons; it&#39;s solely about the ridiculous &quot;Clintons are killers&quot; bullshit that so many people in this sub fall for hook, line and sinker. News flash: believing and repeating that shit which has no basis in reality (or you know, actual evidence) does more to discredit the anti-Hillary crowd that anything else. I almost wonder if it originated from the pro-Clinton camp as a lark, but a few gullible people who take anything remotely anti-Clinton as fact at face value took it and ran with it... it </p>

<p>No, I do want to know why y&#39;all believe shit that&#39;s blatantly untrue, and how you explain away the obvious holes in your &quot;logic&quot;.</p>

<p>The three most mentioned &quot;victims&quot; of the Clinton&#39;s own families have spoken out about how these nonsensical theories have hurt them and tarnished their loved ones&#39; legacies, yet on subs such as this one (and certain others) you have people who use baseless circular reasoning to continue regurgitating the completely baseless accusations. I completely understand the appeal of wide reaching murder mysteries, but keep in mind that the names y&#39;all throw around actually belong to real people with real families that have to deal with your bullshit. It&#39;s disgusting, if you ask me; it&#39;d be a lot more decent if you kept your fantasies relegated to fictional characters.</p>

<p>For the record, I do know what I&#39;m talking about, although I don&#39;t keep up with the latest infowars or Breitbart talking points. Why don&#39;t you bring me up to date; when is the next &quot;shocking revelation that&#39;s guaranteed to bring down Hillary&#39;s campaign&quot; going to be revealed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not interested in an actual discussion, so why bother?  Your sermon here is the ramblings of an obviously insane coincidence theorist, right?  Put on your clearly-not-tinfoil fedora, and get back to grazing.</p>

<p>One question (not an insincere one, like yours), before I let you get back to your feeding:  When you are revealed to be completely wrong, foolish, and blind, and truth comes out about this evil family, will you have to ability to reflect, realize how willfully blind you were, and admit it?  Or will you put your chin up, and pretend like you really knew it all along?</p>

There ya go. You&#39;re welcome. Do a little bit of the research needed to connect the dots and its hard to so easily dismiss the evidence as &quot;ridiculous&quot; or &quot;blatantly untrue&quot;. Speaking in absolutes doesnt make you right. It only announces that you&#39;ve already made your decision on what the &quot;truth&quot; is and your mind isn&#39;t open to a different version of said &quot;truth.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what to do if you disagree:
Make a list of all the deceased.</p>

<p>Google them.</p>

<p>Verify that they were real people with real connections to the Clintons and who really died violently - and were not just imaginary people invented by anti-Clinton propagandists.</p>

<p>Find out how they were connected to the Clintons and what information they were going to divulge.</p>

<p>Find out when the Clintons became aware of this.</p>

<p>Find out how soon afterwards each potential witness was bumped off.</p>

<p>Explain why so many of these murders had similar MO&#39;s (bullets fired into the back of the head, exploding planes etc.).</p>

<p>Explain why so many of these murders were described as suicides by the coroner.</p>

<p>Find out who appointed the coroner.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what to do if you still disagree:</p>

<p>Have a brain transplant or start eating more fish.</p>

<p>Then the only remaining question will be: &quot;was it Bill or Hillary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think for me its more the associated body count, there&#39;s too much suspicious deaths around them. im not gonna solve or prove any crimes from behind my computer but i can easily find a ton of people i think have died in very suspicious circumstances. i know what you mean about speculation damaging the &#39;movement&#39; but something stinks, wether people are correct about certain cases doesnt matter so much but there is something there.</p>
