        here's TV news from 1979

       .

       There is still no real proof of life since Julian Assange's internet connection was said to be cut off. All things you see on twitter or other websites are only cut sequences of old footage. Literally everything. The phone call to the CSIL2016 conference on Oct. 26  in Argentina is not a proof of life and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59m8ps/julian_assanges_intervention_to_the_cisl2016_was/">
        it is very probably a fake
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And if you want to be even more rigorous, it's more like Day 26.  You can look at the
       <a href="http://assange.net/">
        'Julian proof of life clock'
       </a>
       . As of now, there is no valid proof of life since an Oct 4 live video feed in Berlin. This website also thinks the phone call from Julian in Argentina was a fake and think it's 'a pre-recording of Julian Assange's voice' and that they could 'easily put that together' themselves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The video that
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/790406530738913285">
        Wikileaks proposed on Twitter
       </a>
       on Oct. 23  and that was chosen by the people has never been shown? That was 7 days ago, people. How long does it take to do a small video while holding a newspaper? 10 minutes?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't believe all those CTR shills who try to convince you that he has talked, that there is a video or some other bullshit. There has been no proof of life since hos internet connection was cut off. Not a single one.

       I went from worried to now hoping that he didn't suffer if he is dead.  When did telling the truth come at such a high cost?  I hope he is just hiding out until November 8th.  This whole shitshow election...there are no good answers. Hillary went from being the perpetrator to the victim.  Selling out to the highest bidder US interests.

       Assage is a martyr for the truth. The thing is the cocksuckers who killed him (possibly kidnapped) will not want us or the rest of the people to know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they just outright said we killed Assange(or illegally kidnapped) there would be major repercussions. Keeping us in the dark while we still think wikileaks and Assange are safe will have 0 repercussions.
      </p>

       He is either dead or being held somewhere... This fact at this point.
