       We need roads, modern utilities such as water, waste water treatment, electricity and a global trade network, education and healthcare (preferably universal imho). "we can rule ourselves" with what? I believe that definition would imply some form of...wait for it...wait for it...government. I agree that perhaps a change from a Capitalist Republic may better represent the will of the people, but beware what you wish for. The evil you know may be better than the evil you don't know. The sword always cuts both ways.

       The government doesn't provide any of that. They steal your money then pay people to do those things, while taking a cut. Why not just communities get together and pay for what they need? All of those things can be done by private parties/sector. Sorry. But what you just regurgitated was liberal/progressive lies/talking points.

       Can you provide an example of this theory anywhere on the planet? Countries where they piss and crap in a ditch on the margin of a dirt road don't count, as I don't wanna live in that country. I'm sure the businesses will give your community a great deal without any regulation. Y'all can just buy that stuff. The people in Mississippi can buy just as good stuff as the people in New York City, sure. It's all magical unicorn dust.

       Sure, what I said is and has been/being done in rural areas all across the US. All done by private parties:

      <ol>
       <li>
        Water - drilled well
       </li>
       <li>
        Waste - septic tanks
       </li>
       <li>
        Roads - private maintained roads (plowed/paved/updated)
       </li>
       <li>
        Electricity - private solar panels and generators
       </li>
       <li>
        Education - private schools
       </li>
       <li>
        Healthcare - private practice

       so that unregulated fracking screws your water
so burying your poo and piss in your back yard is pretty efficient
not sure where these private maintained roads exist.
Solar panels and generators, why don't I just go sharpen a stick and hunt me a bear.
Private education huh, ok. Most private education is governed by a church...yes the word used was governed.
Private practice with doctors educated by the local witch doctor because you've done away with government education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, if you are into the off the grid thing, then go for it. I like what modern civilization has to offer, and it does a significant part of that with government, seen and unseen. But you win. Sure, it's a reasonably free country. Go build your cabin in the woods, dig a well to drink from, dig a hole to poop in (don't put them close together), edumacate those youngins with the best free education the free total capitalist economy minus any government has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh look at that highly organized and governed group of people coming to take all your crap. Oh, no standing army. That's a bitch ain't it? Oh no borders around your lands? May as well be a Native American. Yeah, your plan is brilliant. Simply cancel out all modern civilization. Cancel out the internet too, as that was a government program as well.

       I say abolish it completely, and remove government. We can rule ourselves. That may scare people, but that is the only way to true Freedom and Liberty. I'm a free man, dammit...Rules, but no rulers...

       how?  You need someone to investigate, someone to prosecute, someone to apprehend, someone to act as judge.  The community appoints these people, but these people, by definition, become the state.  Or do you expect the whole community to be part of all decisions regarding all infractions of the rules?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not against you.  I hate the state as it is.  But a state is absolutely necessary beyond small communities.  The problem is and has always been corruption.

       I think you're missing the point... We.. The people are already doing all these things, we just have a government that usually acts like a parent, taking a cut; if we just act like adults we can get the job done for less without giving a cut of the cost to government to tell us when we need a road fixed or a new road repaved

       Then we are just differing in semantics.  If we are already doing these things then the government IS us and it's just that the personnel currently occupying these posts are corrupt.  They are not supposed to be taking a cut beyond their salaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are taking a cut, as they are now, then that is the corruption.  It is not having a state that is the problem it is the corruption that we are not rooting out that is the problem.  We need more effective measures to root out corruption and severe deterrents.

       Each State has it's own rights to govern with the Federal Government being a "middle-man" (cut out the middle-man).   Removing the FG from the equation could save the Country trillions $$$.

       Sure, what I said is and has been/being done in rural areas all across the US. All done by private parties:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Water - drilled well
       </li>
       <li>
        Waste - septic tanks
       </li>
       <li>
        Roads - private maintained roads (plowed/paved/updated)
       </li>
       <li>
        Electricity - private solar panels and generators
       </li>
       <li>
        Education - private schools
       </li>
       <li>
        Healthcare - private practice
       </li>
      </ol>
