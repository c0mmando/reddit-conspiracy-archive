       Adding everything with Assange, the internet outage, whether he's been killed or tortured or remains in the embassy, the general craziness of the election in general, Trump being a plant, Comey deciding not to indict, then announcing 11 days to go and that they are reopening the case, the ongoing Wikileak revelations, CNN declaring reading wikileaks was illegal, the constant mutterings of Russians interfering with this election, the clear intention of Hillary to go to war with Russia if elected, the 600,000 e-mails Comey found, and how it all leads back to Weiner and Huma.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive said before, all of us here are well versed in how complicated conspiracies are.  look at JFK, or 9/11.  Those had thousands of moving parts involved.  Multiple parties and entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Ive never seen or heard of a conspiracy this insane and complex and involving so many different entities and factions within the government and in business.

       Its crazy.

       Check out Mark Passio if you haven't heard him already. Start at the beginning with his lectures. He used to be part of an occult group until he saw the light or whatever. He does a good job of breaking down the occult meaning and explaining the end game.

       So I wanted to preface this post with some ass-covering phrase like "put on your tin foil hats" or the like, however I think with the current state of affairs on our planet at the moment (Korean Billionaire Cult controlling their President, Blatant Inter-Agency corruption at all levels in United States and many other developments I am sure everyone on this subreddit is aware of) I honestly think we are past the point of having to justify our beliefs in ideas that would in the mainstream seem unsubstantiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB have always had a singular end game in mind. They want to galvanize humanity into believing that we face an extra-terrestrial threat which in reality in non-existent. All of the division and fear mongering perpetuated by recent world events (the U.S. election, escalating tensions between U.S. and Russia, etc.) is a precursor to a
       <strong>
        staged alien assault
       </strong>
       on humanity. They would have us believe that extraterrestrials were our enemies and that they pose a threat to us, and do so under the narrative of world unity in the effort to overcome this alien threat. World unity and peace could have been achieved generations ago if not for the workings of TPTB and their ultimate goal of posing humanity against the peaceful extraterrestrials who have been present since the dawn of our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steven Greer is an Ex-Emergency Room surgeon with multiple children in Ivy League schools who has dedicated his life to bringing the inner-workings of the Shadow Government to light to prevent their ultimate goal from coming to fruition. I'm writing this post because it is becoming increasingly clear through world events that TPTB have  started to put their plan into action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carol Rosin was a confidant of Wernher von Braun (German Scientist who basically created rocket technology and was later brought into service for the U.S. Government under Operation Paperclip) who speaks about Braun's concerns in the last years of his life about the global conspiracy to galvanize humanity against the ET threat and the implications it might have on our species. Linked is a video of her speaking at a 2001 National Press Club event held in D.C. lead by Steven Greer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ALLUuvsVkM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ALLUuvsVkM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She speaks about the progression of "enemies" TPTB would create, all leading up to the ET threat. She mentions Braun described that at first TPTB would set up the Russians as the enemy (Cold War) , then terrorism would follow (9/11 - Al-Qaeda), then the enemy would become "Rouge Nations" (ISIS, Syria), after this meteorites would be the point of concern, finally moving into the framing of ET's as the final threat to humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all based on information given by Braun in 1975. It appears he has been spot on thus far and recent events concerning the "meteorite threat" have already been surfacing on reddit and even MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below is a link for a post currently on the Top 50 on reddit detailing NASA's new "Intruder Alert" anti-asteroid defense system

      <p>
       Also Linked below is an article on MSN covering the "suicide" of Army Two Star General John Rossi, who had just been promoted to the head of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that anyone has all the answers, but based on the  life-long work Steven Greer (who I highly recommend anyone interested in this post look into) has done and the recent events on our planet, we have to be aware of the possibility that this could happen, and be able to recognize it for the fallacy that it is. Otherwise we could as a species could be labeled as a bunch of war-mongering apes by the intergalactic community.

       That's some quality imagery. Two or three already based on what? Certainly not any statements made by Greer. There has been no concrete timeline given, only the precursors leading up to the actual event.

       It's all just getting us ready to believe the truth.. I doubt most of us are ready to handle it. But, it is time to completely stop ignoring the logical and philosophical fallacies of mainstream dogma and start discerning for ourselves.

      <p>
       For example, if 911 happened as reported, talking about the mystery behind it wouldn't be taboo.

       Sure, I highly doubt it's part of any conspiracy (though I never like to rule anything out) but I find it funny, that's all. I think Trump having POTUS brother as his guest for the debate was clever and then MalikO's Twitter activity (and now he had a Reddit AMA) is funny.  It's a great PR move for both.

       It's the first, biggest, most difficult to ignore conspiracy to hit the information age at a time where only the most hard headed refuse to ask questions.

       The state of the world is just BEGGING people to become conscious leading to many more than just people who call themselves conspiracy theorists to look into and participate in the process.

       Is it been manufactured for entertainment by the king of reality TV Trump?

       um no he doesn't deserve that much credit. You think Trump is a mastermind of manipulating our reality? He's a salesman running for president, and has seized on the opportunities that Wikileaks, Project Veritas, NSA whistle blowers, Anonymous and others have provided him.

       I definitely think trump was given some information from someone it's like he can see what's comming next.

       the whole 400lb hacker thing and come to find out kimdotcom has been tweeting about taking down hillary since 2014. posting on Twitter about  how a anthony weiner was going to expose clintons emails to the world 15 months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it has to do with his involvement with Peter theil, more specifically Peter theils involvement with plantair technologies. Trump may have access to more databases and more power AI combing through it for connections than the NSA/CIA/DOD

       while funny to meme about, I'm a big fan of tesla and I don't think he was doing any big data/database/machine learning work back in the early 1900's. However it does show the Trump family has a thirst for hidden knowledge

       Well, if Trump pays enough money I suppose he might get some damaging info on his competitor, but Palantir is known to be a CIA funded startup from its beginning (In-Q-Tel). In other words, Palantir aligns itself with the current President/obama, shadow government, and therefore Hail Hillary, not the crazy "Mexicans are murderers" yelling ginger incumbent.

       Trump had anthony weiner in sights since 2012-2013, there is a interview with him about 9/11 where he says he doesn't know how twin towers could fall because how they were built, his uncle had research notes from Nicola Tesla.

       Also anyone else find it slightly bizarre that it's some people that are pretty much pegged as neo-cons are now pulling sources from hacking groups and Wikileaks? I mean Wikileaks when it started was pretty much a creation of the same counter-culture of the time that created the whole Anon and Occupy thing, and considered to have the anti-Bush sentiment.

       I think those two terms of Obama increased their suspicions which in turn broadened what they consider acceptable information sources. Those suspicions, Along with the sources they have been listening to over the years have carried over to anything or anyone against their ideology.

       I have a feeling that things are going to get even crazier in the next week. The wild predictions that have been made for months about Obama "cancelling the election" are starting to sound plausible.

       If the establishment thinks Trump is going to win (and send a lot of them to jail), a way will be found to stop it (Hillary dropping out the day before the election, or the US accidentally starting a war with Russia - no excuse is too far fetched at this point).

       A looming constitutional crisis a society deeply divided along political, social, economic and ethnic lines. The whole thing is a fucking powder keg! I've heard the term social unrest a few times during the last few weeks but full scale civil wars have been fought over a hell of a lot less. All it would take would be one clear catalysing event. The thought is absolutely chilling.

       We should already be up in arms. I think that's the end-game here: To demonstrate to the rest of the world how successful the American Oligarchy truly is. To say that they can blatantly rig an election and basically spit on the constitution, yet the people as a whole are doing nothing, clearly spells out to the rest of the world that we're nothing but fodder.

       Sometimes I feel like it's all one big fake reality we live in. I mean even the big "blow up in your face" revelations are because of a man named fucking WEINER, exposing his goddamn WEINER!!!! It's like the puppet masters are sitting back laughing in our faces like "look we'll even make it seem obvious this is all an act by using a weiner for such purposes" Idk.......I mean its probably coincidental Im sure theres not literal overlords pulling our strings like this, but sometimes this world, this life and our reality seems so uncanny to me that everyday life for me is just so weird.

       I had similiar thougth come to my mind when Obama was "elected".
Think about it americas two recent greatest "enemies" Hussein&amp;Osama
and your new presidents name is Barack Hussein Obama. Maybe its the tptb behind the curtains mocking us slaves for our stupidity and gullibility, or its just coincidence.

       Because usually they're in synch. I don't think they are right now. I think we're seeing a battle to rule the world among secret societies as the Skull and Bones / Bush faction loses its grip. Hopefully the new guys are less of a sex and death cult.

       I would mostly agree with that. Though it's a slippery slope as society replaces physical love with lust. But it still beats the horrific shit the S&amp;B crowd is up to.

       I think Trump likes fucking hot chicks, even when he's married. I don't believe he's a rapist or pedophile, though that's what's been spun at us.
      </p>
      <p>
       No paper trail of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein on the Lolita Express or on Orgy Island. Trump threw Epstein out of his Florida resort. Bill Clinton was there dozens of times.

       I'm not going to vote for Trump and I'm not a fan. But compared to the Clintons, the Bush family....yeah, I'll take him.

       Well, yes, but I think what we are seeing here it's just one slice of the overall larger picture. The United States is no longer a democracy. It is a full-on kleptocracy, and if the leaks continue, although this is indeed crazy, I think that a couple years from now we could be looking back on this and realizing that this is only the beginning. We are only just now starting to scratch the surface.

       It is crazy. I am no longer convinced Trump is a plant though. I thought so originally, but the way he is attacking so personally now, and the fact that the emails showed Hillary and camp wanted him (or cruz or carson) made me think his nomination benefited her with Trump being unwitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could have been a lot easier on her. She would have just been able to wait it out before this FBI move, and then people would have come around on the emails after the election and claim they didn't understand they were real when they voted for Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is indeed the craziest cycle ever. My dad was already talking about the movie that will eventually be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dirty business and making it up as you go makes it splinter off crazy. It isn't exactly being executed as brilliantly as some conspiracy theorists (the every move is planned type). Yeah they are corrupt, yeah there is an agenda, but some people give them waaaay more credit than the establishment deserves.
It is a billionaire money fight, that is it. It is not planned like a perfect play.

       That is possible I guess, but all of the things he has said, it made her look bad. reminding people of her corruptions, wikileaks mentions, the Bill victims. He wouldn't go that hard and make her voters question if she was pulling his strings. She is barely a person if you read her emails she is like a personality less sociopath. She wouldnt go for that and it does her no favors. Same as the FBI, people say that is to steal wikileaks attention, but it has hurt her maybe worse than wikileaks.

       I think their objective with the election has always been to get the one of their guys with the most public support behind the wheel. And Trump is now that guy and he's gained a lot of that support by throwing Hillary under the bus. So it may have been intentional to bring her down. Throw one crooked politician to the people so to speak.

       I don't think that is the case. Not everything is faked/staged. If that was the case some of the details and superflous acts would make no sense. Like the GOP not wanting Trmp. Sure you could say t hat makes him the underdog, but why tear down and build up these people when you already know one of them will be elected.
I don't believe in some perfect functioning illuminati. No doubt there is some shadow govt figures and billionaires of all countries invest in candidates, but to think they would get along and work in harmony is silly. There would be just as much problem and infighting in that organization. That is why I consider eletions more of a billionaire money fight as I have said. There are genuine things that happen, and a billionaire could throw their hat in the ring against the elites wishes if they had the capital.

       I think that is a stretch. I think they takeover was around Nixon. If you hear Nixon's tapes and hear him being candid you can tell he is a dude under pressure and he is actually a bit endearing (crazy how Nixon is looking better these days). I think the democracy was under non stop attack from the Business plot up and it eventually succeeded. The Kennedy's both gettting killed a few years apart. Shows at least half the govt wasn't on board with people who were clearly powerful enough to get into office. Then seeing the Bushes get in with their father being involved in the business plot, that says a lot to me. Prescott should have been imprisoned and fined instead they let him keep his wealth and gave him a stern "don't do that" which makes me think he succeeded and his family wealth catapulted his son and grandson into high positions and eventually the oval office.

       Read Miles Mathis 'The hidden king' on the Kennedy murders also. It concurs with Quigley. My research points to that Quigley is right. So either the rabbit hole is that deep indeed or I'm a bit too synical. But I actually think this shit show stretches all the way back to the hijacking of Federal Reserve and even longer outside US history

       The tweet that Trump sent out saying close to "huma has the emails and her pr hubby weiner will tell the world" posted summer of 2015 is what I'm referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought about this since posting and can now see multiple scenarios in which Trump may have known well ahead of time what would happen whether or not the re-tweet is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       My single solitary hope now is that he is not what I think he is, and that he's gonna cuck every single one of these motherfuckers out because he's exactly as egotistical as he puts off and he wants to leave behind a far greater legacy than than the farce he's made of himself so far. LoL. I've had people call me a pessimist but I like to think of myself as an optimistic realist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really though Donald, what greater legacy is there than being the hero of the free world? Many people would attempt to do it if given the opportunity and against such overwhelming odds, almost all would fail. If you are half the egomaniacal, patriotic, honest to a fault, asshole of a real man you pretend to be then you'll follow through and deliver America back to its people.

       Meh it was a retweet and everyone knows Huma and Weiner are a bit of a pr couple. The Clintons set them up together.

       She wants to go in with people believing she won and there was the support there to explain that win. She doesn't want to go in despised and being doubted. I don't think she would be owing Trump any favors to do this on her behalf.

       What we need is to destroy these two parties and split them into several less radical parties. It will force the country to become more intelligent and then we need to kick out super pacs and unions giving money, criminalize media collusion, and work on ensuring our votes can't be rigged. Also making propaganda illegal again should be a number one priority that should have never happened in a democratic republic which we of course, no longer are.

       I don't think he works for her either. That would be a really tough sale at this point.

       Making a statement like that a year ago that is so specific to what's happened in the last week is unsettling and my first thought was a far deeper rabbit hole than we have witnessed so far. Like, "The whole show is scripted" deep.
      </p>

       Before he died in an ineptly performed 'suicide,' the young journalist Danny Casolaro was working on a book that he claimed tied together many of the 'gates' and 'miniscandals' surrounding the Bush presidency. The book identified the web which tied all the scandals together as the "Octopus," a mythical creature with tentacles stretching everywhere. Perhaps the birth of the Octopus lies in the 1980 Presidential election; and its growth occurred under the eight years of the Reagan presidency. Casolaro soon found that the Octopus may have consisted of a 'shadow government' apparatus that went back even further than Bush and Reagan. But what's left of his notes seem primarily to focus on events in the 80s and 90s.

       The most coherent argument I can make is that it's some sort of weird infighting within the control establishment - I don't have proof but it's the best I can figure. I don't see a coherent game plan, it feels like perhaps things are driven by a sense of urgency and desperation. I'm cautiously optimistic that we are witnessing the first major loss of control.

       I think it's the most insane conspiracy we've ever heard because the leaking of all the info about it is part of the conspiracy itself. If we had this much info about MLK, RFK, JFK, Iraq, Vietnam, etc we'd see that there are many that are equally crazy.

       You have always been told its all a lie, a smoke screen in front of mirrors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Truth is that everything you believed but never had proof of just got thrown in your face.   Child sex rings, satanic worshiping leaders, trading with the "enemy", self literal creation of that enemy, funding both sides.  The lies go on forever.  They are not one sided, there is ONE coin with 2 sides.  Remember the BUSHES are still the CLINTONS friends if you picked a side of the coin you messed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats ok though, you can still redeem yourself.  You can still be forgiven.  But those Powers That Be, they are lost.  Good riddance to them.

       If there is an eternity I would not want to spend it in the same place as them.

       It's pretty simple. To hide the truth you bury it in layers of conspiracy so no one can really believe any of it. Soooo, Why is it all so crazy? To overshadow the real issues. Now the problem is "these Yahoo's running for office" instead of "Taking money out of politics" or even "looming water crisis".

       That's half of it. The other half is the really interesting part. The most popular religions share just enough of the truth for people to bite on, but they mask the greater truth in trivialities. The religions people follow smother true spirituality, and these people have no idea. They think they are doing it. They think they are tapping into and growing their spirituality, but they are lead astray.

       what if clinton has been a gop plant? Her private positions are anything but progressive, the gop might have the emails all along and they told comey to let her go so that the dems wont have time to change their candidate. The gop thought they had the election in the bag and everything was going as planed...until trump came along. It also explains why they took every chance to bring him down even months after the convertion.

       What about the revelations in South Korea? If someone said 1 month ago that 8 billionaires control the SK president with almost everything she says and does would you believe it? Well, it's a fact now and the MSM will barely cover this story and if they do cover it they downplay for what it is.

       All this said but nothing will happen. In Europe they would have millions take to the streets in protest. There would be sit in strikes and yes even violence. Here we bend over grin and say not so hard next time. The sheep are to brain washed to do anything here.

       Also anyone else find it slightly bizarre that it's some people that are pretty much pegged as neo-cons are now pulling sources from hacking groups and Wikileaks? I mean Wikileaks when it started was pretty much a creation of the same counter-culture of the time that created the whole Anon and Occupy thing, and considered to have the anti-Bush sentiment.
