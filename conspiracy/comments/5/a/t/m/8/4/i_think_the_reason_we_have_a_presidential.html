    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think he was chosen either I was just trying to appeal to this sub. Google, &quot;this video will get trump elected&quot; and you&#39;ll see he&#39;s talked about running for almost 40 years. He wasn&#39;t chosen.
 I used to hate Donald trump but once he. Exams a politician and I heard his message, I fell in love with the mans Passion for America. He is 1 in a billion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not such a fan. I remember when he entered the race in June 2015, I thought if he stayed long enough to be in the debates, it would be entertaining. I never thought we would be in this position. </p>

<p>He&#39;s had 15 or 16 months to learn to shut his mouth, and he can&#39;t do it.  I assume he hired someone who understands the campaign business and they told him &quot;stay off of twitter&quot;, but he doesn&#39;t. I don&#39;t think he &quot;knows more about isis than the generals do&quot;, and I can&#39;t stand what he said about John McCain. </p>

<p>All I know for sure is I won&#39;t be voting for Clinton. I&#39;ll probably vote for Johnson, but there&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll blink at the last moment. </p>

<p>My comment on his generals statement, in context he said it as in he knows more than what obama is telling his generals to do. He knows as much as General Flynn does. Flynn has been his military intelligence man for well over a year </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of sounding naive, democracy actually <strong><em>can</em></strong> be a beneficial thing, in some contexts.  You just have to be intelligent about it, as with anything else.  Democracy requires a genuinely educated and intelligent public in order to work, first and foremost.  Idiots don&#39;t care about keeping themselves informed, and because democracy is participatory by definition, people need to constantly know what is going on.</p>

<p>The other problem with democracy is that it does not scale to large populations.  The reason why is because with a participatory system, accountability is essential, and human beings can only neurologically keep track of probably thirty different relationships at once.  In terms of population and actual size, classical Athens would likely be considered a good sized country town by modern standards.  They didn&#39;t need to come up with a system that would work with a truly large population, because they didn&#39;t have one themselves; and Athens is the basis of all of the pro-democratic propaganda that you hear.</p>

<p>For running small to medium groups of intelligent people, though, as long as everyone knows each other, then sure.  Democracy&#39;s great.  It just doesn&#39;t work for continents very well, that&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the point.  Jack did America a tremendous favour by going first.  Because he did, the public have learned to expect the shadow men to assassinate leaders who they legitimately vote for, and who act in their interests.  If so much as a hair on Trump&#39;s head is harmed while he is in office, the public will know who to blame, and that is who they will blame.</p>

<p>Why do you think he has been so emphatic about how corrupt everything is, during his own campaign?  It&#39;s because it is what the people want to hear, yes; but at the same time, it is for his own safety.  A prudent psychopath will be less likely to try and assassinate someone, when the potential victim is publically pointing his finger at said psychopath, and telling people on national television that he fully expects the psychopath to do it.</p>
