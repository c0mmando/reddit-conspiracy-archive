    <div class="md"><p>Doritos only coat one side of their chips and also throw in some ratio of 100% uncoated chips into the bag. The dust gets everywhere on the bag thus only <em>sort of</em> coating these other chips. This, in turn, saves them billions but also plays on the innate human propensity to think &quot;that one wasn&#39;t as good, but surely the next one will be amazing!&quot; no matter if you&#39;re the sort that like the over-coated ones or the undercoated ones.</p>

<p>Ben and Jerry&#39;s learned this and employs a similar technique in assembling their tubs of ice cream, strategically placing <em>just enough</em> for you to want more, just in case you might get a glob of chocolate <em>and</em> cherry only to be met with only vanilla.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are going to war if Hillary gets into office, and it may be too late as it is.  There is going to be a massive attack domestically that will then be blamed on either Russia, or guns.  Russia being their first option, but at this point, a lot of people know they were setting Russia up these past couple months.</p>

<p>They may use this before election is over, but if it doesn&#39;t happen before the end of year, I doubt it will happen (as far as the domestic attack).   We are still going to be on the brink of war with Russia due to plans being set in motion that I am unsure can be undone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still unsettling to know that only a single nuke can do that much damage. It nullifies any safety you could have had with a bunker. I&#39;m sure the force of the explosion could do something, like cave in a bunker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s mine: Trump is working with Putin to win the election. Putin is pulling Comey&#39;s strings, and Trump thinks it&#39;s to make the US more stable because Hillary would destroy the earth, but the truth is that Putin just wants to put someone like himself in office here so that his government looks more legitimate and the world&#39;s view of democracy is tarnished - thereby paving the way for the return of the Soviet Union which he calls the dissolution of the greatest tragedy of the 20th century.</p>

<p>It would explain why they&#39;ve been helping him by hacking the DNC. It might even explain Comey&#39;s attempts at manipulating the vote with contentless open letters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this has been discovered yet but I did formulate it myself.</p>

<p>Take the famous Simpsons 911 picture where Lisa is holding the magazine where it says New York and 911 side by side. </p>

<p><a href="http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Simpsons-911.png">http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Simpsons-911.png</a></p>

<p>Now take the picture and rotate it 90 degrees to the right</p>

<p><a href="https://s16.postimg.org/6tjnck911/simpsons_911_sideways.jpg">https://s16.postimg.org/6tjnck911/simpsons_911_sideways.jpg</a></p>

<p>It appears to portray the Twin Towers actually being destroyed.</p>

<p>The windows of the bus look like a very tall building being viewed from above where the perspective is making the top look bigger while looking down to the bottom.</p>

<p>The most eerie part of it is how the silhouette of the driver turns into the gaping hole that the WTC suffered. The placement of the damage is also accurate to the real damage. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re saying that enough people had knowledge up front of 9/11 that it extended to the writers of The Simpsons (who probably do not consider themselves rich, and I would probably not consider powerful) - they knew about 9/11 at least 4 years in advance, wrote it into a script, gave animators specific instructions about how the towers should look and the placement of the bus so it looks like the towers being destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A word up front: I&#39;m not trying to be a jerk here. I like hearing other points of view. And when I disagree, I like to try to understand the thought process.  So if me questioning this comes off harsh, I&#39;m not trying to upset you...</p>

<p>Good call, I&#39;m not an expert on what goes on behind the scenes at the Simpsons. Since I don&#39;t think you are either, let&#39;s take a look:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated The Simpsons in the United States. In 1992, the show&#39;s production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to Film Roman,[80] who continue to animate the show as of 2012. (Source wiki)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That episode looms like it aired in 1997, so it looks like Film Roman was handling the animation. It looks like Film Roman is an American company headquartered in California (I swore this show was animated over seas, but I appear to be mistaken).</p>

<p>But let&#39;s say the hell with that, let&#39;s lower the number of people involved (that&#39;s a big thing for me the more people know, the more likely it is somebody will talk). Let&#39;s assime Matt Groening said &quot;I&#39;ve got this one&quot;, and wrote and animated the whole episode by himseelf, because he knew that 9/11 was coming, at least 4 years in advance, and wanted to foreshadow it with this magazine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Groening identifies himself as agnostic[90][91] and a liberal[92] and has often made campaign contributions to Democratic Party candidates. (Source wiki)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>^ this Matt Groening had knowledge of 9/11 in advance, and rather than warn the world that 9/11 was coming, and we were about to get into two wars in places where we shouldn&#39;t meddle..
 He wrote an episode where they go to NYC  (I guess, I really just looked up the date, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve seen this one or not), and Lisa holding a magazine sideways foreshadows the towers coming down.</p>

<p>So I ask again: does this seem reasonable to you? It doesn&#39;t have to be Matt Groening, plug in whatever Simpsons writer you like, the simplest thing is if one person does it all, which would probably raise some eyebrows as somebody else had been handling the animation for years, but let&#39;s just not focus on that.  Even without that, does this really seem reasonable to you?  If so, why? Because this one really looks unlikely to me.</p>

<p>Dna may not exist? Why?</p>

<p>This was my initial theory due to a misunderstanding of how electron microscopes work.</p>

<p>According to mainstream science, electron microscopes function by shooting a beam of electrons at samples.</p>

<p>The sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA helix is negatively charged, so in theory any electrons would be repulsed by the DNA backbone and would not be able to pass through.</p>

<p>As I recently discovered, electrons probably do not exist and electron microscopes function as a dielectric scanner, they don&#39;t shoot electrons.</p>

<p>DNA is not the only inheritance molecule. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Spliceosomes reconfigure pre-mRNA molecules into different arrangements, so that one gene can produce many different kinds of proteins. This is called <a href="http://bitesizebio.com/10148/what-is-alternative-splicing-and-why-is-it-important/">alternative splicing.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Chaperone proteins determine how macromolecules (including other proteins) are folded. This affects their final function in the body.</p></li>
<li><p>Inheritance can also occur through non-materialistic means in the form of <a href="http://www.sheldrake.org/research/morphic-resonance">morphic resonance</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea of determining a person’s race through their DNA relies on the incorrect assumption that differences in DNA alone, is responsible for all variation between the species that we see.</p>

<p>DNA is not the sole carrier of genetic information; therefore DNA testing cannot determine a persons race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really a theory of mine, I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s a conspiracy, more of a cover up.  But from the night it happened, I never believed the official explanation of TWA 800.  I&#39;m not sure what happened, but I think something was covered up.  This isn&#39;t anything ground breaking, but as much as I enjoy reading about them, there aren&#39;t a ton of these theories I believe in.  This one I believe something happened. We probably shot it down accidentally.  There&#39;s a pretty good documentary about it on Netflix, I forget what it&#39;s called.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve been wondering if the pipeline explosion in Alabama is meant to cause a gas shortage and keep voter turnout down, but I don&#39;t see how it favors one side over the other, so that&#39;s probably not it.</p>

<p>Plants are green because of a certain property of plants, chlorophyll. I&#39;d wager alien plants are alot like earth plants, nature and mutation would explain obvious differences, but at its heart is functioning basic chemistry.</p>

<p>You could apply that to intelligent species, if intelligence is defined as being able to produce and use tools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t really a theory. Just a crazy idea that occurred to me last week some time:</p>

<p>The USA sent all its manufacturing overseas. Very little is &quot;Made in the USA&quot; anymore. This started with NAFTA decades ago.</p>

<p>Decades ago, they already knew about carbon and global warming. They just weren&#39;t talking about it.</p>

<p>If someone(s) high up was playing the loooooong game, they&#39;d see that manufacturing, shipping, the whole she-bang would be put on the ropes once everyone got off their asses and decided to cut carbon.</p>

<p>(Insert lots of other &quot;and ifs...&quot; here. No time to type this all.)</p>

<p>So &quot;they&quot; decide to dump manufacturing off on other countries and get a jump start on trying to figure out/build whatever a post-carbon economy will be. They sent manufacturing overseas so we wouldn&#39;t be stuck holding the ugly baby when everyone simultaneously realized that old school manufacturing needed to go the way of the dinosaur.</p>
