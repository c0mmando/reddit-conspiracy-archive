<p>She used to be on the campaign plane, Seizure Force One. Other press was on the bus aswell.</p>

<p>Is the Clinton campaign in full-on panic mode? Only her top aides allowed?</p>

<p>She has been off the rails at her rallies for the past few days. Is she drinking heavily?</p>

<p>Why is her press following her around in a bus now, when the whole point of the plane was for her manufactured &quot;press conferences&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still skeptical that that is what was found.</p>

<p>There are two sources saying that, and neither is particularly trustworthy (to my knowledge).</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t we heard from an NYPD officer?  No comments on anything?  No going to the press?  </p>

<p>They would be posting somewhere about it.  They simply aren&#39;t and I have to take those allegations with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t believe some of the Clintons are Pedophiles, I believe Trump and Bill are, Huma/Hillary may be participants as well, but Bill and Trump are guaranteed Pedophiles (IMO)</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t believe that was what was found on Weiners computer.  I think the Emails were, and Comey, facing political pressure, decided to use the chance to reopen the case.</p>

<p>We will see with time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t like Bill Clinton when he was president, and Hillary Clinton scares the hell out of me... I don&#39;t know if I buy the pedophile angle.  Does he have a weakness for women? Seems to. But the only claims I&#39;ve heard of pedophilia are stories about somebody&#39;s private island.  Pedophiles don&#39;t operate that way. They get locked up for being too close to a school. They get caught with porn on their computers when they take them to Best Buy (or the UK equivalent).  They seem unable to help themselves. </p>

<p>For all Clinton&#39;s escapades in this country (which include accusations of rape, that people just seem to let go), I&#39;m not aware of any credible accusations in this country. And it seems like he propositioned women everywhere he went.  Am I missing something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how pedophiles operate?</p>

<p>In all seriousness, the pedophiles you see caught are not wealthy, when they are wealthy, they can buy the children, instead of the porn.</p>

<p>They are also morons... &quot;Joe Dinglehead ordered DVD&#39;s with his credit card number to his home address.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Girlfriend of Jimmy Nonuts contacted police after finding child pornography on Nonuts&#39;s computer.&quot;</p>

<p>Very rarely do they catch people committing the crimes, usually it is years later, because the children will feel shame or guilt, or some kind of connection to the perp.  30% I believe is the number, of all children being abused in America.  That means, statistically, almost 1/3rd of any class you were in as a child, was being molested or raped.  Those are people without money, once money is involved it becomes much different.  Once one comes forward the rest will gain courage, and a bunch will claim things happened, that really didn&#39;t.   </p>

<p>I am of the opinion that Bill and Trump flew to Orgy Island to rape kids.  Could it have been something different?  A business meeting?  Yes, it absolutely could be.  It just seems like an odd place to conduct business, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just as likely that it was a hedonistic orgy with girls above the age of consent.</p>

<p>My point about pedophiles is that it doesn&#39;t seem to be something that they can turn off.  It would seem unlikely to me that Bill Clinton has all these affairs, propositions other women (and in one case I heard that I believed just makes them feel creepy and uncomfortable) but occasionally, when he can get away with it, he rapes a child.</p>

<p>I could be wrong. It&#39;s just how it seems to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because you are thinking he is a true pedophile, and not someone who enjoys both.</p>

<p>What, and I can&#39;t remember where I read this - sorry, I seem to recall, is that people with power and money are more likely to commit illegal acts, because they put themselves above others, and this includes sex with children.</p>

<p>Being a true pedophile means you can only get <del>hard</del> aroused (women can be predators too) from kids, I don&#39;t think that is the case for most of them.  I think most are primarily in one direction, and dabble in the other.</p>

<p>Think psychology, it&#39;s not so much a true or false, as it is a scale.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also more a series of scales, since people aren&#39;t black and white sexually</p>

<p>Example:  (0 being none, 10 being alot)</p>

<p>Feet: 5 </p>

<p>Clothed sex: 10</p>

<p>hairstyle: 1</p>

<p>fat: 7</p>
