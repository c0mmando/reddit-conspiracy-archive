        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As we know, if the government were to make a move to confiscate guns(like during katrina), they will likely shut down the internet/phone services in an attempt to stop information from being spread. Sadly, if this were to occur, we would not have any warning of this happening, and by the time we realized it, it would be far too late to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Therefor, we must brainstorm ideas on how we can spread information during a internet/phone blackout.</p>

<p>A few ideas that I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Long range radios(Talking 100 miles). Get a radio like this, and have another one with a relative or a friend who you can warn if this is happening, and only if this is happening. If your friend has a friend he wants to warn, you can have him tell his friend(assuming said friend has a long range radio). You can form a chain like this across the country with enough people. It would be similar to a radio version of Tor. Consider learning morse code so you can send a signal with a low battery. If your battery goes low(to the point you can&#39;t transmit voice) it will still make a &quot;static&quot; sound. You can use that static to send codes. <a href="http://qrznow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/morse_code.jpg">Here&#39;s a cheatsheet you can print out</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Also, you can make radio&#39;s fairly easily with a little know-how, but I don&#39;t know how much the range is.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using the above, if your friend has a connection(probably not) you can have him make a hail mary post anywhere he can(There probably won&#39;t be much working if anything. I think the dns &quot;attack&quot; could have been practice for this.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you can&#39;t post it, snap a picture of the raid(if you&#39;re both lucky and unlucky enough to be close to one) but preferably a video of it happening so it&#39;s harder to discount. Get the fuck out of there(with a relatively quiet car), get far enough away that you feel OK, and start spreading the word as fast as you can. Although if you&#39;re close enough to do this, you&#39;re probably fucked over, because they will likely have roads shut down.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to get to a rural area. Tell the farmers/rednecks about it, even if they don&#39;t believe you just tell them. Gun confiscation would likely start from a city and move out, as there are far more people in a city.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t go out and try to fight by yourself, do everything to spread the word about what&#39;s happening. You won&#39;t do much by yourself, but an entire town&#39;s worth of people could. We would lose if the information didn&#39;t get out.</p></li>
<li><p>This would likely happen at night so if you have the money(lol) invest in some military grade night vision(as the ones you can normally buy are really shoddy/bad).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: Added Suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>USB Drives with information on it. This would probably work better after the fact, however, to spread information regarding resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>HAM Radio</p></li>
<li><p>Firechat (P2P Phone chat VIA Wifi and Bluetooth.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://hyperboria.net/">Meshnets</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry, I feel like the only one that&#39;s viable here is the Long Range Radio, but since it&#39;s expensive I feel that it&#39;s not very useful.</p>

<p><em>This is mostly due to a (albeit unreliable) article that gave reports of an ICE officer suiciding and leaving an extended note about what is going to happen soon. The note includes unarming the populace as well as putting &quot;terrorists&quot;(or resistance) in camps, gassing federal prisons to make room in this case. Just a good idea to be ready to spread information</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>USB sticks. They&#39;re dirty cheap, information proliferates quickly and it spreads like wildfire. It may seem like over simplification but Its proof of concept has already been seen to be highly effective in Cuba as a means of pirate media distribution. It&#39;s actually turned into quite a large organised industry over there. So buy a couple of hundred put some new movie on it along with a bunch of important files give them away!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that&#39;s the trade that you have to make going down the road of pretty much any non decentralised information network from open wifi access to meshnets or decentralised servers to USB sticks. Besides it&#39;s up to users to be responsible for their own security imho. Bottom line is that in times of need where information is spread these types of systems really do come into their own when there is nothing else.</p>

<p>Thattag makes it ez to find relevent posts and includes a date so you can see only ones from recent dates.   The xzs at end just makes it more unlikely to be a coincidental post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If all else fails smoke signals were successfully used by romans to send messages over thousands of miles in minutes  via relay towers.</p>

<p>Print yourself a copy of morse  code  right now justto hace it.</p>

<p>A random thing that might be worth doing givne the tensions with russia and all the talk about emps.</p>

<p>Buy a metal container like a small trash can or metal popcorn can. Wrap a spare cell phone and radio in aluminum foil and a small solar panel for charging them and put inside and leave it shut. It stops emps from destroying all your electronic inside.</p>

<p>Also flying rc drones with usb drives would be an easy way to move data fast to wide locations without personally traveling.  The modern equivelent of carrier pigeons. Many drones can be programmed to fly and land without human assistance via gps waypoints. They can snap photos and video on the way. They can broadcast live video back to the pilot too. Not legal in the us to do that but if war with russia broke out or there was a disaster it might be great way to get info from one place to another. I dont recommend a quadcopter unless you only want to fly short distances. Get a electric plane wing style drone. They can fly a hundred miles.</p>
