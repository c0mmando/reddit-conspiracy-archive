    <div class="md"><p>No I call myself a religious free zone, and I don&#39;t know much about any of the religions anymore and that after a several years long trek and hundreds of books  and deep  conversations, one day I realized all religions first require denial of self, and I dropped it all and began diligently erasing all religious based ideas and beliefs I held.  </p>

<p>I am a secular humanist who believes we should honor, each other and all that exits equally. I believe there is only one thing, I call that energy thought or intent. Instead of denial of self I work at staying in harmony with the smoother flowing steams of that intent and the joke is on me since that is only a different version of denial of self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well its the paradox but iffin it works for you then thats exactly what you need from it....</p>

<p>i dont like rules persay [of course i am kinda attached to my own  rules but ] religion always seems so ocd with the rules of what you can do what you cant do and who is allowed to and who isnt  so i just follow my own path and try to be respectful </p>

<p>to me the internet is like a breathing akashic record everyone has some experience to offer i love that i can connect to so many people who i would never have met under any other circumstance yet here we are </p>

<p>Ignore the bottom stuff, but this thread was made roughly an hour after his internet got shut off. The only thing missing is the thread that had the periscope showing armed guards/soldiers entering the embassy extremely fast, almost like they were on a mission, they were in and out in under 5 minutes apparently. </p>
