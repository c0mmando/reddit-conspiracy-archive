       WELCOME TO THE UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s what you need to know…
      </p>

       It is a fucking timeline of events
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Trump's dad vetted by FBI Director in the 1960's
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Trump's uncle was old-school FBI (Tesla)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The FBI became compromised/infiltrated via wet criminality - get people involved in your crimes so they can't expose you (Ethics Code)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) What an investigation should look like (Manual)
      </p>
      <p>
       5) What the Clinton investigation looked like (4 pages!?)
      </p>
      <p>
       6) What the Petraus investigation looked like (bazillion pages) The above 3 prove corruption within FBI, and Federal Government as a Whole, has been 100% accomplished by ~2014
      </p>
      <p>
       7) May 2015 Baltimore - Beginning of Soros funded attempted FEDERALIZATION of police. This is an attempt to usurp States rights by the Federal Govt./Soros. Basically, this is the LAST ELECTION, LAST CHANCE - Trump has been pushing this for a long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Donald J. Trump made honoraria FBI asset - he was RECRUITED by patriots within the FBI to do what he's doing. His uncle was well respected. They knew his dad. He's clean. They needed him. That's from the FBI Honoraria tweet. Trump has been many steps ahead of the game this entire time, like a prophet. Connect the dots. Dr. Steve Pieczenik is the direct link from Intelligence Agencies to Trump, he has been advising Trump for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) How operations run by FBI but outside of FBI look (Trump campaign - Trump has been getting insider info all along - the Tweeted document shows it's legal to give him classified info in this case) -
       <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637205134970880">
        https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637205134970880
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Stay-Behind Agents - activation of patriots embedded in enemy occupied territory within other agencies of Federal Govt. to help. Secret Service. NSA. Etc.

       I'm not normally one to be led by these things without outside verification and decent sources, stuff like this always feels a bit, er wacky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that being said let me say that even prior to your post I had the same exact same notion when it came to the order, apparent theme, and possible sub contextual message of these document releases. It really did stick out like a sore thumb to me too! I really think you're on to something here!
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm finding most frustrating is following up. Aside from cross referencing to the insinuations such as you have I'm not quite sure where to take it from here or what we can really infer from it.

       FBI is coming into the open about all of the above, via this tweeting and Dr. Pieczenik - It means WE are part of a legitimate FBI by-the-book Operation against DOMESTIC enemies. We are the resistance. Rogue FBI can't do it without us or they will be seen as biased.

       Rumor has it that this group faction of the cabal- Rockefeller ,Bush, will not submit to the external pressures of a shifting world. It may mean dark times ahead but for not much longer as the whole reason for the shift is to alter everything.  It's already happening that government and power is being altered and they don't want to let go of it. Hillary's obsessive ambition to be president is a perfect example. In light of the all the negative being exposed about her she won't give it up. This is only going to lead us to probe into their world and discover the darkness. This will be traumatizing to many people. Healing then can happen. And many alterations to our nation can begin to put us back on a path of prosperity.

       So you're saying that Trump is working with insurgent forces within the FBI?  The FBI is the most assertive and effective force of infiltrators and agent provocateurs on the planet.

       I wouldn't be surprised at all if this was true, but it doesn't mean what you think it means.

        It is a fucking timeline of events
1) Trump's dad vetted by FBI Director in the 1960's
2) Trump's uncle was old-school FBI (Tesla)
3) The FBI became compromised/infiltrated via wet criminality - get people involved in your crimes so they can't expose you (Ethics Code)
4) What an investigation should look like (Manual)
5) What the Clinton investigation looked like (4 pages!?)
6) What the Petraus investigation looked like (bazillion pages) The above 3 prove corruption within FBI, and Federal Government as a Whole, has been 100% accomplished by ~2014
7) May 2015 Baltimore - Beginning of Soros funded attempted FEDERALIZATION of police. This is an attempt to usurp States rights by the Federal Govt./Soros. Basically, this is the LAST ELECTION, LAST CHANCE - Trump has been pushing this for a long time now.
8) Donald J. Trump made honoraria FBI asset - he was RECRUITED by patriots within the FBI to do what he's doing. His uncle was well respected. They knew his dad. He's clean. They needed him. That's from the FBI Honoraria tweet. Trump has been many steps ahead of the game this entire time, like a prophet. Connect the dots. Dr. Steve Pieczenik is the direct link from Intelligence Agencies to Trump, he has been advising Trump for decades.
9) How operations run by FBI but outside of FBI look (Trump campaign - Trump has been getting insider info all along - the Tweeted document shows it's legal to give him classified info in this case) -

        10) Stay-Behind Agents - activation of patriots embedded in enemy occupied territory within other agencies of Federal Govt. to help. Secret Service. NSA. Etc.
