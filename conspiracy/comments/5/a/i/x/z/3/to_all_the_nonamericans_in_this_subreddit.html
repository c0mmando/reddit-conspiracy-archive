       I understand that this subreddit has turned into Americans constantly re posting the same ideas (Clinton is bad) and yes it may get repetitive and annoying for some non-americans in this subreddit. And id assume some of you dont fully understand what were up against here.. This next president election determines the rest of ALL OF OUR LIVES. Concerning to war with Russia and civil war. And simply "Standing up and fighting for our rights" shit some of you think we can do... We cant. Example the North Dakota pipeline protest. Or any other protest made in america. It always leads to police brutality. The government knows were all waking up slowly. Id imagine they dont like to that much and are ready to do something serious about it. While the rest of america is so brian washed into pro Clinton or just simply avoiding any issues in our country to begin with. So like i stated before, this subreddit is a huge communication system for us Americans to try to make a change in our soon to be doomed country.

       They didn't practice Jade Helm domestic military exercises for nothing, and they didn't institute Executive Order 13603 to suspend Constitutional Rights in time of martial law because they wish for American's to use our 1st amendment rights.

       Your country is not doomed. You fail to realize that you live in a place of free speech, diversity and relative freedoms. Yes, you live in an oligarchy, but that is an issue of unchecked capitalism rather than a US issue. That said, as a non-American I've been shocked to see the pro-Trump propaganda here. Yes, hilldog is crooked, no one disagrees with that, everyone can see it. But what do you expect of someone that has been in Washington's inner circle for 30 years? The question remains then, how is that worse than someone who has been in the corrupt, elitist, divisive business world for 30 years? I really fail to see why Trump is supposed to be the Harbinger of Poor People when he has been feeding off of their backs for years, and will continue to do so, whether he wins or loses. If you really want to wake up, realize what a Trump presidency will do to the world. Honestly, it has already deteriorated your image abroad so badly that any president is going to need 8 years to polish up the American image again.

       You can't do anything about it, except standing up and fight for what you believe. What do you think about the rest of the world, when protests happens.....their government simply allows it to happen? NO. All protesters are oppressed all around the world. They even lose everything they have. The thing is you have to get out of your comfort zone and in masses. Look at South Korea. Also Singapore when they caught all those corrupt politicians. Look at India where people do gather in mass and protest. The thing is only you can do as a US citizen while the rest of the world see this stupid nonsense election.

       I'm not sure about that, but I doubt things will continue as they are. If Trump wins, he will push for Hillary to be prosecuted which will open a whole can of worms considering the evidence stacking up not just against her but against a lot of government officials and donors. If Hillary wins that evidence is still in the public domain and there are millions who won't let the charges dissappear, especially Trump supporters. Either way, we have had confirmation of a lot of corrupt behaviour these past few months and I can't see the public allowing that to continue as you said.

       If people think like you and accept that nothing will change and that the MSM control us, then no. But the MSM can't cover everything. Other countries and governments know exactly what is going on and they have all the evidence available like us too thanks to Wikileaks, Anonymous, etc. Do you think they'll be happy to see Clinton holding the reins of the US? Thanks to the Internet, this is going to be nowhere near as easy to cover up as past political fuck ups. Even the FBI seem to be realising that they can't play along with these political games any more while remaining a respectable institution.
