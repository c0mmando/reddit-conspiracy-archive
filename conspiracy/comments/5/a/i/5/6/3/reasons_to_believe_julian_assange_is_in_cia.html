        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>UPDATE (11/01/2017 - UK Date Format): Julian Assange is alive and still in the Embassy. He confirms WikiLeaks has not been compromised. Julian took questions from the Reddit AmA but answered them via live, current and interactive video. He did this very intentionally, and by so doing, was true to his word. Watch a recording of the live event here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2EjKYMCeg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2EjKYMCeg</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>On the 26th of September 2016 Secretary of State John Kerry (self admitted Skull and Bones member) visited Colombia. WikiLeaks reported that inside sources had confirmed that John Kerry also met with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Ecuador to personally ask Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton. This was initially fervently denied in the press only later to be confirmed by the Ecuadorian embassy who admitted cutting off Julian’s internet due to pressure from the US. Ecuador wanted to appear impartial.</p>

<p>For over four years, the Ecuadorian embassy has been under surveillance and Julian&#39;s human rights violated as he has been unlawfully detained termed &quot;illegal arbitrary detention&quot; by a recent UN ruling. During that time, it has been possible for intelligence agencies to gather critical information and build a detailed profile and plan to circumvent Julian&#39;s dead man&#39;s switch.</p>

<p>Both John Kerry and US intelligence agencies know perfectly well that cutting off Julian&#39;s internet would have no impact on the release of the leaked emails that are damaging to Hillary&#39;s campaign. It has been very clear for a long time that
many US officials wanted Julian Assange dead, Hillary Clinton even has remarked, &quot;can&#39;t we just drone the guy&quot;. </p>

<p>The cutting off of Julian&#39;s internet access was not for the purpose of preventing the leaks of the Podesta and Hillary emails. Unless intelligence agencies are truly inept, they know that media organisations already have the entire leaked email database and a schedule for release, they also know WikiLeaks staff would continue to leak regardless of Julian&#39;s ability to communicate.</p>

<p>Removing Assange would not be enough, they would need to circumvent his dead man&#39;s switch and then tarnish WikiLeaks reputation. Removing Assange&#39;s internet could have the effect of causing Assange
to take steps that can be followed to prevent the automatic triggering of his DMS. </p>

<p>From the day Julian&#39;s internet was cut off, a series of peculiar and uncharacteristic events started to take place. The same day that Julian&#39;s internet was cut off, CBS reported that Pamela Anderson visited Assange and had &quot;Tortured&quot; him with a vegan sandwich. A few days before on the 14th, John Podesta tweeted &quot;I bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy&quot;. Then on October the 16th the SHA-256 prerelease keys were issued on WikiLeaks twitter feed, although these events are odd and seemingly inconsequential, combined with John Kerry being in the UK from the 16th to the 17th sparked concern among the community for Julian&#39;s safety.</p>

<p>Assange supporters started to gather at the embassy to keep Assange safe and witness any foul play, some of these witnesses have claimed that a very swift police armed raid took place that lasted only 5 minutes while the crowd was kept under control and prevented from approaching, there have also been reports that they were prevented from taking photographs and that their phones were confiscated. A live periscope feed was also cut off. There have also been some reports of the presence of a mobile jamming van.</p>

<p>If Assange has been seized, any recognition by mainstream media would be detrimental to Hillary&#39;s campaign. A covert operation with media blackout would be the only effective way of seizing him at this time. On October the 18th Fox News said that Julian Assange would be &quot;arrested soon, maybe in a matter of hours.&quot;. The was video was then promptly removed and articles relating to it have disappeared. However, one reddit user was able to find an alternative source and now the video can be found again on YouTube.</p>

<p>Although Julian&#39;s primary DMS (the release of insurance file encryption keys) did not activate, on October the 18th one of Julian&#39;s contingencies did activate, a script was activated that made <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file">https://file.wikileaks.org/file</a> publicly visible and set all the file date and time stamps to 01/01/1984 (Orwell reference). This file repository contains many documents that had not been released prior. </p>

<p>Staffers Kristinn Hrafnsson and Sarah Harrison, have gone silent while the Ecuadorian embassy is refusing to provide any updates on Assange’s fate. There is a recorded call made to the embassy by a journalist where the receptionist refused to confirm that Julian was at the embassy, she also refused to confirm that Julian was even alive. Julian has not made an appearance at the window of the embassy since being cut off.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks suggested in a tweet that its supporters were responsible for the DDOS attacks on the 21st. Neither Assange or WikiLeaks would ever insinuate such a thing. WikiLeaks deceptively tweeted a video of Michael Moore that was actually recorded in June. The video was posted on the 24th of October giving the impression that Michael Moore had been speaking with Assange in the embassy. Why would WikiLeaks do this when they know they are already under suspicion?</p>

<p>WikiLeaks have been using their Twitter account to give the appearance of his safety while providing no concrete evidence of his safety. They issued a poll asking what proof would satisfy the public that Julian was safe. WikiLeaks have yet to follow up on the conclusive result of a video or window appearance.</p>

<p>Julian Assange is known for his attention to detail and his consistently good spelling and grammar. Currently the twitter feed has very poor spelling, there are numerous uncharacteristic spelling errors, for example, an accomplished cryptographer knows how to correctly spell algorithm and so do WikiLeaks staff.</p>

<p>On the 21st of October, there was a massive widespread DDOS attack that disrupted US and EU internet. Also on the 21st of October London City Airport was evacuated. The next day (the 22nd), Gavin MacFayden is reported dead. WikiLeaks made a further blunder by stating his death as the 23rd.</p>

<p>There has been a number of high level WikiLeaks deaths recently too. John Jones QC - WikiLeaks U.N. lawyer died on April 16th 2016. Michael Ratner - WikiLeaks chief counsel died on May 11th 2016. Seth Rich - Employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was fatally shot on July 10th 2016 and Gavin MacFadyen - WikiLeaks director died October 22nd 2016.</p>

<p>If WikiLeaks has been compromised, it is already preparing the scene for future discrepancy to seriously tarnish WikiLeaks reputation. Nothing WikiLeaks has shared since the 15th of October 2016 should be trusted until Julian has been fully verified as alive.</p>

<p>My speculative fears are that Julian has been seized and removed from the Embassy. His internet being cut not being related to the release of the emails, but rather as a component of a plan of 4 years in the making to as secretly as possible remove Assange from the embassy, circumvent his DMS and hijack WikiLeaks with the key team members silenced or under duress.</p>

<p>My fears would be confirmed by no future public (mass witnessing and recorded/televised) appearance of Julian Assange discussing recent topics. His death by whatever means after the US presidential election would be extremely suspect. Until proof of life, assume the following compromised:</p>

<p>SHA-256 verification Keys posted after the 15th. 
WikiLeaks submission process and/or platform.
WikiLeaks twitter feed.
Any WikiLeaks leaks after the 15th October 2016.</p>

<p>EDIT: (01/11/2016 - 17:18GMT) URL and spelling corrections.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: Update 16/12/2016</p>

<p>Why demanding proof that WikiLeaks is not compromised is necessary:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/309760466089922/">https://www.facebook.com/events/309760466089922/</a> (PoL Event @ Ecuadorian Embassy London 17th December 2016) – If you live in the UK please come and let’s get REAL PoL. Please circulate.</p>

<p>1) Still no PGP (GPG) signed short message from WikiLeaks.
2) RiseUp’s warning canary may be dead (RiseUp is believed to host WL Twitter email account)
3) Julian’s internet hasn’t been restored as promised
4) The pre-commitment file hashes released in October do not match the released insurance files
5) Julian’s Swedish defense lawyer Per Samuelson was denied access during case questioning. No one actually saw Julian through the whole process.</p>

<p>Additional points:</p>

<p>-UK disregard for international law
-Capabilities of combined intelligence agencies
-WikiLeaks down on October 17th
-Mass censorship
-WikiLeaks reposting old stuff
-See timelines below</p>

<p>Various timelines, some with minor errors: 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikileaksTimeline/wiki/index">https://www.reddit.com/r/WikileaksTimeline/wiki/index</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5dmr57/timeline_of_events_regarding_julian_assange_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5dmr57/timeline_of_events_regarding_julian_assange_and/</a> <a href="https://regated.com/2016/11/julian-assange-missing/">https://regated.com/2016/11/julian-assange-missing/</a></p>

<p>[Still no PGP (GPG) signed short message from WikiLeaks]
Watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/GSIDS_lvRv4">https://youtu.be/GSIDS_lvRv4</a> video for a simple and good explanation of public/private key cryptography. Here <a href="https://riseup.net/en/canary">https://riseup.net/en/canary</a> is an example of how a legitimate cryptographically capable organisation uses PGP to sign a message and prove authenticity. WikiLeaks has this setup too. Why do they not use it and prove they are not compromised?</p>

<p>WikiLeaks could easily do this. They have their private key. The public has WikiLeaks public key. Even if Julian isn’t in possession of the key, WL most certainly is, no excuse for WL not to prove themselves. This has been heavily requested of WikiLeaks. I’d like to hear from the individuals who claim that their requests were removed (please leave comments). Of all the red flags, not posting a PGP signed message is by far the most damming.
If we are to believe that the person in the audio recording at the FCM 2016 is Julian Assange, then what he says about the keys is missing the point. If he himself is not in possession of the key, then WikiLeaks will be. If WikiLeaks use the key to prove themselves, then we know they are not compromised. By extension, we will also be assured that Julian is safe as an uncompromised WikiLeaks would be in a position to confirm his safety and be believed. This audio file includes everything that he says regarding PGP keys: <a href="http://picosong.com/UyVw/">http://picosong.com/UyVw/</a> (I am not convinced this is Julian).</p>

<p>[RiseUp’s warning canary may be dead (RiseUp is believed to host WL Twitter email account)]
RiseUp is an activist ISP providing secure services to activists. Its mission is to support liberatory social change via fighting social control and mass surveillance through distribution of secure tools (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riseup">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riseup</a>).
RiseUp use a warrant canary as a means to protect their users in case RiseUp are ever issued with a NSL or gag order etc (<a href="https://riseup.net/en/canary">https://riseup.net/en/canary</a>). This is renewed quarterly, assuming no warrant has been issued. However, this is now considerably overdue so the assumption is that the canary is dead, and just like the canaries used in coal mines, everyone should get the hell out of there when it dies. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/something-happened-to-activist-email-provider-riseup-but-it-hasnt-been-compromised/">https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/something-happened-to-activist-email-provider-riseup-but-it-hasnt-been-compromised/</a>. I would be grateful if someone could provide a source for the WikiLeaks twitter email account being hosted by RiseUp.</p>

<p>[Julian’s internet hasn’t been restored as promised]
<a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787889195507417088">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787889195507417088</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788099178832420865">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788099178832420865</a> On the 26th of September 2016 Secretary of State John Kerry visited Colombia. WikiLeaks reported that inside sources had confirmed that John Kerry also met with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa in Ecuador to personally ask Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing documents about Clinton. This was initially fervently denied in the press only later to be confirmed by the Ecuadorian Embassy who admitted cutting off Julian’s internet due to pressure from the US. Ecuador wanted to appear impartial.</p>

<p>Both John Kerry and US intelligence agencies knew perfectly well that cutting off Julian&#39;s internet would have no impact on the release of the leaked emails that were damaging to Hillary&#39;s campaign.
The cutting off of Julian&#39;s internet access was not for the purpose of preventing the leaks of the Podesta and Hillary emails. Unless intelligence agencies are truly inept, they knew that media organisations already have the entire leaked email database and a schedule for release, they also knew WikiLeaks staff would continue to leak regardless of Julian&#39;s ability to communicate.</p>

<p>Now it is long after the election and Ecuador have still not restored Julian’s internet. Ecuador have no grounds to continue to restrict Julian’s internet. It does nothing apart from increase tensions and raise suspicion.
Ecuador have always been supportive of Julian. However, after John Kerry applied pressure on Ecuador, that whole dynamic changed. Ecuador cut Julian&#39;s Internet. He then essentially threatened Ecuador, the UK and John Kerry by submitting those pre-commitment file hashes on Twitter. Since then we have only seen hostility towards Julian from all three parties. Ecuador didn&#39;t restore his internet and didn&#39;t let his lawyer interview him and no one actually saw him. The U.K. Denied him access to Gavin&#39;s funeral and denied him access to medical treatment. The UK also continually disregard the UN. The dynamic now is totally different. He has no political friends. It seems that both the UK and Ecuador are now working against Julian and Wikileaks. An environment where a collaborated siege would be feasible.</p>

<p>Finally, many have speculated about mobile signals being blocked at the Embassy. I can confirm that there is 4G signal right outside the Embassy door. I was there, with my phone, and tested it. There is no reason to think Julian cannot use a MiFi device (or similar) connected to a cellular network.</p>

<p>[The pre-commitment file hashes released in October do not match the released insurance files]
Here are the October tweets with the file hashes:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781046519693316">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781046519693316</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781519951720449">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781519951720449</a></p>

<p>These 3 pre-commitment Twitter posts are SHA-256 file hashes. SHA-256 file hashes are 64 characters long. They are not encryption keys for insurance files. They simply are a mathematical formula for verifying that later released files are genuine and have not been altered.</p>

<p>These hashes were released because Julian felt threatened and in increased danger. They specifically targeted the UK FCO, Ecuador and John Kerry. All of whom are key players in his current predicament.
On November 7th, WikiLeaks released 3 new insurance files. These files names match the names given in the pre-commitment hash tweets:</p>

<p>2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_EC.aes256
2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_UK.aes256
2016-11-07_WL-Insurance_US.aes256</p>

<p>EC = Ecuador, UK = UK FCO, US = John Kerry. Soon after these files were released, the 3 files hashes were compared to the 3 hashes posted on the 16th of October. They did not match. When this was brought to WikiLeaks attention, WikiLeaks released the following statement in a tweet:
<a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521</a></p>

<p>“NOTE: When we release pre-commitment hashes they are for decrypted files (obviously). Mr. Assange appreciates the concern.”</p>

<p>This firstly proved that the hashes and the insurance files were related (a fact that was already clear). Secondly, it was a lie, as it implied historical use of pre-commitment hashes in this manner. Thirdly, the (obviously) comment was also a deception and an insult to supporters. It was not obvious to anyone, not even to our crypto guys in <a href="/r/cryptography/">/r/cryptography/</a>, on the contrary, they thought it highly suspicious.
Additionally, what they suggest would be absolutely pointless. Pointless as a threat, as the UK, Ecuador and John Kerry would have no practical way of identifying the documents to confirm the threat.
There&#39;s absolutely no scenario where an uncompromised WikiLeaks would either post bad file hashes or altered insurance files.</p>

<p>[Julian’s Swedish defense lawyer Per Samuelson was denied access during case questioning]
This is highly unusual and very suspicious. Also, Jennifer Robinson was not in the room with Assange. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYR0Pw9LfUQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m55s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYR0Pw9LfUQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m55s</a> and neither was the chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37972528">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37972528</a> “Swedish chief prosecutor Ingrid Isgren will not speak to Mr Assange directly”.</p>

<p>[UK disregard for international law]
The UK threat is very real. Back in August 2012 the UK was poised to break international law citing the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act of 1987 as a basis for entering the Embassy and arresting Assange (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19259623">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19259623</a>). It all became very public, very quickly and fortunately never happened (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/ecuador/9488996/Ecuadors-president-raiding-embassy-to-snatch-Julian-Assange-suicidal.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/ecuador/9488996/Ecuadors-president-raiding-embassy-to-snatch-Julian-Assange-suicidal.html</a>). I expressed my concern at the time that the UK shouldn’t have even been contemplating such action, let alone threatening it in writing to Ecuador.
More recently, the UK disregarded the UN ruling that Julian Assange was being arbitrarily detained (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/julian-assange-wikileaks-arrest-friday-un-investigation">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/julian-assange-wikileaks-arrest-friday-un-investigation</a>). The UK appealed, and then finally lost their appeal in November (<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/368746-un-ruling-free-assange/">https://www.rt.com/news/368746-un-ruling-free-assange/</a>). Julian has also been refused to leave the Embassy with a police escort for medical treatment as well as denied to attend Gavin MacFadyen’s funeral. The UK’s behaviour is appalling and clearly has no respect for international law. The reported raid on the Embassy during the latter part of October seems more plausible when taken in the context of past behavior.</p>

<p>This is the Britain I now live in: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-bill-act-snoopers-charter-browsing-history-what-does-it-mean-a7436251.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-bill-act-snoopers-charter-browsing-history-what-does-it-mean-a7436251.html</a>. I never used to be ashamed to be British.</p>

<p>[Combined capabilities of intelligence agencies]
We know much about the combined powers of the intelligence agencies. We know what they are capable of, thanks to the leaks of Edward Snowden. The combined powers of the NSA, CIA and the UK’s GCHQ are capable of pulling off such a massive takeover of Wikileaks. We know the NSA works with other US intelligence agencies, we know that the NSA works with GCHQ.</p>

<p>We know about Tempora, we know about JTRIG, we know about PRISM, we know about HAVOK. We know that websites can be altered on the fly, we know that real-time voice profiling is trivial for these agencies. We know that censorship is happening.</p>

<p><a href="https://usnewsghost.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/new-july-14-edward-snowden-nsa-leaks-gchq-attacks-and-censors-internet-nsa-leaks-recent/">https://usnewsghost.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/new-july-14-edward-snowden-nsa-leaks-gchq-attacks-and-censors-internet-nsa-leaks-recent/</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)</a></p>

<p>The NSA has a remit to be 10 years ahead of the curve. We have commercial products that can be purchased off the shelf today that can easily manipulate audio and video. Just imagine what the NSA and the military are capable of.</p>

<p>Real time facial manipulation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk</a> Signs of editing: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O9t_TEE1aw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O9t_TEE1aw</a>. Both Julian Assange and John Pilger are not filmed together at any time during the interview. There is also no establishing shot. It is also claimed that Assange’s audio is spliced and edited. No recent events mentioned by Assange, only Pilger. Unfortunately, this interview is not sufficient proof of life.</p>

<p>What the NSA can’t do, is that they cannot break PGP encryption. This has been expressed by Glenn Greenwald who was one of the journalists that Edward Snowden leaked to. He commented that he knows how secure PGP is because the NSA keep moaning about not being able to crack it in their documents he is reading. This is another reason why a signed PGP message can be the only true proof that WL isn’t compromised. Mathematics cannot lie, people can and do. A compromised WL can’t sign a message without the private key.
Edward Snowden revealed that in 2013 the NSA were capable of 3 trillion password attempts per second. As it is now almost 2017, that number will likely be multiple times higher (anywhere between 9 to 15 trillion attempts per second would be my guess based on Moore’s law).</p>

<p>[WikiLeaks down on October 17th]
The alleged raid on the Embassy supposedly took place on the 17th just after 1am GMT. On Monday the 17th of October 2016 WikiLeaks website was reported down (<a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/wikileaks.org.html">http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/wikileaks.org.html</a> expand the comments) <a href="https://postimg.org/image/6t68fe4kj/">https://postimg.org/image/6t68fe4kj/</a>. The internet was alive with reports of mass censorship around this time. This all coincides with when the alleged WikiLeaks takeover occurred. It also coincides with John Kerry being in the UK.</p>

<p>[Christine Assange audio only radio interview] Julian&#39;s family had their identities changed quite a few years ago after receiving death threats. It is odd that his mother has now revealed herself to a news agency. If you do a YouTube search for Christine Assange (her original name), you&#39;ll find all the videos are older than 3 years. She&#39;s in hiding, not openly talking on radio shows (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange</a> scroll down to the personal life section).</p>

<p>[WikiLeaks bitcoin account was emptied on the 18th of November] Interestingly it was after the bitcoin account was emptied that the encoded message in the blockchain was left. Why would WikiLeaks go to all that trouble when they could just sign a message with their PGP key? Is it because bitcoin accounts can be cracked and the PGP keys can’t?</p>

<p>[Mass censorship] Facebook is censoring this event (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/309760466089922/">https://www.facebook.com/events/309760466089922/</a>). It has been advertised for weeks now any only a handful of people are attending. Recently Wikileaks was live on FB. 50% of the viewers (roughly 2.5k) were commenting #PoL, #Whereisassange, RIP etc. The live event was only a prerecorded video being played in loop. Once it concluded, the whole Live event along with all the comments including the comments asking for PoL and PGP signed message were deleted. It was as if it never took place.
When Julian’s DMS had supposedly been activated, I saw posts in threads being deleted within minutes. Supposedly with encryption keys, but it all happened too fast for anyone to collate. I took PDF printouts of the pages and then later noticed that posts and entire links were taken down. I have PDF&#39;s of pages that now no longer exist. I&#39;ve been following this since mid-October and seen the censorship first hand. I know many people here on reddit witnessed the same (please comment with your experiences).</p>

<p>[WikiLeaks reposting old stuff]
There are many examples of this already mentioned in the timelines. One for example is the Palantir Technologies report. Palantir Technologies prepared a report on how to destroy WikiLeaks that was leaked in 2011. The proposal was submitted to Bank of America through its outside law firm, Hunton &amp; Williams. Palantir later apologised for their involvement. But WikiLeaks has recently regurgitated it as if it was new. There are many examples of this. I have watched as WikiLeaks have increasingly destroyed their credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s all sorts of suspicion here. The main thing is that it&#39;s not actionable, provable. My personal opinion is that it&#39;s designed to distract, aside Gavens death but media says it was from &#39;cancer&#39; surrounded by family.</p>

<p>You only got 2 real possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JA dead, in which case it will be confirmed in a week Or</p></li>
<li><p>JA not dead, in which case he tells of his torture in a week.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My inclination is to wait, personally.</p>

<p>But since this is conspiracy I&#39;ll throw out 2 other possible scenarios.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JA is on vacation to see his family</p></li>
<li><p>JA is being duplicated by a plastic surgeon (face off)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You really can&#39;t rule anything out, and a keycode or a video proves little IMO.</p>

<p>PS - we&#39;ve also not received a true sign off life from Snowden either.</p>

Do you think she would attempt some sort of retaliation if she was elected? after all those claims it would make her look extremely weak if she just let it slide imo. my guess is she would do something reguarding the Syria crisis which was orchestrated by her state department in the first place. That country is were ww3 is going to start between US and Russia. I think War between our countries would be the first nuclear war. maybe not on Russian soil or American but on either sides allies in the middle east.</p>

Ignores anyone asking about Julian. Nobody tweets to this chick, why can&#39;t she respond? She&#39;s hiding something. They&#39;re all hiding something. I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s alive anymore, after the fake <em>new</em> videos from 2012 dis informing people. Embassy cat not tweeting. People went to the embassy to hot spot for him and nothing. Wikileaks made that &quot;proof of life poll&quot; yet NOTHING came of it. He&#39;s done. They&#39;re pulling the Osama video routine, posting old videos to make you think he&#39;s alive. Chasing ghosts/dead on ice until he&#39;s ready to be used as a political ploy. They obviously can&#39;t doctor videos fast enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going full conspiracy here. The Podesta joke about Julians food being bad at the embassy was used to mock him on the 14th. He likely knew they had a plot running to poison him.
<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/10/14/john-podestas-twitter-diss-of-wikileaks-editor-julian-assange-backfires-goes-viral/">http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/10/14/john-podestas-twitter-diss-of-wikileaks-editor-julian-assange-backfires-goes-viral/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking Pam was sent there to seduce him and give him a possibly poisoned meal. How could you resist? She was bra less, hard nipped bearing gifts for embassy cat and food!

<p>Perhaps the weird hash tweet sent out by him on the 15th was a small dead mans switch? Is it possible he had a daily check in, and that was an alarm? Then the internet was cut around the 19th possibly earlier. US then asks Ecuador to be quiet about it, or they&#39;ll overthrow or drone them too. Possibly paid off. The problem is solved, armed men discard body in the night. Ecuador is keeping very quiet and hasn&#39;t even confirmed via phoning the embassy that he&#39;s even alive. Wikileaks founder &quot;found dead&quot; around the 24th. Redditors keep looking into this. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Thank you</em></strong> for remaining skeptical.</p>

<p>Three things have happened recently:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assange&#39;s teleconference at CISL2016, no video and scratchy audio.</li>
<li>John Pilger wrote a blog post, and half way into it he claims Assange is OK and people don&#39;t need to worry.</li>
<li>Supposedly Assange made a written statement to Sweden authorities asking to attend Gavin MacFayden&#39;s (Wikileaks Co-Founder) funeral for 1 hour, and Sweden released a press statement denying his request.</li>
</ol>

<p>But if you look into all three of these, they have no substance and here&#39;s why. All three of these things just happen to <em>coincide with what his schedule would actually have been if he wasn&#39;t in custody</em>. So to maintain the appearance that Assange is still at the Embassy alive and well, they have to tie up his loose ends.</p>

<ol>
<li>The speakers at CISL2016 expected a live stream from Assange, but were surprised he didn&#39;t have video. Imagine how surprised they would be if Assange just never showed up.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know who this &quot;very reputable&quot; John Pilger is, but if he is more reputable than Wikileaks&#39; own Twitter, we&#39;ve got problems Houston. Even Wikileaks Twitter baited the entire public with a poll asking for a proof of life video, then didn&#39;t deliver anything. Is John Pilger in the Embassy with Assange? No. Then he knows nothing.</li>
<li>Of course Assange&#39;s appearance would be expected at MacFayden&#39;s funeral, it&#39;s his mentor and best friend. Many people who knew Assange would be there and expect to see him. How many red flags would it raise if Assange just didn&#39;t show up? In a normal, non-psychologically tortured world, we would let him attend the funeral despite his lockdown situation. So Sweden fires off a press release saying he&#39;s grounded.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yer, but what are other meanings for those words? From the link above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which brings us to the Stochastic Terminator algorithm being &quot;updated&quot;. If this should refer to the algorithm that drops leaks on autopilot, then wouldn&#39;t he have to update every damn one of those servers across Europe with the algorithm?
&quot;Stochastic Terminator&quot; can be loosely interpreted as &quot;Random Killer&quot; or &quot;Switch Dead&quot;. Dead Man Switch. If it was just their leak algorithm, then &quot;Stochastic Publishing algorithm&quot; would make way more sense. Why use the word &quot;Terminator&quot;?
It makes more sense (to me) that the Stochastic Terminator algorithm is actually the Dead Man Switch, and the &quot;update&quot; that was Tweeted basically means, Dead Man Switch has been activated resulting in specific material (contingency) now coming down the pipeline instead of just leaks.</p>

<p>People keep thinking that its faked audio and stuff. I think the interview took place before the stated time - ever hear of tape delay? The interview can be completely legit but it could be exactly like the Michael Moore pic.

    <div class="md"><p>Possible the interview was recorded before hand, since his situation at the Embassy is uncertain and cannot commit to a scheduled live conference. Also there was a part where he and a live speaker were talking over each other, neither would pause, which almost suggests his voice was a recording.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible the interview was live, and he was sitting in an interrogation room with CIA/FBI agents while doing it, to give the appearance he hasn&#39;t been detained.</p>

<p>Maybe everything was kosher, he made that conference call unimpeded and was allowed to speak his mind until his slot was done at the conference. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for, but I doubt it at this point.</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me most is that he was talking all about scandals, corruption, Hillary, and the election during that conference. WHY would they let him do this? I thought the very reason they cut his internet at the Embassy was due to interfering with elections, so why let him do this very thing over a phone call to a conference that is being live streamed to the world? Doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CISL conference with Assange, which took place on Oct 26th, was advertised on October 18th on the FaceBook page of the &quot;IT Workers of Tandil&quot; [Buenos Aires]. Screenshot: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sQ76C">http://imgur.com/a/sQ76C</a></p>

<p>The same ad was also posted <a href="http://cisl.org.ar/cronograma/8-cisl2016-dia4-tandil-unicen#.WBknbCSm0hk">on the CISL website</a> and the conference was posted on YouTube the next day (27th).</p>

<p>Finally, Julian mentioned at the beginning of the conference that it was his first interview since his internet was cut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not buying it. Advertised on the 18th? Two days after Kerry was in London? The only thing supporting the Assange is alive and in the embassy and fine narrative is the that the gubment really thinks we are stupid or is incredibly inept. I think they are incredibly inept and they think we&#39;re stupid. Nothing you have posted does anything to support your argument.

    <div class="md"><p>Kerry&#39;s visit to London on the 16th is irrelevant to the FaceBook posting because Assange&#39;s internet was cut on the 18th, same day as the FaceBook post. Visit the FB page to confirm for yourself. The post is still up. Further, I&#39;m just trying to establish facts here...what&#39;s known vs. unknown. You don&#39;t want to believe what you see and hear, that&#39;s your prerogative. </p>

<p>That said, as an Assange supporter, I&#39;m as concerned for his well-being as any other supporter here. However, I choose to believe that the CISL conference was real and that he&#39;s still at work. Until you or anyone else can prove otherwise, I&#39;m gonna go with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was never going to prevent people from looking through the leaks. They already had them in hand and any news worthy information in them would have come out. I saw recently that Nevada stopped taxing gold mines because they didnt want to run out the mining industry. The problem with that is the gold isnt going anywhere and there are precious few places to get gold. Once its gone it <em>cant</em> be taxed and there will always be demand for gold. Same principle applies here. Those emails arent going anywhere. We will always be able to get the information in them. Assange on the other hand is a <em>perishable</em> commodity. He has a shelf life. He&#39;s getting thrown out like a month old banana. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Less than two weeks prior to the start of your timeline, Kerry&#39;s 9/26/2016 visit, Wikileaks published <a href="https://wikileaks.org/Medical-Reports.html">Assange Medical and Psychological Records</a> 9/14/2016. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This part one publication consists of three documents: a twenty-seven page psycho-social and medical assessment from 10 November 2015, a report from Mr. Assange’s physician from 8 December 2015 and a dentist’s report from 31 July 2015.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I question both the necessity and the timing of the release of these records, the newest of which being nine months old. I don&#39;t mean to belabor this point, as I&#39;ve mentioned it before elsewhere to no response, but it strikes me as odd. These reports show weakness at a time when it wouldn&#39;t be prudent to do so.</p>

<p>If he is still alive, needs a root canal, and (probably) a cortisone injection for his shoulder. As well as sunlight, freedom, and a few solid nights sleep, but I guess we can&#39;t have all the nice things.</p>

<p>Best case scenario, he&#39;s snuck out and is receiving the medical care he needs. Let&#39;s throw in a visit with family just to paint a super rosy picture.</p>

<p>More realistic picture is that he&#39;s being held under duress in the Embassy until after the election. During the alleged 5-minute raid, reports have swat entering the building, how many in - how many out? Are some of them still in there detaining him?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason you would release that info is if you needed to either protect yourself from &quot;dying of cancer&quot; or getting the &quot;Alzheimers&quot;. What they did was show that the only thing wrong with him is bad dentistry, it also shows that there are dental records...It was a protection from <em>character</em> assassination by discrediting any claims that he was not of sound mind or <em>actual</em> assassination by mysterious un-diagnosed physical ailment.

    <div class="md"><p>Addendum</p>

<p>In the speculative scenario I have proposed, leaks would continue on schedule despite a compromised WikiLeaks. Leaks would be mostly accurate and the schedule already set out would only be slightly altered. The leaks can be controlled. Any drastic alteration would raise further suspicion. The most damaging leaks would be held back. It would only require a small alteration or the alteration of one email or leak to ruin WikiLeaks publication record. I am concerned with the long term protection of Wikileaks. The current election is like a choice between Cholera or Gonorrhea. We know Julian would concur.</p>

<p>I really feel we are failing Julian with our mass ignorance. The SHA-256 file hashes are NOT encryption keys for decrypting the insurance files. They are simply 64 character long alphanumeric algorithms for verifying that the insurance files have not been altered. I had two motives for mentioning them: </p>

<p>1)  To clarify why there was concern over Assange&#39;s safety due to a mass panic that they were DMS keys. They are not DMS encryption keys. You cannot decrypt insurance files with these file verification hashes.</p>

<p>2)  To point out that we should be cautious of using these hashes to verify insurance files until we have absolute certainty that Julian is alive and safe. I am simply reminding people that these file verification hashes were released AFTER Julian&#39;s Internet was cut, therefore, if it turns out that WikiLeaks has been compromised, we cannot be sure of the integrity of data verified with these hashes.
For example, this means that when an altered version of the John Kerry files are leaked in the future, and we verify the integrity of those files using the hashes posted after the 15th, we are still getting compromised data. IMO, under this scenario, this is why they were one of the first things published after Julian’s internet was cut.</p>

<p>Then there is the PGP signature, which few seem to understand. As many have already mentioned, all it takes is for Julian to publish a short message using his PGP key. Basically Julian/WikiLeaks have openly published their public key. In order to decrypt a message written by Assange, we simply use the key that WikiLeaks have shared with the world. If we are able to decrypt the message using the key, then we know for sure that it was encrypted using Julian’s private key that only he knows. This is very basically how it works. You can’t decrypt a message with the public key that hasn’t been created with the private key. This is why WikiLeaks ignoring and blocking tweeters asking for a PGP signed message is very suspicious. </p>

<p>Apologies to those who already understand how encryption works, I wouldn’t push the point so much if it really wasn’t so important for everyone concerned to understand.</p>

<p>Concerning the insurance files, if Julian did entrust the encryption keys to others, he would have been very careful about it. If he did give insurance file encryption keys to close and trusted friends, MacFadyen would have definitely been one of them. Perhaps even the only other person. But he is dead, so we will never know.</p>

<p>I posted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on purpose. We do need to speculate. What I hope we can all agree on however is that there are a lot of odd facts, potential correlations, events and circumstances surrounding Julian&#39;s internet being cut off that really need a lot of thought and careful consideration. </p>

<p>Suppose for a moment that Julian is in CIA custody being interrogated and tortured but alive. The entire WikiLeaks staff could be compromised under the threat of Julian&#39;s death. I know it is conspiracy, I know it is theory, but we owe it to Julian to be sure, and it isn’t really that hard to become sure. Julian prepared us all for such a scenario and we risk failing him. We have enough reasonable doubt. Even WikiLeaks have acknowledged that.</p>

<p>If all of this is distraction, propaganda, disinfo, counter intelligence etc, then even more reason for Assange to put an end to it. All he needs to do is release a PGP signed statement or appear on his balcony at a pre-scheduled date and time with the media and supporters ready to hear and record him in person.</p>

<p>I stand by my statement that we should not trust WikiLeaks until we have verification. It came with the caveat that we only trust after receiving proof of life. This only serves to hasten a valid response from WikiLeaks/Assange. This does not mean the leaks coming out are false, it just means we cannot trust them completely yet, as I already stated, I am sure the vast majority is legitimate leaks even in a scenario where WikiLeaks is compromised. Those concerned make up a large portion of his loyal supporters, a portion who should be addressed and put at ease.</p>

<p>There are several things we can do. We can schedule an event at a specific date and time (a FB event would work) where supporters (mostly in the UK) can meet outside the embassy and wait for Julian to appear. If the event is sufficiently publicised and gives Julian enough time to become aware and ready for it, then he should have no reason to not show himself at the balcony. He will be protected, as in the past, due to the number of people present and he will have time to plan security precautions with his team.</p>

<p>If we were to collectively organise this event, we would need to all consistently and repeatedly publicise it to WikiLeaks to ensure they can be ready in time. If Julian is really still at the embassy, then he will show himself at the scheduled time. We could all donate to WikiLeaks with the event details in the description or written on the back of cheques sent. I’m sure we could come up with creative ways to ensure Julian is aware that we will be waiting for him.</p>

<p>This reminds me though why I thought the three wikileaks &#39;precommitment&#39; tweets were so ominous when I first saw them-- they are the exact three players who would have had to be in on doing something to Assange.</p>

<p>Ecuador
The UK
John Kerry</p>

<p>So, yes if there&#39;s someway to do or put something together in London plus online lets do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I came here after you posted in wikileaks to check it out. This is baseless. Firstly, I will say that in your original post you just attacked everyone and didn&#39;t actually mention your concern for his life or even mention this. You just called us all compromised and were being a bit of a general cunt. Furthermore, in about 2 minutes of reading this post I was able to find out that that is an entirely different model of Gulfstream jet to N379P which is known colloquially as Guantanamo Bay Express</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;m not saying that there&#39;s nothing to this, Smithfield looks somewhat dodgy, but at the moment there is more credible evidence that he is alive and well in the embassy than this</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>The mods didn&#39;t delete it because we&#39;re demonstrably not compromised. The reason I&#39;m here because this isn&#39;t constructive, it&#39;s a waste of energy and there are far more effective things you can be doing if you genuinely care about this. As far as anomalies are concerned, if you follow the links to the original evidence, they say that it&#39;s an entirely different plane (which 1 minute of googling showed that GSK owns it), and the dates and times of the alleged screenshots and reddit posts have a difference by about 20 hours or so.</p>

<p>You are right though. I really shouldn&#39;t have wasted my time.</p>

Why can&#39;t the Ecuador embassy phone operator even confirm if JA is alive? Explain to me why Wikileaks is taking so long with the video of JA we as a community voted for? Why was there a fox news report about JA soon to be captured but was ignored with no mention afterwards? Why has there been so many high level wikileaks deaths recently? Why was London City Airport evacuated on the same day of a DDOS attack that wikileaks claimed its own supporters did? Why has there been so many weird tweets from wikileaks? Why has @Embassycat not made tweet since Oct 15? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pamela and Julian have been friends through PETA for a number of years now. He has spoken about their friendship a number of times. They met on the 14th.</p>

<p>Julian&#39;s internet was cut out on the 12th at around 5pm local time.</p>

<p>^^^ ie. not the same fucking day</p>

<p>Podesta mocked JA because he had just started releasing his emails and he had just called Podesta out specifically a few days earlier on the wikileaks anniversary live stream</p>

<p>Can&#39;t comment on the Ecuadorian embassy but I&#39;d imagine that they don&#39;t look too kindly on random people calling their embassy and enquiring about a political refugee much less tell you what he had for breakfast. The receptionist doesn&#39;t get to decide what they can tell you, much less divulge information on people seeking asylum</p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine wikileaks are pretty fucking busy at the moment to be honest, probably why they haven&#39;t made a video.</p>

<p>I doubt Fox news are privy to the inner workings of what you allege to be a CIA run extraordinary rendition that also broke Vienna convention on sovereignty of an embassy.</p>

<p>Gavin died of lung cancer at home with his wife and kids, her own words.</p>

<p>I have a better question for that one... why the fuck would a DDoS force an airport to be evacuated? Furthermore, someone has taken responsibility for those DDoS attacks and also released the source code for his botnet and stopped using it, allowing a confirmation of the techniques and IP addresses.</p>

<p>Someone else is using wikileaks twitter now obviously. They have increased the frequency of their posts for exposure. The 256-bit hashes that were released as precommitments nearly melted the fucking internet with people thinking it was his DMS. Seems like a pretty fucking savvy thing to do to make sure you&#39;ve again got media coverage.</p>

<p>Embassy cat posts something about once a fortnight if not less often. That takes all of half a second to scroll down and see.</p>

<p>I do mean really. The only thing that can even be perceived as bizarre would be the video but if I had to guess that was their new social media manager pandering to the masses for attention. This is someone whose role is to maximise social media exposure and they did a pretty fucking great job.</p>

<p>You enjoy the rest of your day. Been interesting to say the least. Oh and just remember what we told you on <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>. Rhetoric means shit. Give us evidence. You have nothing but wild allegations and fantasies, which you&#39;re welcome to have, but don&#39;t expect those of us who are a tad more rigorous to buy into your bullshit.</p>

<p>edit: clarity</p>

<p>edit 2: oh, and in case you didn&#39;t realise, it appears that I seem to know a little bit more about wikileaks and JA than you appear to. Chances are many over at <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> do as well which is why we didn&#39;t entertain your hubris and attacks on us</p>

I reply to this with what was a top in r/conspiracy at the time about John Kerry being in the released fbi documents that are talking about how he is a part of the &#39;Shadow Government&#39; and it also says they deal with everything Clinton related.<br/>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57yrc0/clintons_fbi_files_literally_mention_the_shadow/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/57yrc0/clintons_fbi_files_literally_mention_the_shadow/</a><br/>
So is this Shadow Government trying to clean everything Clinton related up and stay out of the spotlight at the same time (By sending John Kerry to Silence Julian). Maybe this &#39;Shadow&#39; Government should also be talked about a bit more.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>The cost is too high to be wrong and too easy to prove me wrong. Which isnt happening. I am not scared of the internet backlash against my karma for being wrong. If the hash files were sent out by WL after SA had seized the account then they are &quot;authenticating&quot; false information. Which means they get to determine how damaging the information really is, which would be an acceptable cost when considering the potential alternative. If you know exactly how dirty you are but you dont know exactly how much anyone else knows its better to silence them entirely, but you cant raise too many alarm bells or you look like you just killed the guy airing all your dirty laundry - I hope you can see how problematic that scenario would be for someone that is perceived as the most corrupt politician on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.    There was no single person behind 9/11 for example.   </p>

<p>The most useful material on 9/11 is out in the open,  so far,  without the help of wikileaks,  much,  as far as I can tell.    Yet,  the criminals have not been tried,  are free to line up more and more nonsense.</p>

<p>I trust Julian more than Snowden,  as sources go,  but they might as well be the equivalent of alternative media channels.</p>

<p>Why get too concerned about individual alternative media channels?   Its obviously a mess,  with disinfo people like Alex Jones dominating,  and even people like Paul Craig Roberts still use him,  even Sibel Edmonds used him once or twice.   Pathetic.    But then if you can use CNN,  then what&#39;s the difference?</p>

<p>In other words,  the issues each have to stand on their own,  independently of the sources and the channels.    The focus on the messenger is proving to be a distraction from the underlying particulars of each specific incident of criminality,  corruption,  and geopolitical maneuvering.    Recently the conversation about Russia being involved or not has dominated more than what the revealed emails actually said.    The issue is the emails themselves.   I love how the 9/11 timeline eventually got people to focus on the big picture instead of individual so called experts,  whose expertise has never been properly vetted within the forum of a proper investigation.    Its as if people think an armchair investigation,  a break room trial, can make up for the fact that the rule of law has been abolished,  that the dictators have control,  have relative secrecy.    Its time that some semblance of investigative rigor be established among people who are obviously not corrupt and partisan.    The corporate media and the alternative media are a joke.    The society has been contaminated to the point where a conversation about truth and facts is impossible.    In that sense,   the dictators are winning.</p>

<p>So,  what are you doing to insist on rigor in your speculations?    What kind of example are you setting.    You need to disclose better that you got nothing either way.     You need to admit that only the passage of time can clear up the matter of Julian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it always the people with brand new accounts, old accounts with little-to-no karma, no history supporting wikileaks, and/or even a history of shilling for Clinton who keep popping up and pushing hard to divert attention away from Wikileaks to get people speculating about where Assange is? To say that wikileaks can&#39;t be trusted even! Check op for example, look at their history. Check everyone in this thread who is also concern trolling. </p>

<p>Hmm, it&#39;s almost as if some organization wants us to distrust wikileaks...................</p>

<p>The truth is that there is no hard evidence one way or the other about Assange. Where ever he is, he&#39;s locked up as a prisoner with no internet and limited or no access to guests, and that includes the Ecuadorian embassy. Speculating and worrying only serves to distract from Wikileaks and their proven legitimate work. Until or unless wikileaks stops releasing legitimate material or we get actual evidence of something, all your concern trolling is doing is damaging wikileaks&#39;s reputation needlessly. All your concern trolling does is make people worry and distract from the things that we DO have hard evidence of: wikileaks exposing corruption. </p>

It is just as valid to consider that they are holding him AND taking an active roll in counter-trolling whilst trying to figure out how to break into his organisation and use his contacts and any data he had.  That IS what they do.  That is their job.  Their version of Golf. 
This whole thing stinks. We all know it. We all see it.

If WL <em>is</em> compromised it implicates those that were exposed by WL and all evidence points to the DNC, HRC, and the Executive branch of the US. That wouldnt discredit the WL emails, it would substantiate it. Anyone, if anything the US wants to protect Assange&#39;s life while engaging in character assasination...that is unless your own propaganda machine has a <em>lower trustworthy rating that CONGRESS</em>. In that scenario, you cant actually engage in <em>character</em> assassination...</p>

<p>This worked for me.  There&#39;s no &quot;s&quot; in file, in either case.</p>

<p>I just skimmed through the folder though, and there is very little there which caught my eye, to be honest.  Information on various cults, but nothing really that anyone didn&#39;t already know.  I can&#39;t see anything there that would be truly damaging to anyone of real relevance.</p>

<p>If Assange has been killed, (and I am inclined to believe that he already has been) then from the looks of these files, said death unfortunately will not accomplish very much.</p>
