<p>While the First Nations stand together in solidarity to stand up for water, where are the marches, where is the political unrest to protest the fact that you have a system that is so broken that the rest of the world looks on in horror.</p>

<p>Please tell us that things are happening - that people are mobilizing, and that it won&#39;t just be business as usual for another four years.  Both the candidates are non choices in every civilized country on the planet.</p>

<p>I know a lot of you care - and this isn&#39;t to ostracize any of you, but this subreddit used to have some grit, and more importantly variety.</p>

<p>Anyways I wish us all the best - this will be an interesting time coming up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I doubt it.</p>

<p>People are wary about standing up not because they&#39;re afraid of being assassinated, but because they&#39;re afraid of futility and being a martyr for a cause that the general population is too fat, docile, or stupid to appreciate or assist.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem putting my life on the line, for example. But, for what? I stand up, get shot down, and the herd just moos back into their pen... if they ever even noticed. Or, better yet, they celebrate the great disruptor/terrorist is put down and they can all be safe in their homes and not having their simulated reality disturbed.</p>

<p>The people at large, many of whom are the problem, are not worth my sacrifice or even my energies. They&#39;re not worth saving. My evidence would be the country itself, how it was born, and where it is now. The people the sheeple routinely vote into office, your Bushes, Clintons, Obamas... </p>

<p>Our country is weighed down by too many who think salvation rests in government and want more of what got us/them here.</p>

<p>Fuck those people. They can get obese, have their limbs chopped off, die of cancer and beg for socialism to subsidize their own agency. We ARE inundated with useless eaters and liberals.</p>

<p>If people could believe there was a goal, and a purpose, and believed that the people of this country who&#39;ve let it go to shit were worth the work, then several people would willingly stand up. But we&#39;re not and so they don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt the same way. Lots of generally acceptable quotes about equality, none of the hard hitting lines. But I suppose that&#39;s to be expected. The Jefferson Memorial was fairly bland and pro religion too. FDR&#39;s memorial was a bit better, but it still lacked the punch of his proposed bill of economic rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Martin Luther King Jr. work transcended racism.  He broke the law. He was arrested (nearly 30 times in a decade). He spoke at 2500 events and wrote five books.  He peacefully demonstrated. You cannot honor him and his life’s work unless you recognize that his work transcended race.</p>

<p>Dr. King spoke out about income inequality, civil rights, social injustice and against war – all things conservatives feel have little merit within the political sphere and therefore have ignored as part of King’s legacy. Mr. King is not remembered for being a leading American socialist. He wasn&#39;t simply a civil rights advocate, he was a human rights advocate.  His memorial in Washington D.C. should reflect this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And lets not forget that most countries that have mass protests, also have the adequate safety nets in place to help the folks who choose to participate - adequate monetary assistance and work leave, tax funded healthcare, etc. Comparative countries for us would be those in the Middle East joining the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; mass revolts, which were still far worse off prior to their breaking point.</p>

<p>We have been corralled into a tight pen and it really will take something very major to break it down. That isn&#39;t to say we aren&#39;t close to that and its honestly terrifying if you know enough about American culture.</p>

<p>Domestically, the American population is like the angry bullied kid that is constantly abused but keeps on moving, no matter how battered they become. But there comes a tipping point where the kid can stand no more and the fury he unleashes will terrify everyone around. And the various factions around the US that could gain an upper hand are even more terrifying. We are seriously inches from the brink of our own &quot;Arab Spring&quot; with Christian radicals that its not even funny. It just happens to be true that the folks with the most guns happen to also be some of the most radically devoted to their faith in Christianity.</p>

<p>Who do you think will prevail in our country at that tipping point? The millenial generation, largely devoted to science based reasoning, willing to entertain socialist policies that benefit the masses, etc? Or the radical Christians with the guns that are already organized?</p>

<p>Fucking scary.</p>

It is very difficult to hide things from the masses when there is internet.

<p>Matthew 25:15
“So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’[a] spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you ever ask them about their political/religious beliefs? A lot of them will tell you about how this is a Christian nation, it was founded as a Christian nation and that the country is headed in the wrong direction to be overrun by other cultures - most likely Muslims. They have very deeply parallel political and religious beliefs and don&#39;t acknowledge a true separation of church and state. Hell, a lot of them like to point out that particular phrase isn&#39;t in the constitution as a justification for their intentions to vote the most devout Christians into political power - meanwhile ignoring the true intent of the first amendment.</p>

<p>I live in Kansas. I&#39;m quite isolated in my very progressive liberal political positions and I see people talk about their guns, religion and politics on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I think you are being very naive if you think the kind of religious insurrection going on in the Middle East couldn&#39;t happen with fanatical fundamentalist Christians in the US who currently feel deeply threatened by the current state state of things being fed to them by the television.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no I get that. It really depends on <em>how</em> the groups work together during their group goal though. If Millenials (many of which fall into both categories still), are able to treat fundamentalists with respect, and they are able to find comprimise and be willing to find a way for everyone to move forward, then fundamentalist christians will be way more apt to work together.</p>

<p>Fundamentalist Christians have deeply entrenched values about everyone having the right to have a life and work for a good one. If the Millenials who are trending towards other religions are willing to really listen to fundamentalists, then I believe progress can be made in both groups finding a center.</p>

<p>As it stands now, Millenials are not doing a good job of this, and seem to be pretty content with bashing Christian Fundamentalists in the face with changes and telling them to suck it the fuck up, so yeah, parties are pretty entrenched at the moment, and feelings are hurt. We&#39;re gearing up to be a new Isreal/Palestine, Sunni/Shiite conflict right here at home.</p>

<p>Get your popcorn world. Not that it matters, I am doubtful there aren&#39;t other major powers keen on &#39;bringing order&#39; and obtaining a shit ton of natural resources by invading the minute we turn into a clusterfuck.</p>

<p>See, that&#39;s the problem you didn&#39;t think through. You introduce far too many inefficiencies and transaction costs when every routine interaction between strangers - like, say, trade - has to occur between two people who think they might have to defend themselves from the other. Guns can attack as well as defend, after all, so everything I ramp up as a <em>defense</em>, <em>you</em> have to treat as a prelude to <em>attack</em> and therefore match or exceed, for your own defense.</p>

<p>Merchants with guns and customers with guns soon become merchants with standing armies and customers who shop in roving warbands (after a customer kills and robs a merchant, and a merchant kills and robs a customer, respectively.) Eventually merchants and customers are tired of individually shouldering the escalating transaction costs of armed protection, so they band together and create a space where people can meet for business but are <em>collectively</em> defended, with deep suspicion cast on anyone who says they need their arms for &quot;defense.&quot; (Because they&#39;re already defended.) And, of course, the armed guards are sworn to initiate force dispassonately, evenhandedly, for the benefit of all, and only to defend the commons.</p>

<p>Boom. Now you&#39;ve got the monopoly on the initiation of force and given the AnCap game away completely. It didn&#39;t require a government or the imposition of it from outside; it was the natural evolution of trying to live and get anything <em>done</em> under anarcho-capitalism. Eventually one of the merchants figures he can enjoy the <em>benefits</em> of the guarded free market without having to kick in his share for the guards, and now you have the dilemma of unlimited free riders vs. compulsory taxation, and guess which direction that winds up going, too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what police are - the people running around with guns (and the monopoly on violence.) If you have police, you don&#39;t have anarcho-<em>anything</em> by definition.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a system based on adjudication of contracts rather than laws winds up with contract terms that are assumed to be agreed to by your physical presence in a jurisdiction, <em>and</em> a body of &quot;standard interpretations&quot; of contractual terms (so that adjudicators don&#39;t have to tediously rule on identical contracts in identical ways, over and over again) and boom, now you have statutory law.

<p>That&#39;s like saying most people are familiar with Marxist philosophy, which simply isn&#39;t the case.

<p>That&#39;s what &quot;monopoly&quot; means, there&#39;s only one of it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>100% of my day is voluntary, peaceful interaction, because I live within of the collectively secured commons I described two posts ago. I don&#39;t live under an AnCap system, which is why all of my interactions with people can occur on a defenseless, utterly inactive security posture, with astonishingly (astronomically) rare exceptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re values line up with AnCap more than you probably realize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t contend that AnCap proponents have different values than I do. I contend that they haven&#39;t thought AnCap all the way through - reasonable participants in an AnCap society will react reasonably to the practical problems they face from each other by, reasonably, instituting systems of governance and civil order that are the exact opposite of what is intended under that system.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t write your representative.  Don&#39;t even visit their local office.  Go to your capital and watch what they do in committee, on the house floor.  Who they wave to.  Who they recognize.  Who they&#39;ll stop and talk to.  It probably ain&#39;t gonna be you.</p>

Besides, .MLK was successful in many ways - although you don&#39;t mean to be pessimistic you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, still not really being pessimistic. </p>

<p>The internet is already compromised.  The US law against government distribution of propaganda was repealed, and there&#39;s a federal disinformation branch dedicated to the internet now.  That&#39;s not even including party internet campaigns, corporate incognito campaigns, or just plain trolling.</p>

<p>It also made public figures rising from grassroots movements impossible.  Remember those massive NSA data centers?  Get too lippy, and maybe they&#39;ll reveal your porn habits to the public.  Maybe they&#39;ll publish some texts between you and a mistress, leading to public shaming or disillusionment in your movement.</p>

<p>MLK was successful in many ways, but died young because he didn&#39;t give up.  I didn&#39;t mean to take away from the man at all, it was amazing he still succeeded as much as he did considering the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/fbis-suicide-letter-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-and-dangers-unchecked-surveillance">strain</a> they put him under.</p>

<p>There are also other ways of shutting down communications, just look at Turkey.  Governments realize that Twitter and Facebook can make it easier to stage revolutions, and will just shut them down when coups begin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to take an awful lot of frustration to get things moving in a good direction.  Hopefully, people don&#39;t get to the point that they resort to violence before we can start making changes in the traditional sense.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m much more focused on discussing what&#39;s wrong with the government than trying to start a protest, I&#39;m worried that people won&#39;t be educated enough by the time we get to a point to change things to even demand the right changes.  Already, we have people springing for Trump, who openly admits that he wants to strip even more freedoms and strengthen the federal government further, making it harder to criticize.  </p>

<p>I agree that corruption is a very big problem, and near the top of the list in the US, but people are just creating different problems by voting in someone potentially harmful to democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The union division seems self-defeating, but there&#39;s actually good reason for it in some places. The town I grew up in was centered around GM and IBM manufacturing plants. In the mid 80s, the union demands became too much and some dominoes began to fall. IBM closed their local plant and retreated to the northeast. GM closed their plant and sent the jobs to Mexico. Conrail sold to CSX and moved key people to Pennsylvania. This whole county was devastated, and it could have been avoided if the unions had been more flexible. The country and the world were on the verge of a huge financial boom and we missed it entirely. </p>

<p>Now we have Walmart and several factories that hire temps at $9-11 per hour as our primary employers. Good job, UAW. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You summed up the dream we are being sold quite nicely. &quot;If you are not wealthy it is your own fault, because some people have gotten rich in this system&quot;. But the number of those success stories is getting smaller and smaller in proportion to the population as time rolls along. The truth is that not everyone can be rich and most of us never will be (this is a matter of available resources/population growth, not work ethic). If we accept that reality then we can focus on making life better for everyone, rather than trying to step over our neighbors to try and be one of the increasingly elusive &quot;success&quot; stories. </p>

<p>&quot;America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, &#39;It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.&#39; It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: &#39;if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?&#39; There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.</p>

<p>Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>B) The idea that because there is only one government, suddenly everyone is oppressed is a bit silly. if only due to it&#39;s irrelevance. Humanity has propelled itself forward to where it is now by choicefully oppressing one group to accomplish things for another subset. Pretending that everyone would be oppressed is utter foolishness. After all, if everyone is oppressed, who is doing the oppressing? Oppression always requires 2 groups.</p>

Early civilizations can do that, but in the late stage of any empire, when they begin great welfare programs, it just attracts parasites and dissidents. It&#39;s funny how many of the factors that lead to the fall of Rome are being seen again today. Funny in a morbid way, but funny.</p>

<p>While our population is rotting from the inside out from the unhealthy lifestyle white collar work promotes, we are tied to those same white collar jobs to give us the healthcare we need to stave off the diabetes, heart disease, and stress-related illnesses that working 40-60 hours per week inflicts on human bodies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re talking about an uprising with threat of violence then the answer as to &quot;why not?&quot; Is because that&#39;s the way wrong move. We&#39;re still the most prosperous empire of all time with a very high quality of life. Election reform and gerrymandering are huge issues that need immediate attention but that and most issues need to be solved at the voter level. The small minority that is ready to abandon democracy for a forceful takeover would not have public support and would deservedly be prosecuted for severe charges. Still the best way to be heard is with your vote, especially for local elections. More educated voters leads to better local candiwhich leads to better state and national candidates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I swear to God we had an informant or a tracker or something show up last June in our first Bernie meeting.  (Before he got big, it was just a pro-Bernie reddit meet-up.)</p>

<p>Our very first meeting, and we had a woman who ended up being an agitator and trying to cause dissent in our group.  It was really odd.  I know that you always have characters, especially in left leaning groups, but I always felt like this woman was always searching for people&#39;s soft spots.</p>

<p>She finally overplayed her hand by directly accusing someone of not being pro-Bernie enough or something stupid, so I kicked her out, since that was the only rule we had - no attacking each other.</p>

<p>She&#39;ll still pop up in other groups, except now she seems to be a Republican.</p>

<p>And we&#39;re just a small city, I can&#39;t imagine why they need trackers in our area.</p>

<p>The next step is severing your ties to what holds you back...debt, working too much to live how you want, being caught up with getting that new &quot;x&quot; that just came out.</p>

<p>I think A lot of this can be solved by more informed financial decisions, planning, and simple living. Sure you might not have the wealth of bill gates, but you will contentment and comfortability</p>

<p>Because it isn&#39;t all corrupt. Because if you want to change the law, that&#39;s the only process by which it happens. Literally nobody can be compelled to act against their own interests - or more accurately, what they, perhaps wrongly, <em>perceive to the in the public interest</em> - because a bunch of kids spend an afternoon inconveniencing commuters. Because those people are committed to a vision that operates on the scale of years or even decades, and <em>you</em> get bored in two hours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&#39;m guessing your saying that Dr. King shouldn&#39;t have protested in the streets and in his marches, and should have just run for president or another political position? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What law did Dr. King get passed? What structures of power did he overturn? What corruption did he uproot? None, but some of the people <em>he inspired as a figure</em> ran for office, achieved office, overturned those laws, and wrote new ones. Actually accomplished the things you credit to Dr. King. And, not coincidentally, are exactly the same people you&#39;ve been led to believe are &quot;corrupt.&quot; Funny how that works, isn&#39;t it? Like maybe there&#39;s someone with a vested interest in you getting so worked up and hopeless that you burn down your own neighborhood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it goes back to my first sentence, I see way more like-minded people on here than I do in real life and that confuses me.</p>

You&#39;re basically saying that protestors are wasting their time by exercising their rights.

<p>Everybody is concerned with self-preservation. Even if you&#39;re a genuinely good, will-of-the-people common good type of politician, you recognize that your ability to advocate for your constituents is <em>fucking nothing</em> as an <em>ex-</em>officeholder. You have to win the election to even get a chance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect you to believe this - but most politicians, at both the local and national level, are motivated by a genuine ethos of serving the public. That&#39;s why everybody thinks their own congressman is &quot;one of the good ones&quot; even when they&#39;re on the other team. Because they&#39;re almost <em>all</em> &quot;good ones.&quot; Sociopaths cannot <em>generally</em> (rare exceptions, like Ted Cruz) garner the support or build enough of a consensus to achieve political office.</p>

<p><em>And this is still the system we have.</em> Think about <em>that</em> for a minute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re basically saying that protestors are wasting their time by exercising their rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m explicitly saying that protesters are wasting their time. Protests are always a waste of time - they&#39;re a way for young people to vent their frustrations without needing to commit to the tedious, hard work of actually changing society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who will have been the ones inspiring them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely nobody who spent an afternoon chained to a park bench to protest TPP. Martin Luther King, Jr. inspired a national movement of rights advocates and a generation of lawmakers because he spent <em>decades</em> working in his community and becoming a trusted figure. And because he spent decades talking to people, and listening. And because he was <em>lucky</em>. None of which you can do by getting <em>woke</em> on Twitter. If you want to change society - and, honestly, I want you to, don&#39;t get me wrong - then you need to plan to do it after <em>decades</em> of work. Work that you need to start now. And it doesn&#39;t start with protests, same as how you can&#39;t start a family just by masturbating a lot.</p>

<p>Start in politics, maybe. You could major in law, or political science.

    <div class="md"><p>Im 35 and a single father of a young toddler boy. I understand. And i understand the opportunity hasnt presented itself for it to matter yet. There are no &quot;mass&quot; protests. Once there is organization and protests , then it would be worth it to miss a day or 2 from work to support the cause for a better tomorrow. To stay home at that tkme or to stay at work, would just be shitty. </p>

<p>And just an adendum, most jobs allow for sick days or vacation days. Be worth it to take one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &quot;should be A given&quot; not that they &quot;should be given&quot;. That letter makes a big difference. I meant should be a given for the protesters.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that the majority of the people that are aware of the political quagmire we find ourselves are content with the situation. I&#39;m not, my family&#39;s not (immediate &amp; extended as well), my friends aren&#39;t content, my friend&#39;s friends, aren&#39;t content, my psychiatrist isn&#39;t content, my professor&#39;s aren&#39;t content, nor is anyone else I&#39;ve talked to regarding the state of politics/America (USA). This being said, only two of the people in that group have expressed that they are afraid though; seriously, the expression of fear = weakness in people&#39;s minds and people are growing further and further apart due to use of technology incessantly, political stance, and the media constantly reminding us that strangers are the enemy, and that even you probably don&#39;t know people/your neighbors as well as you think you do. The police are portrayed as the enemy in the media, idk about you but I know my local officers and they are not my enemy; they&#39;re always there to help when I or my community needs it. Scare tactics are being used by the MSM and have been for years. Terrorism seemed at an all time high this year. Some shit about people dressed as clowns that rob, beat, possibly kill, and prey on children (Haven&#39;t seen it personally, but people I know claimed to have seen it). Anyone who is aware of North Dakota knows what happens to protesters, thank god someone bailed them all out. The racial divide portrayed by the MSM seems awful although I&#39;ve had nothing but positive encounters with everyone who&#39;s not my race that I&#39;ve come in contact with for years now. Despite this I&#39;ve had conflict with people of my race this year. All this BS regarding Russia hacking the USA/DNC (not true in my opinion) or Obama/Clinton/Biden threatening them with cyber war/NATO moving tanks/troops to Russia&#39;s border and Russia moving submarines, ships, missiles, and likely troops as they seem to be negotiating an alliance with China. The hatred of conservatives by liberals, I&#39;m libertarian ideologically, I don&#39;t hate liberals at all, but I think those who support Hilary are naive. Regardless, politics is dividing us for 100% sure, some people I know are ignoring the situation hoping it will end and they refuse to speak of it, some people I know who are highly invested in a party winning still won&#39;t speak of it, some of us whisper in private about what we really think is going on, but never in public for some reason perhaps we are afraid of consequences/appearing foolish (being labeled as conspiracy nuts)/simple fear of conflict with those who are invested in one of the candidates winning. People can&#39;t miss work generally speaking, most people live paycheck to paycheck, capitalism was designed this way/or at least it was a consequence deemed acceptable, even those with savings can&#39;t afford to lose a job in this economy; I believe that once this consequence of capitalism (people need to work) was realized it became part of why those in power are trying to get away with shit; no time to protest their BS so people must rely on a broken system to prevent these situation, which obviously isn&#39;t working. It&#39;s easier to pretend this is a normal election with normal consequences, people are fantastic at lying to themselves or are in the MSM&#39;s coma and nothing could wake them up/literally not possible. The only way to unite would be through the internet, which is being watched just like smartphones are being watched, they&#39;d know a revolution before it became a protest, wouldn&#39;t get too far essentially. My area isn&#39;t affected, nor is the area of anyone I know, yet. I&#39;m injured, walk with a cane at 25, nerve damage, it&#39;s healing but I&#39;m in no place to protest physically. There are approximately 180 million people between the ages of 15 and 60, they could possibly make up the revolution, but again organizing it is a problem. I don&#39;t know how much of the police/national guard/army would actually try to stop people and how much of those groups would join in. This being said it&#39;s possible the revolution would get nuked if it were large enough or at least seriously bombed. Also if there was a a severe revolution, I think China or Russia or both would attempt to conquer us. The situation is a vast mess that is complex and we do not know what TPTB would have in store if mass protests or a revolution took place. Between being socialized to be divided and thus needing the internet to organize on a scale large enough to make a difference; we&#39;ve essentially been doused with water before we could even spark. Not to mention I think that a revolution would be turned into a civil war if it were deemed dangerous enough, globalists vs capitalists or a race war. Also a large enough revolutionary spark could spark WW3 in order to prevent a national fire, TPTB would rather remain in power in a war that could cost them their lives even if not directly fighting, than deal with a revolution that would probably require them to take up arms at some point and lose a significant amount of the power they have. </p>

<p>In the end I think it was technology that got us in this situation for tons of reasons. A revolution could be an opportunity to decimate the population for TPTB, less people means more resources per person and less complications. IDK what comes next, I am very concerned, I feel powerless. Do I want something different than what we have, of course I do, but until I see a half decent idea on how to right the path of this country for the people, I&#39;m watching in horror like most other people. I&#39;m smart, but not smarter than TPTB, they have many of the best and the brightest coordinating their strategy; some psychiatrists have considered me one of the best and the brightest on my good days, but I&#39;m only one person and the system is designed so that enough of us who are in the top 1% of intelligence will never be able to get together in a large enough quantity to formulate a plan to reorganize the system for the benefit of the populace as a whole. TPTB would probably take me in as additional brain power, but I&#39;m not smart enough for them to seek me out and I&#39;d never them out, nor would I join if asked. I&#39;m for the people, but until we the people have a real idea that has a significant chance of success or are absolutely forced to come together and defend ourselves or the few privileges (wish they were rights) we have left, I will do what I can from the sidelines in a peaceful manner but that is all, especially given my injury.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Obama&#39;s immediate departure on some of his campaign rhetoric, combined with the financial bail-out, opened eyes of Democrats. As time went by the FOIA documents increased, Anon and Occupy happened and more eyes opened. Remember that baby boomers had a life of indoctrination and confirmation bias is a powerful human trait. Sometime people are changing but don&#39;t know it. They hear something, reflect for a second, and then move on. Each of these experiences has a cumulative effect. My epiphany was the result of my new understanding of history with the filter removed. Context is vital. When I realized the depth of the coups in the 60s and the brazen conspiracies resulting in JFK, MLK, Jr., Bobby&#39;s, and MX&#39;s deaths and heard POTUS Transparency label Snowden a &quot;traitor&quot; I understood that it was 1-Party.  Within a relatively short time people began fleeing the Dems, even before Sanders announced. I&#39;m surprised by the number of people who have left the Party and will not participate in a rigged system designed to benefit the elite. As more information is revealed people struggling with these issues will join with others for the real 2-Party system: the Party of the people and the Party of the govt.</p>

<p>NO DAPL? They&#39;re getting cracked down on HARD by the police.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the double-edged sword of decentralized protest movements.  MLK / Malcolm X provided leadership and a symbol  to rally around.  That single leadership role also provided a target for government to target, disrupt and assassinate.  I think Occupy was starting to find political clout, hence the country wide coordinated effort to dismantle all the sites at the same time.  (Fusion centers run by CIA / LEOs --Local Enforcement Agencies).  BLM is also being hindered by their reliance on social media to communicate.  Opsec is poor in that group.   Also - once the press at any of their protests are shunted into the &quot;allowed press zones&quot; any arrests / brutality can take place away from the cameras.  Police / Government agencies have learned their lessons from the Civil Rights movement.  Control the press, control the images going out, you will control public opinion on the matter.  We&#39;ll never see photos of police dogs attacking children or cops using firehoses on the national news again.<br/>
Police crackdown on DAPL has effectively controlled the press narrative.   Coupled with the fact that I&#39;d guess that 50% of the american public don&#39;t care that Native Americans are being brutalized by the police /  private security forces.  </p>

<p>What? Which ones are asinine? It&#39;s likely you have a misunderstanding of many of them thanks in part to the media. His policies are outlined on his website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when is the last time the government has been in the people&#39;s control?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question! Let&#39;s make it 0 days here next Tuesday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how will reducing taxes on the rich to their lowest point since Reagan give The People more political power?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not to give the people more power, that&#39;s to help the economy. But, since you bring it up, taxing gives more resources to the government and, as a result, more control. If the government wasn&#39;t corrupt and we weren&#39;t in an economic shit hole, then a bump in taxes could be useful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has said nothing about the winner-take-all, first-past-the-post voting system. He&#39;s said nothing about gerrymandering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These things are not priority at this moment. They can be corrected after the Swamp is drained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing about unequal access to education.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what sense? If you&#39;re talking about racial inequality then yes he has. What was the last rally of his that you watched? I&#39;m pretty sure he talked about this in his Michigan rallies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing about drug decriminalization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can&#39;t say much about this one cause it&#39;s not a huge issue to me personally. I know he has spoken on legalization on medical marijuana as well as letting states decide their own policies past medical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very little in general about the aspects of the establishment he actually aims to fix (other than trade deals).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go find his Drain The Swamp speech and first 100 days policies. He wants term limits among several other things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m looking for a candidate who actually understands the ways in which the system is rigged and has a practical agenda for starting the unrigging process. </p>

<p>The media? You mean his own words? My understanding of his policies comes from his own mouth. If I were to go on his website and have my mind changed, it either means he is <em>completely</em> unable to articulate his goals and plans, or it means he&#39;s being very dishonest on one or both fronts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not to give the people more power, that&#39;s to help the economy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our country should&#39;ve shaken off the blind, &quot;help the economy&quot; rhetoric after Reagan failed. Trickle-down economics has always been a way to pull the wool over the eyes of working whites. It still is. Strange that the system is rigged against the poor due mostly to the elements of laissez-faire capitalism in our economic system, yet Trump proposes that he&#39;ll un-rig it by strengthening those same elements. Preposterous. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the government wasn&#39;t corrupt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we uncorrupt it. This can happen. Campaign finance reform (the big one), tougher gerrymandering regulations, more protections for voting and penalties for voter suppression, voting structures that don&#39;t disenfranchise tens of millions of people (like winner-take-all and first-past-the-post systems do), increasing transparency, etc. These should be the central government reform package for anyone who claims to be anti-establishment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These things are not priority at this moment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To clarify, my point is that they really should be. The fact that he hasn&#39;t seriously grappled with them is the reason I don&#39;t take him seriously as an anti-establishment candidate. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll clarify me education point by saying that anyone can say &quot;unequal access to education is a big problem,&quot; or &quot;The achievement gap is a big problem.&quot; Ultimately, from what I&#39;ve heard from him on the subject, he doesn&#39;t seem to have an acceptable understanding of the problem. He&#39;s advocated for school choice for example, which is already a big thing, and which in many ways exacerbates the achievement gap and educational inequality. If he&#39;s said anything sensible about Title I reform, please point me to it because I haven&#39;t seen it. </p>

<p>(I&#39;ll also note that, as I&quot;m not a Hillary supporter, I haven&#39;t seen much more than clips of her rallies either. Yet I have a far more thorough understanding of her policy agenda and preferences than I do of Trumps from about the same amount of talk). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know he has spoken on legalization on medical marijuana as well as letting states decide their own policies past medical.</p>

<p>yeah, I confirmed this by looking it up. My mistake. Wish he&#39;d focus on it more, being that it&#39;s such a huge way the establishment maintains power and causes suffering. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked up his so-called 7 point plan. The term limits thing is something I support. The rest of them are either silly or are far more complex issues than he seems to understand. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll clarify once more. I&#39;m looking for a candidate who actually understands the ways in which the system is rigged, has a <strong>practical</strong> agenda for starting the unrigging process, does not play upon the xenophobia/racial resentment/fear-mongering that have been a part of rigging the system in the past and present, has a healthy (but not manic) skepticism of globalization, and can actually convince me that they have what it takes to actually implement what they say they want to. </p>

No one wants to be the crazy, right-wing, conspiracy theory nutjob that goes and protests, and if you&#39;re unhappy with the system its because you&#39;re unsuccesful in life. Whenever a protest comes along,  occupy wall street or whatever, I hear at least one person say it&#39;s &#39;just a bunch of losers with nothing better to do&#39;. We can come here and bitch about how corrupt the system is anonymously, but everyone tones it down when their image is on the line.</p>

<p>Pieces of the Occupy movement have been very successful - here in SF they&#39;ve stopped hundreds of evictions, nationally one group eliminated 15 million in personal debt, they&#39;ve raised the overall awareness of the public, and the profile of whistle-blowers like Snowden.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simple enough to say, but when the rubber meets the road it&#39;s a completely different story. People&#39;s lives in the US are still relatively comfortable and people have jobs, family, friends - obligations basically. A tipping point hasn&#39;t been reached yet and in any revolution there has to come a time when revolting is more agreeable/comfortable than daily life. </p>

<p>The risks are enormous with a very small chance of actually making an impact when you really think about it. Look at what&#39;s happening in North Dakota - the protesters are fighting an oil pipeline and the gov has turned against them. The protesters are getting attacked by militarized police with armored vehicles, dogs, sound cannons, pepper spray, etc... and that&#39;s only over a pipeline, not a complete overhaul of gov. (I&#39;m not arguing for or against this protest). </p>

<p>Very powerful people are pulling the strings and I have no doubt they&#39;ll do anything to keep their power and they have unbelievable resources at their fingertips. It&#39;s incredibly naive for someone to look at this very complicated situation and say &quot;why can&#39;t you sacrifice short term enjoyment for a better life for future generations.&quot; It&#39;s just not that black and white. We&#39;re talking about the US gov, not some tiny country with little influence. As soon as a group of people started to revolt it&#39;d be squashed swiftly and in such a manner as to discourage others from following. Then there&#39;d be a mass PR campaign to paint the revolt as some crazy end-of-worlders at it again type of thing. </p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m done ranting now. If you feel so strongly about it, you&#39;re welcome to march the streets of Manhattan declaring a revolution and see how far you get. </p>

<p>I&#39;m voting for him because the next President is going to pick AT LEAST one Supreme Court Justice, possibly more.  That alone will determine the direction this country will head for at least the next 20 (maybe 30) years.  Getting Hillary in will for sure get two on the bench (Ginsburg would resign to get a young version of her on in her place) possibly 3 if Kennedy or Thomas resign since they&#39;re getting old.  This would be a huge blow against the 2nd Amendment, as I believe that Hillary would appoint justices with an eye towards reversing <em>Heller</em> and <em>McDonald</em> as per her idea that they <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/leaked-audio-clinton-says-supreme-court-is-wrong-on-second-amendment/">&quot;got it wrong&quot;</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with <em>Obergefell</em> but not for &quot;fuck the gays&quot; reasons.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why: there is no right to marry ANYWHERE in federal law.  Legally speaking, it&#39;s a contract between two people to merge them into one for various legal purposes and on a religious level, well, that&#39;s religion but NOT a right.  What SCOTUS did in <em>Obergefell</em> was essentially to say that because you have a &quot;right&quot; to marry straight people, then the right must by extension include gay couples as well.  Which is all well and fine, except that such a right <em>does not exist</em> in law anywhere to where they can argue that.  If it&#39;s not a right that exists for straight couples, then you cannot extend something that doesn&#39;t exist to gay couples either.  So what SCOTUS did was to essentially &quot;legislate from the bench&quot; and wright this &quot;right&quot; into law, and THAT is something I have a huge problem with because it fucks with the balance of power between the 3 branches.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>As for <em>Roe</em>, I disagree with the ruling on the same principles.  A &quot;right to privacy&quot; gets extended to allow a woman to have an abortion (which, technically speaking wasn&#39;t even in the original scope of what <em>Roe</em> was about).  Honestly it should have been left up to the States to decide, in accordance with the 10th Amendment.  But SCOTUS took the due process clause under the 14th and applied it in such a gross manner to this issue.  That does NOT mean that I want to see it overturned, but this is another example of legislation from the bench.  Congress needs to be the ones to write laws like this because that is their job, it&#39;s not up to SCOTUS to wildly apply an unrelated Amendment to a case to create a new right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I differ in an extremely important way. You seem to view us as a collection of states who has a federal government. I vehemently disagree with this interpretation, it worked when we were a tiny country but not anymore. I view us as a single country who has states for local issues. Marriage, abortion, etc are not local issues. And as for legislating from the bench, that argument can stuff it when our Congress has done essentially nothing for years, if Congress won&#39;t get shit done, well then the country will move forward anywau, even if you disagree with how broad those decisions were, you admit they were the correct ones. Government has to govern, Congress wont, so the president and courts do instead.  </p>

<p>And fuck leaving it to the states, we tried that, Jim crow laws, legal discrimination against minorities, legal to fire for being gay? Not ok. The states can&#39;t be trusted to legislate when it comes to protecting their own citizens because those states have turned to effectively mob rule. So the Fed has to come down and knock sense into them. People need to get past the &quot;states rights&quot; idea because it essentially only gets used to trample minority and individual rights.</p>

<p>Study the Constitution, and more importantly, read the Federalist and anti-Federalist Papers if you have a chance.  It really shows the mindset of the Founding Fathers, which was to have strong States&#39; rights/government and a weak Federal government meant to tie them together on something that would effect the country as a whole, IE: armies, interstate commerce, etc.  They were flat out scared of having happening what is right now: a strong Federal government that, through a <em>very</em> minority rule (9 people and I would even argue 1 since the President appoints the Justices), being able to decide and overwrite what the People of a State decided to pass as law.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as for legislating from the bench, that argument can stuff it when our Congress has done essentially nothing for years, if Congress won&#39;t get shit done, well then the country will move forward anywau, even if you disagree with how broad those decisions were, you admit they were the correct ones.

</blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t &quot;stuff it&quot; because Congress isn&#39;t doing anything.  You do not get to disregard the very system of government set up just because you don&#39;t agree with how &quot;efficient&quot; they are being at something (or not).  If the country wants to move forward, then you need to get the legislators OUT of Congress and elect new ones that will properly represent you and your interests, because <em>that&#39;s how our government works</em>.  What you want to do is have rulings done in your favor through executive fiat (another word: autocracy).  You&#39;re wrong in that government has to govern, that&#39;s not the purpose of it in terms of what the FF&#39;s set up.  They aren&#39;t supposed to be ruling over us, they are supposed to be <em>serving</em> us instead of acting like they&#39;re our lords and masters.  </p>

<p>So if you say that the courts and President have it within their power to act because Congress won&#39;t: if a bill can&#39;t get through Congress officially saying that marriage is only between a man and a woman, then do you agree that the courts and President should be able to unilaterally act to make that law themselves?  You cannot argue that they should be able to do it that way because it serves YOUR interests and then in the same breath turn around and scream bloody murder if they try to do it on a matter that you don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>Also, I never said the decisions were correct, so please don&#39;t put words in my mouth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a fundamentalist, constitutionaliat or anything like that. I really don&#39;t care what the founding fathers wanted. Government has to evolve, and part of what has happened in our country is that the powers in the executive and judicial branches has expanded as the legislature has shrunk back from working. Admittedly it requires a very liberal (as in wide, not left leaning) interpretation of the constitution, but if you have a problem with it then the legislature needs to fix our laws, which since they haven&#39;t is why we are in this place in the first place. A confederation of states idea just doesn&#39;t work in the modern world with a global culture and global economy. We are one country and one people and we need to act like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t require a liberal (same meaning as your use) reading of the Constitution.  It flat out states in there the purpose and powers of each branch and it does NOT allow a provision to have the executive and judicial branch assume more and more power just because the legislature doesn&#39;t act.  Again, if you want change, then you need to follow the procedure that&#39;s in the Constitution which is to vote out those that don&#39;t represent your interests and vote in those that do.  </p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t agree with the legislature not acting the way <em>you</em> want it to does NOT give you the ability to do a run-around on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perfect quote for this by John Pilger. When the American way of life was sold to Vietnam to pacify them.</p>

<p>&quot;“My orders”, said the Marine sergeant, “are to sell the American Way of Liberty as stated in the Pacification Handbook......The people of Tuylon finally came out, and stood in line to receive packets of Uncle Ben’s Miracle Rice, Hershey bars, party balloons and several thousand toothbrushes. Three portable, battery-operated, yellow flush lavatories were held back for the arrival of the colonel...Of course, the villagers had no idea what the colonel was talking about. When the Marines clapped, they clapped. When the colonel waved, the children waved. As he departed, the colonel shook the sergeant’s hand and said: “You’ve got plenty of hearts and minds here. Carry on, Sergeant?”&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the civil rights movement, which i think is still obviously going on, succeeding by busing people in.  </p>

<p>but whose going to ride on a bus to washington d.c. now?  the &#39;i have a dream speech&#39; is a wonder of the world.  but once you have mild success, they shut down those avenues.  we&#39;ve seen occupy and ferguson, and there&#39;s a reason police are getting heavy weapons, they are scared to go certain parts of the city already.  If the population is armed and hates you, thats when &#39;police&#39; dont work and you need &#39;military&#39; and this coincides with when your government has no popular support whatsoever.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting ready for, it has been a steady slide in that direction I see no reason to expect otherwise.  Freedom isn&#39;t becoming popular anywhere else in the world, the big places are making a harsh totalitarian turn.   Turkey.  Singapore.  China.  Russia.  Pakistan.  Africa.  The Phillipines.  There will be no awakening or rennaisance in these places, humanity is being locked down hard most places.  </p>

<p>And wouldn&#39;t they love being able to trot out the example of the American experiment to reinforce their claim to autocracy?  reducing us to burning trash cans and rubble by our own hands?     </p>

I think <em>maybe</em> we could get something effective with a 1-2 day event <em>if</em> we got millions, in total (maybe it&#39;d have to be tens of millions), all protesting in their nearest major city.

<p>It&#39;s time to demand a constitutional amendment.  This amendment would create reasonable, modern voting system that is democratic in nature.  No more electoral college.  No more duality system.  No more, pick one voting style.  and NO MORE MONEY IN POLITICS.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very sad. I come from a country where a lot was accomplished by peaceful protest, and we have some protest every year. Every year there are marches for some ideas, like every year there are feminist marches, gay marches, free cannabis marches in many cities for example. Every time our government wants to pass some policy that people don&#39;t like there are protests - ACTA? Protests. Too much religion in the government? Protests. Abortion ban? Protests. CETA? Protests. And so on. People here on general have it harder than in the USA I believe, the standard of living is lower, the amount of things you can buy with average salary is lower, yet people find the time and strength to walk out on the streets and say loudly what they think. Many even volunteer in the organization of the marches and protests in their free time. You can do it too!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We did during the DNC convention. And even the times before the convention. Many marched on Washington to get the money and conflicts of interest out. It was epic. Mostly peaceful, mostly not covered by the major stations, but it was crazy.</p>

<p>It was the warning shot across the bow.</p>

<p>The thing with America is - we&#39;re huge. 
When it comes to other countries, they are the size of our states. It&#39;s very costly and time consuming, things that a lot of Americans don&#39;t have, to March on Washington. </p>

<p>Free Speech and the right to peacefully assemble has to be granted first through an application process which can be denied for whatever the fuck reason. then only in special designated zones. We are loosing our rights. </p>

<p>The United States has a long history of bloody uprising. When we had desegregation, the race riots, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Vnpj5Z0xk">people shot by the national guard trying to protest Vietnam and Cambodia</a>. Civil War. We are trying everything we can through official means. </p>

<p>When those means are thoroughly exhausted, then things go to the streets and when they do - they aren&#39;t pretty. Our government doesn&#39;t give a shit if we vote for them or not. They&#39;ll just shuffle one stooge out and drag another one in. </p>

<p>Look at Michigan. Short of armed ocuped standoff, Snyder does whatever the fuck he wants. </p>

<p>Hey let&#39;s get a good push for legalized marijuana. Start early in the year and do a good weedroots signature campaign. Wonderful we have more than enough signatures and enough time to file it for a formal ballot proposal! Snyder gets wind of it, directs the Republicans to change the law in the middle of an election year to severly shorten the time frame to collect signatures for a ballot and retroactively void all these guys work. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s recall Snyder for Flint! Ok 11 petitions get sent up and they have to be approved. Republicans in charge approve the one written by the Tea Party (the one that will sit on a shelf collecting dust) and not give any traction to it. Oops! Looks like you didn&#39;t get the signatures! What a pity!</p>

<p>State overwhelmingly shoots down Right to work (for less) on the ballot. Snyder does it anyways. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the Democrats? Too busy playing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhRUe-gz690">black knight</a> corruption game so much they&#39;ve basically blown both their feet off and allowed the Republicans to chop off their arms. 
Our government acts with imperialistic impunity with complete contempt for the public. </p>

<p>So just wait until the inauguration. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVT4o0-be1E">It&#39;s going to get messy.</a></p>

<p>I really fear it this country is ready to blow up. </p>

<p>Here is what I want our Canadian friends, who have given us so many wonderful comedians though the years, and the rest of the world to do. <strong>Mock us</strong> Viciously, brutally, cynically, and constantly point out our hypocrisy, the corruption, and be a source of free speech and outrage. </p>

<p>Our problems go far beyond our borders because the people with money and power pulling the strings over here, also extend into Canada and other parts of the world. <strong>Follow the money and then mock us.</strong> Isolate us if need be, but show us a mirror. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the election cycle, our resident Canadian at work  (he actually holds dual citizenship now) sent me that &quot;Canada for President&quot; video. It seemed funny at the time.  Given this election cycle, I would happily let the Canadian people take a crack at running this place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very curious as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really pissy about this entire election and so is everyone I know. It&#39;s probably the first thing my entire immediate family has agreed on, ever.</p>

<p>Weirdly though, as angry as I am about this whole charade, I can&#39;t help but be a little excited about the outcome of this election.</p>

<p>No matter who wins next week, Trump or Clinton, there&#39;s going to be some shit going down.</p>

<p>If Trump wins, a lot of people are going to be pissed and blame it on Russia. A lot of people will be scared because the media has portrayed him as the next Hitler. There&#39;s going to be a lot of folks feeling like they were robbed, cheated and that the election was tampered with by Russia or the FBI.</p>

<p>If Clinton wins, a lot of people are going to be pissed and blame it on our current government and the elite. They&#39;re going to feel cheated. They&#39;re going to feel like the election was rigged. People are going to feel like she was going to win regardless and it&#39;s only going to further prove to a lot of people that she and our current government are corrupt.</p>

<p><em>Either way</em>, no matter what, the aftermath is going to be a shitshow and I can&#39;t wait to see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that&#39;s true but you can&#39;t really get too deep into it with too many people. Especially when you bring up stuff that&#39;s discussed in here to people that don&#39;t even know that rabbit holes exist all around them. You have to pick and choose your spots, otherwise it&#39;s pointless. I, like I&#39;m sure many here, have spent years and years learning and enlightening myself to the truth and you can&#39;t awaken someone in one conversation. It takes time and acceptance and an open mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true! My sister, my ex, my brother... people closest to me talk about how bad Trump is and how they need to make sure Clinton wins or we&#39;re fucked. That is pretty much the extent of their conversations before they settle in to watch TV. I mentioned petrodollars to my ex and she said &quot;I&#39;ve never heard that word. What does it mean?&quot; and I started to explain and she tuned out. She said &quot;Oh that&#39;s ok, I gotta go feed the dogs&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree! but the caveat is that our seeming agreements aren&#39;t strong and don&#39;t actually encourage dialogue or prompt problem solving. We agree that &quot;the system doesn&#39;t work for us&quot;, that &quot;politicians are corrupt&quot;, etc. But it&#39;s cursory, conversational, and mainly a display of verbal etiquette. It&#39;s like saying &quot;nice day&quot; when the weather&#39;s shit - &quot;yeah, it&#39;s all ugly, but there&#39;s nothing anybody can do about it&quot;</p>

<p>So, our so called &quot;agreements&quot; are essentially about our collective decision to do nothing and watch it all burn to the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure its a lack of caring - granted some people are happy to &quot;go along to get along&quot;.  However I think it could be more related to the great mythos of America being a &quot;land of opportunity&quot; that rewards people for &quot;pulling themselves up by their bootstraps&quot; / &quot;the rugged individualist&quot;.  The country as a whole buys into this idea that if you just work harder, scrip and save, come up with that one great idea you&#39;ll make it.  And that anybody can make it big / be a success.<br/>
This is taught in schools, pushed in mass media, built as a part of advertising -- it is literally part of the American culture.  When someone fails at making this &quot;dream&quot; the failure is internalized.  They failed because they didn&#39;t try hard enough, they didn&#39;t have enough education, they were lazy, etc.  For people to break of this mindset and realize that actually the game is rigged against most and rigged for the very few and privileged is a painful, scary event.  If I were religious, I&#39;d equate it to a massive crisis of faith.  There are lots of people who would rather buy into the fantasy of &quot;america dream / progress&quot; rather than have to confront the ugliness / anger / depression of realizing and admitting that we&#39;ve been sold a bill of good that is lies.  There is a huge element of feeling utterly powerless after this realization.  TV / fried food are escapes from this feeling of powerless - it provides a momentary shot of dopamine / escape from reality.  </p>

<p>Sure, they aren&#39;t total and complete subjugation of your political process by megacorporations, but a lot of the problems many Euro-like countries (including Canada, Australia, etc) have is their own people often pay more attention to US politics than their own, and forget their own systems of government still almost ubiquitously have room for improvement.</p>

Sadly, hardly any of them go onto sites such as this to either find their own conclusion or figure out for themselves why things are the way that they are. My thing is even with everything that has been released about both candidates, none of us are taking to the streets, and sadly I think it is because of this reason (media), along with 60 hour work weeks, fear of losing job, work, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We literally can&#39;t get out and protest.  If you look back at many peaceful protests, they are met with violence.  The sit in about the 1% on Wall street.  people were forcefully removed.  People are being arrested in droves and attacked by private security teams on private property in North Dakota.  That infamous pepper spray guy on the college campus where the kids are just sitting there.  The people have no advocates.  In the US the rich are literally able to buy the end result they want.  I will probably get downvoted for conspiracy theory stuff or whatever, but Clinton bought and stole the nomination from Sanders.  The person the majority of the public wanted to run as Dem.  Her rallies may have 100 people show up.  MSM only paints her in a positive light and won&#39;t cover things like the ND pipeline or other shit that is actually important.  All of those stations are owned by like two families and highly invested in HRC.</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse is that a majority now want all new candidates, but we can&#39;t have them.  The system is so screwed that we can&#39;t get new people.  We are forced to select from a bullet to the brain or a noose around our necks.  When you could select any scientist, engineer, college professor and have a better candidate for President.  Hopefully this year will be the start in a real change in government in the US.  and Hopefully that change is term limits for congress and much more.  Hopefully more avenues for regular joe&#39;s/jane&#39;s to make their way into politics as well.  Not millionaires who are there to get richer and play games for their rich friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. </p>

<p>What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a phrase -&#39;complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism&#39;- jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. </p>

<p>He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front -- it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. </p>

<p>As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. </p>

<p>It was not the man&#39;s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, that&#39;s when he&#39;s on point.  </p>

<p>The problem is for example when he talked about Hillary&#39;s scandals compared to Trumps.  He brings up a couple of easily debunkable examples of overblown scandals related to her and then ignores any with real meat on them.  So in that instance he&#39;s sweeping them under the rug instead of discussing them.</p>

<p>He&#39;s obviously been using his platform to help Hillary this election, and with Trump running, it&#39;s hard for me to blame him, but it&#39;s pretty blatant.  He also had a very one sided hit piece on Jill Stein and Gary Johnson recently.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In this regard, at least, I think he was starting with the presupposition that you, the viewer, liked Jill Stein and/or Gary Johnson and were genuinely considering voting for them based on the policies of theirs you liked and agreed with. So, with that assumption, he doesn&#39;t need to tell you their merits, because you already know them. Instead, he focused on their flaws to point out no candidate is perfect (and let&#39;s not forget, older folks who support Hillary are afraid the youth won&#39;t turn out for her, and she needs the youth of the country to win). Now, that could just be my cognitive dissonance justifying to myself why I waste half an hour each week to watch whatever snark Oliver has in store for the week, so take it as you will. </p>

Barring the other big 2, in the event of any major internal revolution, no other nation is influential enough on a geopolitical scale to  have any meaningful influence  - China and Russia&#39;s elite make no attempt to even entertain democracy and dissent is quickly quelled.
But Americans are different. More patriotic, with a history of rebellion against authority turned dictator. I&#39;m 28 and figured out around 15ish that the institutions we depends on DO not have our interest at heart. From the Banking system, to media all the way to elected officials - all corrupt, self serving parasites, leeching from the populace whilst selling dreams of change...</p>

<p>But now both sides are pissed. Dems and Reps. As a result of Wikileaks and other whistle blowers, large swathes of formerly ignorant people are realising what we knew all along. And what was once called &#39;conspiracy&#39; is now accepted as fact. 
 On such actions, at such times, are real revolutions begat. </p>

SJW&#39;s are a prime example. They want their own pronouns, so they force it. Now it&#39;s &quot;mandatory on campus.&quot; </p>

<p>If enough people make noise, it just becomes the rules. That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to go. Democracy is flawed. This nation is fucked. Good riddance. I&#39;d personally like to see it go back to the wild west, but I know that won&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand how bad we are brainwashed here in the US, and that most people don&#39;t even realize it. It&#39;s not their fault. We are indoctrinated from the time we begin school to stand and pledge allegiance to the greatest country that ever existed. We are taught all through school that we have the most freedom of any country on earth. Our education model is that of pre-WWI Germany&#39;s state run thought control, which was brought here by the Nazis in Operation Paperclip; true history is not instructed. Our &quot;news&quot; sources only run stories of distraction, division, and misdirection while we are force-fed meaningless celebrity gossip; all thanks to Operation Mockingbird, CoIntelPro, etc. We are continually pitted against one another over which party is the most patriotic. Anyone who disagrees or thinks critically against an official government report is labeled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and ridiculed in accordance with CIA Document #1035-960.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let me clarify. Your vote for the president has no worth in that case.</p>

<p>The difference between, let&#39;s say the German system and the American one is that every vote counts towards the party. If you chose to vote blue in a red state, your vote is dismissed. It doesn&#39;t count into the total. In the German system it counts no matter who wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is in the American system you actually get to vote, albeit indirectly, for head of government. The German chancellor is elected by the Bundestag. You&#39;re not really comparing like for like here.</p>

<p>Not every state has winner take all elector votes, some are proportional. In this case a red vote in a blue state can matter.</p>

Police joining forces with the protesters... It might have happened in a long past America, but now, they are getting paid to throw concussion grenades and shoot people with rubber bullets (and sometimes real bullets). They are on top of the world doing this shit. Ain&#39;t gonna fuck up a good thing by joining the scum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Protesting is not against the law, however the police / courts use any law on the books as a cudgel to paper one up in court costs / lawyer fees fighting to get the charges dismissed.  You can be arrested for &quot;failure to comply with a police officer&quot; even though it would get thrown out / plead out in court.  If you&#39;re being handcuffed and you lose your balance and bump against an officer, you&#39;ve now &quot;assaulted an officer&quot; - if there is no video evidence, good luck having your word go against a cop.  If you fight the charges and you lose, you risk a conviction which can cost you the right to vote, rent an apartment, keep a job, etc.  If you win, you&#39;re still out law fees, court costs, lost time at work, behind on your bills, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government has made it very risky to protest. I forget the exact details but there is some shady thing where if there is a CIA agent in the area the protest becomes illegal and has to be broken up. So they send a CIA agent to a protest and it&#39;s over. Something like that. Maybe someone else can tell the details better. </p>

<p>Our police have become militarized by and large. This attracts a type of person who wanted to be in the military but couldn&#39;t or didn&#39;t. They salivate over putting on the military stuff and driving military vehicles and holding automatic rifles etc etc etc. Our government is not cracking down on vicious racist bigoted sadistic police officers. They are allowing these things to happen on a large scale, to keep the people terrified of them. I used to protest a LOT and yeah I got arrested but wasn&#39;t treated like a dog. Now, you have no idea what they are going to do to you, and if you will even survive a protest even if it&#39;s peaceful. Our government sends out &#39;agent provocateurs to start the violence and that gives the police a reason to retaliate. </p>

<p>Protesting is a very very risky business these days.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few things actually are stopping this;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Divide and Conquer techniques used on the populace (exaggerated racism, (if this then that) &quot;If you don&#39;t support Hi11ary<sup><sup><sup>leet</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>spreak</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>to</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>prevent</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>bot</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>notification</sup></sup></sup> , then you support Trump, vice versa&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Disinformation/propaganda: The media here are legally allowed to feed us propaganda even if it has no base in reality. (And do so regularly)</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulation of information sources(adding to the above): &quot;Normal&quot; people are rarely exposed to &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;(or as of late, conspiracy fact) because it is not in the media&#39;s (read: Hi11ary&#39;s) interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Laws enacted &quot;for the children&quot; or &quot;to stop the terrorists&quot;: There are a few terrorist attacks that are quite questionable(9/11 for example). Laws passed after these events almost always infringe on our privacy rights. The &quot;for the children&quot; laws usually involve drugs (read: Natural and/or &quot;illegal&quot; drugs), exaggeration, fake pedo&#39;s, etc. Recent events that used this particular method are the recent Kratom issue, the &quot;San Bernardino terrorist&#39;s iphone&quot;, the constant barrage of gun regulation laws attempting to be passed, and finally the keylogger on windows 10(which I already suspected there would be simply by how hard M$ was pushing the platform, and I bet they were ordered to by a 3 letter organization).</p></li>
<li><p>The shaming, mocking, and ridicule of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;: Since JFK, the term &quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot; was being actively pushed to have negative connotations with &quot;tin foil hats&quot;, &quot;aliens anally probed me&quot;, &quot;flat earth/concave earth&quot;, &quot;Aliens from venus/mars&quot;, and it&#39;s sad to say; &quot;Jet fuel doesn&#39;t melt steel beams&quot;(It doesn&#39;t but I&#39;m sure you all know that). We associate &quot;Conspiracy&quot; with crazy people, and so whenever we hear about these &quot;conspiracies&quot; we(<em>general populace</em>) turn off our brains and it goes in one ear and out the other. Which is why if you try to reason with a Hi11ary supporter they just go &quot;Ok&quot; and act like nothing happened.(Or they get triggered)</p></li>
<li><p>The final nail in the coffin: We can&#39;t afford it. We all know the first person to start a movement usually ends up dead/homeless/ridiculed. Martin Luther King Jr is a good example. Another one is Nelson Mandela, and a very recent one is Assange. Due to the fact that not enough people are informed about our issues due to information manipulation, <em>we think</em> there are not enough people to start a movement, so <em>we think</em> attempting to start a movement would be suicide without cause.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR It comes down to the fact that most of the normal populace don&#39;t hear about these conspiracy theories, and when they do (Via MSM) they are portrayed as Crazies, so they discount any conspiracy as completely nuts. It&#39;s mostly due to ignorance via manipulation of information.</p>

<p>Us Americans are an odd bunch. Quick to be opinionated, ready to criticize and condemn but slow to take action. To motivate a group to take real action you have to slap them in the face by removing something they care about. So as long as the internet works the battle will be raged from the sofa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of us who avoid going to protests have seen the results.<br/>
1. It gets ignored. (media blackout)<br/>
2. It gets insulted. (media goes 120% anti-protest, with pundits spouting lies and misinformation for the following 2+ weeks)<br/>
3. It gets infiltrated by members of the opposition and those infiltrators push the crowd over the tipping point into violence.  Some of them even start violence on their own. (throwing rocks and bottles at cops, or even shooting into the air)</p>

<p>The Ferguson protesters (not the rioters) caught plainclothes cops on video and kicked them out.  Not every crowd was lucky.<br/>
The 99% protesters had multiple plainclothes cops showing up, breaking laws, and causing violence.<br/>
Once the protest has &quot;turned violent&quot;, the cops are given the authority to go full Rambo and do what they enjoy.  This story happens almost like a playbook, every time there is a protest that the authorities dislike and want squashed.<br/>
4. Don&#39;t forget the worst part of going to a protest.  Cops are now using license plate scanners to acquire all the data on people who parked their cars at a meeting site for a protest.  Your information is now &quot;marked&quot; for the rest of your life as being a malcontent or worse.  They get caught doing this at Gun shows too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans are literally sheep. The high occultist call them &quot;the dead&quot; or &quot;the unbegun&quot;. People have no aspiration to become self fulfilled or learn as much as possible. People just want their televison, entertainment, sex, and money. Its been designed like this on purpose. The rulers have made it impossible for people to wake up. Anyone who speaks like this is automatically labeled as a crazy. Anyone who suggest changing things is ridiculed, just check the replies i get. I can see why people would rather shut up and walk around like a sheep. It would take some disastrous event to even plant the idea of taking action. It really brings me down to the point of tears. Ive been posting info for free documentaries about this on those redbox stations, they just get taken down. Couple years ago i used to post positive signs around my neighborhood, theyd get vandalized/taken down. I try to talk to people, they dont believe /zone out/call me crazy. It really feels inevitable that humanity will end up in a totalitarian dictatorship with no real sense of what being a free human was. I keep saying it seems the only thing that has to potential to save us is psychedelics, for this too i will get ridiculed. Thanks for posting this and making it to the front page. It seems anytime i try to bring up a subject like this it feels like there some sort of censorship going on or just gets buried. Keep up the good work and spread this podcast that very clearly talks about this, its called &quot;What on Earth is Happening&quot; by Mark Passio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus, I hate the level of arrogance in the ops post. The level of projection is incredible. Firstly the world isn&#39;t looking on in horror. It might appear that way if your world view is shaped by a media who&#39;s only interest is controversy for the sake of profit. Critical thinking of the most basic level would allow you to see that 7 billion souls of this planet are 99.9999% focused on getting through their day, and couldn&#39;t give a fuck about this election. </p>

<p>Secondly, there isn&#39;t a political system on the planet that isn&#39;t horrendously broken right now. Do you think I give a fuck about the US election, living in Ireland, being fucked over by a never ending parade of useless ex geography teachers?! </p>

<p>Get of your high horse, and stop taking your world view from whatever media pipe you&#39;re sucking on.  The vast majority of this world would give their right arms for the first world problems of having either Clinton or trump, as opposed to genocidal tyrants for life who can only be removed by the military.  </p>

 Just because other countries are worse doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t strive for a better government. We&#39;re supposed to be a shining example, not a cesspool. We are also probably the only country that CAN break the chain if we got together and did something. </p>

<p>Obama will go down in history as the Great Divider. Not since the civil rights movement have racial tensions been this bad. Never has the wealth gap been so pronounced. The states lose more rights every year. We are headed for a calamity of nefarious design. Guess who will be there to make it all better?

But I don&#39;t  understand the passionate hatred flowing from both sides against and for two morally vacant and criminal individuals that want to lead your country. Why can&#39;t more people see that they&#39;re both elitist liars and direct their passion into a productive avenue of change? Start a movement to resign from the process. Boycott the vote on a massive scale to show your discontent, or something to that affect. Leaving your homes and your jobs is not an option, but work together to innovate a different solution instead of spreading hate and dividing yourselves further. I don&#39;t know.

<p>The global misinformation campaigns effect our country the very same way. It also very clear by this post that you are quite ignorant in your own right (no offense).</p>

<p>I recommend taking this new understanding to broaden your own perspective, gain some new education, and being marching in our own streets first.</p>

<p>Everything from the way Canada does healthcare, to automotive, to agriculture is all severely corrupted by corporate interests and career politicians. Justin Trudeau is currently compromising our ecosystem at record rates.</p>

<p>Or how about you start learning about something small. Something social and fundamental to the way we interact and unite as a people. The university of Toronto and Ottawa are currently brainwashing centers for a new form of cultural dissonance.</p>

They have tanks, mraps, sound cannons, water cannons, rubber bullets, bean bag projectiles, tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, flash bangs, they can disrupt cell phone reception, send drones in to get pictures of the protesters, send in agent provocateurs, plant evidence, beat someone with their batons... you&#39;re right, no chance. </p>

<p>If armed protesters showed up at a gathering the police would very likely call in the National Guard, proclaim martial law, and boom! We are then so firmly under their thumb we can&#39;t move.  </p>

<p>I think Trump is dangerously incompetent, a buffoon, I think he is very disrespectful and rude and has terrible diplomatic skills. I think he has little to no understanding of how international commerce works, he has been consistently anti-intellectual, and I don&#39;t like his stance on global warming.</p>

<p>And finally, I think his tax plan is literally retarded. Trickle down economics have literally never worked, idk why anything thinks they are about to work now.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t understand why all these people on here think he is so anti-establishment, anti-globalist, when he plans on giving all his billionaire friends the largest tax cuts in history? Come on...</p>

<p>Much of this is opinion and I would be of the opposing belief. He looks competent, he has a successful business and ran his campaign against the tide quite masterfully. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s anti-intellectual, recently he talked about how he wanted to expand NASA.</p>

<p>His tax plan sounds pretty sweet for the average american to my ears, it might even help people start businesses. Maybe his friends might get tax cuts, but I&#39;m pretty sure he planned to fix the gaps big companies are using to evade taxes. In the end, taxing a fraction of big company revenues is better than trying to take a bigger part that they simply dodge.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t own a TV, and don&#39;t consume any MSM on a regular basis,</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I can understand that, if you don&#39;t have a good grasp of the history of &quot;trickle down economics.&quot; The TLDR is that similar policies have never worked. It&#39;s been thoroughly debunked that giving tons of tax breaks the most wealthy will do anything to help the middle class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>watch his speeches, listen to what he has to say</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m the kind of person that thinks it is foolish to believe anything that a politician says while giving a stump speech. Everyone will get better jobs, crime goes down, we defeat the terrorists, and everyone gets a free pony. It&#39;s the same shit all the time.</p>

<p>I judge candidates by their record. And frankly, Trump&#39;s record does not impress me. All the evidence I&#39;ve seen indicates that he would probably be a used car salesman right about now, if he his daddy wasn&#39;t rich as fuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He looks competent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to me, and millions of other people.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is subjective. And my opinion is literally the opposite. I think his campaign has been a dumpster fire, literally one of the worst run campaigns in history.</p>

<p>I mean, Hillary is one of the worst candidates to ever run, before. Completely loaded with scandals, literally under FBI investigation, the least trusted major party candidate in history, the list goes on... And yet, Trump is struggling. I know, many Trump supporters blame that on &quot;media bias,&quot; but again, if Trump was so competent I would think he could turn that around a little bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is largely opinion, as is all of politics.</p>

<p>So thank you for listening to my perspective.</p>

<p>If you take anything away from this exchange, I hope it&#39;s the understanding that someone can be against Trump without being some braindead plebe that gets all their information from CNN.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with jealousy or personal feelings, and I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d bring that up. Honestly, I thought we were having a pleasant exchange, a refreshing change amidst this divisive election season. But then you go and make some crack about me being jealous of Trump&#39;s money? <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t come here to debate about Trump&#39;s credentials. You wanted to know why some people don&#39;t like Trump, and I think I gave you a very reasonable and polite response.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not go to that <em>other</em> place, where we devolve into bickering about sources credibility and the subjective nature of &quot;success.&quot; There&#39;s really no point.</p>

<p>So please, in the interest of civility, can we just agree to disagree? I have no attacked you for your believes, so please be respectful of mine. We&#39;re both American (i think), and I feel that we both want a better future for our families and countries.</p>

<p>Though I&#39;ll reiterate that thinking Trump would be a used car salesman if it wasn&#39;t for his father is simply wrong. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t have made it this far but he has ambitions and works towards them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not american but a neighbor from the north (hopefully we can vote trudeau off next time around).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll end my side on this note: If I was to vote in the US at this very moment, any other choice than the one that will send the country into mass civil unrest on top of the possibility of an all out war with russia is the right choice. That choice can be composed of Donald, Gary, Jill, other independents. I&#39;m not 100% on Trump&#39;s policies, there are some I don&#39;t like, but I think he&#39;s the most qualified of the lot to get this country back on track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A worthy election for sure.  Alas, the only way I foresee such an event is if Trump wins. Hillary is jailed (assuming the seemingly impervious mystical forcefield that surrounds her ever  malfunctions). Trump then goes on to make a complete and utter uberfuck of the Presidency. The masses on either side drop their partisan bullshit as the veil finally descends on the non stop fuckeries that we call Government. Both sides push hard and get Sanders and Paul on the ticket. We get to see what an actual election looks like when both candidates are working for the people. 
Imagine that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s strategic desensitization. The more politicians can make this a shit show the more people tend to care. Pretty soon the only people caring are the people who are already invested in Trump/Hillary and then they move to snag those whales so that they can win the election.</p>

<p>Apathy of the politically moderate/sane people is literally going to make trump/Hillary win the election.</p>

<p>That and the fact that the 99% of the voting populous have no idea about how the government is run or to what affect the president has control over the economy/law making/etc and we&#39;re relying on these idiots to select the next president of the United States.</p>

<p>How many times have you heard people &quot;oh, president made these promises, and said that things would be completely different from previous president, but things are going just as same as the previous presidents administration&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s because The presidents hands are tied in a lot of aspects including paying back favors from all the lobbyists and sponsors that they borrowed money from. All of them are to some degree puppets. I mean if we elected Bernie Sanders as president, you&#39;d probably see him get criticized for all the shit that president Obama continued on from Bush and what not (Though honestly, if he had been elected atleast we&#39;d have a moral president that seeks to empower the nation and not someone who makes the story about himself and shout how he&#39;d sue his enemies or grace the nation with his power and what not.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in downtown San Francisco in 2003, in what&#39;s been recorded as the largest protest in human history, a global protest which was in many major US cities. The few times we were mentioned in the press, our numbers were underreported, we were characterized as being anti-American. The largest protest in the country&#39;s history did nothing to stop the war. </p>

<p>I was one of those wide-eyed optimists out on the streets a few years ago for Occupy. I wasn&#39;t really all that surprised that the cops didn&#39;t like us or that we were demonized in the press. What did surprise me was how many people&#39;s voices suddenly went silent when we asked them to act in accordance with what they&#39;ve been saying for years. What did surprise me was the bizarre skepticism coming from the center and the left of the movement. </p>

<p>Campaign finance reform is quite possibly the most important issue in my country, but between voter apathy and entrenched systems of power, I cannot do a thing to budge it. In a democracy, you get the government you deserve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the MSM everything is Russia&#39;s fault. But seriously, America is probably one of the worlds most propagandized nations next to North Korea. The people have been brain washed into believing that what is happening right now is somehow of no real concern...and most Americans believe it because some sold out talking head on <strong>TV</strong> said it. The MSM is creating reality for those people and that reality has them going about their business as if its just another day at the park.</p>

<p>Americans who are awake are looking upon this election with horror. Trying to protest brings on the Militarized Police State and protesters are demonized by the MSM and tasered and shot by police. That&#39;s how the establishment makes it go away if it&#39;s even reported on to begin with. Last summer there were huge protests in Washington DC. Never made the TV and was never talked about. Is as if they never happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the occupy movement.</p>

<p>The fact is, the country us largely split.  The left and the right hate each other too much to realize we are getting fucked from both angles.</p>

<p>Even here in Burlington Vermont, where there are Bernie stickers on every car, where I&#39;ve seen Bernie walking around a hundred times before he was famous, people are still going to go out en masse and vote for a pro war candidate because their hatred of the right is deeper than their hatred of corporatism.</p>

<p>Other parts of the country it&#39;s the same thing, but the hate is in reverse.</p>

<p>Trump has a lot of ardent supporters, but most of them just hate the left.</p>

<p>Anyone but Hillary, anyone but Trump.  That way we end up with one of them, guaranteed.  Every four years it&#39;s the same </p>

Been doing it for 15 years now and will continue todo until the fascists shoot me! Some things are more important than what&#39;s on TV or Reddit. Some times you just gotta take matters into your own hands and remember that you&#39;re a GOD DAMN CITIZEN OF THE MOTHERFUCKING UNITED STATES!!! THEY&#39;RE NOT GOING TO FUCK UP MY SHIT WITHOUT A BIG TIME FIGHT!!! ENOUGH OF YOUR PUSSY EXCUSES!!! Image if the founding fathers just said, &quot;Fuck it! It&#39;s too hard to stop the British! They have an army, a world class navy, crap tons of money!&quot; If you think protesting in the streets doesn&#39;t have an effect on people in this day and age where we&#39;re all connected digitally GUESS THE FUCK WHAT? YOUR WRONG MOTHERFUCKER!!! Occupy Wallstreet, Black Lives Matter, this shit has an effect! Yeah it&#39;s hard BECAUSE FREEDOM AIN&#39;T EASY BITCHES!!! TRUMP AND CLINTON DON&#39;T REPRESENT FREEDOM, THEY&#39;RE THE ONES TO PUT THE BOOTS ON THE THROATS OF YOUR KIDS! The future is worth fighting for and life is too short to worry about dying.

    <div class="md"><p>As an American living in Germany, I&#39;m watching all of it go down and I&#39;m fucking livid. I have heated discussions about it with friends from places that aren&#39;t America and many of them think it&#39;s so funny because &quot;haha broadsinatlanna is only 5&#39;3&quot; and she&#39;s screaming about politics, so cute.&quot; Only one of my friends from the U.K. has said that he doesn&#39;t understand why everyone isn&#39;t as up in the air about it as me. U.S. politics effect the world and everyone is laughing at us when in reality it&#39;s going to fuck everyone. It&#39;s just going to fuck the U.S. harder. Watching my country blatantly ignore the corruption that the DNC has working inside itself and listening to all alive former presidents say not to support Trump and having no other option because my option was literally cheated out of the race is fucking deplorable. I want America to be thrown into chaos and misery. I want this election to happen and no matter who wins I want banks to fail and wars to break out and poverty to sweep the nation so we will grow a fucking spine and oust OUT whoever got in and revamp the shitty system we allowed to be born and grow into what it is today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems the deep state is so entrenched, that nothing will dislodge it. When electing a president, you&#39;re really choosing a mascot for the deep state. The battlefield is not out in the streets, but in our minds. Modern protesting involves meme magik, trending twitter hastags and yelling &quot;Bill Clinton is a Rapist&quot; whenever a television camera is broadcasting live. So just because we don&#39;t see people in the streets, it doesn&#39;t mean there are alternate forms of protest available. Look what&#39;s happening at Standing Rock, and what occurred at the Bundy standoff. As soon as a protest erupted, agent provocateurs infiltrate the group to compromise it.  Regardless of physical protest, modern war is fought in terms of information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very simplistic statement. Social media is for some, just a place to rant and get nothing done. But while those of you who just rant and do nothing were sitting around ranting some of us were using social media (and still are) to bring about change. How do you think the protests at Standing Rock got as much publicity as they did? (while still no where near enough, it would have been way less if not for social media). How do you think people in the tens of thousands got out to see Bernie Sanders at his rallies? If it weren&#39;t for social media, very few would have known about Sanders. How do you think BLM came to be? Again, social media. Did you see that one video of the guy who got shot by a cop while sitting in the passenger seat , the cop holding the gun to the guy as the guy bleeds out? You think anyone would have ever heard about that if not for social media? </p>

If Hillary is elected I think these movements will only start to grow and with the emergence of all these leaks, people will begin to search for and weed out corruption more and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow Canadian I have to think it&#39;s because they keep the population just above water enough that they don&#39;t want to lose the few conveniences they do still have. Once we pass the tipping point of working not being worthwhile anymore and having to fight for anything, you&#39;ll see people organizing to start mass protests or movements. That&#39;s what&#39;s happened in other countries. It gets just bad enough that you can&#39;t afford to live anymore and are pushed to see it&#39;s worthwhile to topple the system as it stands. It may take a while and the government might be able to keep it just stable enough to prevent it from ever happening but I kind of doubt it.</p>

<p>My point is that your original argument about American&#39;s having an &quot;infinitely more prosperous life&quot; is ridiculous and if you look at average incomes, that becomes very obvious.

<p>While the First Nations stand together in solidarity to stand up for water, where are the marches, where is the political unrest to protest the fact that you have a system that is so broken that the rest of the world looks on in horror.</p>

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t exactly safe to discuss civil obedience. Besides the NSA, local police departments read and monitor this website too. So keep that in mind. </p>

Ask anyone why they would vote for Hillary or Trump and they say its because the other candidate is awful, yet they dont even consider the third option. In fact, they criticize you for even trying to play outside the system. Honestly, whoever gets elected its the goddamn politician we deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are two main factors - the lack of unity and cooperation in our society, and the apparent lack of meaningful ways to protest.</p>

<p>One thing that has been interesting/sad this election is that most Americans clearly agree that our current system is broken, but disagree fundamentally on what exactly the problem is or how to fix it. I think this is largely intentional. In particular, the pro-corporate hyper-capitalist philosophy has been codified into not just law but also culture. Half of this country has been socialized to believe that these things are virtues, and that individual accountability is more important than compassion and cooperation. This is partly a product of our country&#39;s history and, I think, partly a product of deliberate corporate control of our culture. It is extremely difficult to find agreement between this half of the country and those who brand themselves as &quot;liberal,&quot; even if we agree that things are awful.</p>

<p>The second is that protest just has not seemed effective. It&#39;s hard to find the link between private agitation and policy changes. How do you boycott Wall Street?  I think the media also has a large role in this. Investigative journalism has been so marginalized in this country that most people have no idea that the press is nominally there to hold institutions accountable. This makes protesters feel even more alone and powerless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we&#39;ll lose our jobs, our wives will leave us and we&#39;ll become homeless. Or at least that&#39;s what we&#39;ve grown to believe.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, most of us are ignorant, and amongst those that aren&#39;t, there&#39;s a large percentage of people that simply don&#39;t care; their best personal plan of action is to continue living their life as they currently are, so whatever else is going on in the country or in the world just simply doesn&#39;t matter. In the face of this widespread attitude, I have a feeling a lot of people that would otherwise speak up are convinced nobody will support them, and nobody will care. </p>

<p>Protesters are considered a nuisance in the public&#39;s eye at best, criminals and jobless agitators at worst. Police brutalize and murder people every now and again, and it goes unanswered. There&#39;s a lot of resentment in this country, but it mostly seems to get misdirected. Nobody really trusts anybody or counts on their neighbor to have their back, so we tend to just lash out at each other.</p>

<p>I fear things are simply going to have to get a lot worse before the average person feels any sort of call to action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the most likely reason is that we enjoy our standard of living too much. It&#39;s easy to conform, go along to get along, and reap the perks of being the useful idiot. Not that I condone this, but this seems to be the undercurrent of the current situation. </p>

<p>That being said, I think people feel dominated by a lack of privacy and the average American probably feels like they have a lot to hide(smokes weed illegally, cutting corners on shit, the shame of laziness etc...) small things compared to these revelations but personally relevant to individuals in a position to do something about it. </p>

<p>Plus our culture has placed so much trust in institutions that barring an authoritative announcement that you should be in an uproar, most people are just trying to pay the bills and get ahead. Doing good and reliable work is valued, having an opinion is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, Clinton really isn&#39;t any different than the average president from the past 28 years. People hate her because they think she&#39;s an entitled bitch, and maybe she is, but 90% of the stuff you read on here (110% on <a href="/r/t_d">/r/t_d</a>) is, in the words of Trump, <em>wrong</em>. Trump is the real danger. He&#39;s like letting your racist, sex offender uncle become president. There&#39;s nothing to protest about unless he wins, somehow. </p>

<p>America is not the land of the like-minded. You have to have a government that works for everyone, and that means making some people unhappy. So when there&#39;s a lot of people screaming about how things aren&#39;t working out for them, I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re not the focus of the country. There are tons of different types of social circles, religions, jobs, preference all sorts of shit. You&#39;re not a special gem, you&#39;re not a unique flower. It will never be like it is in smaller countries because we do not have a collective culture or mindset. Our president must work for all the people. That means a moderate. Not a liberal, not a nutjob. Someone who will piss everyone off at some point. It&#39;s what a melting pot <em>needs</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would give you gold, if I could afford it. I am about to become unemployed at the end of the month because I&#39;ve had a mental breakdown after finding out my three year old son has Lukemia. I&#39;ve become so afraid of the outside world that I have pissed myself trying to go to work. I work as a bank teller at a local credit union. I&#39;ve been denied any federal assistance on mental health basis. I take up to sixteen pills a day to make me &quot;normal&quot; to be able to function in society. Fuck this world, I hope their is a planet left after the investation of humans eradicates themselves. I&#39;m angry. I&#39;m heart broken that I have been lied to by my up bringing and government. What would you have me do? My coworkers shop for Etsy makeup bags and stalk people on Facebook all day. Even my manager sits in her office on dating sites and when you try to talk to her she goes on and on about whatever dick she had last. FML I&#39;m too angry for this counrty. Sorry for the ranting and crying. This society has made me crazy. I&#39;ve worked my entire life, paid my taxes, did what I was told, and when I need help where is all my fucking money I gave them? Cause I&#39;m in small run down 400sq foot house in an alleyway next to the half way house of child molesters, (whom have more respect and politeness than most police I encounter), for $900 a month. How am I supposed to live? There are millions of people with stories like mine in this country, and when I bring it up, people chuckle and say &quot;that&#39;s the government for ya&quot;. God damn it m&#39;erica put down your lattes and wake the fuck up.
Edit: this weekend is my 30th birthday. Yay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow Canadian living in the capital, my question for you is why aren&#39;t we protesting our own shitty governme-[FURTHER SPEECH HAS BEEN DEEMED OFFENSIVE TO THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM ALL CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA. ROB FORD WAS A TERRIFIC INDIVIDUAL AND AN UPSTANDING MAYOR. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM LEARNING ABOUT ALL PIPELINES - THEY DO NOT CONCERN YOU. THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CBC ARE <strong>NOT</strong> VIOLENT SEXUAL ABUSERS. ROGERS AND BELL ARE SIMILARLY UPSTANDING COMPANIES - THERE SIMPLY <strong>IS NO</strong> OLIGOPOLY.]</p>

<p>Seriously though, we&#39;re just as bad. The current (year!) government, with a few choice exceptions, stands for the opposite of progress. If it&#39;s not Kathleen Wynne trying to sell off every last piece of government we have, it&#39;s the west being beaten down by the oil industry. If it&#39;s not that, it&#39;s complete government inaction on the all-too-common deaths and disappearances of <strong><em>Canadian Natives.</em></strong></p>

<p>Keep your eyen on the <a href="https://www.trudeaumetre.ca/">Trudeau Metre</a>, fuck the police, and inspire revolution here, and for our southern allies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corporations own the place.  No matter who is in charge, corporations will own the place.  Money controls the world, and the USA has a lot of money.  Most people can&#39;t even fathom how much money is in the US, but to put in in perspective, the state of California alone would have the 7th highest global GDP if it were a nation. What this has done, is created a two party system that guarantees the diversified money in the US will be served well, and continue to make money.  </p>

<p>This didn&#39;t really exist before the mid 19th century, in particular with the passing of the 13th Amendment, which was supposed to enfranchise former slaves into the &quot;democracy,&quot; but was actually mostly used to establish corporate personhood.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people are stunned. Naturally, the Trump supporters are dancing in the street. It&#39;s interesting to me that Trump got a million fewer votes than Obama&#39;s opponent in the last election, and two million fewer that Obama&#39;s opponent in the previous election. There&#39;s been a lot of talk about Trump&#39;s &quot;silent majority&quot; of angry voters who didn&#39;t appear in any poll, but mysteriously materialized every night. I doubt that. I think Trump&#39;s unpredicted mandate came not from Trump fans, but from those who despised Hillary too much to overcome their contempt for Trump. I held my nose and voted for her, but I can certainly understand younger, more idealistic people unwilling to do that. I think in the end, the Democrat Party brought on their own defeat with their sabotage of Senator Sanders&#39; campaign in the Primaries, as Sanders had the same level of popular support as Trump, and a far more positive message. What will happen now, who can say? International leaders are being cautious in their reactions, modestly. Yet Russia, and the anti-EU elements of Europe have been ebullient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh please go protest yourself</p>

<p>Look at what&#39;s happening right now. The reason the sub is all about Hillary is because she sits at the nexus of world power. She is the cold as ice heart of the establishment, and do you know what&#39;s happening right now? People are fighting the fuck back!!!! </p>

<p>Thanks in large part to Assange and Wikileaks the public has been armed with critical information. The FBI (for reasons we probably don&#39;t understand) is siding with the people. The news media has been utterly exposed. </p>

<p>So go ahead and make a cardboard sign and march it around the streets of Toronto. Down here in the US we are fighting an information war.. And this subreddit is consumed by that right now BECAUSE WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT MATTERS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why:</p>

<p>1: Too many people are still too comfortable and or in denial.</p>

<p>2: Cops seem to love an excuse to play dress up, drive their APCs, and shoot people. That&#39;s scary for anyone with anything to lose, even people who only think they have something to lose. Not to mention, push too hard and they ruin your life.</p>

<p>3: A system this large and corrupt requires extraordinary measures to change. Either a very significant portion of the population taking extreme actions (work stoppage, unified march, etc)</p>

<p>Assuming the financial system isn&#39;t 100% rigged at this point, there&#39;s a chance consumer credit will collapse, akin to 2008 mortgages, and a whole lot of people will suddenly have much less to do and a nasty consumption habit they can no longer support. </p>

<p>On top of that, a whole lot of creditors will go under and I imagine it will cascade through the markets and fuck up a lot of things.</p>

<p>Maybe then a little reality will sink in and we can get to fixing our world.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union had to go broke and become nearly non-functional before they saw a major change.</p>

<p>The people in real control are always the same. They never have to run for office and they never leave their positions of control.

    <div class="md"><p>She , like all political contenders, lacks any kind of conscience.  She finds she is not at fault for anything, ever. That self image is incompatible with what she should actually do.  The main reason we only get people without conscience, empathy or remorse  to run for office is the road to power requires that kind of  unbalanced all out drive  to even consider the journey. Maybe we should choose only people with a proven conscience to be  contenders. That is, IF we ever got any choice in the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can’t help but compare yourself against the old timers. Can’t help but wonder how they would’ve operated these times. There was this boy I sent to Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn’t any passion to it. Told me that he’d been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he’d do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don’t know what to make of that. I surely don’t. The crime you see now, it’s hard to even take its measure. It’s not that I’m afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job – not to be glorious. But I don’t want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don’t understand. You can say it’s my job to fight it but I don’t know what it is anymore. More than that, I don’t want to know. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He would have to say, okay, I’ll be part of this world.</p>

We scoff at conspiracy theories. We embrace conspiracy theories. We hate our system, knowing that it&#39;s been misused and corrupted and exploited.

    <div class="md"><p>System isn&#39;t perfect, but either President is hardly the end of the world. Checks and balances are in place, so the Presidents&#39; largest role is proposing direction for the country. Proposing. Not mandating. Gov&#39;t gears grind so slowly that it&#39;s roughly 1 major change per 4 years. (De-escalation in the Middle East and the ACA were Obama&#39;s big 2.)</p>

<p>There are side effects like a change in culture/narrative based on who is in office. In this respect, I don&#39;t mind that Hillary seems to be playing the game REALLY hard, by that I mean politician-ing her ass off.</p>

<p>The media tells a story, and it&#39;s full of hyperbole for ratings. Not everyone sees that clearly, so it&#39;s kind of douchey that the media continues in that regard.</p>

<p>So our current system isn&#39;t perfect, but you either vote for &quot;Team What&#39;s Mine is Mine, Don&#39;t Tell Me How to Live My Life&quot; or &quot;Team We&#39;re Probably Getting Taken Advantage of, But At Least We&#39;re Trying to Help Those Who Need It&quot;.</p>

<p>TL; DR I don&#39;t think our country is as fucked as the general public thinks it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Thank you so much for calling this out. I have been meaning to make a self post talking about how we have won the internet battle but the next step is to take it to the streets.</p>

<p>I too am a Canadian so the best i can do is be a keyboard warrior right now but the citizens of America need to take to the streets. Revolution is needed to turn things upside down and back to normal after but without people making a stand, we will continue to go down this beaten path.</p>

<p>Also, taking to the streets, hundreds of thousands of people, possibly millions across the nation, the MsM will not be able to ignore that. This movement can become an extension of Occupy Wall Street and go beyond and bigger than that.</p>

<p>America is the world leader in many things and when the rest if the world sees America standing up for their rights and what they believe in, i feel it will motivate the rest of the world to do similar movements.</p>

<p>In Canada, i would love to participate in an organized peaceful rally that calls out the TPP. We just signed CETA this weekend and no one in this country gives a damn :( </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely... Read this, this is a good resource. --- Canada Goes To War, Pretending To Keep The Peace --- <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/canada-goes-to-war-pretending-to-keep-the-peace/5551084">http://www.globalresearch.ca/canada-goes-to-war-pretending-to-keep-the-peace/5551084</a> ---- &quot;Canada’s representative to the UN, Marc Andre Blanchard, indicated at that time, “while the road ahead might be dangerous for Canadian troops, the country has an obligation to intervene to prevent the violence from reaching our shores.”</p>

<p>But, Blanchard (and thus the Trudeau liberals) have not given up on the discredited “right to protect” (R2P) saying, “The mandates are multifaceted [but] there are things Canada has been a strong proponent of … the right to allow UN forces to protect citizens rather than just maintain peace and the status quo.” [1]</p>

<p>Wonderful, now Canada is taking a stab at the discredited, dishonoured R2P slogan.   Blanchard’s rationale for peacekeeping/R2P is “Peacekeeping is very different than it was 25 years ago. It’s all about mitigating the consequences of conflict.”  It has also adopted the idiotic U.SA. meme that we must stop violence from reaching our shores…as if sending our own troops overseas is not exporting more violence to other countries.  So rather than just maintain the status quo, we are now taking the role of wanting to change things for our own pursuits and interests, much the same as with the U.S. interests, but also with interests with our own corporations mostly involved with mineral exploitation of African resources. [2]</p>

<p>Mitigating consequences</p>

<p>It is correct, peacekeeping is different, as their is no peace to keep, no treaties signed, no truces, nothing like the Treaty of Guarantee in Cyprus for which Canada did play a significant peacekeeping role; or nothing like the armistice in Korea that has been in place until a “final peaceful settlement” can be achieved where Canada has not played a role in the meantime.</p>

<p>Rather, we have the record of unsuccessful interventions that have not only not prevented “mitigating circumstance” but have always aggravated circumstances, leaving behind hundreds of thousand of dead and injured citizens of the “mitigated” countries as well as wasting a small portion of our own citizens lives.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan, now one third under the control of the Taliban,  with other portions now dealing with ISIS, and the government only able to control Kabul and only parts of that city, Canada essentially wasted 158 military lives for nothing.  For Libya, our  glorious military was honoured by the militant Stephen Harper  in the Senate Chambers (appropriate, given the depraved nature of Senatorial behaviour) for leaving behind a destroyed country, with many civilian deaths, ongoing fighting between different factions, and a hotbed of training and equipping for terrorists.&quot;</p>

<p>Not that I necessarily disagree with OP; in fact, I concur with much that was written. But for what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t know if there is a first-world or otherwise nation out there right now that has an ideal leader, an ideal situation. Okay, maybe Canada and Singapore seem like decent places but one also needs to consider the vast array of issues that exists in a heterogeneous and complex America. Any economist worth his salt would tell you about all the variables that need to be considered. Granted, the USA is supposed to lead by example but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re too divided to reach a state of utopia any time soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to mention that we are the minority. The majority of the country doesn&#39;t care, then another large majority thinks they&#39;ll vote XYZ in and everything will be ok. There&#39;s even many who believe HRC is awesome - it&#39;s about a 60/40 split between Trump/Hillary here in PA, if not closer.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why there will be no major change. There needs to be some major pain before change happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though someone has already likely said this, most people aren&#39;t aware of what&#39;s actually going on. Instead of being in the technology/ information Era, this is more of a misinformation Era. Everyone has fractured knowledge of what is and isn&#39;t true (or better worded,  factual). Many may be upset by the current system, but the sad fact that money has more voice than the public (and it should be no surprise that said money is spent daily to sway our opinions or feed us info that spins or feeds into narritives) which facilitates their goals and objectives. Until a metaphorical line has been crossed to raise a group which has sound reason for rebellion. Anything less than violence, I fear, will be the only result when the voice of the public won&#39;t be enough. This is also known to those who hold control which is the largest reason for the militarization of local law enforcement as well as (likely, as I do not have information to support) most militia organizations hold loyalty (and resources) from the federal government that combined would be a great opposition for any (what would likely be labeled as) insurrection factions. Certainly this sounds outlandish but it&#39;s the result I expect if folks wait or don&#39;t realize what it means or the importance &#39;to stand united.&#39; What I would think would be ideal is to get money out of politics and to alter the current system and (equally) culture away from money. </p>

US turnout is extremely low, and those who end up disagreeing with both parties tend to not vote, instead of voting third party.  </p>

<p>We have an aging population. Without immigration we will put a huge burden on the younger generations since there is less of them, which means they produce less income for the government to pay for services.</p>

<p>Like it or not this is capitalism. There needs to be constant growth which means you need your population to continue to grow and not decline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the number of protesters is marginalized in the media.  a million pol could be blocking chicago streets and it&#39;d be reported as 5 thousand.</p>

<p>political comedy shows let ppl vent and have catharsis.  &#39;hey, as long as i have the freedom to make jokes about these guys who run the world, and i can drink my beer, i aint gonna do more than gripe to friends&#39;</p>

<p>any antiestablishment group or person who becomes too popular and influential is destroyed or marginalized.  framing, fake rumors, smear campaigns, planting of evidence, false accusations, accidents, murder.  </p>

<p>anyone who questions the system or rocks the boat is seen by the typical american as a conspiracy theorist, lunatic.  generally not someone they wanna associate with for fear of losing their jobs or reputation.  </p>

<p>our current system means no amount of protesting matters, and voting doesnt matter.  protest all u like, yay freedom!  doesn&#39;t mean the politicians have to do what you want.  they can lie during campaigns and once elected they can do whatever the hell they want.  </p>

<p>think you can vote someone out?  even if i succeed they&#39;re replaced by their roommate from the same ivy league fraternity </p>

<p>ppl see its hopeless.  many choose apathy.  others just bitch on social media.  almost no one actually does something tangible.  and what tangible things can you do that wont get you arrested or falsley accused or killed in a prop plane accident?  or shot by someone with a prominent middle name?</p>

<p>Watch videos of occupy getting busted up before you judge americans too hard for not taking to the streets. The powers that be are completely prepared to squash any and all public protest, and own the news networks that would cover any large actions anyway. </p>

<p>The only thing they are not fully prepared for is the internet, which is why forums like reddit are so important. Keep reading.</p>

Not to mention the fact that when we are in the streets we have no media backing so most people dont find out what happened unless it is to say that protestors were violently disbanded or in the wrong. It makes it difficult to get traction on anything and you would never see it even if there was any sort of real revolution. That being said revolution is coming and it will either be through protests or blood and iron, and the protests are proving ineffective so our options are more and more limited by the day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People protest but the rest of the people talk shit about them (occupy wall st./black lives matter) and act like they&#39;re above them and they have nothing to complain about.  When people do protest, they are met with riot police with machine guns, gas masks and no identifiable badges.  It seems nothing will change.  Everything we do to try to stop them is a minor inconvenience.  We see video after video of police beating, shooting, framing and abusing people and we don&#39;t want to be part of the statistics and like others have said, we don&#39;t want to lose our jobs for something that may not even make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We tried that with Occupy Wall Street. Had a good strong start too, but then we got caught up in being a &quot;leaderless movement&quot; and no central message. The problem is that we don&#39;t know how to do it, or that if we do - as happening in North Dakota now - we are ignored by the media and attacked by police. We need a strong, clear minded, goal oriented movement but Liberalism is a much more expansive worldview than Conservatism and brings in many, varied viewpoints. When I worked for the Democrats we called ourselves The Big Tent Party, where many ideas we covered under a larger liberal &quot;tent&quot;. This unfortunately leads to small battles and fractures within the party, I&#39;m a huge Bernie supporter but many of my friends and colleagues are Hillary supporters, we argue, fight and actively work against one another even though we are under the same tent. So when we go &quot;fight&quot; for what we believe in a few of us are screaming about fluoride in our water, some about pipelines, some about political corruption, some about Wall Street and a some with a mix of the few. This presents an unclear, hard to achieve message. If we could rally around one point, say &quot;Get Money Out Of Politics&quot;, then we have a clear goal to achieve, then a plan of action can be formulated and executed. Much like how LGBTQ rights and Marijuana Reform have been successful, we had a clear goal and a path to success. These smaller wins should motivate us to the bigger battles. We don&#39;t fix America with one huge battle, it&#39;s the sum of the battles that will determines who wins. </p>

<p>If we can organize and clarify our message then we can achieve these victories, which is super tough. We&#39;ve done it before though, and now we have social media as a tool, so maybe we will get there.</p>

<p>Worst case, we all go to Mars with Musk and let these folks figure it out on there own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow Canadian, why are <em>you</em> out in the streets protesting our shitty system? We voted in the Liberals on the promise of election reform and by all indications they are backing away from that promise now, because there is no support for their shitty ranked ballot system that is worse than our current FPTP system. </p>

<p>FPTP is the reason why America is in this shitty two party system, and Canada is on that path. You should be fucking terrified if you think the system they have in America is bad. It&#39;s not entrenched here yet, we still have time to save ourselves.</p>

<p>Protest doesn&#39;t always mean &quot;taking it to the streets&quot; or going to North Dakota. Besides, I have to work, so up and leaving for North Dakota (one example) isn&#39;t something I can do. </p>

<p>But nor is taking off from work and marching in the streets of Chicago. </p>

<p>The best I can do is be aware of the issues, actually get to know my local representatives from state reps and senators to local guys on school boards and other things, and write letters. </p>

<p>Which is more than 90% of the public already. </p>

Regan dealt with Iran to defame Carter and it worked, W dealt with Bin Laden to defame Gore, and it may happen that Trump does it again using Republican Political hay and misdirection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As Canadians you have your own share of shitty “crime ministers”. Just look at Harper. Utterly eviscerated many venerable Canadian institutions, laws and traditions. Committed voting fraud on a massive scale (wouldn’t have had a majority government without it) and got away with it scot-free. Trudeau is falling into the same pattern by ignoring or outright reversing many of his campaign promises. There are no plans to eliminate the egregious Bill C-51 that makes a mockery of Canadian’s privacy and human rights, and it appears that the pro-multinational, anti-sovereignty, anti-consumer CETA and TPP trade agreements are moving ahead.</p>

<p>Even premiers are in on it. Look at Christy Clark over in BC -- Site C dam that is being rammed through with no regards to land owners or even the need for another dam (plus all her construction cronies are dining at the trough). Her systematic defunding of public education and shunting that money to private education (more cronies at the trough -- funding private companies with public funds). The wholesale spending of the massive budget surplus that the NDP left behind.</p>

<p>It just goes on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t get why so many people feel such a strong need to vehemently support one candidate and try to discredit the other. Had two different people run for office and passed through the primaries, it would be the exact same thing: they pick one of the two and anybody who disagrees is crazy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like these people think that because these are the options they&#39;re given they have to take part in these stupid fuck fuck games in which there is only one possible answer, instead of stepping back and saying &quot;Oh yeah, both these candidates are kinda fucked up.&quot; No, it&#39;s always one candidate can do no wrong and the other is satan.</p>

The people who should care because their kids are being screwed are too busy with ipods and TV shows and home improvements to care. And, as always, the only reason the first group is pissy in the first place is because they aspire to one day be where the second group is: anesthetized to the point of obliviousness by consumption and finally free of the burden of asking questions that, as we all intuitively understand, have no valid answers. </p>

I don&#39;t want to end up on any more lists fast tracking me to Guantanamo or some black site police interrogation center in Chicago if DC gets any more paranoid. I&#39;m already on enough just for marching for civil liberties and economic justice. They take pictures and video of all public actions, they send saboteurs to protests, they infiltrate any grass roots political groups or activist groups, they buy slanted media coverage and black out populous movements from the media, they monitor all of phone calls, texts, emails, searches, purchases, and they are very careful to divide us along racial, religious, and other identity lines. </p>

<p>Even when at its most functional our federal government is designed to keep power concentrated among the aristocracy and slow change. </p>

<p>Stop assuming that we have the freedoms our media tells you we have. </p>

<p>What we have down here is the best fake democracy money can buy. </p>

<p>And since 9/11 the official face of our government has been throwing away more and more of the illusion of democracy. </p>

<p>Half of us know. Maybe more. </p>

<p>But when you&#39;re isolated and powerless facing a wealthy, highly militarized government that idly kills its people in the streets to maintain racial tension, locks up and enslaves innocents and executes them, legalized torture, legalized imprisonment without trial, and has recently legalized killing American &quot;terrorists&quot; what the fuck would you do, Superman? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From &#39;So Long and Thanks For All the Fish&#39; by Adams; Ford Prefect explaining to Arthur Dent about why a robot said &quot;take me to your lizards&quot;:
&quot;It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...&quot;
&quot;You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, &quot;nothing so simple. Nothing anything like to straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.&quot;
&quot;Odd,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;I thought you said it was a democracy.&quot;
&quot;I did,&quot; said Ford. &quot;It is.&quot;
&quot;So,&quot; said Arthur, hoping he wasn&#39;t sounding ridiculously obtuse, &quot;why don&#39;t the people get rid of the lizards?&quot;
&quot;It honestly doesn&#39;t occur to them,&quot; said Ford. &quot;They&#39;ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they&#39;ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.&quot;
&quot;You mean they actually vote for the lizards?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Ford with a shrug, &quot;of course.&quot;
&quot;But,&quot; said Arthur, going for the big one again, &quot;why?&quot;
&quot;Because if they didn&#39;t vote for a lizard,&quot; said Ford, &quot;the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;I said,&quot; said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, &quot;have you got any gin?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll look. Tell me about the lizards.&quot;
Ford shrugged again.
&quot;Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone&#39;s got to say it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I probably have a different perspective than most for various reasons that I&#39;m not going to give out online.</p>

<p>Simply put the time for protests has passed, they don&#39;t work because false flag attacks are the foundation of this system and those in power.</p>

<p>A pro trump million man march happens and cunts like bob creamer organize violence for the media to discredit us.</p>

<p>If trump loses we will begin organizing rapidly to fight back. secession comes first, political assassination and destroying tools of propaganda come second. We will win this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it seems like everyone is taking this as a chance to make excuses rather than as motivation to get out there and make some voices heard.</p>

<p>here&#39;s my excuse: the chance for change was in the primaries. that&#39;s when i was out in the streets. not protesting, but going door-to-door, making phone calls, organizing others to do the same, trying to get a decent presidential candidate.</p>

<p>i think there&#39;s space for a big protest going into election day. people to have their voices heard about our corrupt oligarchy. but we still want people to vote! i think the idea of &#39;protesting the election&#39; must be rather abhorrent to most people who think that we need americans to pay attention and vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ship has sailed on protest in this country. We are a conquered people. If we had strong voices in the media to rally and mobilize the disenchanted amongst us(which should be the entire populous) it would be a different story altogether.</p>

<p>It is too late. America has been bought and sold. Moloch(the oligarchy) rules us with an iron fist clenched with debt. Moloch owns the media, the financial sector, our political parties and their respective candidates, the houses we live in, the cars we drive, and the clothes on our children&#39;s backs.</p>

<p>The notion that peaceful protests or marching in the streets has in the past or would now change anything is an absurdity. History is made when blood is shed. Then and only then.</p>

<p>I hate to break it to ye&#39;, friendly canuck, but you have the same political system as we do. The entire western world has the same political system we do. It is the politics of money. Of debt. Your country is a corporation with the citizens as blue collar slaves down in the coal mines every bit as much as ours is. We are fodder for the meat grinder that is capitalist enterprise. </p>

<p>If you feel like marching, get your fucking keds on and do it. Hey, bring the old lady while your at it. You can make a day of it. Maybe visit some shops, have a picnic in the park, take in the sights. That will really send a message to our corporate overlords.</p>

<p>If you want make a change in the world you live in, get ready to sacrifice your life out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I visited Canada I was always amazed at how many protests I saw during the 50 or so days I have been there in my life. The first protests I saw were student protests and they were massive and it was all because tuition was going up from like $1500/year to $2200/year. Since my tuition in the US is about $14000/year, and it has gone up about 250-500 per year, it was astonishing to me. Then leaving a pre-season hockey team, there was some sort of massive middle eastern protest in the middle of Montreal. I&#39;m not sure what that protest was about but these things hardly ever happen in the US for simple issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was just a generalization. No one was really glued to the tv before reality tv got big, then the rise of the super series, and video game binges. 
Back in my day, the only reality tv was the news, and COPS. People weren&#39;t wasting brain cells, staring at the tv, watching a bunch of dummies at a summer beach house make asses out of themselves, or rich, brainless wives of various big cities around the US,  that couldn&#39;t care less about any of their viewers, but get paid because fools tune in to their meaningless existence. The worst there was, was a stay at home mom watching soap operas until 2pm. Now, people don&#39;t even go out to go food shopping anymore. They&#39;re too busy with life so they get it delivered. 
It&#39;s really strange growing up in times like these. Everything moves so fast, and attention spans are short. /rant :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are kept divided, and thus conquered fairly thoroughly. Harboring anti-governmental thoughts that actually hold weight aren&#39;t allowed to be spread on some public forums (facebook comes to mind).</p>

<p>In the US if you protest in this day and age, depending on the cause they may label you a domestic terrorist and then shit gets real. The westborough baptist church of assholes have their right to speak out at the funerals of our dead servicemen, but I can&#39;t even say that we have no right to assume the lead role in the Iraqi conflict (war) and we sure as shit don&#39;t have a place in Ukraine. I went on to state that we would be sanctioned soon if we didn&#39;t stop it with the &quot;Speak softly but carry a big stick&quot; politics.... I&#39;m not lying when I say my post was removed from facebook and I was told that if I didn&#39;t pipe down with those kinds of topics that they&#39;d have me investigated for DISTURBING THE PEACE. For saying we shouldn&#39;t be at war...
(<sup>I</sup> don&#39;t believe I was talking to an actual FB employee. Also fun fact, my acc was locked for 3 days following this incident)</p>

<p>They&#39;re Freedom Fighters, alright. Same as the Fire Fighters of Fahrenheit 451</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As Canadians, we have every flaw (on the macro scale) that the Americans do with our system.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We have electoral fraud</p></li>
<li><p>We have national media being used to smear the opposition</p></li>
<li><p>We have candidates who meddle in foreign affairs and attempt to silence dissidents on home soil</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, most of these things are done by the PC party, aka the big business party. Pretending to have right-wing views is just a way to trick people into voting for an supporting big business, who really doesn&#39;t give a shit about anyone. In opposition to them we have a feminist man (Trudeau), and a man who is so feminine that calling him a feminist would be not only redundant, but an insult to women (Mulcair). </p>

<p>Our system is really not any better, it&#39;s just done on a far far smaller scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the largest and most well equipped military in the world, the only way that, we the people, could be successful would be to have the military protest with us. We have seen it time after time, huge groups assemble and out comes the national guard. </p>

<p>We are supposedly a government &quot;of the people, by the people, for the people&quot;, BUT we are really a government &quot;of the Washington insiders, by the electoral college, for themselves&quot;, and until we get rid of this outdated system of electoral votes, we do not live in a true democracy. </p>

<p>Our system is fucked, the people running it suck, the mass majority of citizens don&#39;t care and nothing will ever be done because as everyone has been saying, most people have to work for a living and missing work to protest doesn&#39;t always go over too well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Canadian who&#39;s been living in the U.S. since 2000, I do find it quite annoying when my Canadian friends and family provide their &quot;political solutions&quot; to the absurdity that is the status of our government.</p>

<p>Let me remind you, it&#39;s different here. It&#39;s not the way it appears to you (from the outside). Your third-person point of view doesn&#39;t compare to that of those who <em>actually</em> live here and see it every fucking day. Although your concern is appreciated, it&#39;s aggravating as fuck that you&#39;d even recommend this in such a way that suggests we haven&#39;t ever tried before.</p>

<p>If it were that simple, it would have already been taken care of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a corner in Omaha at 72nd and Dodge.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a protest there pretty much every day.</p>

<p>Some days it&#39;s BLM.  Some days it&#39;s &quot;Vote for Hilary&quot;  Some days it&#39;s &quot;Vote for &lt;Insert Local Republican Candidate&gt;&quot;  </p>

<p>So yeah, people protest... but they don&#39;t agree on things.</p>

<p>Local political attack ads are amazing.  &quot;Your current senator is a Liberal and he keeps voting like one!&quot;  Like that&#39;s supposed to be an attack ad.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of others that are like &quot;This person did this thing!&quot; and I sit there and think, awesome, I&#39;m going to vote for them, then.  </p>

<p>I get a mailer every day reminding me that terrorists are going to kill everyone if I don&#39;t vote for a certain candidate.</p>

<p>The sad part of all of this is that it works.  By taking a certain tone, people just assume that something bad has happened.  People really are afraid of the terrorists, even though they are much more likely to be killed by a police officer, or a piece of furniture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When OWS happened and those protests were huge and called for actual change they called in support from the feds, contrived a list of potentials to kill if they were too much of a leader. Shot protesters in the face with rubber bullets and tear gas canisters. Sprayed them in the face with pepper spray as they sat handcuffed. Used agent provocateurs to incite vandalism and violence among protestors...</p>

<p>Stopped all traffic on Market street in SF, put barriers up around the Federal Reserve then remodeled the entrance and side walk to prevent camping in tents, or using the giant planters to sleep on and put up extra bollards to protect their tower.</p>

<p>And then they took to online and had a better understanding of how to shill - and how to slide and how to identify the &quot;threats of the future.</p>

<p>OWS should have ramped up after that. The shutting down of oakland port was a briliant idea and they should have really held it together and kept up the protest.</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;m old. I&#39;m 43, married with 4 kids. </li>
<li>I live in a very rural area in the south.  To get to a place where anyone would even be considering an organized protest, I would have to drive about 3 hours</li>
<li>I&#39;m a teacher - if I&#39;m not at work, my kids get a substitute, although I appreciate them, I know they aren&#39;t getting the level of education as if I were there in the classroom.</li>
<li>Even though I&#39;m a white male, I&#39;m afraid of our over-militarized police system.  I know too many local, &#39;roided-up,small-town cops that used to be local, &#39;roided-up, small-town bullies and jocks.<br/></li>
<li>There&#39;s a very big part of me that just wants to see the US political system burn, but I also know that I&#39;ve got children that will have to reap whatever grows out of this shitstorm that&#39;s coming next week. </li>
<li>I&#39;m pro-legal drugs</li>
<li>pro-choice</li>
<li>pro banking regulations</li>
<li>pro guns (but also for more regulations... I&#39;ve got a BUNCH of guns that I have for hunting and target shooting, but I think there should be MUCH more stringent mental health checks)</li>
<li>against churches not paying taxes</li>
<li>I&#39;m for a single payer healthcare</li>
<li>I&#39;m for term lifetime term limits for every position in government. </li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one candidate that speaks for me.  I was wholeheartedly behind Bernie Sanders, but he never had a chance against the Clinton machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion that this outcome, with two horrible candidates, has been a long time coming. The Republican party and the Democratic party represent the political extremes with no hope of reconciliation. The two party system was always going to end up with two entrenched extremes lobbing grenades back and forth over the electorate, oblivious of the damage. </p>

<p>We no longer have a representative republic. Rather, we have a new form of government, a short sighted entertainocracy where facts are not important, only the sound bite. Our media has chosen sides, a very popular plot twist, but fear not... A magical Knight appears to shine light on the betrayal. Wikileaks to the rescue. </p>

<p>Ultimately, this is a story about the downfall of a once great nation who lost her way. </p>

The Democratic and republican parties can be thought of as monolithic party that has a monopoly over our political landscape. Protest seem to be a waste of time, and it seems we need to attack this from another angle. Maybe start with very small local elections. Take a page from the social conservative hand book and run stealth elections for county, and school board seats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is too hard to believe.  The rulers of the world are satanists. So are most if not all people who have over 50 million. They control the media so that means they condition our minds to hold whatever opinions they want because we are glued to our screens and hearing ideas repeated over and over.  The human mind accepts info as truth if it&#39;s repeated enough times. Also, satanists use witchcraft to control the masses.    </p>

<p>The media teaches us to reject Christianity yet Jesus is the only one who can help. ( I realize most people will tune me out after this point.). Just saying His name helps. The media has brainwashed people to stop believing in something that was well known centuries ago.  That there is a spiritual world and it consists of demons.  Jesus,  God the Father and The Holy Spirit along with guardian angels and such are also in the spiritual world. Satanists are people who choose to forego going to heaven after this life so they can live it up in this world as powerful rich people.  The truth is rather simple but the we simply can&#39;t understand the spiritual world. We are limited. Demons have certain supernatural abilities so we are sitting ducks if we don&#39;t accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and pray regularly.  Whenever I post about this I just get downvoted because the media did a great job of controlling our opinions. I had the great fortune of having enough free time and limited responsibilities for a long enough time to have really stopped and looked around and notice what is really going on.  People wth their 9-5 jobs are moving too fast to see usually.</p>

<p>Edit:  basically heaven and hell are real. We have forgotten that thanks to the media.   The us is a young country relatively so the media has a stronger hold on our minds that other countries where there are long held traditions and family values rather than corporations raising us.  The media is twisting our perceptions and is run by satanists. Hilary and trump are satanists and they serve the same hidden rulers. Also satanists.  Satanists hold power through demon worship and bloodlines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are such a complacent country. Seeing protests on TV seems like it&#39;s enough. I took part in the Wall Street marches and is was invigorating but disappointing to see nothing really come from it all. I would be into protests but hoping others would pitch in and stay committed to the cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Western Canadian dude, I find our system is just as bad, if not worse. We don&#39;t have a good due diligence part in our political system. A Prime Minister with a majority government has more power than the US president. The reason, the US Senate is elected and they have to agree on anything that the President wants to pass. Canadian Prime Minister appoints the Senate so when he wants something passed, why would they defy him? And as someone who lives in Alberta where we keep getting gouged by the Federal government and can hardly get anything back this year in our time of need is just awful. Thats more of a personal rant part, but no government has all kinks worked out. I certainly prefer the US system&#39;s 2 term maximum and elected Senate. Its a much better balance and check system.</p>

Do you think the ordinary people of the middle east were flush during the Arab spring? No. I&#39;m afraid you guys are just plain scared, too lazy or have been brainwashed in to thinking that expressing your feelings and opinions is just wrong and beneath you. I know this because I live in the UK and most here are suffering from the same affliction.
We need to get over this quickly before TPTB drag us down a path that doesn&#39;t bare thinking about. Times are gettin scarey!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you <em>exactly</em> why there has been no mobilization aside from blm morons.</p>

<p>The blm crowd has been worked up &amp; promoted by the msm as what is &quot;right&quot; and how they can do no wrong,they get arrested for horrible violence,the media calls the cops racist for arresting a criminal.</p>

<p>Now if you are a patriot &amp; bring attention to anything that actually matters,you are labeled a racist,insane,violent domestic terrorist from the get go by everyone to the msm to the president to dhs to hillary clinton.</p>

<p>If you understand that civil rights aren&#39;t just about blacks,it actually means constitutional rights for everyone,you get labeled as a hatr monger.</p>

<p>So they are doing a very 1984 flip flop of reality ,making the sane ones out to be terrorists &amp; the terrorists out to be the gentle sheep that were wronged.</p>

<p>All this combined is enough to topple any real resistance from the get go (feds will send out plants to disrupt your plans if you manage to gather more than two people) because when you are bombarded with the message that you are wrong &amp; to be comtempted from all angles,that person is made to feel any resistance is futile. But add in the fact that the so called &quot;leaders&quot; will lead you to the fountain of truth, but when it&#39;s in sight they scream &quot;stop! Dont drink from it&quot; I.E- they will tell you everything that is wrong but when it comes to finally putting the final piece in the puzzle &amp; standing up to fight,they tell you not to or you&#39;re horrible for even thinking about it.</p>

<p>Alex jones is notorious for this,he&#39;ll build up the pitch of the broadcast making you fuming mad with anger only to tell you to sit down. Ive seen quite a bit of self sabotaging in his work ever since about 2014, he is now loading the bits of truth up with aboslute nonsense. It used to be full of truth &amp; a bit of bs here and there but now i cant take him seriously anymore. Esp since the last election he did everything he could to convince people that trump was a flip flopping shill not to be trusted,now he gets a hard on everytime the name trump is whispered.</p>

<p>And beyond all those other reasons....want to know why no-one stands up? Sedation. Everyone goes to social media to whine &amp; it ends there.they are too busy impressing their formers classmates with bs on facebook about how &quot;blessed&quot; they are with worthless trinkets or some nonsense about what they see on the other great sedator,television. Everyone is so wrapped up in that crap, as well as plenty of vicarious living through various sports/dramas that unless all that is taken away,NOTHING will happen.</p>

<p>Bread &amp; circus has fulfilled its purpose beyond anyones wildest hops &amp; dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an understanding in the USA, that most people agree on but we won&#39;t say out loud. If people really stood up and started to change things, we would be dealt with. If you have a good job, one arrest and that job is gone. If you gain too much power, you&#39;ll either be killed or they&#39;ll find illegal material in your email, even if they have to put it there. If none of that stops the crowd they&#39;ll just try beating us or inserting groups to tear it apart. That&#39;s what happened in occupy Wall Street. They had intelligence officers swarming it, infiltrating their little planning councils and sewing chaos so nothing would get done. The USA has gotten too good at disrupting democracies.

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be fair, us in Canada have it just as shitty except it isn&#39;t as &quot;big&quot; of a deal since we are considerably less in population. </p>

<p>Trudeau&#39;s government is fucking us hard with CETA, Bill C-16, and the refugee crisis, except it all gets ignored due to his Charisma, and other world events such as the American Election. Canada is in essence less free than the US, except it&#39;s considerably less violent (for now).</p>

<p>I think the entirety of the world needs to stand up to globalists and their plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Americans&quot; are lazy. &quot;We&quot; protest after things get bad, not before.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think it will be business as usual. Things are increasingly polarized now, they are probably going to stay that way. There&#39;s going to be all kinds of witch hunts coming. Not only do we have the usual terrorist threat, now the propaganda machine is injecting cold war reminiscent Russian threats into the mix.</p>

<p>There will be protests, there are protests, but there won&#39;t be media coverage, unless people really dig.</p>

<p>People of color in the u.s. always lead the way when it comes to social movements. There&#39;s a historical pattern.</p>

<p>No one pays attention to the Black movement, while it&#39;s discredited as &quot;violent.&quot; Then Natives protest, they are dismissed using legal means, &quot;criminal.&quot; And of course ever-present Hispanic and Asian movements, centering around labor, immigration, and &quot;citizenship.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally the white hippies, or whatever they call themselves now, come out and show some of the social intersections between the issues people of color have and the rest of the world. All of a sudden the problems get some kind of acknowledgement. This is just before all these movements inevitably meet their public end, when the cops or military show up and start killing people. Justifying all the violence by using words like criminal, communist or terrorist.</p>

<p>People of color are the ones on the front lines, always. The protest never stops for them.</p>

<p>This is why &quot;Americans&quot; expect someone else to do their protesting for them. That&#39;s how lazy &quot;we&quot; are. Most white people are usually too exhausted by the thought of felling almost obligated to vote, to even think about joining these other movements. In other words, they&#39;re too busy to sacrifice their privilege.</p>

<p>All people are not out in the streets because unless white people die no one seems to care and cops have no problem killing people of color.</p>

<p>No white person no matter how non-racist they say they are, no matter how much of a white savior they want to be, they won&#39;t actually die for the causes of people of color. They only want to look like martyrs, not actually be one.</p>

<p>As far as Canada goes. You&#39;re next. How about taking a vacation down south to help out?</p>

<p>Sorry for being gritty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quiet protesting wouldn&#39;t solve anything. Nothing <em>real</em> anyways.</p>

<p>The best option I think would be towns---&gt;cities---&gt;states standing up, creating their own governments and standing up for themselves. I think this could be viewed as treason or something though. They&#39;d also have to be able to defend themselves and would need militia. Of course a few state militia couldn&#39;t keep up with the USA military. So we&#39;d need outside help, which most likely come from US enemies. Overall bad situation. </p>

<p>This system is messed up beyond fixing I think. Maybe small towns and cities could behave differently, against the governemt, but once states do...things are gonna get messy. </p>

<p>People have to be willing to die, and I&#39;m not ready to die for this country. Only person in willing to die for is my family and God. None of which constitute as all of America.</p>

<p>Id rather just immigate to Toronto after my student loans are paid</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no I get that. It really depends on <em>how</em> the groups work together during their group goal though. If Millenials (many of which fall into both categories still), are able to treat fundamentalists with respect, and they are able to find comprimise and be willing to find a way for everyone to move forward, then fundamentalist christians will be way more apt to work together.</p>

<p>Fundamentalist Christians have deeply entrenched values about everyone having the right to have a life and work for a good one. If the Millenials who are trending towards other religions are willing to really listen to fundamentalists, then I believe progress can be made in both groups finding a center.</p>

<p>As it stands now, Millenials are not doing a good job of this, and seem to be pretty content with bashing Christian Fundamentalists in the face with changes and telling them to suck it the fuck up, so yeah, parties are pretty entrenched at the moment, and feelings are hurt. We&#39;re gearing up to be a new Isreal/Palestine, Sunni/Shiite conflict right here at home.</p>

<p>Get your popcorn world. Not that it matters, I am doubtful there aren&#39;t other major powers keen on &#39;bringing order&#39; and obtaining a shit ton of natural resources by invading the minute we turn into a clusterfuck.</p>

<p>Pieces of the Occupy movement have been very successful - here in SF they&#39;ve stopped hundreds of evictions, nationally one group eliminated 15 million in personal debt, they&#39;ve raised the overall awareness of the public, and the profile of whistle-blowers like Snowden. Their mere existence is a sea change in social consciousness in America - as recently as the 80&#39;s they would have been dismissed as &#39;hippies&#39;.</p>

<p>How can it be Trump if the vast majority of his policy ideas are asinine or nonexistent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Which ones are asinine? It&#39;s likely you have a misunderstanding of many of them thanks in part to the media. His policies are outlined on his website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when is the last time the government has been in the people&#39;s control?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question! Let&#39;s make it 0 days here next Tuesday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how will reducing taxes on the rich to their lowest point since Reagan give The People more political power?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not to give the people more power, that&#39;s to help the economy. But, since you bring it up, taxing gives more resources to the government and, as a result, more control. If the government wasn&#39;t corrupt and we weren&#39;t in an economic shit hole, then a bump in taxes could be useful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has said nothing about the winner-take-all, first-past-the-post voting system. He&#39;s said nothing about gerrymandering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These things are not priority at this moment. They can be corrected after the Swamp is drained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing about unequal access to education.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what sense? If you&#39;re talking about racial inequality then yes he has. What was the last rally of his that you watched? I&#39;m pretty sure he talked about this in his Michigan rallies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing about drug decriminalization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can&#39;t say much about this one cause it&#39;s not a huge issue to me personally. I know he has spoken on legalization on medical marijuana as well as letting states decide their own policies past medical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very little in general about the aspects of the establishment he actually aims to fix (other than trade deals).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go find his Drain The Swamp speech and first 100 days policies. He wants term limits among several other things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m looking for a candidate who actually understands the ways in which the system is rigged and has a practical agenda for starting the unrigging process. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be Trump. I encourage you to dig a bit deeper into what he says regarding establishment politics. I&#39;d help you a bit more but I can&#39;t at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was just a generalization. No one was really glued to the tv before reality tv got big, then the rise of the super series, and video game binges. 
Back in my day, the only reality tv was the news, and COPS. People weren&#39;t wasting brain cells, staring at the tv, watching a bunch of dummies at a summer beach house make asses out of themselves, or rich, brainless wives of various big cities around the US,  that couldn&#39;t care less about any of their viewers, but get paid because fools tune in to their meaningless existence. The worst there was, was a stay at home mom watching soap operas until 2pm. Now, people don&#39;t even go out to go food shopping anymore. They&#39;re too busy with life so they get it delivered. 
It&#39;s really strange growing up in times like these. Everything moves so fast, and attention spans are short. /rant :)</p>
