Jesus will know his followers and the ungodly simply by looking at them. We are part of the wake up, not all will wake up, and everyone will call us crazy. Too bad we are rocks that can&#39;t be budged. We follow truth and spit on lies. We all share slightly different perspectives because of words and our own personal perspective, but we are all one, we just live in tough times, they have us divided.</p>

<p>Magic is essentially mind control, propaganda and ideology, so yeah.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I see spirit being equivalent to will. Spirituality is all about finding out what you should/want to do. They want to control your will so you will do what is in their interests. They want servants to make their stuff and do their work for them.</p>

<p>The meanings of all these old terms have been corrupted through misinformation, so you have people who say things that sound ridiculous to most people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, these people with money and power are so self righteous they literally believe that they have money and power because they are supposed to, as if god himself ordained them to have and to use this influence as they see fit. </p>

<p>The logic is circular. &#39;I have money and power because god gave me money and power, so I should use this to gain more money and power&#39; this belief also justifies itself because if you believe you have power because you deserve it you can literally do nothing wrong. You are &#39;chosen&#39; and everyone else is less than you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would recommend not listening to him for some reasons I can&#39;t list, read his comment history and see his level of intelligence. I will tell you some stuff though, look up David Icke and his long lectures on youtube. We live in a multi dimensional universe.</p>

<p>In the Talmud it says &quot;The humans born on earth right now are merely animals in human bodies&quot; that&#39;s their level of logic. Look past the control system literally everything is bullshit. Thankfully the good things in life like marijuana, healthy food, and a gym membership are cheap.</p>

<p>We are immortals who live forever and currently there is a battle between good and evil. Evil is running the world but people are waking up at an exponential rate, the fibonacci sequence. 1 1 2 3 5 8 13, well that pattern is going all the time and it&#39;s merely a matter of time all of the righteous will be awake. Enjoy your life for now and keep reading stuff, we have already won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even necessarily as far off the beaten path as interdimensional beings, or even religious dogma. An individual can find pleasure in the misery and/or subjugation of other beings. That&#39;s really all there has to be to it, which isn&#39;t to say that there can&#39;t be anything more exotic going on. Some people have fun playing games with friends, or reading a book. Some people get their joy from causing pain. Some people find bliss in making others kiss their feet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is animal instinct in there, or there can be. I don&#39;t think an alpha lion tends to rule the pride without any design towards what is best for said pride. I really don&#39;t think my point needs any elaboration. Have you never had a moment of sadism, however brief and shameful it may have been?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be normalised, just as any one can normalise a behaviour with enough reinforcement. It&#39;s not necessarily a trait someone is born with; it can be fostered and developed. I think we all likely know someone who seems to derive pleasure in feeling &quot;better&quot; than someone. Imagine you were one to enjoy that feeling, and you find/put yourself in a position to be &quot;better&quot; than almost any one you meet.</p>

<p>This is a hobby for some people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s say I am better at playing guitar than somebody else; then yeah, I am better in that sense--a better guitar player. A better person? I don&#39;t think I can really know. Do I derive pleasure from knowing that I am a better guitar player than somebody else? No. Do I derive pleasure from knowing I am a better guitar player now than I was a year ago, which came about from practice and devotion? Yes.</p>

<p>Feeling that you&#39;re above somebody else is trait that is closer to animalistic instinct, and farther from a higher level of consciousness. Are sadistic people all too common in this world, though? Yes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to waste my time going through your post history to back myself up, as you know full well what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>You just sound ignorant</p>

<p>No.  I&#39;ve just called you out is all, and you don&#39;t like it.  Go ahead and make a new thread to discuss it at length with your friends though.  I&#39;m sure someone will-- soon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are deceived into believing what they do will be rewarded.  I also believe it is a spiritual battle.  These people wanted too much and would do anything for it, and now they are so deep in it that they cannot back out.  Even if they were to try, something, it, has so much dirt on them that everything would be ruined for them so they continue their lie.  IMO</p>
