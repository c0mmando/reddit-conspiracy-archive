       This is a real Black Swan event: she's going to lose the world's throne, go to jail and lose everything because of the dick of a guy she never slept with! That's way outside the 5-sigma realm.

       I interpret it the same way.  It appears that the (New)team handling the investigation is keeping things between them not even sharing info with DOJ. They understand they have all the evidence necessary to prosecute and won't allow any sabotage from the current corrupt administration.

       I think there's a far more simple motive. She had that shit-eating grin on her face because they know damn well the FBI will not release the specifics of an ongoing investigation.  Any investigation would not be completed by election day. So she gets to play the whole thing off, while saying she has nothing to hide, and calling for transparency from the FBI. All the while getting people to bash Comey for letting people know the new emails were found in general. It's the logical play, man.

       She and her campaign did the same during the earlier iteration of the investigation, as if the FBI and DoJ were operating on her schedule.

       Turned out they were. Let's hope that's not the case this time around.

       I'm glad the NYPD is the one that discovered this. Another agency oversight can only help when it comes to serving justice. Since they know exactly what's in those emails, they know what should and shouldn't happen in this investigation.

       Now, more than ever, the NYPD are important to the future of this country. Let's hope there's no shady shit going on behind the scenes and that if the FBI doesn't do what the NYPD deems necessary, the NYPD speak up and make a statement!

       Yes.  And She is trying to appear like she wants transparency, but she knows that the fbi can't really give a whole lot of info during an ongoing investigation.

       No,  its just PR rhetoric.   Its typical lying,  bluffing,  grandstanding buffoonery that the Clinton's have waged against the American people for decades,  and there are millions of Americans that drink these dregs up as if it was nectar.     Whose kids do they think are going to be sent to the front lines?   As long as its not theirs,  they are going to turn a blind eye.    How do they sleep or look in the mirror?    Like anyone who backed Hitler.    No difference.

       Which is perhaps why the Democratic Officials in The Senate asked for the EXACT AMOUNT of emails they had on record. They want to know exactly what they have.
      </p>

       People not afraid of transparency, that aren't keeping secrets incriminating to transparency- so long as they're legal- don't spend even a fraction of their time colluding together to figure out how to hide ANYTHING ... or how to "spin" a situation or a catastrophe they're at fault about providing damage control for when it comes out later.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been very upset to find out they're being lied to. And I think for this particular situation, it has effected a lot of people's lives, on a very personal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption is an evil captor (bribes, blackmail, etc.)... and the Natural cry or call of the spirit is: TO BE FREE
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, the recent questions possess a motive, and they can be seen, very easily. Which is even more interesting that they've even been asked... Are people in such denial about their ability to hide it? Weirdly, yes.
