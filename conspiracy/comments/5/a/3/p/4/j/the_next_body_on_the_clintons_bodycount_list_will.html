    <div class="md"><p>Honestly that is not what will happen. I called this yesterday. I am going to guess that Huma is going to get thrown under the bus. Clinton will be cleared and Huma will be...idk what but she taking the fall. Only question is will they fast track this shit and clear Clintons name before the election? </p>

<p>Sorry seems like wild speculation but i have to look at nearly everything in the news to somehow benefit the DNC. </p>

<p>Side note: Is anyone else somewhat excited lately? I dont mean by the case being re-opened, i mean just very excited that we are living in an extremely pivotal moment in history. We are witnessing either the <strong>most blatant silent coup d&#39;etat</strong> on the most powerful nation in the world or we are witnessing the **collapse of western civilization and possibly the entire global system! Or if Trump wins, which i dont think will happen, but if he does id think we will get 8 years of the same shit. Obama promised big and did not deliver. </p>

<p>Like wow! This subreddit change my perspective on a lot of things. I am kind of thankful to be a conspiracy theorist as i have always thought NOT being one is extremely irresponsible when you are dealing with a society that heavily values self interest and secrecy.</p>

<p>edit: Know whats crazy? Obama is simultaneously bombing more countries than all other nobel peace price winners in history. Tell me that shit aint fixed.</p>

<p>Kill her and it puts more light on all the deaths that have been happening. People would be more likely to release what they have knowing that if Clinton becomes president they are as good as dead.</p>

<p>Conspiracy aside, it&#39;s top 3 shows all time to me and is definitely required watching for anyone that appreciate a good deep story with phenomenal character development.</p>

<p>In fact im turning episode 1 on now! If you do watch it...Get through the first season at least. It&#39;s insane.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d rather, the show follows the books <em>reasonably</em> well. Word for word for the first two books, and then they split a little each season. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but...fiction vs reality. As I&#39;m a bit aged, I am more familiar with the Lord of the Rings, having read the books many times and seen the movies. You can twist anything in fiction to reality. Even one step further, your reality isn&#39;t my reality either, so within that everything is up to interpretation.

<p>the wonderful thing I find with the people here (not the paid shills trying to present a specific narrative) is the broad expanse of people  who, with like minds, all feel that in their gut something is wrong and that our leaders may be selectively herding us all to a cliff, out of good, ill, or plain ignorance. On this site leaders is also not really a defined term per-se and could mean anything from humans to E.T.s</p>
