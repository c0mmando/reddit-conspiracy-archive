    <div class="md"><p>Adam Curtis just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js19h1GW32o"><em>&#39;Hypernormalisation&#39;</em></a>, a film wherein Curtis proposes a perspective outlining the various ways that America manufactured Gaddafi as a radical islamist, &quot;a bad guy&quot;.  Gaddafi then took this mischaracterization, doubled down on it, and spun into a more empowering &#39;the bad boy of n africa&#39; image, utilizing this recontextualization as a platform to reach out of the black muslims in america.  One example of this involves the lockerbie bombing.  Curtis asserts that American intelligence discarded euro intelligence, and instead asserted that attacks on pan am flight 103, lockerbie bombing originated from Libya, not Syria-Iran, and continued this narrative.  </p>

<p>This is similar to how Bush invaded Iraq and saddam hussein, who had nothing to do with 9/11. It would seem that America fights wars it know it can win, and it fights wars it wants to fight, not those who actually attacked america.  So for example, if America wanted Guatemalan lithium or something, and they got attacked by Costa Rican terrorists, they&#39;d go to Guatemala instead and then use the media to try to convince stupid people it&#39;s guatemala and before 9/11 I thought people were smart enough to see thru this but now I realize they are stupid and will believe anything from msm and that&#39;s the problem there that Curtis also discusses.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t just kill Gaddafi to inhibit the gold backed african union reserve currency dinar, but for several reasons.  </p>

<p>1), disrupting libya was another way to ensure more terrorists to join isis in syria, </p>

<p>2) we had been using libya to torture our prisoners in &#39;extraordinary rendition--outsourcing Libya for very high priority prisoners with intel...therefore Gaddafi had blackmail leverage on the CIA, this activity got Libya in trouble for &quot;human rights violations&quot; by the UN--of course, we know now gaddafi was doing this on behalf of the US<sup><sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/cia-rendition-countries-covert-support">[1]</a><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/08/us/uk-documents-reveal-libya-rendition-details">[2]</a></sup></sup> </p>

<p>We used Libya for torture, then blamed them for rights violations, then attacked and ruined that country, then our pres candidate laughed about it after screwing up and getting some of our guys killed</p>

<p>3) Gaddafi had a system that was becoming competitive with the US, and people there were happy--he believed in freedom and human rights actually (read his green book), he ran a successful social democracy, so we had to kill that.  It&#39;s what we do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that.  And I&#39;ve seen, read, watched etc a lot of info about Gadaffi transforming the area.  I guess I still don&#39;t see the direct connection that would benefit the Clinton Foundation to the point that intervention (legal or otherwise) is needed.  At the point Gadaffi was over thrown, the Clintons were already very wealthy.  So does this get them more wealth?  Cant they just relax, retire, chill?  Or is this other plays press HRC to act?  I guess Im having touble understanding someone as self-direct as HRC seems to be giving a crap to point of risk.  Not sure if what im trying to ask even makes sense</p>

<p><strong>Haaretz, Israel, Feb 18, 2003</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/sharon-says-u-s-should-also-disarm-iran-libya-and-syria-1.18707">Sharon Says U.S. Should Also Disarm Iran, Libya and Syria</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said yesterday that Iran, Libya and Syria should be stripped of weapons of mass destruction after Iraq</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said yesterday that Iran, <strong>Libya and Syria</strong> should be stripped of weapons of mass destruction after Iraq. <strong>&quot;These are irresponsible states, which must be disarmed of weapons mass destruction, and a successful American move in Iraq as a model will make that easier to achieve,&quot; Sharon said to a visiting delegation of American congressmen.</strong></p>

<p>Sharon told the congressmen that Israel was not involved in the war with Iraq &quot;but the American action is of vital importance.&quot;</p>

<p>In a meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State <strong>John Bolton</strong> yesterday, Sharon said that Israel was concerned about the security threat posed by Iran, and stressed that it was important to deal with Iran even while American attention was focused on Iraq. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything the US does in the Middle East revolves around Israel&#39;s interests. EVERYTHING.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it had anything to do with the dinar/petrodollar issue.</p>

<p>The petrodollar has no economic value as such. It simply means that oil is priced in dollars for convenience.</p>

<p>The important factor is which currency do people want to save in.</p>

<p>I think they wanted to radicalise Libya for some reason. They have been building the ranks of radical Islam for decades now and the &#39;Arab Spring&#39; was the final stage in this plan.</p>
