<p>Now think about this for a moment. He claims China tries to install their puppet as the US president. I&#39;ve heard more flimsy reasons to justify military action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rumor has it that the Saudi&#39;s have started accepting the renminbi.  If true (and it is) then it implies quite a few things: not only is the dollar in for a devaluation (and all that goes along with that) it means that the balance of power has shifted away from the West, as has been suspected (at least in terms of total domination).  Given that Soros is neither part of the NWO or the OWO, it makes perfect sense that he would have alliances with powerful foreign actors in the Southeast.  And given how relevant the United States is on the world stage, plus how many wealthy Chinese there are, this is the type of conspiracy theory you should be comfortable putting some weight behind.  It&#39;s very likely to be true.  </p>

<p>tl;dr Hillary Clinton is a puppet for more than one man (Soros) and her connections to the Chinese can be faithfully assumed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(1.) Let us assume the following:</p>

<p>A. They know much more than we do.
B. They understand they need us.
C. They are, in some way, us.</p>

<p>(2.) Let us extend to some initial hypotheses from (1.)</p>

<p>A. They cannot tell us everything that they know, but we do not, because otherwise they would tell us, and they do not do that.
B. They want us to do our part, even though they cannot tell us what that is, or why it is critical, because they need us.
C. Their stance is based on self-interest on their part, because they are us, and it is in their interest to preserve us.</p>

<p>(3.) Now unfold another extension from (2.):</p>

<p>A. Whatever it is they know, and won&#39;t tell us, must be extremely disturbing, or it could be openly explained.
B. Whatever it is they need us to do, must be done in a state of extreme confusion and uncertainty.
C. The linkage between our disorientation, and their disturbing knowledge, must be made, somehow, in coordination between us and them.</p>

<p>(4.) Now we project some questions raised by this situation:</p>

<p>A. What might have been discovered that could not reasonably be told to us, without endangering us?
B. Under what conditions could we seek a solution in coordination with them, without being told?
C. What type of resolution might extract both us and them from the current chaotic and precarious situation?</p>

<p>(5.) Now preliminary answers to the questions in (4.):</p>

<p>A. Our civilization may have passed a certain point at which survival of the entire planet has become a low probability.
B. Each sector of the human population - those very few that know, and those many who do not - will need to focus on solutions.
C. A resolution that includes both a broadly shared, highly positive, humane mind-set, and a hybrid high-low-tech analog-digital, earth-friendly technology, seems to be indicated.</p>

<p>People know the game is rigged, but just not how deeply. If the people pulling the strings throw Clinton to the dogs and she gets hit with actual charges, there will be less incentive to dig deeper. The Clinton corruption will be seen as a huge cleansing and the people pulling the strings will be safe for a while knowing that the public thinks corruption has been taken care of.</p>

<p>Voting does not matter. This country is a hegemony, oligarchy, plutocracy and corporatocracy all wrapped in one package. If you honestly believe rich people are going to allow the common joe to decide the leadership of the number one country on the globe, by punching a hole next to a name printed on a piece of paper or marking it in with a bubble, then you&#39;re a fool. Is that what you believe? That&#39;s like saying Jerome the Janitor is sitting at a Fortune 500 meeting, asking about 3rd quarter earnings and about to fire Brian the bean counter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it becomes too much to take, then people will turn. For most people, though, the crimes of the elite don&#39;t even reach their ears. Events happen, scandals are exposed, but because no politicians are <em>directly</em> attacking people, many can&#39;t find the will or the need to change their way of thinking. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen in this election alone that a ton of people are openly breaking out of the neoliberal/neoconservative brainwash. Trump and Sanders have changed that by bringing class warfare back into the public consciousness, and these ideas are reminding people that economic and political violence is still violence and that we are, in effect, being attacked by an elite minority.</p>
