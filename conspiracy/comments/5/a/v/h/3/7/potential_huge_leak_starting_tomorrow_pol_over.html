       Obviously take an anonymous post with a grain of salt, but this supports the theory that NYPD uncovered a smoking gun on Anthony Weiner's computer. [EDIT, there is discussion of the pedo ring we have been hearing about

        No mention of a pedo ring, however

       "Over the next few days many new documents will be released. The contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest coverup in American History. Before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until this month, WikiLeaks and Anonymous have worked together in building an efficient, detailed, comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and 21 individuals ranging from the DNC, FBI, CIA, and Clinton foundation. These documents will show without a doubt, evidence of Treason, Obstruction of Justice, Election Fraud/Manipulation, and Bribery.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was intended to the be October surprise. But before the release of these documents, we were contacted by a member of the FBI, as well as another from the CIA, and a week later by the NYPD. All with information retaining [EDIT: sic] to something much darker than even we imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the nature of these leaks, we all worked together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives. 
1.) That all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized, searchable, manageable way.
2.) Those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made. (This concern wasn't without warrant)."

       People eat that shit up. People might say that everyone "woke up that day", but the people who see through it likely already knew they were full of shit and biased.
      </p>

       Lots of other people see on the news that there's a leak of confidential data and hear it's illegal to read and end up trusting their all-knowing TV. That's why we're here in the first place. Those that control what's on our TVs choose who win the elections

       Most people only know about the law through word of mouth. I'm sure if no one ever mentioned that Murder was a crime there would be a lot more Murder's going on. I don't know if this is clear but what I'm getting at is that because a "trusted" source has told people that it's a crime they are going to believe that it's a crime because they are afraid of jail. The sad part is that I'm sure if these same people heard taking a shit was a crime they'd plug their asshole up instantly.

       I am no better, or more valuable than those lives were, and they made the ultimate sacrifice so that their families and children could live with hope. I've been hoping and waiting for 10 years since I first "woke up" for the powers that be to be brought to justice, and I cannot imagine anything greater coming to pass in my lifetime.

       You better strap in and grab your guns and purchase some body armor mate. It's going to be bloody, but Others who came before us have lived through this and it's a necessary cycle to kill the corruption , burn it, and bury the ashes. We can't puss out on this one. So grab your nutsack and get ready.

       Doesn't have to be violent.  Don't assume it will be.  Be ready in case it is, but don't start the violence by drawing first blood.  Such a thing may not be necessary.  Be ready - yes - but don't fly off the handle and start shooting like crazy because you

       things'll turn violent.

       Honestly this. Being a male sucks because most of my money goes to the Government if I'm not married. But I'd like to do nothing more with my free time than stuff my fat face and play video games while getting my dick touched every once in a while. I can't see my self being able to do that if we have a Revolution.

       If you couldn't detect the sheer amount of sarcasm coming from my comment let me be clear. That's fucking sarcasm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not wish for a violent civil war I wish for a peaceful one, one where more than just internet warriors wake up and realize how incredibly deep and fucked this rabbit hole in fact is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say if violence came I would not fight. I believe in this country but there are only so many times that someone can thrust facts and truth in front of someone and they ignore it before shit hits the fan. This country's at a tipping point, violence can and will most likely come in one way shape or form at any minute be it foreign or domestic. I do not wish violence upon this country but I will not cower from it either.

       If you think that's an actual possibility then you're off your rocker man. No fucking way there would be a revolution in this country. First off most of our population are too content as is and wouldn't risk their own hides. Second our government is armed to the teeth with drones, satelites and mine resistant troop carriers and shit. They are the best outfitted police and military in the world, we'd have no chance especially once they cut communications. Keep dreaming

       The military would likely be split if a revolution happened. Most soldiers there wouldn't fire on American citizens. Many Generals would probably side with the people too.

       That said, I seriously doubt that anything that big will happen right now.

       True. I know a lot of military guys and I'm confident not a single one of them would obey orders to harm Americans unless they were absolutely convinced those people were the enemy.

       F22's can't patrol street corners, Abrams tanks can't tell the difference between a pizza guy, an insurgent l, or a bank manager. If fighting the American military was always a losing battle, we would see a peaceful Americanized Afghanistan and Iraq, not the insurgent hell hole of (current year) 2016

       That's Apples to Oranges. Afghanistan was a nightmare in terms of terrain, the fighters were hardened veterans of their war against Russia(or countless conflicts of the region), many of them flooded in from Pakistan. They were hardened fighters not some doughy middle class American's who's idea of hardship is hitting a 30 minute traffic jam on the way back from work.  There was a cultural and language divide that isolated our troops and made it hard if not impossible for them to gain the local's trust and get in tune with local communities to root out the insurgents. Literally none of that stuff would be an issue here. If our Govt wanted to fully oppress a revolution in a no holds bar situation they would do it with expert analysis of social media and cell phone meta data and sting rays, they would know who is where and who is fucking with them and they would put a predator missile right through their roof. We would have no chance unless a significant portion of the US military defected. If that didn't happen we would be toast. But really that is a mute point. The fact that over 250 people upvoted for that comment is ridiculous. It's proof of how moronic part of the /r/ conspiracy community is. A revolution in this country would be hell on earth, probably worse than any to have ever taken place beforehand. And even if there was a revolution I'd bet next to none of them would have the guts to do a damn thing.

       Honestly, I would be devastated. As someone that works for the government, I don't know how I would handle it. I would be ashamed. I would be embarrassed and disappointed. Nothing good will come out of this except making any participating members pay for what they did.

       And how would you be blamed? It's easy to use blanket statements and say it's "all the government's fault." When in reality, deep rooted corruption like this is isolated to just a few of the entire population that work for the government. Those with the most power. Many others simply "take orders" as their job consists of.

       And if it doesn't actually happen, it sure would be nice for there to be a big huge, loud acknowledgement of how problematic it is that people could so flippantly believe something that is such an incredibly serious allegation. Seriously, I have a feeling if the regulars on r/conspiracy would acknowledge all of the times they have been wrong, they'd find that less than 5% of the conspiratorial things they believe are ever proven to be true.

       Well I can't speak for the regulars here but I don't go believing every post I see here. I don't know if there is actually organized pedo activity happening at the highest levels of our government but I do know that the language used in some of these emails is sketchy as fuck. You would have to be an idiot to read that beanie baby email sent to the Georgetown faculty and take it literally at face value. They are clearly talking about something else and arent actually trying to sell 480 beanie babies in bulk for $9,600. That one email alone was enough to make me feel uncomfortable.

       The one email that seemed to make everyone suspicious about "pizzagate" is very easy to explain. Bill Clinton went to North Korea to rescue a hostage. The three Korean people eating pizza were the hostage, her sister, and one of their children. That's it.

       I have no doubt that you've looked into this story more than I have. But what I have seen, the stuff that people are saying is solid proof, appears to be just completely tenuous garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're too deep into conspiracy world. You have no perspective on the story, on whether it makes any sense in the world. It is a monumentally stupid allegation to suggest that Hillary Clinton's staff and husband are involved in a pedophile ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how it works: you dislike/hate/distrust the government and anyone who is in an elite/establishment position. Hillary and the Clintons and anyone associated with her define this. Therefore, you immediately distrust anything about them, and you are excessively willing to believe anything bad about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So someone with an equal or greater amount of distrust than you, possibly someone with an actual mental illness, puts together some information purporting that Hillary's people are involved in a pedophile ring. And so when you start seeing evidence about a pedophile ring that most people would assume is questionable at best, you are the opposite. Other people assume that it's probably false unless the evidence is very strong, difficult to dispute. You, on the other hand, assume that it's probably true unless you see some kind of obvious evidence to the contrary. But you're never going to see evidence to the contrary because these kinds of stories are so crazy that no credible person even bothers to investigate and point out the obvious errors and fallacies in the story. Also, they know that most people like you probably won't believe the facts that disprove the story anyway, so why should they even bother?
      </p>
      <p>
       The final level of your belief in this stuff is that you also now think that I'm in denial or haven't been properly informed or part of the conspiracy or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way for you to really sort this out and verify the accuracy is if you're willing to step back and consider that maybe none of it's true, to approach it with more skepticism.

       Well I don't believe with 100% certainty that they're involved in a pedo ring but I'm not gonna say that they aren't either. The evidence I'm working with is wikileaks. All I'm saying is that some of the emails are sketchy and don't make sense at face value. If there is a pedo ring this wouldn't be the first time either, look up the British pedo scandal and Jimmy savile, it really wouldn't be that shocking if it was happening in America too. However I refuse to believe something isn't possible just because it's disturbing. I suggest you check out the wikikeaks emails the are worth looking into. Also
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">

       You can't just say "The evidence I'm working with is wikileaks."
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks is not evidence. Wikileaks is a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's this weird thing I've started to notice where people think that everything Wikileaks releases is dark, secret information that is hiding massive conspiracies. The reality is that 99% of Wikileaks information is very mundane information of no consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But guess what the conspiracy theorists do? They assume the worst and then they take the leaked information (which often lacks context) and they give it the worse possible context imaginable. This is how a picture of 2 Korean-American women and a Korean-American girl eating pizza becomes proof of a pedophile ring (even though it's just a picture of Lisa Ling, Laura Ling, and one of their daughters, and they're celebrating because Laura Ling had just been released from being a hostage in North Korea).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the story of the Korean-American girl that Bill Clinton rescued by visiting North Korea after they took her hostage:

       And the Wikipedia entry about it:

       Well CNN fired Donna Brazile because of what was found on wikileaks so it's not all mundane/false information. And that picture you're describing doesn't prove anything you're right, there are much more damning emails than that one. My point is that there is clearly code talk being used in some of the emails and the only reason people would do that is to hide something. Combine that with emails about having kids in a pool for entertainment for adults and the comet ping pong Instagram page and it definitely looks sketchy. I'm not saying I have smoking-gun evidence I'm simply saying it looks sketchy. Honestly though you seem a little more preoccupied with fighting conspiracy theories than actually finding the truth so the conversation is fruitless.

       I didn't say it was all mundane information, and I didn't say it was false information. Yes, Dona Brazille did engage in shady practices and Wikileaks caught that, and there was clear evidence of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is different. This is not clear evidence of a pedophile ring. This is a lot of people loosely interpreting evidence from Wikileaks. Those other "much more damning emails...." Where are they? And why is it that you can't say they show clear evidence of a pedophile ring? Because it doesn't exist, at all. But the poorly argued conspiracy bullshit is alive and well on this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong -- some conspiracies are worth checking out. This one is just really off a cliff and it makes you look less credible when you try to argue such blatantly false conspiracy theories.

       "Because it doesn't exist, at all." How do you know that? I'm not saying it definitely exists or doesn't exist. My argument is that there are multiple emails that deserve investigation. I'll send you some of the emails I'm talking about when I get out of work. If your so sure there isn't a pedo ring in Washington then show me some evidence, otherwise this discussion is just me providing information and then you providing your opinion.

       Sure, send me the emails. But note two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that some emails are false, that someone edited a small percentage of the emails. Then, if most of the emails are accurate/valid/true, it becomes easy to manipulate people into believing a lie stuck in the middle of a bunch of true (but mostly mundane) information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the emails show direct evidence, then it's just the same thing that happens always with conspiracies: a small grain of slightly odd information, and then a wild interpretation of that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that the New York Times has now said that the story is bullshit. Not that you are going to trust the New York Times implicitly, but you should at least read the article and consider that this conspiracy might be wrong:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Always remember that you are more likely to believe a lie when it comports with what you already believe. So if you already hate Hillary (possibly because of false information you've read about her), then you are likely to believe new lies about her that you hear.

       1) I see that when you can no longer defend your position, you change the subject to something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I'm not really defending Hillary. I'm questioning the idea of blind distrust of everything Hillary and questioning blind trust of information that's critical of Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I'd love to see which lies you think she told about Benghazi. There's just nothing there, which is why she was exonerated without any punishment at all. Same with the emails -- the emails were just a relatively minor mistake in the context of the much more major scandals that have happened at the highest levels of government throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it to you this way: if you are going to be a truly consistent skeptic, then you must also consider at times when it is appropriate to be skeptical of the skepticism. You should be skeptical, that is, of the conspiracies. This is how you can separate the valid conspiracies from the ones that are likely invalid. This is also how you can ultimately present yourself as more credible when trying to persuade people about your conspiracy. And in the process, you might actually be doing important work if you are skeptical about the right things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem when you push questionable conspiracies instead of pursuing more valid conspiracies is that you can actually harm the country -- you can distract us from focusing on the actual conspiracies that are happening at the highest levels of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me give you an example: there was actually a conspiracy surrounding 9/11, but it's not the super crazy truther conspiracy that most people are familiar with. The conspiracy is that before Bush came into office, the Bush administration wanted to invade Iraq in order to earn money off of a war, to get Iraqi oil, and to exert greater American imperialism around the world. 9/11 gave them the excuse to tell the American people "we need to start this war in order to fight terrorism."
      </p>
      <p>
       But what happened? Instead of everybody questioning the Bush administration's motives for the war and the lies they told to get consent from Congress and the American people, as we should have, we had this gigantic faction of people spending years trying to prove this outlandish theory that the Bush administration planned 9/11. In the process, this actually helped the Bush administration go to war in Iraq because it made it seem like any criticism of them was a crazy conspiracy theory.

       We already have sufficient evidence that both under Bush and under Obama (with HRC as secretary of state) the US government intentionally lied to have pretexts to incite or prolong and intensify civil wars in the middle east, from Iraq to Syria to Libya. These wars cost hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives, including thousands of children's lives. The results of these wars are the breaking up of families and migration of millions, including hundreds of thousands of children, many of which are being exploited now as child sex labour, either because they are without guardians or a state, or because they have to earn money to help pay for the escape of their families from death and starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that is well known, well documented, and above serious doubt. Nobody went to prison. Nobody even lost a job or a pension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if these new allegations were 100% true, how would a few more abused children significantly add to this list of crimes? How would that lead to any arrests all of a sudden? (And, frankly, how hypocritical would that be?)

       I mean if you think this would be anything but devastating, youre too lost in the philosophy. yes its hypocritical, but you cant underestimate the power of tribal psychology. being responsible for hundreds of deaths abroad is easy enough to explain away to people who already want to believe in you. Personally molesting an underaged american citizen is a very different political moment.

       100%. We're used to hearing about people die in the middle east whether we like it or not. We can believe it's "war over oil" and not really blame the politicians for it completely just because that's how we think our government works. People are just used to that idea but think there's nothing we can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you hear about a 12 year old getting her innocence de-innocented, and people are ready to lynch someone. Unfortunately it's our only hope to enact real change. No one wants to see a pedophile or someone involved in a pedophilia ring get elected or keep office. It's worse than murder in our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone who's corrupt is also a pedophile, but I understand hoping that the most corrupt people were complicit. It's the only way you can say "see what a piece of shit they are" and get everyone to agree. They could be complicit in the murder of a journalist and no one will bat an eye. Life is cheap in this country. Feels like it wasn't always like this, but it definitely is now.

       I saw a cool ted talk making the case that the world has actually been getting better for a long time now, but the mechanism driving this change is our growing awareness of whats actually going on, causing this generation in particular to subjectively percieve the world as having just recently gotten much worse.

       If the videos are heavily censored it might pass as legal.  We don't really need to see the pornographic parts.  A picture of children being led into a bedroom where Bill Clinton is standing in his underwear would be enough.  Or it could simply be video of the guilty party talking about having sex with kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger issue is how those who are implicated will spin this to protect themselves.  "WikiLeaks knowingly distributed child pornography!  Those perverts on 4chan actually watched it!  Watching those videos is against the law!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That might be enough to scare the general public into burying their heads in the sand.  "I didn't see it, so it must not be real."

       The thing is, it wont. The evidence they have on the laptop regarding this type of stuff is most likely Anthony Weiner's. Since he's Huma's husband ad so closely tied to Hillary it looks bad. But if they don't release it they're basically hurting the victims. So it's a rough spot. But this narrative being pushed by others is absurd. Everyone is anonymous with an anonymous source. If you can't come forward with this type of evidence then you're full of bullshit.

       So... If you had evidence that some of the most powerful people in the world were involved in several conspiracies up to and including organising child sex slave rings, you'd simply supply the information signed with your real name?

       You give a heads-up about their impending doom so they start covering stuff up in a reckless fashion. Everything they do from this point forward would showcase their guilt. Of course, this is only if there really is all of this damning info out there.

       How exactly is that supposed to play out? You walk into your local news station with this info and what? They immediately put you in witness protection? No, you go home and wait. You hope they run it soon. You hope they verify the information with the right people and it doesn't get moth balled somewhere up the chain. These are the most powerful people on the planet and you think you can expose them the same way you'd run a story on the lunch lady stealing from the donation box?

       Which is why these leaks are done through a source like wikileaks (much more prudent than reddit). However, you still shouldn't leak under your identity for fear of assassination, prosecution, or exile. See: Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, etc. These are the most powerful people in the world remember. How credible are you going to find my information if I'm caught in a murder or child porn investigation? Maybe a plane goes down while im on vacation; simple accident. "Oh well" for you right? For me, I'm dead.

       I really don't know the truth behind them, and most don't either.   However, being in the top game of power for 20+ years, and in politics for an even longer time, you are going to meet a ton of people who will associate with you.  More than you can imagine.  And some will die.  I'm sure some die because they messed with the wrong people.  It doesn't necessarily have to be the Clintons either.  These are people who deal with powerful people around the world.  It could be other corrupt politicians, the mob, etc.  I do think it is strange how some deaths are reported, but you have to take into account how many people they do relations with every day for decades.

       Even if it did, how would you know what was completely made up and what's real? That's the issue with any kind of leak like this, it instantly lacks any credibility if it's coming from some other foreign agency. It's clearly targeted which means it's an attack directed at the Clinton campaign. There's all this shit on Clinton, but not one single mention of Trump in any of these leaks people do? Already makes me suspicious to begin with. How many of these turn out to be completely false rumors altogether? How many giant leaks are we told are gonna happen? I remember on Facebook someone said Putin was gonna present undeniable evidence that would rock the nation the US was responsible for 9/11, whatever happened to that? Like 95% of everything from unreputable sources, it was bullshit, it always was.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually this has happened before so the idea of a pedo ring isn't unrealistic, it's just the target, the timing and the clear agenda someone has in stirring the pot up. I can't remember the guys name, he was either a state or federal politician but he ran a pedophile ring and eventually got caught so it's not impossible, but...is anyone gonna say with a straight face there are emails from government accounts sharing pictures videos and emails of this shit... So convenient too, right before election day we hear about this. Trumps facing the same accusations but they haven't leaked a god damn thing about him this whole cycle, it's obvious what their agenda is so as far as I'm concerned, it's BS. And you should all be skeptical too until we see some real proof and analysis.

       It's fucking nuts. I haven't gone to 4chan in probably 8-9 years? When I was going there (every. single. day. for years) it was all just caturday and desu spam. I actually went to the first wave of anonymous protests against scientology. It's just fucking nuts. The internet is a weird place and the world seems to be adapting to its weirdness.

       What?  There is no proof that these leaks WILL come out.  Its just some random anonymous poster from some shady forum.  Based on historical evidence, most of these pre-announcements have been false.  Preannouncements are a new form of disinformation.

       How could anyone believe any of that though?

       With today's tech its entirely possible to make CGI videos of any political leader doing any terrible activity.   Video, with sound, it does not really matter.

      <p>
       I wonder which political leaders will get totally screwed, and possibly murdered by the people, when a fake video of them comes out in all of their likeness.

       If they had something it should have been released already. But no we have to wait so they can't replace Hillary. But no we were contacted by the government and they told us a story that we completely believe so we are still researching. Everything will be released in a few days. Trust us.

       It is a valid point. We have a very serious problem in this country. The Democratic Party has rigged the election and installed a sham candidate in Hillary Clinton, in a total affront to our Democratic process.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even have untold $hill$ on this very forum who go around minimizing, distracting, arguing with, and gas lighting actual American people who pay the taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody in America has to or should consider any Clinton as legitimate. Nobody has to accept Hillary. The lines for Bernie Sanders at the caucuses were very long.

       Oh, I just think the whole story in the post doesn't make a lot of sense.  They claim the FBI, CIA and NYPD contacted them? Doesn't make any sense.  Also, the way they dropped "october surprise" in there further convinces me it's just some kid on pol spouting nonsense.

       It also softens the blow. Someone says "PROOF!" and it isnt...its just
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       but people now dismiss credible evidence because it isnt the smoking gun they thought it would be. On its own without the sensationalism the evidence would mount up to something severely damaging but we think less of it because it isnt what we want it to be.

       The gunpowder plot was about bringing down parliament.

       It was actually about Catholics trying to remove a Protestant government.  It was essentially religious extremists blowing up a building, which sounds rather familiar...

       Yeah I'm gonna think anonymous if they are playing a central role in thus would bend over backwards to release on that day. I thought this week would be better wikileaks sort of disappointed but that only leads me to think that whatever they do have will be so damning even released last minute will be enough for her to resign or get no votes on election day.

       Amy Goodman provides solid truthful reporting. Time and again for nearly twenty years I have heard things for the first time on her program that seemed outlandish to me, then watched in horror as they turned out to be the absolute truth. This happened with voting machine fraud back when Bush was still president, for instance, and the Weapons of Mass Destruction claim that Bush made before the Iraqi invasion. She's a valuable resource and I couldn't care less how she pays her rent.

       I fully understand why you guys don't like her: topic selection. She's definitely biased in that way, but she's honest in the interviews and her outfit is a grade a prime bullshit detector.

       So are WikiLeaks and the intercept. All three organizations are extremely vulnerable to false sources. They have exhibited their ability to manage the problem. We need them working for us now in that way simply because there are no other organizations on the planet that can do a better job of it.

       It is illegal to host/share child porn, so I would imagine there is risk in releasing this stuff, right? The sick part is that folk need to see it to shock them awake. This is all terrifying, I agree.

       It's just too bad that if this comes to pass, CNN will say "Wikileaks hosts child porn from Russia" and "Assange confirmed pedophile because Wikileaks distributed child porn".... Without saying why they would distribute such a thing.

       THIS my friend, is how it feels to be alive during one of the greatest moments in our history - to see true patriots stirring to battle with righteousness in their hearts for their country and freedom. I think my fear is other countries seeing our moment of disruption during a constitutional crisis (which this is looking like) and taking advantage of it. We have a lot of pay to players out there around the world and a lot of enemies. Remain vigilant.

       No matter what happens, things are going to get worse before they get better. They might not go as dark as these particular rumors indicate, but we're going to be in for trouble one way or the other. We already have the DOJ and President stonewalling the FBI and covering up obvious crimes of a presidential candidate as their crimes get exposed further and further every day. We're living in strange times.

       I want to believe, but this is cutting it awfully close to the election. Only 5 days now, and It usually takes a few days after a leak for the MSM to even acknowledge it, this is cutting it close enough that even the most damning leak could be too late. If she gets elected they can put the blame on others or have Obama pardon people who would otherwise have to testify against her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Wikileaks has said they aren't doing this to directly effect the election, but if they want to be about gov't transparency, voters deserve to know who they're about to potentially elect as leader of the free world. it would be really shitty if they wait until after the election to release the bombshell, and Hillary wins then has to be impeached.. maybe they just to watch the world burn.

       Because his support has been based on the premise that Trump is just as bad for the country and, from his perspective at least, worse than Clinton. Which is a fair perspective. Both Trump and Clinton are morally bankrupt, corrupt trash. There's really no way to "pick a side" in this situation if you believe in the system at all, which as a career politician I'm sure he does. He's doing what he thinks is best within the bounds of the system he believes in. If you disagree with his choice, cool. But don't completely vilify the man for operating within the bounds of a system that isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

       I'd like to see him start the formation of a third party that can be taken seriously. The Republicans and Democrats are so far removed from reality and no longer seem to represent a lot of the populace that being forced into their framework in order to meaningfully participate at this point just no longer makes sense.

       No it isn't. Personally I think Clinton is worse than Trump. Trump is a buffoon, a liar, and a misogynist. He's also a politically ignorant moron. He spouts a lot of nonsense that a president would never be able to actually do. Clinton is just utterly corrupt, obviously dishonest and manipulative, and completely willing to sacrifice or sell out others to attain her own goals. The fact that her campaign has been pushing for a conflict with Russia in order to deflect attention from her many scandals is the most frightening element to come out of this whole ridiculous mess of a campaign season. Ultimately the thing that makes her worse in my opinion is that she has the political savvy and network to be able to really damage the country in ways we would not be able to unravel for decades. That being said, I understand that others may not view the situation in the same way I do, and I'm not going to shit on then for their opinion. Personally I think Sanders should've run third party. He's probably the only person that's ever had a chance to win, and that could've really changed the political landscape. Instead we get two assholes campaigning on which one is worse than the other.

       As if you would even read an argument against trump.  There is info all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       This article is just the lies he said in a week in March:
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-fact-check-errors-exaggerations-falsehoods-213730">
        http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-fact-check-errors-exaggerations-falsehoods-213730
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this is all MSM, so it must be false right?  They include verifiable sources.  Something Trump has
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       done.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is brainwashed? Someone believing Trump with almost 0 support for anything he says, or someone who can call that bullshit?

       I agree to an extent, but I don't think Trump's motivations are in the right place. He always runs for president, always as one of the joke candidates like the various porn stars and Vermin Supreme. He's says a bunch of funny outlandish stuff, flies around giving speeches, and then drops out and supports some other candidate after getting all kinds of attention. I don't think he had any intention of things being different this time, but the Republicans have gone so far off the deep end and spent so much energy courting this kind of extreme, ignorant base that his outlandish statements started to gain some traction with a lot of people and it all just got out of control. Now he's just going for it because why not? Coupled with Clinton's pathological inability to appear even reasonably likable, and of course all the scandals, it's like the perfect conditions for a once in a lifetime shit blizzard.

       Honestly, if he shilled out for money or fear, you'd think this sub at least would realize he would just be a standard puppet in office anyway. It's not like the people that are compelling him to act as he is now would have just given up and gone home had he won the primaries.

       Seriously. Bernie seems like a decent guy but he sold out. He got cheated and peacefully fell in line. I lost all respect for him when he didn't stand up for himself. I can never vote for him again knowing that he wouldn't be able to stand up for our country.

       WTF are you talking about? Did you want him to be a pouty bitch about the whole deal? Yea, he got cheated, but he knows that throwing up his hands and saying "alright, fuck you guys" wouldn't get anything useful done. His campaign was always about changing the discourse of the DNC, and he's accomplished that. Having a big ego isn't good for being President, as evidenced by Trump.

       He would of Won if the DNC didn't purposefully cheat him out of what he deserved and earned. In a fair race he would of beat Hillary and honestly would of probably beat Donald too.

       I completely agree. What they did was a travesty. They didn't even do a good job of hiding it. FFS, Debbie Shultz was made head of Clinton's campaign mere hours after her resignation was announced. You can't get much more blatant than that.

       He has done nothing of the sort. He realizes that the situation is a complex one. Now, he had two options here.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could do what you suggest and lambaste the DNC (who definitely deserve it). He had a HUGE following made up of a very important demographic for the Democrats. An antagonistic approach would fracture the party and even drive some of his base to vote for whoever wasn't Clinton. That obviously means Trump. He believes that a Trump presidency would be even worse than a Clinton presidency (even if she was elected fraudulently).
      </p>
      <p>
       His other option is to work from the inside to push the platform of the DNC closer to his own. He has actually been quite successful in this, and has forced Clinton to take on more progressive policy in order to secure the vote of his base. This is the only option that actually furthers his dream for the country. His humility in this is not a weakness, but a virtue. He doesn't care about personal power (unlike Clinton), he cares only about moving the country in a more progressive direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the beginning he knew that winning the primary was a long shot, and his campaign was always primarily about creating a grassroots effort that would change the discourse in our political system.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It has nothing to do with ego, it has to do with sticking up for yourself. If he can't stick up against the corruption of his own party then How can I expect him to reform our entire country?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not about him, it's about progress. He will do whatever it takes to push his agenda, even if it means endorsing a cheat. His endorsement keeps him at the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's not "his own party". He's an Independent that caucuses with the Democrats. He runs with the them for the same reason he endorsed Clinton after she "won" the primary. He knows that in order to push his agenda, he has to play with the big boys.

       I have to agree, I was so crestfallen the first time at the democratic convention we need to get behind Shillery. No real Bernie fan would do that. I was so hoping he would tell them all to fuck off and join a third party and when that didn't happen I gave up on him.

       Quite possibly Bernie believed that  throwing in with Team Hillary made a lot of sense because A) Trump and B) if HRC as president and if the Dems take control of the senate at any point Bernie can use his leverage to be thorn in HRC side.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you think Bernie is going to just roll over if / when HRC gets elected your wrong.

       Throwing in with HRC was a very good move for Bernie and his agenda.

       There ia nothing in the constitution that allows for this. (except for the possibly the electoral college, but that is not a revoting). She would be sworn in, and then if she is removed, Tim Kane becomes president.  If he is removed, then it goes to the speaker of the house.   But the senate needs to convict both of them, and will likely be under control of the DEMs

       fucking kids won't take days to get covered. everyone one of killarys soap box msm will jump ship and report on it. it's a smear that no one wants to be anywhere near, that's why TPTB use it against people. it's like having dog shit on your hands, you can wash it but the smell still lingers and taints everything you touch.

       It's kind of like somebody leaking information to wikileaks, only to 4chan instead. They just do it because they may be a good person who stumbled into some shit, and that's the easiest way to get it to anybody in the public while remaining anonymous.

       My advice for everyone on here is not to anticipate the leak but to come up with a plan. Go grocery shopping now if your fridge is empty. Most Americans do not have the benefit to do so right now. 
Most Americans will be in shock. As will the world. 
Next 5-8 hours are vital.

       If there are photos of political figures abusing children, you better believe those folk's lives will be over.

       I've always wondered what it would take to get riots in the street but pardoning a rich pedophile politician might very well do it.

       Yeah, there's no way these crooks don't get assassinated if the president pardons them for example after the whole world has seen them raping children. If this comes to pass, anyone directly implicated is fucked one way or the other.

       If this is as they imply, then there will certainly be repercussions. At the extreme would be a citizen revolt, but I doubt it would come to that. Who in the military/police would fight to defend child molestors?

       To add to this: If you have pets, make sure to get food and supplies for them, too. Fill up the car's gas tank and double-check your "go bag". Review the plans you've made and update them if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, try not to succumb to fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Trust your skills, trust your plans, and trust your intuition in adjusting them on the fly. The grace of the Gods be with you all in these troubling times. Good hunting. The North remembers.

       I'm calling BS. For one thing, I haven't heard anything (check my profile), although obviously I don't know all of what's going on. For another, in general Anonymous doesn't work well with others. Third, a lot of Anons are angry at Wikileaks because Assange has a history of using the Anonymous name and actions when he thinks it helps him, then shitting all over Anonymous when he thinks that will help him.

       Who the hell is OP, that s/he has good contacts in all three agencies who are willing to leak information (at the risk of losing their jobs, and according to OP, with concerns for their safety)? And these three people all decided to leak information about the same topic, by coincidence? The only way I could

       It's also written in a rather awkward syntax with some bizarre spelling errors and wrong word choice type mistakes. To my eye, it seems like it was written by a non-native speaker. I'm not sure what that could mean, but it sort of set off some "bullshit alarms" in my head.

       "The new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails, pictures, and videos. Within these will be evidence of Bill Clinton, as well as at least 6 other Government officials, taking part in sexual acts with minors. As well as evidence of Human trafficking that also included minors.
      </p>
      <p>
       We believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation. In order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       These documents were given to us by an American Governement official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by Hilary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail. He also told us that due to the restricted access to these documents, they would soon know he was the one who released them to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tried to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely, but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out. We are still not sure if this is because they became aware of the leak, or if they were scared that he may in the future. In either case, his identity will be made public in this next set of leaks so that he can be honored for the hero that he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will not only be releasing these documents, but we have multiple members of the FBI, CIA, and NYPD who will be publically verifying their authenticity once their safety is assured.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hack has not come from Russia or anyone else they may try to blame this on. This is a leak from Americas own Government Officials who fear for their safety had the opposed them directly due to reasons that will be made clear soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We thank you for your patience, as well as your determination and assistance in helping us expose the corruption that has infested our own government. Democracy will be restored to America.

       See, in college there are these things called essays. When you write these essays and quote someone or material that is not your own, you usually have to cite the source of the information. Now depending on how long the quote is, you actually have to format it a different way. Also, at the end of the essay, you normally include a work cited page or bibliography. So maybe you should google MLA format and start from there?

      <p>

       All of the people in here doubting the Hillary Clinton international sex trafficking ring are an embarrassment to r/conspiracy. This is something we've been suspecting for years and now that the semblances of actual proof are coming together, you're going to bury your head in the sand and claim it's all ridiculous?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you even doing here? Did CTR pay you to get a lobotomy? This is the kind of stuff this sub was built on. We can't trust the government to expose it, so we need to do the work ourselves. No one's going to come out and say "yes I peddle kids to Israel for a profit", so of course it's going to sound ridiculous to anyone outside of this sub.. until you research it and realize there's a lot more to this than you think.
      </p>

       Go to WikiLeaks and search for the word "pizza". Then make a good argument for why the people in this world with the most power sit around and email each other about pizza all day. Tell me how it makes any sense. And you better have a goddamn solid argument.

       Indeed. I don't necessarily trust Alex Jones but when Fox News is the only organization aside from Drudge and Breitbart that's doing their jobs and reporting on all these Hillary crimes, I gotta give them all the benefit of the doubt

       Ok I did. There were a 126 results. Out of 42000, that's 0.3% of the emails (and that's 8 years of emails) that have the word pizza in them. There may be a code there, but I think operators like this are a bit more sophisticated than that. Maybe I'm wrong.

       It's just really hard for me to believe that these millionaires sit around all day sending each other very strangely worded cryptic emails about pizza. Is it nothing? Could be. But it's worth putting thought into.

       That's probably because "a major leak in the next few days... bigger than anything they've ever leaked before" has been promised over and over and it's unfounded or some minor crap the majority (but not all of) the time.

       I mean I wouldn't really care or believe you. Whatever is leaked is always hyped to no end regardless of what it actually is. It'll be something fairly mild, then you'll just look a bit silly, and then in a year the process will repeat

       Listen up. My grandpa was full yeti. So that makes me 1/4 yeti. I am allowed to use such terms like bigfoot and the even more offensive (when said by non yetis) sasquatch. So before you get in my face on reddit in front of everyone telling me what to say, maybe you should get your facts straight!

       2:09 am, said all would be posted to wikileaks within the hour. This is bollocks. It's highly unlikely the OP is employed by wikileaks, or is in direct contact with Assange.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, OPs claims and info does corroborate with that Steve fellow who posted the two YouTube video announcements yesterday. (See VS stickied on this thread).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact he said "checkmate" makes it seem amateur, but like pre-cognition, I actually sensed weeks ago that someone would say checkmate towards the end of this epic behind the scenes battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Assange is pushing back saying, I'll publish when I'm damn good and ready. It makes zero sense that Wikileaks would publish in congress with some random anon saying checkmate, but that shouldn't completely invalidate what s/he is claiming is coming.

       Hey, I'm all for locking her up, believe me, I wear my "Hillary for Prison" shirt with pride.

      <p>
       I just see two holes in this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but this supports the theory that NYPD uncovered a smoking gun on Anthony Weiner's computer.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was intended to the be October surprise.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So we've been teased this "October Surprise" since the end of summer, and
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       due to whatever was found on Weiner's computer, we're getting it? Just seems awfully convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two: why is this shit always released on a Friday? Why not in the middle or beginning of the week, so it at least gains
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       traction with the MSM, instead of a quick blurb and everyone heads off to enjoy their weekends? By Monday, most people don't give a fuck what happened last week, unless it pertains to West World.

       Check out the link to the 4chan thread, there's speculation that it could be a general who allegedly committed suicide a few months back. Maybe it could also be the Clinton Foundation person who was seeking asylum in another country but has apparently gone missing?

       Sadly, /pol/ has been caught up on this pedophilia topic and other more obscure theories lately. It has taken the focus off of the more believable, (and boring), corruption topics and led them down a seemingly endless rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this, just like many before it, will lead nowhere. Is it a troll or a concerted disinformation effort? Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that the simplest answer is usually correct. We should focus on the simpler motives to explain the corruption like greed and the lust for power and spend less time trying to find secret pedophile rings.

      <p>
       Just my 2¢.

       This could be the reason they were practicing shutting down the internet last week. The Economist (a CFR elitist rag) reinforced the threat of an impending take down, Genl. Petraeus also saying there's going to be a lot more of this in the future. This is all fluffing to get you to think Russia or whatever. The screechiest is, of course, Clinton.

       Scenario: 911 list of the complicit with the Neocons and War Machine for the false flag. Mass arrests and show trials then executions. So, fear of exposure, disclosure. One of the main planners, scared shitless, looking for immunity, may blow the whistle on the whole cabal. The biggest danger, nukes fly as a last attempt at distraction.

       IMHO the biggest cover up in USA history is the 911 attacks orchestrated by Mossad with support of dual citizenship American zionist politicians and the like.

       They needed to do this to drag us deeper into THEIR wars for THEIR benefit, using our tax dollars and young soldiers' lives.

       Since so many of these people are tied to that-- we can hope it blows the lid off of zionist control also.  In my wildest dreams, I never thought it would really happen.  I'm hopeful it's true so we can do something about it.

       What I tell myself all the time when I get down is-- all things come to an end.  Israel has overstepped, and it will soon be toppled, one way or another.  There was open speculation of revolution there only weeks ago.  It's time they oust the nazi zionists.

        <p>
         The FBI Records account is being internally investigated because of the tweets it sent out this past weekend.  FBI anon claimed there was an internal schism inside the FBI.

         The UK Parliament juat said that they make the last call on Brexit irregardless of voter decision.  FBI anon said Brexit wasn't going to happen when it eventually came time.

       So what?  So what if the FBI have the smoking of all guns if the DoJ will not prosecute?
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I understanding correctly that even if the FBI recommends prosecution, Loretta Lynch and the Dept of Justice can still block?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why the eff would Comey incriminate himself, when he is so closely tied to the CF?

       I believe there is evidence, I even a blind man with google could see the corruption.

       I'll believe it when I see it, which means it'll either be overblown or they literally won't release anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these leaks are bullshit. If anyone ever had any kind of "smoking gun" on either side, they wouldn't be waiting until a couple days before the election when it'll do almost nothing. Just more distractions and people trying to get their rocks off by having "the scoop".

       I too want justice for being subjected to the lies.  However let's not forget about potential economic impacts of a massive haul which would indict the fraudsters and their business partners.  The US economy would be brought down and chaos would ensue.  While that sounds sexy and all....I don't have a load of MREs to feed my family with nor do I have a loaded arsenal to help protect me from the apocalypse.

       I wish this were true, but if you believe a thing a random 4channer says you're a little more than a conspiracy nut

      <p>
       bet he claims, once this happens, that the FBI was silenced by team Clinton and had their lives/family lives threatened, and people will eat that bullshit up

       I'm still waiting for leak docs that contain information that our Government has been hiding the existence of Alien life. But let me put on my tinfoil hat. I'm ready! Or that John F. Kennedy was killed by our government. Or that Bigfoot was a mistake from the US Army. See that will be the biggest cover-up in America. Not this.

       How would this work? The public cannot legally view the type of videos they say they have. They would need to release the videos to law enforcement and announce that they did so publicly.  Would that be the best way to go about it?

       After all this gets settled, I hope more investigations are conducted on other people who have been known to be shady individuals. Of course it will take as much effort people are contributing currently. I'd like to thank anyone who has been a part of the effort.

"These documents were given to use by an American Government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by Hilary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail. He also told us that due to the restricted access to these documents, they would soon know that he was the one who released them to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tried to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely, but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out. We are still not sure if this is because they became aware of the leak, or if they were scared that he may in the future. In either case, his identity will be made public in this next set of leaks so that he can be honored for the hero he was." ...

       I can't imagine a government official giving evidence from an ongoing investigation to anonymous. They could potentially ruin any chance for a trial by leaking that data.

       All said and done, I'll believe it when I see it. Hopefully wikileaks excludes the images and instead has a credible source verify their existence/content.

       I can image this, given that Obama killed any investigations into the former government officials immediately after inauguration, and Hillary will very likely stop the investigations into her own criminal allegations also, as she did before via Comey and DOJ. 
This is not the rosy age of Watergate or Church committee anymore, where you could actually go after government officials, and implement constitutional reforms.

       Why trail the leaks? It's not like you have to get people interested beforehand, like with a film or TV trailer. If you have the stuff, leak it. If you don't, then I guess you have to try and fuck with everybody by making it seem like you do.

       haha yea i doubt it too, mostly a joke. I met a flat earther the other weekend that sternly believes this election will fall through somehow and Obama will stay in the presidency. I took down his number in case he's right. Also was joking with him: if this election falls through and Obama stays in power, then I'll believe the earth is flat lol

       You're obviously someone set in your ways.  To think you might be wrong is painful to you, so you lash out at the truth.  You are obviously refusing to read wikileaks also.  Shame on you.

       But is there time? I was just watching a discussion about how if Comey had restarted this investigation a month earlier, Donald would be ahead, but now there may not be enough time for this info to get out to enough people before election day. It will be the same situation with this other stuff. At best, Clinton will go to jail and we will have President Kaine for 4 years. I don't want that. The Democrats don't deserve the presidency after all this.

       The actions of the Democrat Presidential nominee, her campaign, the Democratic National Committee leadership, and the current Democrat sitting president have nothing to do with democrat or republican, liberal or conservative, red or blue? They're just ideologies, pure and innocent, incapable of being tainted by the corruption we observe daily? There is nothing about the strong authoritarian streak in the Democrat and even Republican platforms that encourages and enables the type of behavior we find abhorrent?

       I hope it's about the fraudulent act of 1871 &amp; how it needs to be undone to get rid of this shadow government returning the corporation United States of America Inc. back into a country &amp; we as country as States as Citizens get back to the Constitution,amendments and the Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence. Get rid of admiralty law in military courts &amp; go back to common law, law of the land, natural law &amp; supreme law, Common Law Courts to be presided over by common law judges like Anna Von Reitz. Doing away with all that is unlawful. How we need to quit Big Oil &amp; poisoning our air which contributes to global warming more than cow farts or people &amp;  big corporations destroying our natural land water and world for its natural resources when we can go green I could go on and on but I won't.

       If any of this is true then Trump is the only remaining legally viable candidate being put forward by a major party.

       What legitimate reason do you have to cancel an election? Hell, even if Trump was eliminated (though he did nothing wrong) the election must proceed with third party candidates.

       The democrats are just a party, if they pick a dud that's their problem. That's why they're allowed to rig their primaries...

       It's just too bad that if this comes to pass, CNN will say "Wikileaks hosts child porn from Russia" and "Assange confirmed pedophile because Wikileaks distributed child porn".... Without saying why they would distribute such a thing.

       The thing is, it wont. The evidence they have on the laptop regarding this type of stuff is most likely Anthony Weiner's. Since he's Huma's husband ad so closely tied to Hillary it looks bad. But if they don't release it they're basically hurting the victims. So it's a rough spot. But this narrative being pushed by others is absurd. Everyone is anonymous with an anonymous source. If you can't come forward with this type of evidence then you're full of bullshit.

       We already have sufficient evidence that both under Bush and under Obama (with HRC as secretary of state) the US government intentionally lied to have pretexts to incite or prolong and intensify civil wars in the middle east, from Iraq to Syria to Libya. These wars cost hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives, including thousands of children's lives. The results of these wars are the breaking up of families and migration of millions, including hundreds of thousands of children, many of which are being exploited now as child sex labour, either because they are without guardians or a state, or because they have to earn money to help pay for the escape of their families from death and starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that is well known, well documented, and above serious doubt. Nobody went to prison. Nobody even lost a job or a pension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if these new allegations were 100% true, how would a few more abused children significantly add to this list of crimes? How would that lead to any arrests all of a sudden? (And, frankly, how hypocritical would that be?)

       I am no better, or more valuable than those lives were, and they made the ultimate sacrifice so that their families and children could live with hope.

       Even if it did, how would you know what was completely made up and what's real? That's the issue with any kind of leak like this, it instantly lacks any credibility if it's coming from some other foreign agency. It's clearly targeted which means it's an attack directed at the Clinton campaign. There's all this shit on Clinton, but not one single mention of Trump in any of these leaks people do? Already makes me suspicious to begin with. How many of these turn out to be completely false rumors altogether? How many giant leaks are we told are gonna happen? I remember on Facebook someone said Putin was gonna present undeniable evidence that would rock the nation the US was responsible for 9/11, whatever happened to that? Like 95% of everything from unreputable sources, it was bullshit, it always was.

       And actually this has happened before so the idea of a pedo ring isn't unrealistic, it's just the target, the timing and the clear agenda someone has in stirring the pot up. I can't remember the guys name, he was either a state or federal politician but he ran a pedophile ring and eventually got caught so it's not impossible, but...is anyone gonna say with a straight face there are emails from government accounts sharing pictures videos and emails of this shit... So convenient too, right before election day we hear about this. Trumps facing the same accusations but they haven't leaked a god damn thing about him this whole cycle, it's obvious what their agenda is so as far as I'm concerned, it's BS. And you should all be skeptical too until we see some real proof and analysis.

       So he bends easily? Is that what you want in a president? If he can spend his time campaigning for the candidate who represents everything he stood against, why would he be any different in the oval office?

       How could anyone believe any of that though?

      <p>
       With today's tech its entirely possible to make CGI videos of any political leader doing any terrible activity.   Video, with sound, it does not really matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder which political leaders will get totally screwed, and possibly murdered by the people, when a fake video of them comes out in all of their likeness.

       WTF are you talking about? Did you want him to be a pouty bitch about the whole deal? Yea, he got cheated, but he knows that throwing up his hands and saying "alright, fuck you guys" wouldn't get anything useful done. His campaign was always about changing the discourse of the DNC, and he's accomplished that. Having a big ego isn't good for being President, as evidenced by Trump.

       You better strap in and grab your guns and purchase some body armor mate. It's going to be bloody, but Others who came before us have lived through this and it's a necessary cycle to kill the corruption , burn it, and bury the ashes. We can't puss out on this one.

       It also softens the blow. Someone says "PROOF!" and it isnt...its just
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       but people now dismiss credible evidence because it isnt the smoking gun they thought it would be. On its own without the sensationalism the evidence would mount up to something severely damaging but we think less of it because it isnt what we want it to be.

       Indeed. I don't necessarily trust Alex Jones but when Fox News is the only organization aside from Drudge and Breitbart that's doing their jobs and reporting on all these Hillary crimes, I gotta give them all the benefit of the doubt

       Well I don't believe with 100% certainty that they're involved in a pedo ring but I'm not gonna say that they aren't either. The evidence I'm working with is wikileaks. All I'm saying is that some of the emails are sketchy and don't make sense at face value. If there is a pedo ring this wouldn't be the first time either, look up the British pedo scandal and Jimmy savile, it really wouldn't be that shocking if it was happening in America too. However I refuse to believe something isn't possible just because it's disturbing. I suggest you check out the wikikeaks emails the are worth looking into. Also
