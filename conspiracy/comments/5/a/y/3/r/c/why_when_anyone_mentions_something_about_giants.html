    <div class="md"><p>Blame the Smithsonian, there are tons of interesting theories out there on Giants. Some say Ancient Alien Civilization that came to ruin 100&#39;s of years ago, lots of pictures of Giants and burial mounds being found when settlers came to America in the 1800&#39;s with the bones being whisked off, never to be seen again. Stories of Indians having to fight Giants off in caves. It&#39;s all quite fascinating, there&#39;s some chatter going around that secret bases have been found in locations like Bucegi Mountains at the moment and even in Iraq. Another thing, is they&#39;re supposed to have 6 Fingers and 6 Toes apparently, It&#39;s all fascinating stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard about the 6 fingers and read that apparently the American Indian form of greeting with the raising of your hand was initially to signify you had only 5 fingers and were a &quot;friend,&quot; hence it turning into a friendly greeting between tribes.  It&#39;s all very interesting.</p>

<p>Come to your own conclusions. it is the only way to truth. And it is fucking sad. Because we could have all worked together and made great progress. But nope, now we live in a fog of lies and deception. We can&#39;t even tell up from down anymore.</p>

Or to see clearly that stone has been <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ck1H7">inexplicably melted</a><a href="http://imgur.com/a/KWhtA">, 2</a></p>

<p>And as far as the archeological evidence one doesn&#39;t need to be an expert to see that these solid stone <a href="http://imgur.com/a/CY78E"> pillars are hollow</a> or that these<a href="http://imgur.com/a/0eHeA"> stone figures are also hollow</a>, or to wonder how n the f were <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2dXwV">these</a> mass produced. no expertise required to question how this ancient <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ljGQE">Dacian head</a> wound up in south america. Or to know that <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xdQ9T">these lions</a> were originally part of a much more technically superior structure </p>

<p>you don&#39;t need to be an architect to see the same style of masonry executed flawlessly from <a href="http://imgur.com/a/viAnV">Anatolia</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/HkzA4">Chile</a> to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fLdqK">japan</a> to the Mediterranean region</p>

<p>you don&#39;t need to be a cartographer to see old maps depicting <a href="http://imgur.com/a/jXt5o">Hyperborea</a> or to wonder <a href="http://imgur.com/a/kiW0H">wtf happened here</a> or to wonder why we were never taught about <a href="http://imgur.com/a/W0NVv">tartaria in school</a> or why Washington dc was once called <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sf3Yj">norumbega</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/oKBrd">no expertise is needed to see that something very strange is going on with this photo</a></p>

<p>you don&#39;t need to be an ethnographer to wonder how this chines girl came to have <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gSvPe">shocking blue eyes and stunning red hair</a> or that this native american<a href="http://imgur.com/a/S7bC0"> looks like Putin</a></p>

<p>you don&#39;t need to be an art historian to question the methods that went in to crafting the multiple layer of <a href="http://imgur.com/a/i49JV">this net</a> out of solid marble</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be a symbolist to know that <a href="http://imgur.com/a/noJU4">weed was very important to middle ages Siberians</a> or to wonder why the image of the double headed eagle can be found from Anatolia to india to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8yKfq">Germany</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Bcl7Q">Russia</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/jRK8j">northern Canada</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/aGRE0">central Mexico.</a> or to wonder why these churches have both a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WSDrz">cross and a crescent</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this post. You gave me a lot of material to research because I&#39;m a sucker for these kind of things.  </p>

<p>However my question remains. You can observe and question all these phenomena, but what kind of conclusion can you draw of them without scientific expertise? The stone looks like it&#39;s melted, but is it really? I&#39;m no engineer so I have no idea, and if it is, how can I tell what caused it?  </p>

<p>How can I tell why a chinese girl has blue eyes, or how an ancient Dacian artifact ended up in America. I can make a lot of assumptions but are my assumptions more valid than the work scientists did before me? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really find it strange that places in America had names before the Europeans came, but if there&#39;s anything important about that name, how can I know about it without relying on the research conducted by experts on the field?</p>

<p>No problem n that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg</p>

<p>I try to post my interpretations over at r/alternativehistory</p>

<p>The more questions we find the clearer the picture gets. It&#39;s more historiography than history Anyways a more suitable term for what I&#39;m interested in would be westory.</p>

<p>It sounds like a cop out response but the truth is the trained academics are suffering from the universal truth that it is Easier to fool some one than convince them they have been fooled so all you will get from most academics is a blank stare and accusations of being a conspiracy theorist. These peoples livelihood rests on the current narrative </p>

<p>We need to remember that our historical understanding is global and the fact that there is little to no collaboration between academia in the west and Russian, Eastern European etc academics is very scary. We won&#39;t ever get the full picture without significant collaboration.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I try not to assume to much but asking hard questions of the academics can only result in a better understanding for everyone. There are many researchers working hard on many of these questions accessing primary sources and picking apart photographic evidence. The problem is few of them speak English.
I wouldn&#39;t say disregard all establishment science but to not accept &quot;it&#39;s a mystery&quot; as an answer. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since this is just the tip of the iceberg I understand why you don&#39;t grasp the significance. And because the ideas proposed by some of the researchers I speak of its best to see the evidence
For oneself if I tried to detail the exact scope of the new chronology you wouldn&#39;t believe a word of it. Seeing is believing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this post. You gave me a lot of material to research because I&#39;m a sucker for these kind of things.  </p>

<p>However my question remains. You can observe and question all these phenomena, but what kind of conclusion can you draw of them without scientific expertise? The stone looks like it&#39;s melted, but is it really? I&#39;m no engineer so I have no idea, and if it is, how can I tell what caused it?  </p>

<p>How can I tell why a chinese girl has blue eyes, or how an ancient Dacian artifact ended up in America. I can make a lot of assumptions but are my assumptions more valid than the work scientists did before me? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really find it strange that places in America had names before the Europeans came, but if there&#39;s anything important about that name, how can I know about it without relying on the research conducted by experts on the field?</p>
