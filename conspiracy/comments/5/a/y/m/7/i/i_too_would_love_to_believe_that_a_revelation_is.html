       I've spent the past couple of days alternating between giddy excitement and thinking I must be a fool to get my hopes up again.  Imagine your most asleep and unaware neighbors suddenly learning that there are videos of Bill and Hillary raping children!  It would blow their minds so wide open that the truth about 9/11, Sandy Hook, chem-trails or any other conspiracy might at last be looked at seriously.  And from there maybe our world could change for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's what's troubling me.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Julian Assange has never spoken up about 9/11 and even says that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-kSuuJrzMo">
        truthers annoy him
       </a>
       !  That is really not helpful and makes him much less than a hero in my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <a href="http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/">
        "Breaking bombshell" from True Pundit
       </a>
       .  Here is the gist of the story:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><code>Money laundering
Child exploitation
Sex crimes with minors (children)
Perjury
Pay to play through Clinton Foundation
Obstruction of justice
Other felony crimes
</code></pre>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.
       </p>
       <p>
        “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.
       </p>
       <p>
        “People are going to prison,” he said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's a strange article in that people are identified by their titles but not their names.  Of course people need to stay safe, but there is no anonymity in a title like "NYPD Chief."  Perhaps there is more than one NYPD Chie?  If so, they had better all be under armed guard 24/7, and their families too.  Their kids should have bodyguards at school and walking to and from school.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  The NYPD should have
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       held a press conference detailing what they know and what they have, and then given bodyguards 24/7 to those who announced it.  The longer they wait, the more likely that powerful people like the Clintons will find a way to steal or suppress the most incriminating evidence.  We may see some suspicious deaths in the NYPD in coming days.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Steve Pieczenik says the Clintons attempted a coup on Tuesday 11/1.  Given that they already essentially hold power, why would a coup be necessary?  I assume they have the power to rig the election and insure her crowning as the new POTUS.  Why bother with a coup?
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  Hillary was recently reported to have
       <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2016/10/hillary-clintons-sudden-move-of-1-8-billion-to-qatar-central-bank-stuns-financial-world/">
        moved $1.8 billion in personal assets to Qatar
       </a>
       , a country with no extradition treaty.  Given what they say they have on her, why has she not left the country already?  She could live out her days in the lap of luxury in Qatar with no worries.  Instead she remains in the US facing (well deserved) humiliation and possibly the rest of her life behind bars?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'd love to believe that the system is going to come crashing down because the most powerful woman in America is suddenly seen for what she is.  But as time goes on with nothing happening, I increasingly fear that nothing will.

       Part of me thinks this is all orchestrated with the only purpose of inciting extreme civil unrest to justify a major gun grab operation. They WANT people to take to the streets so they can invoke riots and justify lethal force on American citizens to assert power and dominance.

       With regards to who the NYPD Chief making comments is, the article states:
NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carlos Gomez is the current NYPD Chief but for them not to say it's him seems strange. So either he, or one of the former chiefs who's still in touch with the Detectives could have made the statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe Esposito was the Chief for 13 years and is now NYC Commissioner for the Office of Emergency Management, so he would still have a close finger on the pulse of what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philip Banks III was under federal investigation for corruption when he suddenly retired so probably not him.

       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          'What's there is OUT of CONTEXT! They were... showing... affection to poor victims of the tsunami or whatever happened in Haiti!'

       Even graphic proof of such a crime (which I'm not saying is a minor offense but in the greater scheme of things lesser that global scheming with powers that bring about corruption and suffering to millions today and generations to come, worldwide), with its' emotional charge, would not budge the electorate today I'm afraid.  The Trump scarecrow has worked way to well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if even that won't work, it's easy to understand, if disheartening, how the damn flood of leaked proof of the Foundation and the rigging of the DNC hasn't changed the minds of the huge TV watching masses. Boring facts &amp; figures in black and white that don't pack the gut punch of some grainy video or slurred audio.

       I have multiple friends (all of us went to a fairly good university, and most of them are now in grad school, so a reasonably educated crowd) who are so indoctrinated by the MSM that when asked "OK so if that isn't enough evidence to sway your vote away from Hillary, what would it take?" And shockingly the most common response is "she would have to kill my pet/a member of my family or close friend in front of me". Yup, that's what we're dealing with. This woman literally has to commit cold blooded murder, which they observe with their own two eyes, in order to believe this woman is bad. When asked why they don't try to explain some of Hillary's merits or try to disprove the contents of the leaks, and instead just say "because I'm not racist/sexist/stupid enough to vote for Trump". The scarecrow has worked all too well.

       "They" just runs our elections like they do our drug trade. Back two cartels then have one take the fall.

       Then justify it with some shady excuse like "We're controlling the drug trade to make it less violent. This is a land of wolves."
