      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM blatantly ignoring everything newsworthy that isn't a positive spin (until the stories became too many), isn't a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her receiving debate questions in advance, isn't a conspiracy.

       The polls being oversampled garbage, isn't a conspiracy.

      <p>
       Her being tightly associated with major corporations and big banks, isn't a conspiracy.
      </p>

       All the conspiracies about her wetwork initiatives and lolitta expressways are just extra. Her actual misdeeds are so plentiful one does not need to wait for confirmation on any actual conspiracy. She is beholden to elites and she wants more war. That is what a vote for Hillary Clinton is.

       EDIT: I've been advised, many times over (!), that these are still conspiracies.  They are mostly conspiracy fact, but apparently I had an inaccurate definition of "conspiracy" (i.e. a wrong one) in my head as I was writing this.  Please accept this list as my top 20 (?) reasons why you shouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton.

       Also a conspiracy doesn't mean it's fake. I hate when people use that word to insinuate it must somehow not be real if it's a conspiracy.

       fair enough but the guy that started this off (the initial conversation in another thread) was saying there weren't facts supporting the idea that HRC is a shit candidate and that I was basing my opinion on "conspiracies".

       If you just look at the right sidebar, underneath the big picture there, you've got the definition of what a conspiracy, a theory, and a conspiracy theory are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those up top in your OP are! conspiracies. But you state they're not all throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ARE conspiracies, though they are not conspiracy theories. conspiracy facts.

       Words sure can be tough when that ingrained bias toward them just won't let go. Good post tho.

       yeah that's fair.  I've obviously conflated the notion of a conspiracy with that of a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, all of what I wrote (I would hope, as I'm not willing to review atm) are conspiracy facts.  They play into conspiracy theories but they are damning in their own right.

       no no... I understand that now (re: conspiracy vs conspiracy theories) but he was clearly saying HRC was a good voting option and the only reason I thought otherwise was because of "conspiracies" (i.e. conspiracy theories).

       yeah that's just laziness.  I would have gone into detail (money from Morocco, Saudi, etc) but I couldn't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head.  I know Morocco was 12 and Saudi Arabia was 25 (+++) but all the other sketchy money escapes me.

       One of my pet peeves is people misusing words, one of which is conspiracy. I can't tell you how many times I've been talking about stuff with friends or family and they say "bah, that's just conspiracy".....well yeah, that doesn't make it any less valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't directed at you, per se, but people need to understand what the words they say mean before they say them.
