       Blackmail on President Obama to get Lynch there, huge amounts of funding from Soros &amp; Silicon Valley, etc, apathy by the voter saying it's Business as Usual, media blackout on it.

       Give it more time and forthcoming podesta emails.  You'll see.  He did some shit too, I'm sure of it.  His dumb little blue star son-in-military pin is a covert way to convey he's American Legion, a veteran paramasonic group, to which Bill belongs as well (see bill clinton shaking hands with JFK).  Simlilarly to Bill he's also a jesuit, so at some point he's developed the martial machinations of dnc and there's likely blood on his hands as well.

       Nope, it's masonic.  These paramasonic organizations exist for a couple of reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        To extort money from good people as 'charity'.  Think "clinton foundation"
       </li>
       <li>
        To collect personal information on society, acting like a kind of intelligence network of surveillance and control
       </li>
       <li>
        To act as a soft onboarding entrance organzation to masonry
       </li>
       <li>
        To instill hierarchical, authoritarian, paternalistic, dominator, imperialist, fascist, statist, jingoisitic, nationalistic principles that make people easier to control in society;
       </li>
       <li>
        Identify which kids, young adults (demolay, rainbow girls, daughters of job, boy/girl scouts, etc) or professionals (rotary, lions, fop, american legion) are most suceptible to both flattery, elitist ideation and mind control.  And then they will try to recruit into masonry the best ones.
       </li>
       <li>
        To identify the most rapeable children and women for child and adult sex trafficking.  Yep, I went there.  Otherwise why is there a CHIP program?  Seriously.  WHY
       </li>
       <li>
        To identify the most troublesome and violent male teenagers to recruit for blackbagops and future special military or paramilitary training and for international drug trafficking
       </li>
       <li>
        Manufacture consent for various masonic clown circuses that serve only as a means for old gross men to touch children('s hearts).  I did a post earlier.  We see in their faces how much kids appreciate these old clown people.
       </li>

       It is odd that it's a bar, you can bring in small children, but god damn it you stand behind that tape while Pappy gets drunk! The line of tape makes it ok. Laws are silly sometimes.

       I don't think Donna is humiliated. She is proud of herself. She is disgusting. She posted today that she never thought she would come out of this unscathed and then reaffirmed her comittment to the party. Like a Nazi, it's disturbing. "The Party" I almost made a twitter to say "Yeah unscathed, but also unethical and notoriously corrupt and dishonest. Another villian for history. #StepDownDonna"

       by "humiliated", I'm referring to the way she is perceived by people outside of the Political Class.  Obviously, within the political class she's a self-sacrificing martyr for the New World Order.
