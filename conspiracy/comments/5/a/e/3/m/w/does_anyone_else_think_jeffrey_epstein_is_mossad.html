       So
       <a href="http://ncrenegade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hillary-in-on-Bills-pedophile-express-trips-576x1024.png">
        rumors
       </a>
       are now circulating that there will be a sordid if not downright horrific Epstein-Weiner-Clinton revelation in the coming days that will finally bring down the Clintons.   Perhaps the powers behind the scenes have decided it's time to get rid of this toxic bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apropos to that, I've been looking into this Epstein character.   His lawyer and best friend is Allan Dershowitz (Dersh, under suspicion himself, now claims they were never close, despite previous statements).
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein's black book contains the personal phone numbers of several former Israeli prime ministers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Epstein was arrested the rumor in NY was that he was going to flee to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-scandal vanity fair article expresses puzzlement over how Epstein built his fortune (the "hedge fund manager" title may be a cover).   A huge fortune it is: he lives in the most expensive apartment in NY -- eight floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       J. Epstein Company was set up via a 1 billion grant from Victoria's Secret owner Leslie Wexner, who's father Harry Wexner (changed from Hagan Wexelstein) was a secretive billionaire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein's other partner in crime was Ghislane Maxwell, the daughter of a notorious Mossad agent named Robert Maxwell.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Epstein was busted he was given the sweetheart deal of a lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hidden cameras were found throughout his Florida home.   Presumably hidden cameras were/are also present on the "lolita express" (on which Bill took two dozen flights) and "sin island."
      </p>
      <p>
       The entranceway to his NY apartment is decorated with glass eyeballs -- an inside joke about the cameras behind the walls?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems pretty cut and dried to me: Epstein was recruited by Mossad to run a honey pot operation in order to ensnare and blackmail US and international elites.    The bait was underage girls ("forbidden fruit") and possibly even children, given the frequent trips to Thailand etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton should be barred from office on the grounds that she is blackmailable by the Israelis.   We might as well be electing Netanyahu to the White House.   Perhaps this is an open secret.   Hillary's top five donors are Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly, Epstein has claimed that he "helped found" the Clinton Foundation.   Was he just bragging about his relationship with Bill?  Or could the CF itself be involved in trafficking child sex slaves?

       I think your theory about the honeypot method is pretty spot on...and it sickens me that there are people like Epstein and Saville that work overtime to make it all possible.

       You've identified the core problem: one of the mechanisms for the AngloZionist Empire's takeover of the US government. I suppose it was supported by Brookings, Chatham House and The CFR as their depopulation goals are being met by the war machine. You must understand this is one sick unholy alliance. How much more "in your face" can it be when
       <em>
        every single Congress person has taken an "oath of allegiance" from Netanyahu
       </em>
       . Look at the Neocons in the Near East Division, look at how they have us playing Russian Roulette with
       <em>
        Russia
       </em>
       ! This is like the opening scene in "Deer Hunter" and it can't end well.

       I'm just saying that it doesn't have to be Mossad either -- they are the low hanging fruit b/c of his last name.  That assumption takes the spotlight away from whichever agency is actually pushing the blackmail as everybody jumps to the first "obvious" conclusion.

       Both candidates are likely compromised.

       Hell Ny magazine reports a dinner with Epstein that was attended by Clinton aides and Trump, and they were disappointed Clinton never showed up.

       Exactly.  I was just banned from another board today for posting the same thing.

       Every single politician who spent time partying with Epstein should be removed from office.  We have to assume that each one represents a security threat.

       Probably. Another interesting angle is the "movie script" contract that pod eats received from a confirmed Mossad agent. It was a contract to have Scalia murdered

       Of course Epstein is Mossad. His madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the daughter of a Mossad Sayan and media magnate named Robert Maxwell.

       Yes, I've thought Epstein, Monica Lewinsky, the new Congressman junkets to Israel, the israelis caught with foreign passports, are all Mossad gathering blackmail evidence to control our leaders. "Through deception thou shalt do war."

       FYI, Trump is also heavily implicated. There are even court proceedings happening right now, with witnesses, claiming he raped a 13 year old, via Epstein.

       That's why Clinton hasn't used it in the campaign.
