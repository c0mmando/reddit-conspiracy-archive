        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">46</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/shogun_starship.html">shogun_starship</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So <a href="http://ncrenegade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hillary-in-on-Bills-pedophile-express-trips-576x1024.png">rumors</a> are now circulating that there will be a sordid if not downright horrific Epstein-Weiner-Clinton revelation in the coming days that will finally bring down the Clintons.   Perhaps the powers behind the scenes have decided it&#39;s time to get rid of this toxic bitch.  </p>

<p>Apropos to that, I&#39;ve been looking into this Epstein character.   His lawyer and best friend is Allan Dershowitz (Dersh, under suspicion himself, now claims they were never close, despite previous statements).   </p>

<p>Epstein&#39;s black book contains the personal phone numbers of several former Israeli prime ministers.   </p>

<p>When Epstein was arrested the rumor in NY was that he was going to flee to Israel.   </p>

<p>The pre-scandal vanity fair article expresses puzzlement over how Epstein built his fortune (the &quot;hedge fund manager&quot; title may be a cover).   A huge fortune it is: he lives in the most expensive apartment in NY -- eight floors.   </p>

<p>J. Epstein Company was set up via a 1 billion grant from Victoria&#39;s Secret owner Leslie Wexner, who&#39;s father Harry Wexner (changed from Hagan Wexelstein) was a secretive billionaire. </p>

<p>Epstein&#39;s other partner in crime was Ghislane Maxwell, the daughter of a notorious Mossad agent named Robert Maxwell.  </p>

<p>When Epstein was busted he was given the sweetheart deal of a lifetime.   </p>

<p>Hidden cameras were found throughout his Florida home.   Presumably hidden cameras were/are also present on the &quot;lolita express&quot; (on which Bill took two dozen flights) and &quot;sin island.&quot;  </p>

<p>The entranceway to his NY apartment is decorated with glass eyeballs -- an inside joke about the cameras behind the walls?  </p>

<p>This seems pretty cut and dried to me: Epstein was recruited by Mossad to run a honey pot operation in order to ensnare and blackmail US and international elites.    The bait was underage girls (&quot;forbidden fruit&quot;) and possibly even children, given the frequent trips to Thailand etc.   </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton should be barred from office on the grounds that she is blackmailable by the Israelis.   We might as well be electing Netanyahu to the White House.   Perhaps this is an open secret.   Hillary&#39;s top five donors are Zionists.   </p>

<p>Oddly, Epstein has claimed that he &quot;helped found&quot; the Clinton Foundation.   Was he just bragging about his relationship with Bill?  Or could the CF itself be involved in trafficking child sex slaves?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve identified the core problem: one of the mechanisms for the AngloZionist Empire&#39;s takeover of the US government. I suppose it was supported by Brookings, Chatham House and The CFR as their depopulation goals are being met by the war machine. You must understand this is one sick unholy alliance. How much more &quot;in your face&quot; can it be when <em>every single Congress person has taken an &quot;oath of allegiance&quot; from Netanyahu</em>. Look at the Neocons in the Near East Division, look at how they have us playing Russian Roulette with <em>Russia</em>! This is like the opening scene in &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; and it can&#39;t end well. </p>

<p>I think your theory is spot on except you left out the fact that not only the Clintons but Trump is also a good friend of his.</p>

<p>Both candidates are likely compromised.</p>

<p>Hell Ny magazine reports a dinner with Epstein that was attended by Clinton aides and Trump, and they were disappointed Clinton never showed up.</p>
