        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Before I go into the post I want to preface it by saying I reached out to several people within the community before I made this post. The reason for this is because I&#39;m a lurker, not really familiar with the &quot;culture&quot;of this sub, and want to spark a discussion/debate about recent events without appearing that I&#39;m rooting for this side, leaning this, way, etc. I want to have this discussion for creative reasons and for my personal growth. With that being said allow me to say the following about myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m apolitical and do not ascribe to the concept that the U.S. is a democracy or a republic. I believe this country is a hegemony, plutocracy, oligarchy and corporatocracy all rolled into one. So, for this reason, I do not partake in politics. In fact, I believe WWE is more realistic than politics. I don&#39;t knock anyone who partakes in it but I do have several questions that I hope some of you wouldn&#39;t mind answering. And maybe debate is a strong word? I mentioned that earlier but I don&#39;t mean debate as in people are arguing what is real or what isn&#39;t as I respect your right to your beliefs and opinions just like I hope you respect mine. So I have several questions and you can feel free to chime in:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If it all goes back to the Bilderbergers, TLC, CFR, royal bloodlines, bankers, etc and the game being rigged, then what is the purpose of voting?</p></li>
<li><p>If the global elite operate without impunity, what is the purpose of voting or asking for someone to be indicted?</p></li>
<li><p>If the FBI or any law/investigatory agencies are tools of the global elite, what is the purpose of asking them to look into this candidate or that candidate and ask for them to be indicted?</p></li>
<li><p>Has wikileaks leaked anything about Donald Trump? If so, can you link me to those leaks? If not, have they given a reason or explanation as to why they have leaked a ton of emails related to Hillary and not Trump?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In closing, those are all the questions I have for now and I believe I will have more if people respond. Again, I spoke with members of the community before I made this post (spoke with them yesterday) and I&#39;m making this post in hopes of sparking discussion and learning a bit more.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>THE_LORD_HERESY</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion what is being revealed in politics is only scratching the surface of what is happening worldwide. The elites are being exposed from the many sources not just Wikileaks. The world is responding to such corruption. Look at Brexit, and now what is being exposed in South Korea. The citizens of the United States now have the evidence needed to throttle down against the oppression from those elites (.01%). My hope (as foolish as it may be) is that the world can stand up in the face of the corrupt and return humanity to peace and cooperation for the interest of mankind.</p>

<p>The Podesta emails from Wikileaks is all about the Clinton&#39;s and has nothing to do with Trump. </p>

<p>Well, information is a powerful tool/weapon within the hands of the right person but do you think that maybe the people are so beaten up they&#39;ve lost the will to fight? There is division based on race, sexual preference, religion, socioeconomic status and whatever else we can list. How can you really expect them to fight when the division is on every level and the majority of those divided probably don&#39;t even have their basic needs met?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me that&#39;s what is so exciting. I was one of those who lost faith in our society. What is being exposed while on the surface has to do with politics Dem/Rep, race etc like you listed, at the heart of all this debate is the exposing of the oppression of everyone and that in itself is blind to all the separating factors we are discussing. That has the power to open our eyes and come together to defeat the injustices we have allowed. I also think most of the division of those issues related to race, sexual preference, religion, socioeconomic status etc. have to do with feeling oppressed. Everyone deserves to be free and have their basic needs met and I guarantee that .01% couldn&#39;t care less. </p>

<p>I would think with the frenzy of all the grave digging going on that something would have come to light by now. Some would argue that it has in the comments that Trump has said. But are words as equal to atrocities that have been committed by the Clinton&#39;s? </p>

<p>I think so. Your point is probably that it hints at WikiLeaks having an agenda, and I&#39;ve been thinking about that too. It&#39;s possible they&#39;re incriminating Clinton first and Trump later. One thing you can be sure of is that WikiLeaks <em>does</em> have an agenda, otherwise, why do what you do? The question of what Assange is actually trying to accomplish and why is one that I never see asked, interestingly enough. But if his goal is <a href="http://anitasnotebook.com/julianassange/how-did-wikileaks-start-and-what-is-the-goal-behind-their-actions/">political reform</a> then I think it&#39;s fair to say it doesn&#39;t matter so much whether Clinton or Trump gets thrown under the bus because he understands they are both not the right people for the job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For your first three questions in my opinion id say voting, politics, FBI trials that deal with real criminals, are just illusions of choice. They want us to think we have power to vote and choose our leaders, if we knew we didn&#39;t we would revolt, stir the pot. As for the FBI, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll charge Hillary. Maybe a fine because that&#39;s all high millionaires and billionaires get, besides the occasional year or two. The trials all drag out so people never even hear what the final charge is and by then the system knows not enough people will care to do anything about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 and 2 relatively have the same answer. We are given the option to vote under the guise of free will. They make it look like we are free, but we truly aren&#39;t. Remember G.B. Second term? I was rather young at the time, but I researched it years later and apparently Al Gore won the popular vote of the People, but the Electoral College votes Bush in anyway.

<p>Ok, so in your opinion it&#39;s the illusion for the &quot;useless eaters&quot; and keeping them docile. So does this have anything to do with people wanting to feel important, appreciated, etc? And when I ask that I&#39;m referring to the people who&#39;re basically being conned in your opinion. </p>

<p>If they were created by them then wouldn&#39;t that make them a pawn or tool? If the people at the top of the FBI are corrupt then does it make a difference if those at the bottom of the totem poll aren&#39;t corrupt? I mean, what exactly are they doing to stop the madness when they have jobs, families, etc like you mentioned?</p>

<p>So, as far as you can tell, their is no dirt on trump for them to leak is that what you&#39;re saying? Could it be that they&#39;re holding on to the dirt on Trump because they have an issue with Hillary?</p>

<p>Well part of this is because I want to learn more (for creative and knowledge reasons) and the other part is because things simply aren&#39;t adding up. Something isn&#39;t quite right about any of this, I can&#39;t put my finger on it, so I&#39;m taking a step back and putting my questions out there to see if others can at least make sense of it and reconcile what appears to be one big clusterfuck of a planet.</p>

<p>No but it <em>is</em> a sheep. If it believes it&#39;s anything other than a sheep then there is a problem right? As for the fence, it may try to get beyond it or it may stay within because it&#39;s comfortable. </p>

<p>So at the end of the day have blood on your hands? Yes, if you believe yourself to be a patriot, a crime fighter, someone who has taken an oath to defend the constitution, etc, then yes, you should die for it. If my father and uncles (his brothers) had to risk their lives in WWII and they had no choice in the matter, then surely these people can step up to the plate. But to me, I think the oath they took and all of that is for show. I personally think that maybe .5% of those are having second thoughts.</p>

<p>From the Koch brothers, to Sanders, to the Bush family (and their puppet Tim Osman) to Gore to any president and party, I don&#39;t believe they aren&#39;t crooked and believe they serve their own self interests. But let me ask you this. Is it really &quot;voter fraud&quot;, like people say, if the game was rigged from the start?</p>

<p>Years ago, in fact it was the election with Gore and Bush, I told my brother that he and I should actually protest the polls. My mom had a ft, said we would be causing trouble, etc. All of this happened before the election. You know what happened afterwards, we all know. And my dad? He used to say, &quot;Son it&#39;s all just for show, they know right now who will be president&quot;. So why did he do it? He told me, &quot;Just because.&quot; He didn&#39;t go into fighting for freedom or none of that shit. So at that point I said fuck it all. </p>

<p>I appreciate the service of your father and his brothers, but I personally don&#39;t believe that they were fighting for America. I don&#39;t believe that the holocaust ever really happened. I believe that Hitler was a rebel trying to bring up the revolution against the Islamic 1% that controlled the Shadow Government. We sent in troops because the hands of those Islamic 1% were dipping into our government. I believe we basically went in to help that 1%, not because Pearl Harbor (which was also a false flag op), and not because Hitler was a bad man. 
There&#39;s blood on their hands because of misinformation. 
The members of the FBI aren&#39;t misinformed, and that means that something must really terrify these people. </p>

<p>People are only starting to scream &quot;Voter fraud&quot; because they are realizing that it is rigged. If the populace was as close-minded as we were in the late 1990s we would have let Hillary win and not even thought about it. </p>

<p>You tell me dude, people believe what they want to believe. However, this election is helping to bring some credibility to alternative news &amp;amp; conspiracy &#39;theories&#39;, so who knows, gradually the majority might begin to see it. Then again a lot of people do see the writing on the wall but feel powerless to do anything about it, so they close their eyes to it again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a US citizen, so no I am not going to vote, but I don&#39;t agree with you, it&#39;s not a contradiction it&#39;s deciding to make a choice between what you believe to be the lesser of two evils. If it turns out the voting process is meaningless as suspected, no harm done. Also one might vote simply as a personal statement because they can&#39;t abhor either Trump or Hilary. Sometimes people take a stance for things even when they don&#39;t believe it will make a difference.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;You&#39;re entitled to your opinion but on more than one occasion, I said I&#39;m posting because I&#39;m trying to learn.

<p>I am a great believer in that there are no stupid questions but asking that question in a conspiracy forum was like saying I want to learn about Trigonometry, now what does 1+1=? Just sayin&#39;...</p>

<p>&amp;gt;But if they (wikileaks) have an agenda and that agenda is the destruction of her campaign and Assange having a better chance under a Trump leadership, why would they release any information?</p>

<p>Not quite sure what you are asking here...
If you are asking, if they have an agenda such as Assange becoming free from the threat of extradition why leak anything about either Hilary or Trump? Well then I would say that they would leak the info on H to hopefully get Trump in because even if they didn&#39;t leak about H she would never go easy on Assange.</p>

<p>However if you believe in Wikileaks publicised agenda, then what this is about is making the truth available to the public when they receive leaks that show that truth is not being provided to the public. The leaks in this case are revealing the underbelly of Democratic Party political machinations. </p>

<p>If however you are asking why they would leak anything about Trump if they have an agenda, then as I already said IF they had an agenda to demonise Hilary (though they can&#39;t do that unless her emails contain evidence that proves she is demonic) then they wouldn&#39;t leak Trump emails if they had them and those emails were as equally damning. They might leak them though if they had positive info about Trump. BUT this is all supposition as they would have to had someone leak those emails to them in the first place in order to be able to leak them &amp;amp; they would have to be untrue to their stated core beliefs to not leak.</p>

<p>As I also already said, it would be pretty unwise of them not to leak Trump emails if they had received them though as if the whistleblower in the Trump camp saw that WL wasn&#39;t leaking the info they supplied they would most likely go find someone else who would leak them &amp;amp; also leak the fact that WL refused to publish them which would entirely damage the credibility of WL.</p>

<p>Your opinion, I disagree. You keep treating conspiracy theories as fact or conspiracy theory believers as 100% certain in their beliefs. This is not so, they are &#39;theories&#39;, many &#39;think&#39; the elections are rigged but they are not certain they will be, many think Trump is hand-picked by TPTB but many are uncertain about this, what I said before about TPTB possibly not being infallible, yada yada yada...there is doubt, therefore there is a possibility that one&#39;s vote counts....if you want a real discussion/debate process start listening and stop just spouting back your predetermined beliefs.</p>

<p>1+1=2 is not the basis for Trigonometry either, and although I see what you&#39;re getting at 1+1=2 being the first thing you pretty much learn in Math, my point was that in this subreddit right now if you don&#39;t know how Wikileaks operates then you&#39;d be smart to read a bit more before you start to try engaging people in conversation.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m not much interested in trying to explain myself to a stranger over &amp; over so I&#39;m out. I hope you got some personal growth or something out of this. </p>
