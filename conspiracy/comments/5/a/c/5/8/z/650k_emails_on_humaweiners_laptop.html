        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is getting way past bizarre. It&#39;s probably time to coin a new phrase for the crazy web of deceit and shenanigans that&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Ok, back to the emails. Skipping all the other info that&#39;s come out since Friday I wanted to focus on the detail it&#39;s 650k emails that were found. That&#39;s a buttload and seems to be more than one person could generate. Quick math says if you did 20 emails a day everyday of the year it would take 89 years to generate 650k.</p>

<p>So how many people or sources of email was Huma hording? Sure she&#39;s cooperating with the FBI (their words) and some anaylist are saying it could be a cloud backup that she didn&#39;t know about. I think I would remember if I was backing up multiple sources from the constant configuration I would have to do as I upgrade devices.</p>

<p>If this happened in a short span of years, enough to forget you setup a cloud backup, then she would have to be pulling emails from many sources to account for the volume.</p>

<p>just my $0.02</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good thing you are not my assistant because I&#39;d kick your ass to the curb. Your source says literally nothing about an object being shipped to NY. It says they attempted to ship items to Chappaqua and Whitehaven but that did not happen. The only thing that was shipped in that article was to PRN in Denver. I have found nothing credible that substantiates the claim that a server archive was sent to NY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so &quot;reading up on the archive&quot; was just code for finding a way to discredit me? Nice, try watching the congressional hearings it&#39;s all in there, but here you go prick: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/nypost.com/2016/10/25/hillarys-33000-emails-might-not-be-missing-after-all/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/nypost.com/2016/10/25/hillarys-33000-emails-might-not-be-missing-after-all/amp/</a>
 the elusive Apple MacBook laptop was actually “shipped to the Clinton Foundation in New York City.”  P.s. I don&#39;t need sources when conversing in a theory sub, kind of goes against the whole concept. And if you want to try kicking my ass I&#39;m more than willing to accommodate that request.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understand she worked for HRC- SOS, The Foundation(s), Teneo, HRC the campaign and whatever else she&#39;s involved with. Emails add up quick when you are involved with multiple entities, many items are just cc&#39;ed and the likes. </p>

<p>I am willing to bet she as ALL the details on everything HRC has ever been involved with. It has been said that HRC does nothing for herself so she most likely had Huma doing everything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I considered that too. I guess when some more details will leak we&#39;ll know more. I just find it hard to imagine anyone dealing with that amount of email wouldn&#39;t thread.
I have 6 years of email on my machine for business. If I pick a year and hit select all I get the total of all emails in every thread(avg 1500 per year).</p>
