<p>I was just in a conversation where a person stated an opinion, one in direct conflict with my own, so I asked, why do you believe that?</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;</p>

<p>Then why do you have an opinion on a subject you don&#39;t know about?</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t watch it like you do, I don&#39;t study their movements, I&#39;m allowed to have an opinion&quot; (she is saying this like it&#39;s a negative thing I do)</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, you are allowed an opinion, but if you can&#39;t back it up with facts or even a singular source for your reasoning, then it means jack shit.</p>

<p>&quot;You look into it too much, I can have an opinion&quot;</p>

<p>I can have the opinion that the mets are doing great this year, but I know nothing about the mets or baseball, so why should anyone listen to me?</p>

<p>(she frowns, shakes head in a no gesture)</p>

<p>Whatever. (and I walked away).</p>

<p>It&#39;s conversations with people like this, that make me think &quot;Fuck it, let the country burn.&quot;  They don&#39;t deserve to live.  I am not even joking.  They are incompetent buffoons.  </p>

<p>I never rant, but when I brought up some anomalies about how Building 7 collapsed, the shields went up.  A few half-hearted responses about burning fuel tanks were given, and when I pointed out that that never brought down a steel-frame building of that design before, it was, &quot;yeah well... conspiracy theories... yawn.&quot; And that was it.  We&#39;re all friends and I&#39;m not going to bend their ear about it - believe what you want to believe - but why would you refuse to even consider evidence?

    <div class="md"><p>Depends entirely on the subject matter. You can win a debate on a painting or a song using your values and feelings just fine. But that&#39;s about it, barring some other similar examples. The problem begins when opinions borne of &#39;values and feelings&#39; aka biases, begin to inform popular opinion (seeMSM )
Then youve allowed the subjective to override objectivity. The same goes for a debate - one guy argues a point he&#39;s formulated with info derived from 1st hand sources, literature and other media he&#39;s fastidiously gathered around the topic. Other fella turns up feeling really passionate about the subject, confident in himself but doesn&#39;t actually know squat.- whose your money on? And furthermore how can you expect to ever engage in reasonable discourse in that fashion?

    <div class="md"><p>What you and the majority of the American people fail to realize, is that you&#39;ve been witnessing a manufactured false narrative your whole entire life. Everything you know is dictated and approved by the US government. What you were taught in public schools to believe, virtually all of what you know history as, all of the prevailing opinion that you have-  it&#39;s all been regulated and presented to you with the approval of the government. You heard the rumblings from &quot;fringe conspiracy theorists&quot; your whole life and wrote it all off as paranoid bullshit because that is the line fed you by the mainstream. Now with the technology available to us and the advent of the Internet, more people are realizing the propaganda they have been brainwashed with their entire lives is actually the polar opposite of the way things really are. You see &quot;reputable sites&quot; like Google and YouTube have obvious agendas and the power to convey information to the masses in a certain way, and you witness in real time the censorship and manufacturing of sentiment, and you have to think back about how much bullshit we were always told to believe without question by the media and think how different society should be. </p>

<p>We are not merely &quot;witnessing history,&quot; it&#39;s more like we are &quot;just noticing now what has been happening throughout history.&quot;</p>

Multiple &#39;polls&#39; and Huff Po op ed pieces.  Yet they were deleting news of the warrant getting issued until it was unavoidable.  Then they finally let one through, of course it was the one with the disclaimer in the headline about the Hatch Act being violated.  It&#39;s absurd how biased they are.  What&#39;s worse, I don&#39;t so much mind the bias, is the outright denial of the bias from users who never leave the front page.  Things like, &#39;Oh, all the anti-Trump stuff is getting upvoted because that&#39;s what the community is voting for!&#39;   Yeah, because literally everything else is removed for bullshit reasons.  You have 5 articles talking about the same letter to Comey about the Hatch Act &#39;violation&#39; yet delete new and pertinent information because, &#39;oh this belongs in that megathread we buried.  We won&#39;t actually put it there though and good luck trying to dig it up.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The true way to find balance isn&#39;t by reading articles on either sub and cross-referencing, the media industry is so co-opted on either end that the only way you can truly get balanced news is finding a third non politically affiliated source to compare stories with. </p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is a mainstream sub with over 3 millions subscribers.  Most everyday people who are into politics and surf Reddit are going to be liberal.  The site seems to attract a mostly younger crowd and mostly younger people tend to vote democrat.  </p>

<p>It makes sense that there&#39;s an over saturation of &quot;shills&quot; (most people aren&#39;t paid shills, they&#39;re just people who follow mainstream propaganda) and mainstream newstories.  </p>

<p>There are paid shills.  The revelation of CTR (Correct the Record) has proven that.  But I believe that groups like this exist more as herding mechanisms to direct the already loyal followers to more specialized and non-dissenting points of their already created narrative.  Even without these paid astroturfers, the majority that subscribe to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are already so loyal to the mainstream media that they don&#39;t really need any guidance to continue the push of propaganda and many of them don&#39;t see any reason to change their views.  It&#39;s comfortable to be in conformity.  </p>

<p><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is a containment sub for people that feel that the mainstream has forsaken them.  The only thing is that this is just another mainstream.  An &quot;alternate&quot; main stream. This is where people with dissenting opinion flock.  It&#39;s also just a means to get an establishment candidate elected.  It has stories about the Wikileaks (which are important) and a lot of other egregious things our government has been participating in, and that&#39;s great.  It&#39;s main function is to get a candidate elected.  Read into it, but don&#39;t trust it as gospel.  There are likely just as many misleading and slanted stories.  </p>

<p>Both campaigns put millions into their campaigns and Hillary just happened to run in a party that has a stranglehold on the mainstream media. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was there for any democrat that ran.</p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m trying to get at is that both sides will flock to one source or another.  The red and blue parties are propaganda machines and if you want to maintain balance and neutrality you have to cross reference both parties output with any unbiased sourced info you can come across.  </p>

<p>They are both mainstream so always take everything with a grain of salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, thanks for the concern! To clarify, I don&#39;t disagree with you in that both subs are mainstream and, also, I don&#39;t endorse <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>. With that, I take all content from either sub with a half pound of salt.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m aware that reddit is predominantly progressive folks but I&#39;m still very surprised to see that 100% of the posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are pro <em>Hillary</em>. I&#39;m very skeptical to believe that <em>she</em> actually has this following and I&#39;m also skeptical of the measure of the following. I understand that it&#39;s natural for reddit to have a strong lean towards the democratic candidate, but the constant and fervent posting for Hillary is questionable.</p>

It has to be perfect so it doesn&#39;t expose some other lie in her web. </p>

<p>So when this happened the CTR people work the same way. They could be told to keep shilling other issues and talking points, but they would run the risk of encountering that issue and being exposed by their sudden silence. So they are likely waiting on their marching orders.</p>

<p>In high school I joined DailyKos out of opposition to the Iraq War - but when that got too conservative for me (they couldn&#39;t handle criticism of Obama/Clinton from the left); I migrated to pre-CTR r/politics. </p>

<p>Then when CTR took over there during the tail end of the primaries I followed <a href="/u/NebraskaGunOwner">/u/NebraskaGunOwner</a> over to <a href="/r/HillaryForPrison">/r/HillaryForPrison</a>. </p>

<p>It was short hop from there to here.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is that there&#39;s a lot of people like me who were smart but whose knowledge and sources were still considered &quot;inbounds&quot;. In the age of the Internet, however, bullshit is exposed in real time. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a small window within which the tools and power of the internet still outstrip the capacities of the powers that be to control is using it. It is vital that we make the most of this time! Thanks to all of y&#39;all for keeping the lights on for the wanderers</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some copy/pasted statuses. (Note the flagrant absence of capital letters) The last one is actually the one that made me think he actually might have some kind of mental illness.</p>

<ul>
<li>yet again. more death at the hands of fascists. he was driving away from the cop... the cops life was not in danger and thus there was no need for the gun and there was no need to fire the gun. no prosecution? fuck this government. the executive branch no longer obeys the contract of the constitution. therefore, i no longer recognize the police as USA citizens or officials as long as they wear a badge. once their gun is away and their uniform is off, then i will respect them. NO LONGER WILL I RESPECT A BADGE. personality over authority is where respect shall reside. fuck the police.</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree the police need to shape the fuck up, but a wealthy white kid from the suburbs saying fuck the police just bothers me.</p>

<ul>
<li>i wonder how many people would join an environmentalist focussed malitia. malitia&#39;s are supposed to be a last (self) defense against tyranny. oil companies are attacking our water supplies. water is our life. it&#39;s the most legit reason to have a malitia i think. i&#39;d join it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again. Privaledged white dude. (not being racist against my own race it&#39;s just a fact that should be noted)</p>

<ul>
<li>i had a dream that my parents and i were in a movie theatre with a bunch of stuffy people watching a presidential update, but all that was playing on the screen was commercials. then i asked &quot;isn&#39;t there a speech from the president?&quot; and president Obama was sitting next to us and said &quot;no, this is just an update.&quot; so my phone rang and as i answered it, it turned into a landline phone that belonged to the theatre. so i went into the hallway and put in back on its charger. then i walked to the lobby entrance/exit where a popcorn vendor was chilling. president Obama walked through the entrance and gave the popcorn vendor a check for 1 million dollars and the vendor was super tearfully happy and left. then i was talking with Obama about how if i had 20 million, i&#39;d help out 19 people just like that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah that sounds like a real dream.</p>

<ul>
<li>my opinions and political positions are malleable and are ever changing. right now i identify most closely with Anonymous even though i can&#39;t even navigate a PC computer... wump wump. </li>
</ul>

<p>........</p>

<ul>
<li><p>let us all give a moment of silence for the poor souls in the secret service that are tasked with protecting such a wretched creature like Drumpf.</p></li>
<li><p>so i applied to starbucks in 5 locations. all that i&#39;ve got from them is 3 different calls asking if i want to go to college or graduate school right now. IM LOOKING FOR A JOB!!! NOT STUDENT DEBT YA GITZ!!!!
the first two i politely said nah. the third one... well if they are going to waste my time, i&#39;ll return the favor. i started talking about how the universities are run like businesses now, how the student loan debt is becoming an economic bubble that i don&#39;t want to be a part of, and how the marketing is pressuring and funneling people into a profit motive system that has taken over academic settings. 
i love how they can be so polite yet give off the sound of desperation to hang up at the same time. ahhhhh music to my ears. trolling telemarketers. 
they aren&#39;t even with starbucks. they just got my number from starbucks corporation. marketing ass wipes. gosh.</p></li>
<li><p>my okcupid profile is me wearing the most hippie outfit i could possibly wear. the only text is an essay on police brutality and how civil rights is an economics movement. </p></li>
<li><p>i was buying batteries at CVS and noticed that the duracell ones had a hard plastic lock device stopping me from sliding the pack off the metal bar shelf thing and written on it were instructions to get a employee to unlock it. i looked below it and saw the same type of batteries without the plastic lock. i picked them up and realized they were CVS brand batteries.
It struck me as a manipulative marketing ploy that is trying to take advantage of my human programming. a sociology trick to funnel me into CVS brand. i was annoyed to such an extent that i didn&#39;t even want to go through the small trouble of waving down an employee. 
i noticed that the duracell pack was thin cardboard and so i just ripped it off lightly and bought the pack at the register. no problem. 
i assume most people would just buy the CVS brand though. 
i&#39;m no sheep you marketing f***wits! get wrect ya monopolist capies. (capitalists=capies)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And I&#39;m pretty sure he comes on here so Michael if you see this post, stop this shit. You&#39;re making us sound like insane people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m done with it. This is the last day of media consumption for me and the first day of a good life, well at least I hope. It all stinks. It&#39;s all compromised. I see the manipulation everywhere. I feel it in every comment thread and every time I turn on the TV. I tried, like many others, to stop it, to do something to help people realize the control and the falsehoods, the lasting terrors and the humanity of every human face. But it&#39;s time for us to go. They are not leaving us behind. We are leaving them behind. It&#39;s our journey and it&#39;s their prison. Those who broke the chains let them go with us in truth and in love. Those who only gilded their chains, let them eat each other in madness and despair. Take care all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realised that it was only the Risen Jesus who can save us a few days ago, when I had a Marian apparition in my living room as I was watching some YouTube footage on my personal computer of Mr Donald Trump reacting to the FBI&#39;s reopening of the investigation on Mrs Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The apparition told me that only the Lord Jesus Christ is able to take care of the United States of America, as both Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton are agents of one of the fallen angels who have been trying to get a stronger foothold within the government. I was told some very important information which I am not at complete liberty to disclose because of the nature of the agents of evil involved. But I can reveal now for the first time that both Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton sometimes wear each others&#39; suits, and they have been interchanging themselves without us even knowing. As Frank the Rabbit told Donnie Darko, &quot;why are you wearing that stupid man suit?&quot;.</p>

<p>I was told that I will in the future be playing a crucial role in bringing more followers to realise that Jesus Christ is our only and rightful President.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just looking at the headlines of the articles you get the sense that you&#39;re in a spin zone with how they make judgements about the facts instead of reporting them. And then you look at the sources people are posting and theyre the EXACT ones Wikileaks shows as colluding with the campaign. </p>

<p>If I wasn&#39;t already locked in that I believe there is a lot significant to this scandal, I&#39;d feel like I was being gaslighted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m done with it. This is the last day of media consumption for me and the first day of a good life, well at least I hope. It all stinks. It&#39;s all compromised. I see the manipulation everywhere. I feel it in every comment thread and every time I turn on the TV. I tried, like many others, to stop it, to do something to help people realize the control and the falsehoods, the lasting terrors and the humanity of every human face. But it&#39;s time for us to go. They are not leaving us behind. We are leaving them behind. It&#39;s our journey and it&#39;s their prison. Those who broke the chains let them go with us in truth and in love. Those who only gilded their chains, let them eat each other in madness and despair. Take care all.</p>

<p>Clinton is doing what she has to do to win the nomination (appealing to the Republican voters, etc.). All this blatant &quot;shilling&quot; will die down by next Tuesday when Trump gets beaten by a woman.</p>
