    <div class="md"><p>I know Trump supporters are flooding this sub because they share with us a mutual hatred of Hillary Clinton, but please get your heads out of your asses.  The president does not run this country.  He&#39;s a face, a figurehead, a bone TPTB throw us to help foster the illusion that the average person has some kind of say in how our country is run at the highest level.  You don&#39;t have a say, and you never did, and even if Trump had any interest or intention on making good on his promises, if he is truly a threat to the establishment or the status quo, they would just kill him.</p>

<p>JFK, MLK, Malcom X, JFK Jr, Bobby Kennedy, all people of greater integrity and character than Trump could ever dream of and they actually stood a chance and they are dead because TPTB considered them a threat.  Snowden is in exile, Manning in a deep hole somewhere, Assange is missing.  These are the kinds of people who stand to make a real difference, and you know this because look how our government reacted to their brave and heroic actions.</p>

<p>We will welcome your anger.  We will welcome your passion for seeing HRC destroyed and brought to justice.  Hell I even admire the fervor with which Trump supporters have gone through the leaks and emails to bring light to the corruption of the DNC.  But you are living in a goddamn fantasy world if you think Trump will get away with any kind of change at all outside of what he is allowed to by his handlers.  If he doesn&#39;t play ball, they&#39;ll just take him on car ride through Dallas past the book repository and some patsy will take the fall for his death, same as always.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the only thing that might -- slim but might swing full reform via Trump / Trump&#39;s cabinet is if he had the backing of an electorate in full revolt of the current system.  Not comparing FDR to Trump, however FDR was able to push through a lot of policies that TPTB hated b/c he had a public who was ready to act if he didn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible in this day and age of full surveillance / militarized police.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a nice thought, and there is no harm in hoping.  I think TPTB were pretty set on Clinton because they knew she could be bought easily and was a willing crony.  Now that she is going down in flames, I think they will most likely try to find a way to groom Trump for that role.  Whether or not it will work, who is to say, but it would be naive to think they wouldn&#39;t try and as you said in this day and age regimes have a lot of tools for &quot;persuasion&quot; at their disposal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Times have changed -- not just metaphorically, but astrologically (eye-roll?).</p>

<p>Nothing will remain hidden since the Age of Aquarius started.  Truth <em>has</em> to come out and <em>will</em> come out -- be it Trump, Hillary, Bush or whatever.  This is the age of Technology.  The Age of Religion (just ended Pisces) and Wars (before Pisces, Aries) are over.</p>

<p>Did you notice how Technology is playing its part in unearthing <em>every</em> scam?</p>

<p>Also, TPTB are <em>very</em> smart people who will, if not already have, pivot to lure Trump in their fold.  And that&#39;s where we have to watch what price he extracts -- Mount Rushmore?, sure!  On the $100 bill?, absolutely!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Aquarian Age will be dominated by networks, and information.  This is the age of information. Nothing is secret anymore. All information is available at your fingertips. </p>

<p>Where the Piscean age was organized in a vertical, up and down structure of hierarchies, the Aquarian Age is organized in a horizontal network, opening the world up to true equality.  The Piscean Age has been dominated by hierarchy, and power.  From around 2000 B.C. to 0 A.D. we were in the Age of Taurus. From 0 A.D. to the present we have been in the Age of Pisces, hence the &#39;fish&#39; as a symbol of christianity/on Pope&#39;s hat.  For the next 2000 years we will be in the Aquarian Age. We have been in the transition from the Piscean Age to the Aquarian Age for the last 50 years. The official beginning of the Aquarian Age was November 11, 2011 or 11/11/11. Some people thought it was December 21, 2012. Considering that this is a 2000 year cycle, no matter which date you accept, we are in for lots of change in the near future!</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking to a brick wall.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes their chosen candidate will do anything for the people is already in fantasy land. Not only that, they aren&#39;t willing to change their perspective at all. They won&#39;t budge. It doesn&#39;t matter which candidate they back. Any real challenge is immediately rebutted with a shill accusation these days. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad state of affairs. People each election cycle are pushed into this subreddit due to a perceived conspiracy against their chosen candidate yet they leave months later without learning anything.</p>

<p>The cycle continues while the people surround themselves with a safer world view. It&#39;s more comforting to believe that their protagonist was swindled out of a win than realize that it didn&#39;t matter anyway. </p>

<p>You either kneel to the masters or you find yourself politically castrated. Real change doesn&#39;t happen through elected officials. See Obama. His greatest feat was creating a healthcare monopoly while selling it to the people as the best thing since sliced bread. What did he do with his EIGHT years in office? What were his executive orders? He definitely made sure that the Continuity of Government plan and state of emergency continued.</p>
