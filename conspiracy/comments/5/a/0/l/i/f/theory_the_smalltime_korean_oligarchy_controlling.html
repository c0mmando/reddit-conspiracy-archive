       Remember Koreagate, back in the 70's when Korea tried to pull an Israel and buy off congress? Sun Myung Moon, who has been linked to the scandal (and Korean intelligence) was tried for tax evasion several years later. President Park Chunghee (Guenhye's father) was also assassinated within a few years (he was also trying to get nukes and make deals with the North behind the backs of the West, but they knew and that is a different story).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that Washington Times article about the call-boy rings taking tours of the Reagan-Bush white house? The same Washington Times owned by Moon and his unification church? Did you know that former CIA station chief of Korea, Donald Gregg  was the one fingered by former CIA asset and pimp Craig Spence as the one who organized said call-boy tours?  And all of this came out just as Gregg was nominated by Bush to be Ambassador to Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several years after that both of the Korean presidents who ran Korea during the 80's had their bribery and extortion schemes exposed, and both were sent to jail.  And of course Spence was suicided (but that is yet another story).
      </p>
      <p>
       In summation, we are seeing now is nothing new for the Vassal state (Brzezinski's term for the nations under the security and economic umbrella of the United States) of South Korea. All we can do when one of these events occurs is to ask the age-old question, "who benefits?" We know Guenhye was getting way too close to China, so there is a possible lead there. But, like the case of her father, it could have been a myriad of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       She should at least be glad that she got Nixoned as opposed to her father who got Kennedy'ed. Whatever the case, her days are numbered. Look for a Western-friendly globalist along the lines of Ban Ki-moon to take the reins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Spence suicided, not Gregg

       Wow, I was just about to ask if this could have had any MK Ultra connections, as I assumed the age of those controlling Park would be around the same age of programees. And connecting it to the Gregg, who was one of the show runners for the MK-tied call boys is close enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       This honestly seems like evidence of an MK plant in a foreign government. Obviously there is more to be found, but it can't be coincidence that at least two of us immediately went to this idea.

       Gregg said in an interview somewhere that he met Guenhye in 2002 when they had the world cup in 2002 if I rememember correctly. The interviewer had the balls to press him on the conspiracy theory of the U.S. killing her father and his response was that it was "bullshit" (the very same remark he made when pressed years before about running the call-boy rings, for what its worth)

       Dick Russell asked Richard Case Nagell whether the pseudonym A. Hidell was related to the Korean CIA, "HID" ... Nagell refused to answer.  More details to that exchange also.

       Lots of advanced references there for legit conspiracy theorists only.  If there are any on this subreddit.
