    <div class="md"><p>Not only were the emails backed up by the NYPD before handing them over to the FBI they were probably given to Wikileaks...You don&#39;t think NYPD isnt sick and tired of what our politicians are doing? plus its payback for 9/11. a lot of brave police officers lost there life that day and everyone knows the official story is bullshit. this is all out war against the system man and everyone is getting involved because the tide is turning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking there is something to a possible Triangular aspect to all this. How&#39;s this Scenario sound:  Everyone knows that. Huma and HRC are thick as thieves. Maybe so thick that Hillary gave her her email password/access to her emails. And maybe there are indeed ones in the cache that are Incriminating and/or Top Secret Level type stuff which, correct me if I am wrong, Huma would NOT be allowed to see. 
       Enter the Weiner.  He gets access to said email cache and sees himself a nice Bargaining Chip for his fucked up sexting  issues. 
        Hopefully you get my Drift. Sheer Speculation on my part at this point but, hey,  it ain&#39;t Flat Earth horseshit. It&#39;s just.......House of Cards type stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be great if he did this and then sits and tells the investigators everything he knows, thinking he will get a pleasure bargain. He names everybody. Every night we see another high power person being rolled into prison for corruption. Then at the end, the FBI goes, &quot; fuck you weiner, we don&#39;t negotiate with pedophiles.&quot; And then chucks him in the cell next to old slick willy himself. </p>

<p>Edit: wrote &quot;plea&quot; bargain, but pleasure stays.</p>
