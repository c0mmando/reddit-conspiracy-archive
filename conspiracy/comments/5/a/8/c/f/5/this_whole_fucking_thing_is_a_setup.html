        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are living in a perfectly crafted reality show.</p>

<p>The shadow corporations have been gathering our information for decades.  They&#39;ve been learning about their subjects, us.  They know every single thing, about every single one of us.  </p>

<p>The US Gov (see world gov) has a J Edgar Hoover style dirt file on every single human being who uses the WORLD WIDE WEB.  Including prominent politicians, members of the media, and world leaders, allowing them to blackmail whoever they want to affect change in the world.</p>

<p>Alex Jones, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, &quot;insiders,&quot; are fucking plants.  They are government plants to &quot;affect change&quot; in the masses who feel cheated by the system. </p>

<p>They are playing us against each other, thinking we have heroes to look up to that will combat the corrupt for the people.  Like every movie we&#39;ve been shown lately; we&#39;re being setup to believe in justice.  </p>

<p>Trump is one of them telling us he&#39;s one of us, I say bullshit. I say he really is a plant meant to distract and hope to get Hillary elected, or on the off chance he did get elected he&#39;s already with them.</p>

<p>They forced everyone who cares about justice and truth into one corner of the internet, The Donald, a reality TV star.  Reddit is owned by one of them.  They are suppressing us across the internet except for this one tiny little place, where they can monitor us all at once.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t get all of my thoughts out, let alone make these make sense.  The dramatic threat of showdown of war, treason and possibly pedophilea in the highest offices of the US government, House of Cards being one of the biggest shows in moddern times.  This is the equivalent of a modern day coluseum level of distraction.  We&#39;re all getting played, you mark my words.</p>

<p>Edit: Movies and video games have been nothing but remakes lately, and products have been made cheap as shit but sold for a ton.  The highest proportion of expendable cash is young people who demand cash from their parents for bullshit products, reducing the wealth of the nation while consolidating money in the banks of those at the top.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a meteor or something coming and their building underground bunkers across the world for the wealthy.  2012, the meteor movies, Independence Day, we&#39;re being setup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people really want to believe in Trump, like they did with Obama. But to think he will change things, let&#39;s be clear. He is a businessman, a millionaire, who has very little in common with you or me, and he doesn&#39;t care about us. Think about the &#39;grab her by the p***y&#39; thing. The thing about it is not that he is sexist, but that it&#39;s the way he sees normal people. He talks about how he can treat them and get away with it because he is not like them. He is not one of us, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about obama care, or living paycheck to paycheck, or the quality of his housing, or the wellbeing of his kids. Student debt you think he cares? You think he&#39;s worried about his kids&#39; education? Tuition fees matter to him? His life is a million miles away from that of ours. He has way more in common with Clinton than he will ever have with you and me. Please get the picture here... His interests are totally different from ours. For that reason alone he is incompatible with our needs. He cares about lowering taxes, about cheap labor and cheap real estate, about his pr, about being in good standing with the people in the world that really matter... And you think he won&#39;t be holding hands with the elite? He already is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about Snowden et all. I don&#39;t believe the conspiracy runs quite that deep, I do believe there are people out there trying to make a difference.</p>

<p>What does this even mean?  </p>

<p>Do you mean that 1 guy, and 1 guy only, is capable of providing accurate judgement?  The perfect Hero in a Hero Narrative?  </p>

<p>I would think that this 1 guy deal has scaling issues.  Rather, the ideas would be the &quot;scaling agents&quot;, not this Jesus guy.  Ideas are what changes human behaviour, anyway.  So if the ideas are the things that matter, then the whole 1 guy requirement goes away.  So maybe we&#39;re dealing with this whole &quot;Christ Consciousness&quot; thing rather than 1 guy, Mr. Jesus, come to remove evil while we sit on our asses getting baked sharing cat memes.   Seems a bit absurd, ya?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gray State film/murder was disinfo, almost sure of it. </p>

<p>Names of the 3 principal talents involved with &quot;Gray State&quot; were:</p>

<p>David CROWLEY - Director &amp; Writer</p>

<p>Mitch HEIL - Director of Photography</p>

<p>Danny MASON - Lead Actor</p>

<p>Is that not a triumvirate of suspicious monickers? Almost like a joke, in fact? I googled &quot;Gray State&quot; and &quot;Psy-Op&quot; and found this: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html">http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html</a></p>

<p>Writer makes some good points. 1st time I watched the trailer, frankly, I didn&#39;t even watch it to the end. It was so dark, oppressive and needlessly violent. Didn&#39;t sit right with me -- without hope, nobody&#39;s going to pay to see this movie, &amp; it sure as hell looked expensive.</p>

<p>That said, I believe Snowden to be some kind of Limited Hangout. Assange, I&#39;m not so sure--the movie about him was not flattering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Votes say otherwise. As I was writing it I knew it wouldn&#39;t get anywhere.  There is plenty of evidence if you allow yourself to be open to outrageous claims, if there is proof.  The old adage &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot; is 100% true if you study history.</p>

<p>dude most people here are open to outrageous claims. it&#39;s not like you&#39;re in front of the wrong audience. the aspect you&#39;re missing is critical thinking.  Or maybe it&#39;s not missing completely, but you don&#39;t have any of it posted here.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s consider &quot;C&quot; an outrageous claim in these examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ex1: A -&gt; B -&gt; C</p>

<p>Ex2:A -&gt; B2 -&gt; C</p>

<p>Ex3: A -&gt; ?? -&gt;C </p>

<p>Ex4: ?? -&gt; ?? -&gt; C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which one do you think this post is?</p>
