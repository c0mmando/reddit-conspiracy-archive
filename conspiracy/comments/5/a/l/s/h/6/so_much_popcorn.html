<p>here&#39;s what i predict: no matter who wins this debacle there will be major chaos. whether it&#39;s <em>because</em> of WHO wins or because of info that comes out after (IF) the FBI decides to reveal the everything.</p>

<p>i&#39;m hoping the global pedophile ring gets busted along with &quot;the money chain&quot; that governments are plugged into. financial collapse is a given, imo, it&#39;s just gonna happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far, one of my favorites is watching the CNN analysts cringe and try to cover everything about the email investigation (which they report on in a 30 minute cycle). One lady who was on this morning looked like she was near tears.  At another point on the Clinton Network this morning, the panelists were rabidly speaking over each other to the point where it would have been considered poor content (even for CNN). Carville&#39;s Godzilla screech on MSNBS was pretty good, too.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t all been good, though... CNN is trying to show support for the Clinton Foundation by running the Russia ties headline about Trump, but half the time they do that, they call in their legal correspondent, and he debunks it.</p>

<p>I have to admit, though, that I was expecting another piece to drop today (besides wikileaks). It doesn&#39;t matter, though, because if the networks keep pounding this story as they have since Friday, Clinton will be lucky to break 220 electoral votes. The narrative after the fact will be that the email scandal &quot;suppressed Clinton voter turnout.&quot; All that being said, It&#39;s possible that nothing else drops from the FBI until after the election... we will still have wikileaks and the MSM to entertain us.</p>

<p>You think the NSA hit Abedin in the Weiner to set up the CF for the FBI??? 600k emails run through Palantir???  It could be going down for rilz... if this thing is Global, why not take out Merkel, too??? This is the most interesting stuff I have seen in a while. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read this too: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ad6dw/fbi_anon_got_a_lot_right_keep_the_focus_on/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ad6dw/fbi_anon_got_a_lot_right_keep_the_focus_on/</a></p>

<p>This was 4 months ago, back in July. A guy came out saying he was part of the FBI. People were saying, on here, that the former link I sent you was FBI anon, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>Regardless, a lot of what FBI anon said came true. I have no idea if it was a setup. The news is saying it was the NYPD (because they were investigating the Weiner case), but it&#39;s all within the spectrum. I really have no idea why NSA would do it, unless she was a threat to them. It&#39;s slightly scary, because it seems like NSA is being the good guy, when they really are wielding an incredible amount of power (all to catch terrorists, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve even caught one AFAIK).</p>

<p>This thing is global, in that it seems to be linking with the South Korean president with her 8 billionaire oligarchs. Merkel may be a part of a shadow government, maybe not. Something is clearly guiding her to allow all these immigrants though, and it&#39;s batshit insane, because you&#39;re seeing a huge rise in nationalism in countries like Poland (also, a couple documentaries on Brexit reveal how inefficient the EU is).</p>

<p>Obama, and the others are backing away from Clinton through Twitter, as well as all his compadre&#39;s (Michelle, VP, Kerry, etc...). From that guys video posting today (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM</a>), it is adding up that the FBI may be avoiding the whole bombshell thing, and creating an airstrike in its place. They don&#39;t want to shake the system, from what it looks like, and that means not trying to impeach a president again (like with Billy boy). Usually these conspiracy deals are so entangled, that they never get fully solved. You just have a surgeon with a razors edge remove what they feel like.</p>

<p>What the FBI guy was saying (and hackers may have this info too, and can drop bombshells) is that some of the information in them could create instability on a national, as well as an international scale. There&#39;s multiple organizations at work here: FBI, NSA, WikiLeaks, and who knows whom else.</p>

<p>Every layer of the onion is a new level: Hillary Clinton---&gt;Clinton Family---&gt;Clinton Foundation---&gt;Democratic Party---&gt;Both Parties---&gt;Washington DC---&gt;Shadow Government&#39;s. Like I said, there will most likely be a compromise in there somewhere. Nobody that wants to rule wants that level of instability. So we&#39;re talking about a lunatic, someone with the very best intentions (and hopefully a lot of money), or a hacker. Reddit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is only the surface level of this stuff anyways. As mentioned in that thread you read, there&#39;s other sources at communication out there that at least give you a shovel. Start with Tor Browser, as far as I know.</p>

<p>The US government had a hard enough time taking out mobsters, and this is a whole new level of international/interglobal crime fighting. It gets to a point of backing an animal into a corner. If Clinton Foundations 1 billion dollars floating to a Qatar bank sends the family that way, just imagine what insane bullshit they may incite there, especially if we try and catch them? Rearm Isis, like a bad straight to VHS? You can apply that to every one of these overlords, and achieve radically different, batshit high results.</p>

<p>All this for money and power... I&#39;m gonna pull a Karl and wonder why we can&#39;t all just be happy with our 1 and a half acres farming with Washington.</p>

<p>Edit: I feel like my post is slightly negative on taking everything out. There&#39;s a lot coming out right now. It&#39;s like a snack bag with Bugle&#39;s, Doritos, Peanuts, Chex, etcetera. You may pick and choose a favorite, and leave the rest of the bag out to get stale, hoping someone else fishes for the crappy choices. There&#39;s pedophilia rings, ISIS funding, the big shots (Rockefeller/Soros), Presidential candidates, current Presidents, and all sorts of other figures and motivations. Taking one out potentially has a domino effect in terms of blackmailing/power/money. Taking out the big leagues would just be like volcanoes setting off other volcanoes, in the same way of catching: drug users---&gt;drug dealers---&gt;distributors---&gt;makers---&gt;mini-bosses---&gt;Bosses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the suggestions! got the start you mentioned...</p>

<p>I think you are on the money that the biggest wildcard will be the breadth of the official admissions to the public. Russia has proven its willingness to uphold a big lie or three... In my mind, the best aspect of the situation is that the information exists in multiple places, and that they threaten to drop it if they aren&#39;t pleased with the outcome. At this point, I imagine that Hillary goes down - she will at the very least get hit for obstruction... In that (weak ass) outcome, <em>somebody</em> is going to drop something big...</p>

<p>I have wondered if the FBI tweet of the Mark Rich Pardon was to support the case that we read about in the newer chan thread... Perhaps somebody (on a hunch) ran the old case through the program, and it laid a groundwork for how to study the CF. Then they started building up a legal case through field work, with the head start of knowing where to look. That&#39;s what leads to 2nd mutiny and letter to congress. The case was already made, and then the Laptop and 600k emails damn an additional thousand people or so. As I type this out, I think that here (and also in Korea) the foundation, leaders, and membership will be crucified (politically), and the influence peddlers will remain censured and watched, but unharmed (but they own the MSM?). All of this before the bottom drops out on (what&#39;s left of) the economy...  Strange days...</p>

I think if Killary runs, Killary will win through vote rigging.  Best not to have her run at all.  Even better have her watch the election returns from her cell in SuperMax prison.</p>

<p>What would be on your &#39;highlight reel&#39; for this bucket of crap?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely some of the Donna Brazile lying, her &quot;persecution&quot; comments and trying to make herself a victimized female or christian.  She is straight-up blatantly corrupt.  Similarly, I would include some Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  Some of Clinton&#39;s speech at AIPAC is also vomit-worthy.</p>

<p>My prediction is that Clinton will still win barring some huge revelation.  It won&#39;t be met well.  Might be tough to throw a gala afterward, similar to how Bill was embraced in the 1990&#39;s.</p>
