    <div class="md"><p>Let me put it this way: there&#39;s a bridge that leads to oblivion.  The world is x way there... This election represents another step towards it.  One of only two candidates are going to win.  One candidate is an aggressive step into the void.  The other is a slight step back or at least a bit of a pause.</p>

<p>If you think the election doesn&#39;t matter because elections are all a sham and a lightshow, that&#39;s your prerogative.  The reality though, is that in a world where a day or an hour can make a difference, this election matters a whole hell of a lot.  It probably won&#39;t change the end result, but there&#39;s at least hope that it can affect the change that changes the end result.  </p>

<p>Let me put it this way:  as far as I&#39;m concerned a Trump presidency much shorter trip to the void you&#39;re referring too- and that many of the people supporting him are doing so because they just want to see the world burn and the system collapse on itself (think russia at the fall of the soviet union).  </p>

<p>But I spend a hell of a lot more time criticizing clinton, because I don&#39;t think Trump ever had a chance anyway, and is likely just a plant because he&#39;s the only way to drive out the deplorables and set up Clinton for a close win while rallying her critics as supporters.</p>

<p>The only thing Hillary has going for her is a blatantly rigged election and a totally corrupted media and government power structure.  She will lose this election and they will crown her anyways.</p>

<p>And if Trump was a plant, he wouldn&#39;t be promoting the Bill Clinton rape allegations and he wouldn&#39;t be making such a big show of her corruption scandals.  That plant narrative is the most nonsensical idea I&#39;ve heard on this election.</p>

<p>And if you think the no-fly zone creating war monger isn&#39;t going to launch you quickly into the void, you are not paying attention.</p>

<p>They&#39;re both pushing for Israel&#39;s neocon proxy war against Shiite countries in the middle east.  That&#39;s the path to persia and it&#39;s run by the same oligarchs pushing the same anti-Iran talking points through Trump and Hillary.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s void is quicker towards austerity- because his economic plan is reagan era starve the beast in a post recession global economy.  At least with Clinton we&#39;ll have a few more years until the real police state (don&#39;t take this as an endorsement- only a policy comparison).</p>

<p>I doubt I&#39;d be surprised at anything.  If I were placing live odds on Trump being a plant, they would be well below 1:1...</p>

<p>Trumps&#39; economic plan is a problem only because he wants to cut taxes on the rich.  That is some grade a bullshit and, in a just system, would never fly.  His tax plan otherwise is very sound.  Clinton on the other hand wants to raise taxes on everyone, while increasing spending for the most heavily funded programs.  Her tax plan is only &quot;a few more years&quot; for the middle and upper...the bottom is literally falling out of this country and it will hit much sooner than years...</p>

<p>The Middle East has too much blackout and misinformation for me to make a valid assumption on what the plan is.  Sometimes it seems like <a href="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7E_zRvpnMWKHK-3CC1VCLKgkW-0RkBb7Q2aUFhBjuSTL76Zyb8_qhcA">they just do things</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not just talking about taxes.  he&#39;s trying to appease middle america by claiming he&#39;s going to bring back the manufacturing jobs that have been systematically outsourced in a global economy.  It doesn&#39;t actually make any sense, but it sounds good to the under-educated and under-served people who have been negatively affected by america&#39;s shift to a service economy.</p>

<p>there are ebbs and flows.  we&#39;ll see another bubble burst soon (probably education so they can get moving on their charter school plan and privatize investment there), but it&#39;s two steps forward and one back in their fabian plan towards global public/ private socialism.  We&#39;re not just going to dive right into the global meltdown Alex Jones has been predicting for the 20 years I&#39;ve been listening to him.</p>

<p>and yes the upper middle class is feeling the shift and to be in the blue collar middle class, you&#39;d better be in a union or run your own business.</p>

<p>what type of infrastructure are you suggesting- and who are you suggesting should &quot;spend&quot; on it?</p>

<p>i think hillary is advocating investing in &quot;high tech manufacturing&quot;- but that&#39;s automated and while it might help the economy- isn&#39;t a huge job replacement for the 7 million labor intensive manufacturing jobs we&#39;ve lost since 1980.  skilled workers means engineers and people writing code- if you can do that, you can already find a job in professional services.</p>

<p>And no, you&#39;re not going to convince enough people to vote third party. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s considered throwing away a vote, they barely get any votes at all.</p>

<p>Lets put it this way, if Hillary becomes prez, she&#39;s going to start a war with Russia. Despite how much a country may want to avoid war, there&#39;s only so far you can go before a country will fight back. If Hillary is pres, there&#39;s going to be a war if she wants a war. Russia is one of the few other countries on the planet that can take on the US and win by its self. Provoking them is, ironically, like stabbing a grizzly bear and expecting not to be eaten alive. It&#39;s suicidal for our country.</p>

Her actions that have lead to the current reality in middle east and Europe are as damning as any assertion that she will start the next great war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t try to rephrase my statements.  I meant what I wrote, as it was written.</p>

<p>Let me restate this for you: As it pertains to the individual who will be elected on November 8th 2016 to sit in the White House (and travel abroad) as the President of the United States, there are only two options: Democrat, Hillary Clinton and Republican, Donald Trump.  There will be no other outcome than for one of those two individuals to win the White House.</p>

<p>If you deny this, you willfully deny reality.</p>

<p>If you choose to vote for a third party candidate and are content with your belief that Hillary Clinton is a better potential President than Donald Trump, then you have every right to vote for your candidate of choice.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you view Donald Trump as a dangerous option for President, then a vote for a third party will help to achieve the goal of ensuring he is not the 45th President of the United States.</p>

<p>If, however, you view Hillary Clinton as a threat to national and global security (as many people do) then I believe you should understand that voting for a third party puts you at risk of experiencing her Presidency as a reality.</p>

Russia is also essentially defending itself from American since they&#39;re defending their base in Syria that Assad allows them to have. War with Syria means war with Russia.</p>

<p>Plus, we know that Obama is super mad at Russia after Iran and Russia played him (Iran gave all the money from the Iran nuclear deal to Russia; in exchange, we can expect Russia to help Iran develop nukes).</p>

But a persistent and peaceful, overwhelming presence would do it.  Don&#39;t just loiter around outside for weeks, like most of these impotent modern protests.  Stand on their desks.  Sit in their doorways.  Shut down their operations.  Demand their removal.  Don&#39;t attack, but be attacked, and hope that when it&#39;s witnessed, others at home will join up.
We&#39;re too sedated (including myself).  We need a trigger that can wake up millions of people who won&#39;t just stay at home and be fearful anymore.  Our country is murdering millions of humans around the world, and we should be enraged, but since it doesn&#39;t affect us (too much) here at home, we&#39;re passive and compliant.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>47 states in total, if a party gets 10% of the vote then they get federal assistance in the next campaign i believe too, unfortunately they poll around 2.5% but maybe a bit higher since the Bernie fallout. Careful when throwing around the &#39;if you dont vote for one its a vote for another&#39; it stops people voting with how they feel and they start to vote out of fear then the systems grip tightens and we are put further behind. but thanks brother remember you can never vote against someone, only for someone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all the suit was originally thrown out. In the second suit, the accuser is suddenly a &#39;Jane Doe&#39;, so how could Snopes assume that the two suits are related when the first one didn&#39;t anonymize the accuser while the second one did? </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/">&quot;Jane Doe filed a similar suit in California in April, under the name Katie Johnson, also accusing Trump and Epstein of rape. That suit was dismissed on the grounds of improper paperwork — <strong>the address affiliated with her name was found to be abandoned</strong>.&quot;</a></p>

For decades they have been known to intimidate voters from voting, implementing ridiculous laws and providing scarce resources for voting booths and locations in order to have as few people as possible voting in elections. Why? Because low voter turnout helps them. This whole election is a sham. We have a man going to trial for defrauding innocent civilians by creating a fake school to vacuum money from people, and also heading to trial FOR CHILD RAPE, while on the other side we have one of the most corrupt politicians in our history (that we know of). We lose no matter what</p>
