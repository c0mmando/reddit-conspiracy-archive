       , then Citigroup executive, sends John Podesta a list of cabinet members. The email is dated Oct. 6, 2008 and bears the subject line “Lists.” It went to Podesta a month before he was named chairman of President-Elect Obama’s transition team.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Froman’s list proved remarkably prescient. As it proposed, Robert Gates, a Bush holdover, became secretary of Defense; Eric Holder became attorney general; Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security; Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff; Susan Rice, United Nations ambassador; Arne Duncan, secretary of Education; Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services; Peter Orszag, head of the Office of Management and Budget; Eric Shinseki, secretary of Veterans Affairs; and Melody Barnes, chief of the Domestic Policy Council.

       Froman wasn't Citi as much as he was Democratic. He worked in the Clinton WH, and went to a Cush job when Bush won. Then he volunteered for Obama and worked on his transition team.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't that Citibank sat down and compiled the Cabinet that should be the focal point, that simply isn't true. What should be the point is the obvious racism inherent in a "diversity list," and the obvious problem of a shareholders paying an executive to spend his time on politics instead of corporate results, imo.

       I don't see how you can label that statement untrue, if anything the revolving door demonstrates just how tight the ties are between the WH and Citi. Bottom line, Froman while working outside the government, under the employ of Citi, influenced the presidents cabinet selection... I think that's pretty big.
      </p>
      <p>
       The diversity list raises questions too, but can't we focus on both?

       The headline says "Citibank chose Obama's 2008 Cabinet."  I take issue with that. I think its too simplistic and feeds this idea that a few white dudes make all the decisions for the rest of the world when it is infinitely more nuanced than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citibank didn't do this, a guy who was hanging out at Citibank until a Democratic President was elected and he was called home (see his job title now?) was solicited to, and did provide a list of potential nominees to fill Cabinet and senior level policy positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the troubling thing for me is that he used race as the first point of consideration on that list.  Now, maybe the Administration had someone evaluating white dudes and kept a separate list, but I think the prejudice was to find someone who had alot of melatonin and could do the job instead of the best person to do the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it isn't helpful to me to see this in terms of Democrats and Republicans.  People of both political inclinations play this kind of revolving-door game, leaving "public service" for the private sector and lobbying jobs when their time is up.  Part of me says "it profits a country to profit an individual" but the history suggests that this is just so much grift and makes me question how long we've been leaving under a failed Republic?
