       Suppressed technology, medicine, banking, govt, education, etc. Everything is sure to be exposed and the Genie is not going back in the bottle. The tentacles of the beast permeates everything. At first I was excited, now I feel sad for the sleeping majority, many of who will be totally freaking out.

       I really thought it wouldn't be as bad for the general populace and their consciousness as many people have suggested, but just seeing the levels of despair and denial on Facebook from all the Clinton acolytes, I'm guessing i was wrong.

       Or a rise in hate crimes against white males... or a growing sense of disenfranchisement from minorities (well founded or not). I have thought that the Trump presidency was a possibility (regardless of how slim the odds seem) because of how many people would be absolutely offended by it. It might be interesting to tune in to Alex Jones to hear when he finally claims he was sold out by Trump.

       Regardless of what happens, the awakening is happening, and that's a Genie that's not going back in the bottle. Of course we don't have the luxury of watching the internal war within govt, though it appears that that's the catalyst of this grand unravelling. The script is out the window and the people won't tolerate another Obama false hope caper.

       Keep the people hypnotized, fed, clothed and content and they will tolerate a lot. Don't think most of America is suddenly going to jump on a moral and ethics bandwagon without a major catastrophe that takes away their state of hypnotism, and general lifestyle. So far it's just a big drama with larger than life talking heads and unreal characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the bunker building ammo collecting patriots are pissed at the moral and ethical situation, but waking up involves action...and I've noticed this is one lazy assed spoiled country (for the most part). I don't like it as much as you, but what can you do until the shoe drops?

       Nuthin but wait and postulate. I like my beer cold and fresh and my interwebs speedy, and the climate control in my casa well regulated. kinda hard to complain, since I have lived in countries (and areas of this country) where these things are not easy to come by.

       I was gonna type something similar then I read this- you're spot on.
A lot of people need to get a lot angrier before we see any discernible shift in gears.
What would it take I wonder? A singular event of note or a culmination towards civil breakdown... one scandal at a time..?

       I'm not endorsing Huffpo...just convenient example of what I'm trying to convey. The propaganda war battlefield has moved and you are looking at it right now. The "War on X" straight to your eyeballs. Any closer and it'd be directly in your brain.

       IDK, they are always rioting.
They aren't "jungle asians" so who the hell knows (lookin at you Phillipines). I'm not there, but the interwebs seem kinda silent on all the outrage that is supposedly happening. Got some links to some vids of some quality current rioting/unrest? I can't seem to find any.

       Rallies aint flipping police cars over and setting fire to stuff. I mean that's a total Korean berserker move and they ain't pulling it...yet anyway. Does this effect the warranty on my Hyundai and if my Samsung washer or LG mini split AC go on the blink, will I be able to still get parts? Remember when we were all turning Japanese?

       ... They aren't really tearing stuff up, but like in the USA there is a regime change coming... both are actually drawing more from legal battles than angry populace. I feel like people are going to like the new masters even less, but time will tell on this one.

       That's just a bunch of people milling about. South Korea is almost as fat dumb and happy as we are right now. Meet the new boss same as the old boss, and you keep thinking we wont get fooled again.

       I'm thinking all the leaks and corruption becoming so obvious is a plan to get us to revolt so they can crack down hard. Right before the war with Russia leads to a "better" government, a world government. That's just my guess though. I don't think the people who engineered our entire modern world in their favor would let things get this bad without a plan.

       I can believe that. I imagine they have failsafes built into contingencies for every possible variation of events - and that's just for Plan A.
Plan B? Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet. 
Don't even ask about Plan B. Because you don't really want to know.

       I'm worried about a "stupid" revolution, headed by ill-informed morons that end up trashing the old, but failing to install a decent "new".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people dont realize the extent that the global capitalism/market system is corrupting everything; corruption literally built into the system from the ground up. Exploitation as a mode of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear that the revolutionary forces of the world will just install a hyper dictatorship (left or right oriented, whichever it be) or just throw a few guys in jail, remove certain market-based laws and then claim "we made the free market more free, that'll end the corruption". Then 20 years later were in the exact same situation, with different players at the table.

       Exactly. When you hear about Mark Zuckerberg being a billionaire, you should know he made that fortune by clueless people creating content that then becomes the property of Facebook (it's all in their Terms of Service, guys).
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing happens with Youtube: you create your shitty video of a kitty playing in the sand, it gets 20 billions views, Google attaches just a couple of ads to it and there's your fortune – made off of someone else's content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most recent Youtube Heroes development is simply the next step, as there's a massive pool of wannabe hipsters who'll actually do paid work
       <em>
        for free
       </em>
       only to get a badge and some internet points.
