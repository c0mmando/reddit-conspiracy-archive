I have thought that the Trump presidency was a possibility (regardless of how slim the odds seem) because of how many people would be absolutely offended by it. It might be interesting to tune in to Alex Jones to hear when he finally claims he was sold out by Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep the people hypnotized, fed, clothed and content and they will tolerate a lot. Don&#39;t think most of America is suddenly going to jump on a moral and ethics bandwagon without a major catastrophe that takes away their state of hypnotism, and general lifestyle. So far it&#39;s just a big drama with larger than life talking heads and unreal characters. </p>

<p>Sure, the bunker building ammo collecting patriots are pissed at the moral and ethical situation, but waking up involves action...and I&#39;ve noticed this is one lazy assed spoiled country (for the most part). I don&#39;t like it as much as you, but what can you do until the shoe drops? </p>

<p>Nuthin but wait and postulate. I like my beer cold and fresh and my interwebs speedy, and the climate control in my casa well regulated. kinda hard to complain, since I have lived in countries (and areas of this country) where these things are not easy to come by.  </p>

They aren&#39;t &quot;jungle asians&quot; so who the hell knows (lookin at you Phillipines). I&#39;m not there, but the interwebs seem kinda silent on all the outrage that is supposedly happening. Got some links to some vids of some quality current rioting/unrest? I can&#39;t seem to find any.

Rallies aint flipping police cars over and setting fire to stuff. I mean that&#39;s a total Korean berserker move and they ain&#39;t pulling it...yet anyway.

<p>Most people dont realize the extent that the global capitalism/market system is corrupting everything; corruption literally built into the system from the ground up. Exploitation as a mode of business.</p>

<p>I fear that the revolutionary forces of the world will just install a hyper dictatorship (left or right oriented, whichever it be) or just throw a few guys in jail, remove certain market-based laws and then claim &quot;we made the free market more free, that&#39;ll end the corruption&quot;.

<p>Exactly. When you hear about Mark Zuckerberg being a billionaire, you should know he made that fortune by clueless people creating content that then becomes the property of Facebook (it&#39;s all in their Terms of Service, guys).</p>

<p>The same thing happens with Youtube: you create your shitty video of a kitty playing in the sand, it gets 20 billions views, Google attaches just a couple of ads to it and there&#39;s your fortune – made off of someone else&#39;s content.</p>

<p>The most recent Youtube Heroes development is simply the next step, as there&#39;s a massive pool of wannabe hipsters who&#39;ll actually do paid work <em>for free</em> only to get a badge and some internet points.</p>
