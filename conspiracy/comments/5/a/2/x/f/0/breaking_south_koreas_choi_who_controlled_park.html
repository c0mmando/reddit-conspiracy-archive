       There are currently BBC, NPR, and Asian news reports on the story, but most western media has completely blocked this event from being a big story.
      </p>
      <p>
       While not directly tied to Wikileaks yet, it has a strong likelihood that it could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choi, Park's cult-religious puppet master, had known Park for over 40 years. Choi's elder relatives have ties to previous SK presidents. She commanded virtually every policy/speech of Park and told Park who to appoint/influence for government positions.

       Here's an interesting article detailing Merkel and Choi(keep in mind Park has been 100% uninvolved in affairs and only answers to Choi) talking about the reunification of SK
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/full/2014/03/26/31/1200000000AEN20140326008752315F.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Park and Merkel first met back in October 2000, when Park visited Germany on an inspection as the deputy governor of the opposition party. Merkel was the party leader of Germany’s opposition party at the time, as well. Park recalls their first meeting as including a lot of discussion on South-North Korean exchanges. Also, it is known that Merkel had a lot of influence on Park Towards Reunification Park Revealed Reunii cation Plans in in terms of forming a political philosophy and values, as the latter kept track of German social and economic reforms led by the chancellor."
      </p>

        www.businesskorea.co.kr/sites/default/files/pdf/BK-2014-04.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even before Park became President thanks to Choi's influence, Merkel had ties up to 12 years earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       There also are numerous massive protests involving police not being reported
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While no complete ties are found to Clinton or Merkel yet, this rabbit-hole could help lead the answer. Are there any Clinton Foundation links to SK or Park's nonprofits? ( K-SPORTS, The Blue K, MIR Foundation)
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus: Kerry and Park (keep in mind Choi was most likely also present during all Park's foreign affairs)

      <p>
       ALSO: If anyone can translate SK this would be helpful It relates to the 8 Goddesses which has been a long running conspiracy theory within SK

       Please update with any new info found
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Just realized Park's father and Tongsun Park were implicated Koreagate where SK tried to influence 115 Congress members through bribes and favors seeking to gain power over Nixon's withdrawal of troops during the war.

      <p>
       More info: Choi is the daughter of the late Choi Tae-min, who was a kind of shaman-fortune teller described in a 2007 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul as “a charismatic pastor.” Locally, he’s seen as a “Korean Rasputin” who once held sway over Park after her mother was assassinated in 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,” read the cable, released by WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This situation goes super deep and I need help finding out more info. Post if you can find anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: EDIT: More info about Park's father, Tongsun Park, and their relations with the US and Saddam Hussein. This covers the Reagan, Carter, Clinton and Bush administrations. Keep in mind Park's father had similar, if not identical relationships, to this shadow government

       I think that the link joining Merkel, Clinton, Park, and de Lima is George Soros (and his money). It might be a good idea to keep an eye out for more Soros lieutenants getting removed from office(s).

       I've been talking with her about all of this, and everything this blog has said, she's been trying to say to me (her English is still pretty terrible lol). Regardless, that's a pretty spot on account of the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the bit that scares me the most is the theory about the boat full of children being sunk... I know it's super kooky, but with the whole Moloch thing, I can help but wonder if the whole world is slowly entering the Tyson Zone.
