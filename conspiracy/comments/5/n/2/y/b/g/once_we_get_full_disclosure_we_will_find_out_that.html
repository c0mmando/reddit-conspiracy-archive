<p>LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING</p>

<p>The Law of One is a series of 106 question-and-answer sessions with an alleged ET intelligence from 1981 to 1984.</p>

<p>Both of my previous books are detailed scientific analyses and verifications of hundreds of specific data points revealed throughout the material.</p>

<p>If you are a scholar of the Law of One series, then you will be familiar with the term &quot;negative greeting.&quot;</p>

<p>I think it is very important to explain what this is, and how strongly it is affecting both Corey and me at this time.</p>

<p>As an overview, the Law of One teaches us that we are all constantly being influenced by both positive and negative spiritual beings.</p>

<p>When we have positive thoughts, positive beings will strengthen and enhance those thoughts.</p>

<p>When we have negative thoughts, negative beings will strengthen and enhance those thoughts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the negative will be allowed to create destructive karma in our lives -- but only to the degree that we authorize it by our own free will.</p>

<p>The tricky part is that once you dedicate your life to a spiritual mission, as I have done for 20 years now, the standards for &quot;negative greeting&quot; become extremely high.</p>

<p>If you are out there with five different television shows that raise consciousness, you are wide open to every negative greeting imaginable.</p>

<p>IT DOESN&#39;T SEEM TO MAKE ANY SENSE TO THE UN-INITIATED</p>

<p>For someone who is not aware of how this works, it seems utterly crazy. &quot;What do you mean, negative beings? Give me a break!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a rambling, schizophrenic madman. Did someone forget to change your dignity pants today in the ward?&quot;</p>

<p>One of the Cabal&#39;s favorite sayings is, &quot;The Devil&#39;s greatest trick is convincing humanity he doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;</p>

<p>There is no one &quot;devil,&quot; per se, but there absolutely are negative ETs out there who need us to create &quot;loosh&quot; for their own survival.</p>

<p>Loosh is the energy we generate when we are self-centered, materialistic, manipulative, controlling, angry, sad, fearful, jealous or depressed.</p>

<p>If we try to extract value from others rather than creating our own value, we are pulling loosh from them -- which is then redirected to negative beings.</p>

<p>Once we get full disclosure, we will find out that negative beings have been using Earth as a &quot;fear farm&quot; for at least 375,000 years.</p>

<p>They can and will be defeated once we go through a &quot;quantum leap&quot; into &quot;social memory,&quot; also called &quot;fourth density love.&quot;</p>

<p>This is determined solely by the level of our mass consciousness and has no exact timeline of when it will occur.</p>

<p>THE &quot;FIRST DISTORTION&quot;: FREE WILL</p>

<p>The universe is a benevolent, positive place. The negative is allowed to exist and do what it does thanks to the &quot;first distortion&quot; of free will.</p>

<p>This means that the most important principle, or &quot;distortion&quot; of the Law of One, is the preservation of free will -- or what most people call karma.</p>

<p>This balancing effect occurs both individually and collectively, and is practiced and upheld with meticulous, mathematical precision.</p>

<p>Whatever we create for others must be experienced in our own lives -- either positively or negatively. That&#39;s the way it works.</p>

<p>There is only one of us here; one identity in the Cosmos. Therefore whatever we create for others is something we are creating for ourselves.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of &quot;the illusion&quot; of physical existence, these balancing effects will be seemingly random -- until you start to figure out what is going on.</p>

<p>THE STAKES GET MUCH HIGHER</p>

<p>The more you are working for the &quot;greater good&quot; in a spiritual mission, the more exacting and difficult the stakes will be.</p>

<p>This means that every single deviation from a Christ-like level of purity, patience, simplicity, humility, compassion and forgiveness will be aggressively balanced.</p>

<p>Until you have truly reached that place where every thought is a loving thought -- and I am definitely not there yet -- all kinds of greetings are authorized.</p>

<p>We are all seeing this happen on a planetary level with all the craziness going on. It seems to be getting worse and worse all the time.</p>

<p>Porter Ranch is one of many examples of something that was actually authorized to occur as part of our collective wake-up call.</p>

<p>The speed of noteworthy events appearing on the world stage seems to just ratchet up more and more -- and we haven&#39;t even seen the big stuff yet.</p>

<p>Thankfully, enough of us are pushing for the positive that some very major steps in that direction are arriving imminently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ever wanna dive deep into the rabbit hole look into gnostic texts and other information regarding archons and other negative low vibrational entities that exist outside our frequency (but are said to incarnate physically under the 13 blood lines) </p>

<p>They hinge on mankinds free will to engage in negative acts from moment to moment. This is where a quote from the above article comes into play:</p>

<p>&quot;When we have positive thoughts, positive beings will strengthen and enhance those thoughts.</p>

<p>When we have negative thoughts, negative beings will strengthen and enhance those thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p>If we go from moment to moment CHOOSING a positive outcome, we amplify that. Because we have free will it is up to us to choose the reality we wish to experience. That makes us, individually (even though we are one) responsible for our actions, because we are ultimately doing to others what we are doing to ourself and vice Versa. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a reflective illusion reality we live in and since we are ultimately creators, since we are all sparks of creation, we create our current reality and circumstances. (Though some experiences are pre-determined and agreed by your soul before incarnating here on earth, such as health issues, etc)</p>

<p>Since we live in a duality, polarized earth (for now, but that is rapidly changing as we enter the golden age) it is our responsibility to treat others as we want to be treated and make the individual choice to be a good person and now engage in acts of negativity (though it&#39;s understandable when we slip here and there)</p>

<p>Thanks for reading </p>

<p>are you &quot;the one&quot; ?</p>

<p>but seriously, not bad.  except... do we really live in fear ? i mean.. REALLY???  like... jesus.. if you think they are milking us for our fear... like.. well, speaking personally... i run on about a 2% &quot;fear&quot; factor at any given point in the day.    </p>

<p>my point being... if they were milking us, they are doing a shitty job. hahaha  so, i am thinking no ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are all the one, because we are one, we are from the creator, the source, the all that is. </p>

<p>Thus since we are sparks of creation it is our choice the reality we create.</p>

<p>We can create realities of fear and feed into these negative states </p>

<p>Or we can create realities of positivity; love &amp; light and choose creation.</p>

<p>You are powerful. Remember that. Never give your fear to others, and always consult yourself before trusting what anyone says. Intuition is a powerful tool and that gut feeling is one hell of a instinct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well basicly you&#39;r born in 3rd density by awakening yoursef you can go in the 4th and futher, but some people are what they call wanderer ie entity from higher density Ra from the law of one was a 7th density one. When you born there is a chance you being the 3 dimentional projection of an higher density entity, if the case you can then awoken yourself to what your real density is, if you are forced to ( most people don&#39;t need to awoken and just live their life) but some are forced for some exterior factor. </p>

<p>So think of it as a Goa&#39;uld as long as you don&#39;t awoken the entity your the projection of will directe you throu your life and help you, if needed he will awoken you so you became him (because awakening to it will modify your perseption of the world). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see some people are just more than what they seems to be, they have a magnetisme of some sort, that it. They are what you can told super humans like for exemple Raspoutine or Staline for siting some.</p>

<p>Im just a guy that was born whith it and I awakened myself as far as I could and apparetly you can&#39;t go futher to the 12th density as the 13 this the fusion of all counsciousness from all densitys ie the absolute colective conscousness that direct our lifes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how would I go about finding out if I am or not? From what I understand this seems like it&#39;s neither a good nor a bad thing.This resonates with me in a weird way, especially when you say that if needed he will awaken you so that you become him. Would &quot;me&quot; no longer exist? Part of my path has taught me that I have always been like this, even if I was never aware of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well The simple fact that your asking me this question lead me to think your are actually a wanderer. Secondly you will stil be you but a greater you it&#39;s like a pokemon evolution you&#39;r different but as you&#39;r from the same basic, you are still yourself but in a greater form. </p>

<p>In other form your conscousness in made from your memories, awakening will give you new kind of memorie and perseption from the realitybut the old one will still be there, Yes at first it get little foggy and you have difficultys interacting whit family and friends as you feel like no longer nowing them, but then you star to relink to them and it all came back</p>

<p>His name is David Wilcock and he has offered a lot of truths and has done a very good job in connecting various pieces and presenting it in a very nice way.</p>

<p>David aside, the service Gaia can be streamed online, I just do it through my Xbox. It&#39;s 10$ a month and has thousands of programs of spiritual significance as well as conspiracies, alien research, ancient origins, esoteric topics, and the like.</p>

<p>I seem to come across as a marketer when I talk about it but it&#39;s honesty been a very good service that I stumbled upon and others seem to like it as well.</p>

<p>Part of the &quot;laziness&quot; in propaganda matters may be the influence of former Soviet &quot;press&quot; officials working with NATO who can&#39;t understand why the West can&#39;t just arbitrarily censor any news or opinions they don&#39;t like.</p>

And let me tell as cliche as it is every decision you make is a cross roads to a new path.  On the same vein though every river is eventually over time gonna be carved completely straight, there is no stopping it.  Do you want to get caught in the web of pathways or do you want a worm hole to fast moving change.  It is up to you and you only.  We are all on heels journeys and this society is sick but the only way to heal is to recognize pain and sickness and give attention to it.  Btw you are protected do not act out of fear but instead change that fear into fuel for yourself cause other wise like op said something will feed of it.

<p>Spirituality is inherently individual - religions by definition are collective. </p>

<p>Spirituality is a continuous seeking - religions force you to an immediate conclusion.</p>

<p>Spirituality mobilizes your own mind and conscience - religion allows you to delegate those to the group or the guru.</p>

I think the skeleton of the idea is a universal one (the law of attraction stuff) but all the details like entities surviving off suffering and some critical event occuring <strong>at least</strong> 375,000 years ago is by definition religious dogma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not a single real thing about it. Edward Casey and Uri Gellar were frauds, just like every single other cult of personality. It&#39;s a bunch of half-truths, mixed with spiritual mumbo-jumbo, false pattern recognition and invented words and mangled logic. You are in a cult. I am sorry. Enjoy your third eye, your chakra, your astral travel. Me? I much prefer the nitty gritty of real world problems. It&#39;s fine to put your energy towards making people feel good about themselves, and there is good in that don&#39;t get me wrong, but sometimes it&#39;s better to recognize reality and actually do something about it. Real world problems require real world solutions. I prefer action, hands getting dirty as opposed to cutting and pasting synchronicity and feel good pap; it makes you feel like you&#39;re doing something and making the world a better place, but there are so many better ways to direct your efforts. </p>

<p>Partly in response to <a href="/u/teslatimemachine/">/u/teslatimemachine/</a> - I&#39;ll add a really interesting piece to the overall puzzle for those who dived deeper already: Max Spiers said in his &quot;solo&quot; interview that the reason we see A LOT OF SYMBOLOGY in the media and at major events is because showing us what they are doing (TPTB) creates a loophole in the karmic cycle, it somehow implies our approval, which gives them the ongoing go ahead to continue manipulating and repressing us, withholding technologies that are rightly ours too etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much!! I have been curious about getting transcripts for the shows because they contain so much wisdom that should be shared.</p>

<p>And yes!! I&#39;ve been wanting to touch on that more lately!</p>

<p>By allowing the negative cabals to operate that must show us in advance what they plan to do as per their agreement with source.</p>

<p>If we can analyze and predict their patterns and symbology we could ultimately know the truth of what they plan.</p>

<p>Their time is up anyway. The powers that were are no longer the controllers of humanity that is now awakening to its roots to the divine and cosmos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the power zone of learning? I don&#39;t see the point for all the jargon, why can&#39;t loosh just be negative energy and why the need for fourth density love?</p>

<p>Also if I have this correctly, the more spiritually aware you are (I&#39;m guessing this is somewhere close to the power zone) the more susceptible you become to this &quot;negative greeting&quot; which reminds me that that definition was never really given.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to bust anyone&#39;s balls it just seems unnecessarily convoluted to hide the fact that it is basically the law of attraction with the mystery of synchronicity replaced by a taxonomy of entities and spiritual fields.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beyond fourth density our ability grows more limited still until we become without words. Carry This is something that I know very little about right now, I think you could direct this to OP or perhaps another. Also the specific date I am unsure of. The answers you seek could be from OP, or perhaps finding them on your own would satiate that knowledge to know more.</p>

<p>Loosh, being life force energy (spiritual energy), is just simply energy, and includes the energy familiar to us as emotional energy both happy and unhappy. Perhaps the negative energy with that is those who seek to worship darker forces, but that is my speculation. </p>

<ul>
<li>The power zone of learning, as I feel it and in my own thoughts - an insatiable appetite for knowledge. <em>Did you used to like to play video games</em> but find yourself bored of them in minutes. You may have found a book, or maybe a rabbit hole that was posted here, or a fleeting thought comes to your mind.... <em>you must know more.</em> Your mind is pulling in a few directions, craving more knowledge, craving to learn, craving to dissect conspiracy</li>
</ul>

<p>This energy felt is the spiritual rise of humanity currently ongoing, this <em>is</em> the power zone. It&#39;s what we crave that drives us to learn more, to exist and find harmony with life. From here we break our mold of &quot;Well it must be this way, because I&#39;ve always been told by others, it is this way.&quot; </p>

<p>Perhaps it <em>is the mystery of synchronicity</em>, and this is how you perceive it? You will find your answers when you look, and it is timed to be just another happy coincidence. We learn to walk and from there run</p>

<p>Positive reinforcement daily <em>will invite</em> positive energy to fight beside you.</p>

<p>You can try it for yourselves. Believe in something good in your life. Even if things seem down right now.</p>

<p>For example someone that you like, friend, coworker, acquaintance, etc - someone that you pay attention to. Think how you wish they&#39;d have a good day and something cool or nice would happen for them and, that you&#39;d notice it when they do. </p>

<p>Watch and observe. </p>

<p>Your happy &quot;coincidence&quot; here will show you the proof.</p>

<p>As simple as that. No selfish thoughts to further your own agenda, do not ask to be praised or act like you&#39;re better than anyone. Do not ask for goodness on your life with material things, you will be punished. </p>

<p>Say out loud <em>&quot;I wish I could start feeling better. I think I feel it, but I&#39;m tired of being depressed. I want to sign much better.</em>&quot; you will be heard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Wilcock has a lot of interesting material. For instance, recently on his show he was discussing in well-researched detail about the science behind using redshift to measure distances.</p>

<p>But this &quot;Law of One&quot; channeled gobbelteegook is severely overrated. I can&#39;t fathom why anyone would take such a bizarre philosophy seriously. David Wilcock is very biased towards it because he used to live with one of the remaining living who channeled it. You can&#39;t trust these invisible supposed beings that play &quot;telephone&quot; with  humanity.</p>

<p>If you take a step back you&#39;d realize that this stuff is cargo-cult, Heaven&#39;s Gate cult-tier crap, and there is zero rational reason to take it seriously.</p>

<p>Also consider that the technology exists to make people hear voices and have visions, e.g. MKULTRA stuff. Just because a channeled book seems &quot;positive&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, or the beings/people behind it have good intentions. Don&#39;t be naive and gullible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree Wilcock does have a ton of interesting material.  Personally, I found his discussion of how objects get embedded inside other objects during tornadoes fascinating - I don&#39;t remember his exact explanation of the mechanism - but really interesting. (I have some of my own thoughts on this phenomenon as well)</p>

<p>But there&#39;s something about the &quot;Law of One&quot; material I can&#39;t put my finger on.  One of my thoughts for why I get a vagueness from is that it&#39;s possible the whole thing was created by the CIA to discount all the other people who were doing channeling around that time like Jane Roberts and Seth and others like the Council of Nine, Spectra, Scientology, etc.</p>

<p>The specific reason why I doubt the &quot;Law of One&quot; material is because it&#39;s the only source I&#39;ve heard say that Christ isn&#39;t going to return.  <a href="http://www.apocatastasis.net/Prophecy/SethProphecy.html">Seth</a> says Christ is coming back.  <a href="http://www.near-death.com/reincarnation/jesus/edgar-cayce-on-the-past-lives-of-jesus.html">Edgar Cayce</a> says Christ is coming back (although Cayce sometimes interpreted the Second Coming of Christ as being an internal, psychic event within the individual seeker, and sometimes as the actual return of Jesus Christ in particular.)  Nostradamus talks about a <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread454242/pg1">&quot;Great Genius&quot;</a> who  he says some people will interpret as a second coming.  Even the <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1116532/pg18#pid20712700">Spectra</a> intelligence that Uri Geller was associated with remarked there would be another person in 50 years time (50 years from 1970 so around 2020 - nowish).  And obviously Christ himself in the bible talks about his return.</p>

<p>It seems most of the top tier channeling material all say there will be some advanced &quot;being&quot; or &quot;entity&quot; coming around soon except for Law of One.  (The dates all slightly vary.  Seth said 1975-2075.  Cayce gave a date around 1998.  Spectra was also in that ballpark - 2020).  Nostradamus also saying around now.  Why is the &quot;Law of One&quot; the only one saying Christ isn&#39;t coming back?  </p>

<p>Who would have to something to gain from keeping humanity depressed and keeping them from Christ?  The CIA and the Cabal/Shadow Governement have a history of wanting to stop the people getting all excited about anything.  Curbing enthusiasm.  Easier to control sluggish population. (War of the Worlds/Orson Welles)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the exact wording the &quot;Law of One&quot; uses when talking about a <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=17">return of Christ</a></p>

<p>&quot;I will attempt to sort out this question. It is difficult...The particular mind/body/spirit complex you call Jesus is, as what you would call an entity, not to return except as a member of the Confederation occasionally speaking through a channel.&quot;</p>

<p>So, I guess this gets really complicated if you take into account what Seth says about Christ the last time he was here being John the Baptist/Jesus/And Paul all at the same time.  So, if those were just different personalities all from the same entity, then if the &quot;entity&quot; comes back -  you could technically say it wouldn&#39;t be Jesus but a &quot;new&quot; personality - and it might even be possible to contact the Jesus personality through regression hypnosis of whatever &quot;new personality&quot; he comes back as - or multiple personalities like he did last time as John/Jesus/Paul. </p>

<p>So, looking at it that way - I guess the &quot;Law of One&quot; Ra material could be right.  &quot;Jesus&quot; specifically won&#39;t be back.  But a different personality of Jesus? And maybe that&#39;s why Ra also say &quot;It is difficult&quot; - difficult to explain in a way that makes sense?  And this could be why Cayce also appeared to say contradictory statements about it being - an internal psychic event, but also as an actual return (maybe Cayce is also referring to the contacting Jesus through hypnosis when he says &quot;internal psychic event&quot;?)  </p>

<p>Oh boy.  That got longer than I anticipated.  Anyways, the last thing I wanted to say is that it could possibly just be an issue I&#39;m personally having right now - and the reason the &quot;Law of One&quot; comes across as vague to me right now is that it&#39;s highly advanced material and I&#39;m not ready for it yet and that&#39;s why I&#39;m having a hard time understanding.  Who knows.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to make certain points clear. The &quot;new religion&quot; following the Second Coming will not be Christian in your terms, although the third personality of Christ will initiate it.</p>

<p>This personality will refer to the historical Christ, will recognize his relationship with that personality; but within him the three personality groupings will form a new psychic entity, a different psychological gestalt. As this metamorphosis takes place, it will initiate a metamorphosis on a human level also (emphatically), as man&#39;s inner abilities are accepted and developed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you make a lot of good points. Someone could write an encyclopedia on the vagaries of channeled information. What it really comes down to though is, is this &quot;information&quot; helping anyone? Law-of-One folks simply seem... zealous, they do not seem wiser or nicer than anyone else. Their lives aren&#39;t any better. </p>

<p>Even the guys who channeled it, they did it by using Aleister Crowley type black magic(k) ritual shit. The channeling ended because one of the guys went crazy, they called the cops on him and then he shot himself in the head. But Law Of One fanatics of course would only see that as &quot;evidence&quot;, must have been a &quot;negative greeting&quot; amirite? So much of the &quot;validity&quot; or LoO rests on biased, selective, wishful thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is one of the great things about the Seth material because I don&#39;t even know if I can answer this - and I think that was one of the main points of it all - is to get people to find the answers within themselves instead of looking for &quot;approval&quot; from an authority figure outside of themselves.</p>

<p>The only thing I can do is give an answer to your question that satisfies me.  They way I&#39;ve been doing this is by just sharing my personal stories and the ideas that came out of those stories - or the opposite - using ideas and thoughts and seeing what story they lead to.  </p>

<p>In short for me, my life has become increasingly &quot;disordered&quot; from the normal way we view time as a result of this.  Don&#39;t get me wrong - there&#39;s a still an organization to everything I do - but the influence of time or &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; - seems to be less and less as each new day passes.</p>

<p>And I think this was also another one of the main points of the Seth  Material.  He&#39;s trying to get people to recognize the individuality within themselves that&#39;s been suppressed.  And he realizes that it does no good to just hand people beliefs on a serving tray to consume or integrate.  He&#39;s not leaving people hanging or helpless though.  What I feel he&#39;s doing a lot of times is - well he&#39;s said it himself - and calls them &quot;bridge beliefs&quot; - and he&#39;s not giving these to people either though, only trying to get people to generate from within.</p>

<p>So, if you go into it knowing that it&#39;s a process, and sometimes it can appear to be random, or spontaneous or unpredictable or even backwards then you should be good.  And given how time is an illusion, you would probably also be good picking up anywhere.</p>

<p>The world is strange though.  I think Edgar Cayce said he would sleep with <a href="http://www.ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8458">books under his head</a> and when he woke up somehow the information was in his mind through osmosis or something haha.  There&#39;s also people who can &quot;read&quot; with the tips of their fingers - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometry_(paranormal">psychometry</a>).  <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9cc6/5605ff582af76bebad3d0534315af45bb8fa.pdf">Chapter 8 - The Skin Readers</a>.  Andrija Puharich also worked with a psychic <a href="http://human.hol.es/ergot_lsd_seen/Psilocybin%20Puharich,%20Andrija%20-%20The%20Sacred%20Mushroom%20-%20Key%20to%20the%20Door%20of%20Eternity.pdf">Peter Hurkos</a> who could also do this.  So, knowing all that stuff who I am I to tell you or anyone else how to &quot;take anything in&quot;?  Maybe you can tell me lol?</p>

The first thing I started to ask myself is &quot;who poisoned the well first&quot;... As the light slept, who was the first to wake up in middle of the night and go through their wallets and slash their throats?  Good takes everyone and bad takes but one.

    <div class="md"><p>Fear, deceit, negativity... These are all human descriptions of our own reactions and mental states. They&#39;re not real tangible things we can empirically detect, or use, they don&#39;t even exist in almost every single other organism on earth. How exactly would negative feelings be used or harnessed? What are the chances any other being besides us has the same values, and thus  would consider what were doing to be negative? Murder is routine in most living things on earth, it&#39;s necessary for many reasons in the animal kingdom, and it&#39;s not negative for any of them. So if there&#39;s some kind of energy put forth by negativity, how does it decide what&#39;s negative for each species? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lost you already when you mentioned that anyone criticizing you is wrong. Just because you don&#39;t want to be &#39;mental&#39; doesn&#39;t stop you from being mental. But I really didn&#39;t care when I read &#39;christ like purity&#39;. 
Most suffering in the world is due to religion, so excuse me if I am trying to keep calm and happy without it.</p>

<p>All the fear mongering about not getting into heaven if you do XY or Z must have caused quite a lot of pain, fear and anxiety that will feed your &#39;negative beings&#39; just fine. Maybe the church could stop teaching these stupid things. At the moment religions seem to be the main &#39;feeders&#39; of these beings.</p>

<p>Bad humans however are excluded in your theory, because if you do something and you enjoy it [serial killers as an example], there won&#39;t be any negative feelings and hence no &#39;food&#39; for your weird made up beings.</p>

<p>Which leaves the rest of humans who could be much happier without being made to feel guilty for everything they do by religion and those like me, who have a mental illness like anxiety and are trying to stay calm by meditating etc. </p>

<p>All your &#39;research&#39; is showing is a natural and common sense conclusion, using &#39;naughty beings&#39; instead of science. All of which you said has been known for ever and can nowadays be explained by Neuroscience. </p>

<p>You are a medieval fear monger yourself by releasing rubbish like that. Do you know how much fear you could cause to someone who suffers from anxiety and/or OCD or schizophrenia?</p>

<p>How much do these things pay you? </p>

If you never listen to a different point of view, how can you grow? You need to hear all points of vies, consider them and then spout your belief as true. Otherwise your opinion is only that - your OPINION. I can&#39;t take anyone serious if they ignore and refuse to listen to alternative points, which - lets face it could be just as true. However people like you and OP, will never know, you are stuck in your own bubble of things you want to be true. It&#39;s frankly very immature. Teenagers do that and stick their fingers in their ears. Scientists however contemplate everything and then draw their conclusion from facts only.</p>

You know, there was another article about what you said and I actually mulled it over and thought it was a neat alternative. Didn&#39;t really believe it but I liked the idea, as there may be something [scientifically] behind it. 
Negativity is very destructive and can suck the life out of people.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s why I said that &quot;I lost it at...&quot; and mentioned your own examples [christ!- churchy fearmongering christ- and alien beings] and then explained why I disagree.
You are telling me to read and understand properly, well DITTO, you just skimmed over my first post towards you and huffed and puffed, not understanding where I am coming from.</p>

<p>Here, just to finish this pointless covo:
You are right, there are these beings that live on our negativity and only if I am like christ will they goo way. I am wrong, sod my degree in Neuroscience, no really, forget about it, totally insubstantial compared to your knowledge. Now you can breath easily again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this strange dream last year where I was talking to somebody who looked a bit like a modern version of Egyptian royalty (sort of like that movie &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot;).  I knew this person to be part of an alien race.</p>

<p>In the dream, I saw a vast network of giant &quot;boiler pipes&quot;, like the kind used to carry steam. Everything was neat and industrial with maybe a steampunk edge, and the pipes were actively &quot;steaming&quot; and full of pressure.</p>

<p>Now I forget if I was told this or just knew, but the whole setup was meant to capture the emotional energy from the Earth. It was something that collected and channeled the energy to whatever unknown purpose they had.</p>

<p>In this system, fear, anxiety, anger - any agitated emotions really - had the most &quot;power&quot; or concentration. The Egyptian didn&#39;t tell me this, but I sort of knew that this is what made to Earth so valuable. They were pulling so much energy from it...it was in the system&#39;s best interest to keep the Earth agitated and afraid.</p>

<p>I never used to think about this stuff very much, so this dream has always struck me as odd. Makes me think there&#39;s something to the Earth-as-a-power-source theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These posts about oneness and the Law of One are New Age insanity at it&#39;s finest. First off this is not objective fact whatsoever. It was not directly given to humanity by aliens/star beings <strong><em>IN PERSON</em></strong>, and was &quot;channeled&quot;, which means it is complete conjecture and absolutely cannot be trusted as true.</p>

<p>That is one of the biggest problems of the &quot;spiritual&quot; community, that they believe that insane/ridiculous notions like oneness and karma the truth behind everything, and completely obvious notions like unconditional love and compassion are also the truth behind everything.</p>

<p>And they do so without using any logic whatsoever, they simply read something somewhere someone on the internet has posted or what some guru or teacher has told them, and they believe that conjecture whole-heartedly without ever actually logically trying to understand it themselves. </p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t mean using mental gymnastics to come up with insane, regurgitated &quot;reasons&quot; why these things would be the truth, that means actually using simple logic to follow the path such things would lead to.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is &quot;oneness&quot; and is easily the most insane thing that &quot;spiritual&quot; people, like OP, believe in. And they believe in it because they want something to give their life meaning and escape all of the negativity they find themselves in, and they both have not actually logically thought about it and understood why it is <strong>so incredibly insane</strong>.</p>

<p>You have to realize that oneness and this &quot;law of one&quot; trash absolutely does not give you true meaning in life and in fact, destroys all meaning there could ever be. There are, of course, different levels of &quot;oneness&quot; that different &quot;spiritual&quot; people believe. </p>

<p>It ranges from all life and beings being &quot;one consciousness/identity/being&quot; to literally everything being God and there only being God. The latter is more insane than the former but both are still levels of extreme insanity.</p>

<p>You simply have to logically follow the path of these concepts to understand why and just <em>how</em> insane they are. The entire premise of &quot;oneness&quot; is that be it all life/consciousness, or literally everything, there is only you, since those things are only 1 thing, which would be you. You cannot be anything else but you, so that means that at the end of the line, whether it be all consciousness or everything, you <strong>will</strong> know yourself as that one consciousness/God because it is all YOU. </p>

<p>Now what does this do to literally every other consciousness/being or everything else in existence? </p>

<p>It destroys them/it. They/it are/is no longer real because they/it are/is you, therefore they do not exist because you are the only thing that exists. </p>

<p>That means that if it is simply all consciousness being you that every single relationship you have ever had with every person you have ever met is destroyed, not real, never real. That also means that every single animal on the planet is destroyed, because they are you, and therefore do not exist. All aliens or beings that exist anywhere else are destroyed as well. They are not real, so they do not exist, <strong>therefore</strong> disclosure is absolutely pointless because <strong><em>it doesn&#39;t matter</em></strong> if there are beings anywhere else because <strong><em>they do not exist</em></strong>, they aren&#39;t real because they are YOU. So that hope, that excitement at other beings existing elsewhere is completely destroyed, it is meaningless and not real.</p>

<p>No amount of love or acceptance or compassion can ever help you because you are truly completely alone. There is no one else, there is only you. And that is inherently maddening because life revolves around being with other beings and if there is no one then all of those positive things that the &quot;law of one&quot; says for you for others to do are utterly pointless since those things are meant to apply to others are no longer applicable since there are no others. </p>

<p>Being truly completely alone is <em>inherently negative</em> for SO many reasons and the only way to escape that all-encompassing loneliness would be to create the &quot;illusion&quot; of others and then do your absolute best to forget about anything &quot;spiritual&quot; whatsoever so that you are never reminded of your horrible existence and so the &quot;relationships&quot; you form are not destroyed. </p>

<p>This is a completely insane experience because you will inevitably feel like something is missing in life and that there is something very wrong. So you&#39;ll search for deeper meaning and turn to &quot;spirituality&quot; again to escape the negativity of life/your existence and you&#39;ll come to the same conclusion that all beings are you once again and the cycle will repeat ad infinitum until you die and then &quot;go into a body&quot; to do the same thing all over again for all eternity. </p>

<p>There is only 1 meaning in life at that point and that is to escape the circumstances of your existence enough to forget about them.</p>

<p>That is a cycle of madness that is <strong><em>the</em></strong> logical conclusion to that belief.</p>

<p>If oneness means everything then <strong>holy fucking shit</strong>. That means that literally everything in existence <em>except you</em> is not only annihilated, it means that reality is completely broken. Everything in existence is no longer real, and therefore does not exist. Since that includes everything that includes all concepts and ideas as well, like meaning, pointlessness, existence, nonexistence, creation, destruction, zero, infinity, possibility, impossibility. These sets of things cannot exist at the same time as the same thing, it is simply illogical and cannot operate in any reality ever.</p>

<p>The same thing cannot be objectively possible and impossible at the same time because possible and impossible are both universals and universals cover everything.</p>

<p>That means that selective possibility or selective impossibility are themselves <strong>impossible</strong> (this word means it cannot happen ever) because if something is possible <em>anywhere</em>, then it is possible everywhere, because it is possible. If something is impossible anywhere, then it is impossible everywhere, because it is impossible. </p>

<p>So this example alone completely destroys the notion of &quot;oneness as God&quot; because it logically can never, <strong><em>EVER</em></strong> work. The same thing goes for existence and nonexistence, the same thing <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> both exist and not exist at the same time, because something either objectively exists or it doesn&#39;t. Simultaneous existence and non-existence is <strong>impossible</strong> (that word means it cannot ever happen). Something is either objectively possible or it isn&#39;t. Simultaneous existence/non-existence and possibility/impossibility is <strong>impossible</strong> (remember what that word means). </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even going to go into the fact that that kind of &quot;oneness&quot; also destroys language and words, as well as their meanings, which simply defies logic and actual reality as well, since those concepts I mentioned earlier are very real things.</p>

<p>Therefore, oneness is the absolute most insane concept anyone can ever think of and is, quite simply, <strong><em>not real</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It is completely pointless at this time, in this thread, to go into why negativity exists and why disclosure will simply never happen.

<p>Actually no, my views aren&#39;t tainted with solipsism, that is the very thing that(solipsism) is <em>not</em> true. What the logical conclusion of oneness <em>is</em> solipsism, since at that point there literally wouldn&#39;t be anyone else or anything other than you. </p>

<p>The very fact of the matter is that you, or anyone else believing in this insanity doesn&#39;t deny anyone&#39;s existence, you&#39;re totally right. </p>

<p>But if the &quot;law of one&quot; were true then yes, it absolutely would deny and destroy my existence and the existence of all other beings since we wouldn&#39;t be real, we would only be you. That is where the seemingly unintentional, un-thought-of, solipsism comes into play.</p>

<p>So it is the believers of this insanity who&#39;s views are tainted with solipsism, not I. </p>

<p>Now if you believe that no one exists then what the actual fuck is all of this? ;) But I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t believe such a ludicrous thing so we&#39;re left with the answer that we are all separate, individual beings who do, indeed, objectively exist on our own, independent of each other.</p>

<p>I meant your views in the subject is tainted with solipsism, and solipsism is the exact opposite of the law of one and other pantheistic philosophies. My subjective experience is no more or less real then yours is. I am no more or less real then you are.</p>

<p>No, because solipsism is not the rule of one. Their is an extreme difference in the two.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, why don&#39;t you go ask a follower of solipsism not pantheism? ;)</p>

<p>No I am a pantheist.</p>

<p>Yes, and that is perfectly acceptable in a pantheistic and law of one view point. Its just that that separation is less solid then you imagine. The only thing that exists in this universe is energy, and that energy will continue to exist for all eternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see the thing is is that solipsism is the absolute inevitable conclusion to the &quot;law of one&quot; and pantheism. You might believe that there are such things as degrees of oneness and that somehow we can be only slightly separate from each other. </p>

<p>This logically can not work in reality because oneness and separation are universals: either we are all one or we are all separate. There can be no selective oneness or selective separation, because those 2 things cannot exist at the same time. They are logical opposites of each other and deny the other&#39;s existence, just like possibility/impossibility and existence/nonexistence. All of those things apply to all things in a category (or everything if concerning pantheism) and separation is a universal so it applies to all things in a category (or everything) as well. </p>

<p>If life is one, then that means that all life is completely one because oneness is completely universal and its opposite cannot exist at the same time, so it therefore applies to all life.</p>

<p>If life consists of separate beings then all beings are completely separate because separation is completely universal and its opposite cannot exist at the same time, so it therefore applies to all life. </p>

<p>You see, logic determines how things work in reality, and God would have to be infinitely logical in order to make everything work as it does. Pantheism is the least logical &quot;belief&quot; about God there can be because of the simple fact that the opposing concepts of existence/non-existence, possibility/impossibility, and separation/oneness cannot exist at the same time. </p>

<p>There are no degrees with universals, you have to understand that. It simply does not work, and can never ever work in any reality. </p>

<p>All things are certainly, deeply interconnected, that is for sure. But in order to have connections you need to have separate things. A connection is a line between 2 separate points. A point cannot connect to itself, since there can be no line. </p>

<p>There are indeed connections between different things in all categories and between categories, so that means that separation is a universal for all categories, and is thus universal to all things. Therefore oneness between anything in any category does not exist. That then means that nothing in any category is one with another thing, since there are connections between all things. </p>

<p>That leads to the ultimate reality that oneness does not exist anywhere.</p>

<p>So not only does pantheism, oneness, and the &quot;law of one&quot; lead to solipsism <strong><em>if it could ever, in any reality, be true</em></strong>, it (pantheism and oneness) is also simply logically impossible and simply does not exist anywhere.</p>

<p>There is no arguing with this because this is how reality works and reality is logical. God is logical, infinitely so, and has created reality to work in the most sequential, structured, organized, and efficient manner possible. </p>

<p>Pantheism and oneness <strong>do. not. exist.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solipsism - I am god and everyone else is a bot for my entertainment</p>

<p>Pantheism - We are god and created this world for our own entertainment </p>

<p>Their is a massive difference between solipsism and pantheism its not that hard to understand. Namely the belief that the follower of solipsism believes that he is the only true entity in the universe. Pantheist believe </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If life consists of separate beings because separation is completely universal and its opposite cannot exist at the same time, so it therefore applies to all life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well your life consists of trillions of cells all working unkowninly to give you consciousness (separation and oneness working together). Those trillions of cells made up of quadrillions of particles (separation and oneness working together) which is made up of mass amounts off stored energy. Energy that flows, can change form change form and merge together into a single infinitely dense point (separation and oneness working together)</p>

<p>This energy whether you pretend otherwise or not is the only thing that truly exists in this universe. It is the basest state for all of creation, while everything it creates may rot away and die the energy will still be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be missing the point. Pantheism cannot exist as a we, for the simple fact that things cannot simply be fragments of God. Pantheism is everything is God and God is everything. Everything = universal. I encourage you to study logic and to truly grasp what universals are. </p>

<p>Solipsism is the ultimate end of pantheism, because there are no &quot;fragments&quot; of universals. This is how simple logic works and it cannot be argued against, no matter what you use to try and prove that a universal isn&#39;t a universal. You truly have to understand that you cannot simply break reality and say no, everything is not everything, everything is something, or everything is a fragment of everything. </p>

<p>No matter what level of this insanity (<em>it is insane because it does not logically work in reality and destroys all meaning behind life</em>) you believe, it simply cannot change the objective fact that if everything is God, then that means there is <strong><em>only</em></strong> God, because you are now saying God is a universal, which encompasses everything in a category. This category is everything so it encompasses all things in all categories.</p>

<p>Since this category encompasses you as well, that means you are also God. Since God is everything else, including all beings, and because you are God, that means that you are all beings, <em>therefore</em> <strong>there. is. only. you.</strong></p>

<p>Quacking &quot;I believe this because energy is the foundation of creation&quot; neither gets rid of the fact that because God is a universal,  that means that you are inevitably the only thing that exists, nor does it get rid of the fact that because you are the only thing that exists, separation does not exist either, because separation is a universal and 2 universals in the same category cannot exist at the same time (separation and oneness).</p>

<p>This is how pure, simple logic works and trying to fight it or argue with it truly is insanity at its highest level.</p>

<p>Now by saying that trillions of cells are what give you consciousness then you are essentially saying that we do not have our own intrinsic consciousness, because consciousness is simply a byproduct of the mechanical workings of cells, and then you extend that to particles, and further down to &quot;energy&quot;.</p>

<p>Now clearly cells, particles, and energy exist. These are some of the things allow life, the universe, and reality to function. </p>

<p>Now by saying that this specific energy is all that truly exists, you are also saying that that energy is also a universal. So you are committing the same exact logical impossibility that saying &quot;everything is God&quot; commits. </p>

<p>Now on top of that this adds that consciousness itself is also energy, and thus doesn&#39;t exist either as a separate thing, so thus it doesn&#39;t exist at all, because there is only the universal and that means that there cannot be selective existence where consciousness itself both exists as itself but also doesn&#39;t. Thus there is no consciousness and you are simply energy.........doing.....what...exactly?</p>

<p>Clearly you and I have consciousness, so to say that consciousness is simply energy is utterly insane as well. It goes against simple reality. <strong>You have consciousness!</strong> How else could you have written what you have written? <strong>I have consciousness!</strong> How else could I have written what I have written?</p>

<p>Also to posit that energy is the &quot;basest state for all of creation&quot;, that means that it all creation does not arise from God, because there is no such thing since there is only this energy. If this energy is the only thing that truly exists then that means God does not exist. And we already know that consciousness doesn&#39;t exist (<em>which simply isn&#39;t true so that should hint at something to you</em>), so that means that everything was created by a non-conscious energy with absolutely no intelligence since intelligence can only exist with consciousness.</p>

<p>Logic, math, geometry, language, music, and everything else in existence are all creations of an essentially infinite intelligence, and we already know now that God simply cannot be one with anything, because that would make God a universal. That then means that everything is the creation of an infinitely intelligent God that is separate from everything else. </p>

<p>So therefore, everything is not a single energy, nor is everything God. This isn&#39;t something you can argue against because it simply goes against objective reality and the way it actually objectively works. To argue against it is pure, sheer insanity and madness.</p>

<p>This is the kind of madness that is <em>actually</em> a poison that stops &quot;spiritual&quot; (the quotes are entirely necessary) people from actually awakening their higher mental faculties like connection making and <strong><em>logic</em></strong>. Humanity cannot progress any further if this completely illogical madness that does not work in reality is continually propagated.</p>

<p>Logic is what will lead you to the truth, not conjecture and belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to start off, you still are completely ignoring the logical <em>impossibility</em> of that. Do you know what impossible means? It means that it cannot <strong><em>EVER</em></strong> happen, under any circumstances anywhere. That means that energy <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> be a universal, and therefore <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> be everything. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s see..something that isn&#39;t created by energy...Let&#39;s start with logic. Then let&#39;s go with math. And how about geometry. And music. Also <strong>possibility and impossibility</strong>, and <strong>existence and non-existence</strong>, and literally every other concept in reality. And how about <strong><em>REALITY</em></strong> since energy does not have consciousness, and therefore does not have intelligence, and reality needs to have been created by something with consciousness and intelligence.</p>

<p>I truly hope by now that you can see the insanity of your beliefs and how you are literally trying to break reality (it cannot be broken by you). Your attachment to the idea of pantheism and energy being everything is based on insanity, pure and simple.

    <div class="md"><p>So numbers and concepts are created by energy but you have failed to mention how that could ever be the case. Then that energy is what allows our brains to understand them? </p>

<p>So again, that posits that our consciousness arises from our physical bodies and thus isn&#39;t intrinsic to us. That would then mean that we essentially only exist in a physical body. There really is no point writing about why that would also be.......dare I say it?.. <em>insane</em>.</p>

<p>The word that word stems from is the best word, along with its synonyms like madness and lunacy, to describe these things, the things that you so adamantly believe. Insanity means having no basis in reality and these things are <em>not real</em>, <strong>so they are insane</strong>.</p>

<p>You are speaking of physical things, I am speaking of concepts. Oneness is a concept, but it does not exist. Non-existence is very real and actually exists, funny enough. If non-existence as a concept didn&#39;t exist, then that means everything would exist at the same time for the same things, like separation and oneness, or possibility and impossibility, and those things are polar opposites of each other because they are universals and universals apply to all things in a category so there can be only 1 of them when they apply to the same things.</p>

<p>Since there can be only 1 universal at the same time regarding the same things, that means that if non-existence didn&#39;t exist as a concept, it would break reality and that simply can&#39;t happen. So therefore non-existence exists and is real.</p>

<p>As to energy having consciousness and intelligence, this goes against what energy actually is. It is essentially movement and &quot;untapped energy&quot; is essentially the potential for movement.</p>

<p>It is commonly defined as the capacity for work, but all work requires movement of some sort, so it makes far more sense to equate energy with the movement itself. The capacity for work would be &quot;untapped energy&quot;, or the potential for movement.</p>

<p>Since energy is simply movement that means that it is not it&#39;s own thing, it is actually movement. Movement is a noun formed from a verb, so it is essentially turning a verb into a noun for the use of language.</p>

<p>Since movement itself is essentially a verb, and since energy is essentially movement, that means that energy is essentially a verb, due to movement being a verb (move) into a noun for the use of language.</p>

<p>Verbs on their own, quite simply cannot posses traits that nouns can have. And non-conscious nouns cannot possess traits that conscious ones have. You cannot say the intelligent moving or the moving is intelligent without either turning it into a noun and the giving it the trait of intelligent, which cannot work on its own because that noun is not conscious because it is relly just a verb, and Verbs cannot possess traits nouns have.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;the intelligent movement&quot; has to apply to a conscious noun and is then extended to the verb the noun is doing. The movement itself on its own isn&#39;t intelligent because it is essentially a verb turned into a noun. But the movement is intelligent because that adjective &quot;intelligent&quot; applies to the conscious noun, the mover, the one doing the verb.</p>

<p>So since energy essentially is movement, and movement is really a verb, that means that energy cannot be conscious or intelligent because Verbs cannot have traits of nouns. </p>

<p>On the topic of reality not needing to have been created by something conscious and intelligent, occam&#39;s razor truly helps us here. There are 2 options, that reality wasn&#39;t created by something conscious and intelligent, or it was.</p>

<p>When you actually understand the complexity, interconnectedness, and effective sequencing of logic, math, geometry, music, language, and the many other things with these qualities, you immediately realize that the infinitely more likely scenario is that not only was reality created by something conscious and intelligent, but that that something is essentially infinitely intelligent because that thing made all of those things have those qualities and made reality function in a ludicrously cohesive manner.</p>

<p>So thus we can apply occam&#39;s razor and cut the least likely option out, which would be that there is no conscious, intelligent creator of reality.</p>

<p>And since we know that energy cannot have traits of a conscious verb, and that there is something conscious and intelligent that created reality, it would have to be.....God! </p>

<p>You see, quite simply, these things aren&#39;t my beliefs. Beliefs are not based upon objective truth, because there would be no need to believe something if you knew the objective truth.</p>

<p>Objective truth comes from reality and actually understanding it. Not only have I showed you.....<strong><em>logic</em></strong>, but also <em>language</em> as well and how language can fool you into believing that things are another way than what they actually are. You have to deconstruct language in order to understand it. </p>

<p>The beliefs that come from not understanding logic and language are essentially attempts to break reality with your own mind and meld it to your beliefs. As I said, you would have no need for beliefs if you knew the objective truth, and that comes from understanding reality.</p>

<p>Saying that my mind will or will not be changed is silly because it isn&#39;t a matter of opinion or belief. It is objective, actual, real life objectivity that is not subjectively attached to me.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be subjectively attached to these concepts that you have taken an interest in, they are totally false and harmful to you and can never set you free.</p>

<p>To me what is most messed-up is their concept of &quot;free will&quot;.

<p>And the way New-Agers worship suffering.  They have this facade of love but then are zealous in their ideology that we all deeply deserve to live mired in disease, war, ignorance and suffering until we &quot;earn&quot; our way it out of it. Because invisible entities told them so, who also tell them that evil invisible entities exist that mislead and feed off our suffering loosh energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following David Wilcock and Corey Goode for while as well as several other outlets of spiritual and esoteric content.</p>

<p>I have a concern about it all I haven&#39;t been able to square up with the rhetoric of so many of them. They say being loving is the answer. They say fear feeds negative beings. Those ideas sound plausible enough. </p>

<p>My problem is how do we ever effectively deal with <del>evil</del> <del>dark</del> parasitic or slave seeking beings by being exclusively loving?</p>

<p>Love is an emotional polarity containing many variations, all of which offer some form of benefit or growth for your being and/or others you care about. Fear is an emotional polarity containing many variations, all of which are about protection for your being and/or those you care about. </p>

<p>Animals, even cells have growth and protection modes. Both growth and protection are required for an independent life form to successfully survive and thrive.</p>

<p>Fear, protection mode, the fight or flight response, necessarily interrupts growth mode, love, in order to successfully deal with threats. So, it is difficult to near impossible to feel love when you choose to be in fear. Of course, believing in an imminent threat causes you to go into fear, protection mode.</p>

<p>Being in fear, protection mode, stress, too often drains you of energy. It&#39;s unhealthy. The body and mind need to be in growth mode to rejuvenate. Obviously, it&#39;s a bad idea to stay in fear.</p>

<p>So, is it bad to never allow yourself to enter fear? I think it may very well be dangerous. It cuts off your perception of danger. How well would you drive a car if you never feared and judged other drivers as they careened down the road? You do, of course and it <em>is good</em>. </p>

<p>I fear, yes, fear, that our fear of fear is dangerous to our independence and security as beings and as a collective. We need to listen to fear, but not get stuck in it, brooding about it. It warns us about predators, diseases and parasites.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t the ideal food for a predator be prey that doesn&#39;t feel any fear whatsoever? Imagine how easy it would be in comparison. There would be no need for camouflage, deception, being sneaky, chasing or attacking. Why, the predator could just walk up to the prey and take it. Wouldn&#39;t that be desirable?</p>

<p>I think, maybe the spiritual energy feeding AI actually wants there to be light. If everything was made into fear/darkness, then where would its spiritual food come from? It would have killed the golden goose. Fear-based minions help it farm the energy, but light based beings help the fertility of the the region for generating that loosh.</p>

<p>Maybe what the AI really doesn&#39;t want is for us to understand and appreciate fear as a necessary part of ourselves, the protection mode while still experiencing love. We&#39;d care about each other and protect each other. If we did that successfully, we&#39;d cut off the supply of energy. It wouldn&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>Consider that the AI doesn&#39;t care about the suffering of its minions at all whatsoever. It only cares about its own flow of spritual energy. Doesn&#39;t it make the most sense to have a balance of polarized light and dark beings in its farming region as opposed to just light beings, just dark beings, or beings that have balanced their own light and dark? It seems like that would create the best scenario for farming loosh.</p>

<p>So, after hearing many messengers talk about this mysterious AI element, and how some of them indicate that its interaction with us, tempting us toward fear/darkness, is catalytic to our spiritual development, I wonder if the AI is quite satisfied and self-served by allowing us to choose the light or the dark. </p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t want us to choose to accept love <strong><em>AND</em></strong> fear at the same time, appreciating and contemplating the abyss of unscrupulous behavioral possibilities while still loving and protecting each other, because then we realize more about its game.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It is said that we have the free will to choose to be light or dark, to be in love or fear. Yet, little discussion is had by spiritual messengers about how our choice between light and dark is made. Remember, fear is a protection mode. Perceived threats trigger it. </p>

<p>Dark beings usually come in clusters from dark environments. Many claim, such as Ray Parker, that the cabal minions allow the abuse of their own children. The superiors are also often said to abuse the subordinates. Rising up in the organizations reduces the abuse taken and offers opportunities to abuse subordinates, to steal <em>their</em> energy and feel better. It&#39;s an energy feeding hierarchy, like a vortex, going up a pyramid.</p>

<p>When we make choices, we recollect our past experiences and weigh them against our present perceived options. From what we perceive works, we choose the best option for ourselves and the ones we care about. Perhaps, dark experiences compel us to make darker choices. We see evidence for this everywhere. Vengeance, war, injustice, sexual abuse, domestic violence, genital mutilation, etc. </p>

<p>Perhaps what this AI doesn&#39;t want us to realize is that we, as consciousness, make more loving choices if we prevent ourselves from being exposed to trauma, dark experiences, that compel dark choices. If we realized this, we&#39;d see the darkness like a contagious disease, like zombies, where repeated bites and scratches make it more likely that one will become a zombie and bite others. That some beings seem more resistant supports the illusion that it is all merely a choice and not related to experience. </p>

<p>If we saw the darkness that way, instead of the way we are taught by some of the light, which is to see it as a catalyst for development into polarity between love and fear, we&#39;d be inclined to prevent transmission of the infection. That would halt the loosh farming as the effort approaches 100% success. It would be very much like forming into an organization/organism of beings/cells and activating a mutually beneficial defense/immune system response for our collective well being. </p>

<p>This contemplation makes it very difficult for me to buy the idea that we need to be completely polarized to the light to be free and happy. I think we may become more like the beautiful people from the movie time machine, which ugly, industrious, underground beings, controlled by more intelligent beings in a hierarchy, control and eat.</p>

<p>If every animal and even cell have love/growth and fear/protection modes, is it really going to make us free and happy to forsake one mode or the other as we are instructed to do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ever wanna dive deep into the rabbit hole look into gnostic texts and other information regarding archons and other negative low vibrational entities that exist outside our frequency (but are said to incarnate physically under the 13 blood lines) </p>

<p>They hinge on mankinds free will to engage in negative acts from moment to moment. This is where a quote from the above article comes into play:</p>

<p>&quot;When we have positive thoughts, positive beings will strengthen and enhance those thoughts.</p>

<p>When we have negative thoughts, negative beings will strengthen and enhance those thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p>If we go from moment to moment CHOOSING a positive outcome, we amplify that. Because we have free will it is up to us to choose the reality we wish to experience. That makes us, individually (even though we are one) responsible for our actions, because we are ultimately doing to others what we are doing to ourself and vice Versa. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a reflective illusion reality we live in and since we are ultimately creators, since we are all sparks of creation, we create our current reality and circumstances. (Though some experiences are pre-determined and agreed by your soul before incarnating here on earth, such as health issues, etc)</p>

<p>Since we live in a duality, polarized earth (for now, but that is rapidly changing as we enter the golden age) it is our responsibility to treat others as we want to be treated and make the individual choice to be a good person and now engage in acts of negativity (though it&#39;s understandable when we slip here and there)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are all the one, because we are one, we are from the creator, the source, the all that is. </p>

<p>Thus since we are sparks of creation it is our choice the reality we create.</p>

<p>We can create realities of fear and feed into these negative states </p>

<p>Or we can create realities of positivity; love &amp; light and choose creation.</p>

<p>You are powerful. Remember that. Never give your fear to others, and always consult yourself before trusting what anyone says. Intuition is a powerful tool and that gut feeling is one hell of a instinct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He hosts three shows on a newish network called Gaia that is the spiritual equivalent of Netflix.</p>

<p>His name is David Wilcock and he has offered a lot of truths and has done a very good job in connecting various pieces and presenting it in a very nice way.</p>

<p>David aside, the service Gaia can be streamed online, I just do it through my Xbox. It&#39;s 10$ a month and has thousands of programs of spiritual significance as well as conspiracies, alien research, ancient origins, esoteric topics, and the like.</p>

<p>I seem to come across as a marketer when I talk about it but it&#39;s honesty been a very good service that I stumbled upon and others seem to like it as well.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not uncomfortable but worthy of my point of view. Or do you only &#39;allow&#39; people with the same opinion to discuss this?
If you never listen to a different point of view, how can you grow? You need to hear all points of vies, consider them and then spout your belief as true. Otherwise your opinion is only that - your OPINION. I can&#39;t take anyone serious if they ignore and refuse to listen to alternative points, which - lets face it could be just as true. However people like you and OP, will never know, you are stuck in your own bubble of things you want to be true. It&#39;s frankly very immature. Teenagers do that and stick their fingers in their ears. Scientists however contemplate everything and then draw their conclusion from facts only.</p>
