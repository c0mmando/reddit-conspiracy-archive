       I dunno... I haven't looked into if it is an actual conspiracy... it just seems kind weird that we keep doing it... I know it was originally stated that in the 20s people needed to get iodine in their diets to the powers that be put it in all the salt so that we would have to eat it.

       Just like the reasoning behind fluoride... "You need this so we're just gonna put it in something you have to consume... it's for your own good."

       Fluoride isn't toxic at the levels we are exposed to, however, it does have adverse effects on hormones such as testosterone. With long term exposure it causes society to become passive. Which is one of the reasons we haven't seen an open rebellion in America when we are actually long over due by democracy standards.

       Rebellions don't happen every 200 years, collapses and transitions do. Rebellions are sporadic.
      </p>
      <p>
       for instance, after the 2008 collapse there should have been one. Everybody felt the effects of the housing bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you have to take into account small localized issues like the flint water crisis(example only) or small sects that feel threatened by legislature/federal overreach.
Rebellions are not always on a mass scale like the American civil war.

       Shay's Rebellion was caused by primarily economic hardship, something that I am arguing does not exist today at nearly the same level that caused these men to revolt.  Btw this rebellion took place prior to the signing of the constitution.  It may seem nit-picky but, strictly speaking, the rebelling farmers did not enjoy the same rights and due process that we do today.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point still stands.  Americans today have it much too good to rebel (and they have it much better than the poor bastards in Shays Rebellion did).

       Story time!  During second grade 91-92 my and the other 2nd grade class had weekly "Flouride Treatments" in class. Which consisted of mouth washes and brushing out teeth with special toothpaste. Myself as well as several other kids have crumbling teeth in our early 39's . I contribute it atleast partially to the "dentist " who visited our class.

       It's to dumb us down. The ruling bloodlines don't want our pineal gland in working order. It fucks with our melatonin production, thus giving us shitty sleeps. Also, it hinders our ability to reach higher levels of consciousness. The elite don't want joe blow tapping into the vast knowledge of the universe. If we did, how would they be able to control us? They'd no longer have slaves working for them.

       Look up the stats on dental cavities before and after fluoridation.  I believe there are even a few cities (maybe just one) in Canada that took it out of the water supply after their citizens got all up in arms about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boom, cavities shoot up.

      <p>
       Fun fact, some places have naturally occurring fluoride in the well water, the folks there seem to be just fine.

       If fluoride was such a great "social control" drug that was making us either dumber or wussier or both then there would be some pretty clear signs.

       Right idea, wrong suspect. I think flouride is ok at the levels it is at; as always there should be room for new studies and changes in policy based on what's found but this is more of a problem of science-for-profit than anything else.

       Yeah, it's a neurotoxin that permeates the blood brain barrier.
       <br/>
       I think the dumbing down is just a welcomed side-effect of what tptb want to achieve.  I think the real reason is it put in the water is to damage our pineal gland to  limit our consciousness, to keep us docile, and controllable.

       I think you can recover your pineal gland through diet, and meditation.  Once your third eye starts to awake you will realize that you are much more than your physical construct and are part of something much more.  It's a very powerful revelation to have.
