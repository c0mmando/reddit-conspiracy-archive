<p>There might be some people awake to a global conspiracy who also reject Christ, but if the big conspiracy is pro-Genesis and pro-Christ then did someone drop a ball in the 20th century? </p>

<p>What&#39;s really going on if a <a href="http://archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=novus+ordo+seclorum">novus ordo seclorum</a> is referenced on dollar bills next to occultic symbolism associated with freemasonry and Egypt?</p>

<p>&quot;4:5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</p>

<p>4:6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.&quot;
-Luke 4:5-6 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>&quot;2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>

<p>2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against <strong>YHWH</strong>, and against his anointed, saying,</p>

<p>2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.&quot;

I wish I was a round when he was alive to see it so i could judge for myself... it would have been awesome if they just said Jesus built the pyramids and everyone agreed. Cause it seems like Christ would be the kind of dude to create some eternal landmark that you could believe only the Son of God could accomplish. </p>

<p>&quot;17:5 Thus saith <strong>YHWH</strong>; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from <strong>YHWH</strong>.</p>

<p>17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.</p>

<p>17:7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in <strong>YHWH</strong>, and whose hope YHWH is.</p>

<p>17:8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</p>

<p>17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?</p>

<p>17:10 I <strong>YHWH</strong> search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>These are all wonderful things, I&#39;m not saying that there is nothing to be gained from these texts but a lot of wise people have said a lot of wise things but that doesn&#39;t mean that they are the son of God. Again, I want to believe, but I&#39;ve taken WAY too much LSD for things to be so simply cut and dried. I truly do believe in a higher being/s I like to call them &quot;the watchers&quot; or &quot;the observer&quot; but I can&#39;t subscribe to any religious text as gospel. I&#39;m sure you understand as someone who&#39;s heart has been softened by the very real influence of a divine presence. I feel that we all believe in the same thing but have placed that ideology inside of our preferred or learned template, some less harmful than others and some completely raped and adulterated with the ideas of Man. I choose to remove the fluff and baggage of religious texts and try to be the best person i know how to be and actively seek a relationship or connection with the universe or creator or watchers. If, in the end, I am not greeted with open arms in &quot;heaven&quot; simply because I didn&#39;t wear the right glasses then I don&#39;t desire to be a part of that club.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read about watchers in 1 Enoch or Jubilees? They might have descended to Mt Hermon and had children with women and taught things to humans and taught some questionable stuff. Interesting if there are still HUGE stones including a giant platform known as the trilithon next to there?</p>

<p><a href="http://qbible.com/enoch/8.html">http://qbible.com/enoch/8.html</a></p>

<p>Consider what pops up with alien and UFO research? Reptilians and nordics and greys? How interesting if seraphim are serpent like angels and iyrim/watchers are suggested to be nordic-like blonde angels? And it&#39;s rumored that greys are chimeras with insect hivemind characteristics bred to be used as spirit hosts or something like that maybe.</p>

<p>What if there is about to be an extreme amount of deception in the world involving a public arrival of fallen angels masquerading as good angels or benevolent aliens or both? Consider stuff like Daniel 2:43 and Daniel 8:10-11 and Daniel 11:29-31 and Daniel 11:38-39 with LXX comparison and concordance? 1) Seed mingled among mankind and 2) host of heaven coming to the planet and 3) mysterious ships showing up against a leader that was coming at another leader and 4) alien elowah ruling over many and the land being divided for gain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Creator might actually be called a G word in error as a result of people being led astray by deceivers. What doesn&#39;t actually go back to a false deity associated with fortune if you investigate origins?</p>

<p>Was was there not a delay expected and specifically a two thousand year delay referenced by Barnabas and a two thousand year Messianic reign referenced in the Talmud? What&#39;s random if you consider everything here?</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Matthew 24:14 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</p>

<p>If Christ was speaking of a gospel being preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and an end coming afterwards, then what was fulfilled in the first century or a thousand years ago or really even a hundred years ago? There might be some Amazon tribes out of touch with modern civilization in 2016.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Daniel 12:4 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>

<p>Consider words there and then consider planes and trains and automobiles and the internet? Is there any time in the past that would make more sense than modern time? What could run to and fro be referring to?</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Nahum 2:4 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>2:4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>

<p>How interesting if this is referring to a time referred to as the day of his preparation? What would a man say well over two thousand years ago to describe modern automobiles and highways using ancient Hebrew or Aramaic?</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> 2 Peter 3:3-4 and 3:8 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p>

<p>3:4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</p>

<p>3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with <strong>YHWH</strong> as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>

<p>Does this sound like Peter thought Christ&#39;s return was imminent? If a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years are as a day to the Creator then what does that mean for us and is there any clue in Old Testament prophecy to help us out?</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> Hosea 6:2-3 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>6:2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p>

<p>6:3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know <strong>YHWH</strong>: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</p>

<p>Hmmm. Is this meaning to hint of timing of return of about two thousand years after the crucifixion? And is there a first and second coming referred to with the latter and former rain unto the earth?</p>

<p><strong>6)</strong> Consider Barnabas 15:4-5 here?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/barnabas-lightfoot.html">http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/barnabas-lightfoot.html</a></p>

<p>Were there not people in the 1st century expecting something big to happen around the 21st century if people thought they were living in about year 4,000 since Adam and expected an end in about year 6,000?</p>

<p><strong>7)</strong> Consider Talmud Sanhedrin 97a starting around a footnote of 33 here?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160511145611/http://come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_97.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20160511145611/http://come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_97.html</a></p>

<p>How interesting if even Christ rejecting Jews expected a Messiah about two thousand years ago and also expected a Messianic era to last two thousand years?</p>

<p>Add in Matthew 24:7 and recent wars and race conflict and diseases and quakes and divorces and technology that allows the world to witness events taking place in Israel from across the world and recent technology advances that are moving people closer to a cashless society? </p>

<p>Even if someone is an atheist or has little to no allegiance to Abrahamic religion, who can rightly deny that we are living in a prophetically significant time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it filled with corruption....</p>

<p>Is it possible a powerful group believes Jesus Christ the son of god is not who Christians claim? </p>

<p>There is a group and it believes that Jesus Christ was &quot;The son of Pandira, a soldier. Illegitimate and conceived during menstruation. Hanged on the eve of Passover, seduced, corrupted and destroyed Israel. Died like a beast and buried in animal&#39;s dirt heap.&quot;</p>

<p>They say more about Jesus, that he is Illegitimate, A fool and insane, A conjurer and a magician, An idolater, A seducer, Wrongfully worshipped, Crucified For His crimes, Buried in Hell.
His teachings are a falsehood, heresy, Impossible to observe, illegitimate, and that he was Possessed by the soul of Esau and being Esau himself.</p>

<p>It would be prudent for those of Christian beliefs to know this. </p>

<p>Basically, the God, who is both male and female, made his first task to clone himself and give each of his parts freedom. So God was his entire self, but he was also his cloned self. His cloned self had almost an infinite number of personalities which each was given freedom. All these personalities that roam free as the Christ are perfect and magnificent. The union of Christ is basically what god looks like in a mirror. When the father God and the eternal son (Christ) perform an action in unison, you get the infinite spirit. The father is thought, the son is word, and the infinite spirit is action. All these gods are considered individual people but they are actually the same person in 3 different God modes. </p>

<p>There is a huge mixup. Jesus is a part of Christ. We humans stem from the eternal son so we are equally a part of Christ and godfathers sons. Remember, god is both male and female so don&#39;t let these words like father confuse you. </p>

<p>Jesus, which I am almost ready to study thouroughly, is a higher level being who worked his way up the 7 densities of the matrix very quickly. I believe he was late stage 4th density and had earned the right to create his own sector of the universe which is this part where earth resides. His task is to work with others within this universe to help advance the lower order of beings like humans. It is in his best interests for us to advance because it leads to his own advancement. </p>

<p>Jesus, by the rules of the matrix game, had to incarnate 7 times on any of his planets to show the teach the locals about spirituality and love. This is common for a creator son which is a being so forges their own universe sector however, most of the time the creator son does not get crucified by their own people. Sadly, we literally crucified our creator son but it served to fight the ego in the process. The ego I should the actual devil and it is not actually real. The ego exists as a fake creation of man that stems from the thought that we are all separate when in fact we are all the same person. Even the father himself and you are the same person although your present form of life stems from the eternal son. Jesus was crucified because the ego convinced the gov that a man of this much purity is a blasphemy to God. Nobody is this perfect and so he deserves to die. However, Jesus rose 3 days later and the government officials who were celebrating the kill jumped out of their seats in shock. This happening spread and the world realized something new in their subconscious minds which is that light defeated the darkness even though it appeared as if darkness defeated light. </p>

<p>Also, Jesus had to come down 7 times and earth was his last run. This is why he looked up on the cross and said &quot;it is done&quot;. It was in fact done and he had fulfilled his duty in the position he occupied as a creator son. The 2 major rules for a creator son is that they must incarnate as a male and they cannot have children. Each creator son has to follow the same challenges of the world he incarnates on so Jesus had to deal with all our issues including the ego. Although this can lead to a catastrophe, and although Jesus wasn&#39;t actually perfect, every single creator son has done an outstanding job in the history of this cycle of the matrix game. </p>

<p>The return of Christ represents a return of the human senses and the ancient 100,000 years of hate of hate will be replaced by an even more ancient love which is what we are outside of the matrix. We should have access to old Jesus himself once it&#39;s all said and done. The way to trigger the 2nd coming is with a powerful desire for peace and a love for all life which is actually happening now and this sustained desire will manifest itself into a worldwide reality. This is how the matrix works. We get what we want whether good or bad and finally we are understanding that peace and love are way better than power, fear, superiority, and control. Those things simply don&#39;t work and Jesus new mankind was very close to realizing this but he didn&#39;t know when as this information is kept from all beings except the father, eternal son, and infinite spirit. </p>

<p>One major purpose for the matrix is to feel the contrast of being a pampered son of god who gets anything he wants at anytime. This hardship and service to the planet will help you appreciate reality and so everyone who stems from the eternal son does it. </p>

<p>In a few months I will know much more about Jesus but I need time to research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting it from all the major psychic channeling that happened ove the past 100 years. The beings in the outside are sending the information into the planet through humans that trigger the channeling. </p>

<p>For example, a homeless man wrote an angry letter to God an
about his misfortunes and god thought (spoke) back. Another one happened in the 1920s where a sleepwalking man was speaking on universal secrets. That book is 2000 pages long and extremely complex. It was checked for discrepancies and didn&#39;t have any. These channelings are the only way to research the matrix. The information and wisdom inside are pretty spectacular and all the channeling are different, but they all say the same things overall. </p>

<p>Read about watchers in 1 Enoch or Jubilees? There might be fallen angels who descended to Mt Hermon and had children with women and taught things to humans and taught some questionable stuff. Interesting if there are still HUGE stones including a giant platform known as the trilithon next to there?</p>

<p>Consider what pops up with alien and UFO research? Reptilians and nordics and greys? See some interesting connections if seraphim are serpent like angels and iyrim/watchers are suggested to be nordic-like blonde angels? And it&#39;s rumored that greys are chimeras with insect hivemind characteristics bred to be used as spirit hosts or something like that maybe.</p>

<p>What if there is about to be an extreme amount of deception in the world involving a public arrival of fallen angels masquerading as good angels or benevolent aliens or both? Consider stuff like Daniel 2:43 and Daniel 8:10-11 and Daniel 11:29-31 and Daniel 11:38-39 with LXX comparison and concordance? 1) Seed mingled among mankind and 2) host of heaven coming to the planet and 3) mysterious ships showing up against a leader that was coming at another leader and 4) alien elowah ruling over many and the land being divided for gain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my research into the matrix, I do 100% believe in aliens now but not a deceptive spirit persay. This gets a little confusing and I&#39;m going strictly based on a year worth of deep research here but the main deceptive code (not spirit, its a built in code) is the ego. It rests inside of the left side of the human brain. Why in the heck does it even exist? Because it is the &quot;bad guy&quot; in the matrix game. </p>

<p>There are many reasons we are in the matrix and one of them is to experience what the opposite of paradise feels like. If humans didn&#39;t have the ego, they wouldn&#39;t make nearly as many mistakes as they have and so none of the bad parts of life would be experienced. These bad parts come and go real fast (90 years of life is really nothing in comparison to eternity). The goal of the game is to take all these people and steer them away from egotistical thinking into a mind set of &quot;we are all one&quot;. Once we do that, then the entire world transforms and humans enter the golden age. </p>

<p>You might think, couldn&#39;t we have just skipped all this pain? The answer is no because we all agreed to this before going in. This pain is what makes us appreciate absolute paradise because the contrast of pain really makes paradise seem so much more appealing. It just simply works.</p>

<p>All these people you see (Hitler, Clinton, the Reptilians) ect.. are all the players in the game who are losing badly by being egocentric and ruining the world. If they are evil enough, they will go to level 4 negative which is a slave planet. We are on level 3 now so its very different and in level 4 they can choose to take the high road and redeem themselves. In between each death, we spend a long, long time in paradise enjoying it until we get bored and decide to jump into the game. The game ends at level 7. Also, we have had our memory brought down to numskull level so we don&#39;t remember how to make the world work but our human self is going to learn more and more until it knows it all by level 7. In paradise, we have access to 99% of what we want to know but that last 1% kicks in when all the members of the universe make it to 7. </p>

<p>All those evil people, including the pedo child eaters are just people who are losing so badly, that they will end up on a slave planet on their next life which is very hellish. Then they have the opportunity to fix themselves or continue on and on from one slave planet to the next BUT in paradise, they are perfect and always have been blameless, loving and good friends as we are all good friends upstairs. </p>

<p>Try to imagine that we have to maintain the health of the planet to maintain good, blameless people for this to work. We have actually been failing hardcore for 100,000 years and yes, certain alien species are manipulating us while others are helping us. All of this will be brought to the light and one day, even those evil aliens will transform after enough pain is felt from their mistakes. Everyone will turn around but some people wait until they get to a level 5 slave planet before doing so. There is no level 6 slave planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this probably isn&#39;t inline with what you have in mind, but there is no historical reason to believe that an incarnate jesus ever existed, i.e. jesus is a myth. </p>

<p>here&#39;s a good, very thorough, examination on the jesus myth:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/jesus_myth_history.htm">http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/jesus_myth_history.htm</a></p>

<p>basically, the jesus as a corporeal son of god was a 2nd-3rd century creation, largely based, maybe entirely based, on marc&#39;s retelling the elisha/elijah story set around the time of the roman sack of jeurslem in 70ce (which was after jesus was said to have died) intended, and almost certainly understood, as a christian rebuke of the jewish revolt.</p>

<p>the 3rd-4th century roman catholic apologists argued with all of the other sects, most much older, that there was indeed a corporeal jesus. their letters are pretty funny tbh, they argue against the accusation that they are just roman mithraism influenced by judaism, based on the fact that roman mithraism and roman christianity had the same rituals etc, by having the devil go back in time to create mithraism to decieve christains and make them doubt their faith. mithraism was only invented centuries earlier by the devil to give heretics amunition against the true faith.</p>

<p>even paul only speaks of a relevatory christ, not a bodily christ. paul+jewish mystery cult+mitharism+buddahism+the alexandrite osirus/isis cult=christianty</p>

<p>a lot of conspiracies depend on the believer believing in christianity and that christianity is the answer or antidote, or that the conspiracy exists primarily to undermine christianity. </p>

<p>christianity like buddahism, from which it borrows heavily, is a slave religion. i mean that matter of factly, not pejoratively. </p>

<p>the underlying foundational premisese of both are:</p>

<p>the world you live in is sorrow, pain, suffering, and sin, and there is nothing you can do about it, but just be patient, because when you are dead life will be eternal joy, well-being, bliss, and purity. in other words, the only thing worth living for is death. but suicide is forbidden...because you can&#39;t have slaves offing themselves if you want them in the fields. death has to be earned one plow line at a time =)</p>

<p>both buddahism and christianity justified, fortified, and enabled permanent servitude of the masses. for me, the religious elements of conspiracies are like lace and frill dressing up the true motive of all conspiracies--power, greed, arrogance, and socioopathy. i think jesus and buddha are tools of some of the oldest, most successful, most profitable conspiracies.</p>

<p>this propbablly makes me sound like a santanist or thelmist or what have you. i&#39;m not. i just a sartrean, athiestic, anarchist. i assure you that the last thing i believe is &quot;there is no shame, there is no guilt, do as though wilt.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;17:5 Thus saith <strong>YHWH</strong>; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from <strong>YHWH</strong>.</p>

<p>17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.</p>

<p>17:7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in <strong>YHWH</strong>, and whose hope YHWH is.</p>

<p>17:8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</p>

<p>17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?</p>

<p>17:10 I <strong>YHWH</strong> search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.&quot;
-Jeremiah 17:5-10 (RNKJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as to the end of your comment: that&#39;s not how this works lol. Just do good and love bro. Defend the weak/poor, don&#39;t mock them. Don&#39;t cause pain/suffering. </p>

<p>Organized religion was never meant to be a thing(says it in the bible), which is were we get these silly ideas of wearing the right clothes and the us vs. them religious mentality. Don&#39;t fret, just be good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read about watchers in 1 Enoch or Jubilees? They might have descended to Mt Hermon and had children with women and taught things to humans and taught some questionable stuff. Interesting if there are still HUGE stones including a giant platform known as the trilithon next to there?</p>

<p><a href="http://qbible.com/enoch/8.html">http://qbible.com/enoch/8.html</a></p>

<p>Consider what pops up with alien and UFO research? Reptilians and nordics and greys? How interesting if seraphim are serpent like angels and iyrim/watchers are suggested to be nordic-like blonde angels? And it&#39;s rumored that greys are chimeras with insect hivemind characteristics bred to be used as spirit hosts or something like that maybe.</p>

<p>What if there is about to be an extreme amount of deception in the world involving a public arrival of fallen angels masquerading as good angels or benevolent aliens or both? Consider stuff like Daniel 2:43 and Daniel 8:10-11 and Daniel 11:29-31 and Daniel 11:38-39 with LXX comparison and concordance? 1) Seed mingled among mankind and 2) host of heaven coming to the planet and 3) mysterious ships showing up against a leader that was coming at another leader and 4) alien elowah ruling over many and the land being divided for gain?</p>
