        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are now looking at 5 (yes 5) goldman sachs current or former employees/partners that have been added to our new president&#39;s staff. </p>

<p>Steve Bannon - Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor (FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS/EXECUTIVE CHAIR BREITBART NEWS)</p>

<p>Steve Mnuchin - Nominated for Secretary of Treasury (FORMER PARTNER/SENIOR MANAGER AT GOLDMAN SACHS)</p>

<p>Gary Cohn - Top economic advisor (HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF GOLDMAN SACHS)</p>

<p>Jay Clayton - HEAD OF THE SEC (FORMER LAWYER FOR GOLDMAN SACHS)</p>

<p>Dina Powell - Additional Trump advisor (PARTNER AT GOLDMAN SACHS)</p>

<p>What I found interesting were trump&#39;s thoughts on his opponents relationships with goldman sachs, like his thoughts on ted cruz (during the republican primaries)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/690717760205275136">https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/690717760205275136</a></p>

<p>Trump supporters were really against Ted cruz having relationships with wall street like goldman sachs, as shown in this video: <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/02/cruz_faces_off_with_pro-trump_protesters_you_are_the_problem_wheres_your_goldman_sachs_money.html">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/02/cruz_faces_off_with_pro-trump_protesters_you_are_the_problem_wheres_your_goldman_sachs_money.html</a></p>

<p>What would they say to trump now?
This is a conspiracy. We are watching a president who was elected off the back of millions of Americans who ate up his comments on the corrupt and paid for politicians nowadays, he promised to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and get rid of these scumbags. I mean, he wanted Obama and Hillary&#39;s cronies out of the government so sketchy appointments like these wouldnt be made... yet here we are. I am saddened there is not more outrage from his supporters as he is slowly showing us he was just a normal corrupt politician all along.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-announces-5th-high-profile-hire-from-godlman-sachs-853078595918">http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-announces-5th-high-profile-hire-from-godlman-sachs-853078595918</a> (be careful, MSM but video is only 1:50 long and gets to all the points i just covered)</p>

<p>SPEZ: Figured I should add some notable appointments he&#39;s also made so far:</p>

<p>Rex Tillerson: Secretary of State (Former chairman and CEO of EXXon mobil 2006-2016)</p>

<p>K.T. McFarland: National Security Advisor (EXTENSIVE HISTORY WORKING UNDER HENRY KISSINGER)</p>

<p>2ND EDIT: There is a post regarding a trump tweet from 5 years ago on the front page of this sub that has nothing to do with a conspiracy, that has a higher upvote % than this post. This sub is about opening our minds to ALL conspiracies</p>

Unless of course we&#39;re all totally wrong and Trump is trolling us all. He&#39;s gonna end up a fucking liberal dove who likes to make money.<br/>

I whined about Carter and Ford (but that was more about them being on TV instead of my shows back when we only had 3 channels and if the president was on, you were stuck with him until he got done talking). I do have certain nostalgic fondnesses for LBJ and Kennedy, but even they had whine worthy moments. </p>

<p>Explain to me how you you check if someone is a muslim since as we were told all throughout the election &quot;muslim is not a race&quot;. This is going to lead to large scale discrimination of a lot of people who are not even muslim.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>&quot;I would do stop-and-frisk,&quot; the Republican presidential nominee said during a town hall with Sean Hannity in response to a question about what Trump would do to control crime. &quot;We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well.</p>

<p>At the height of New York&#39;s stop-and-frisk policy, officers were stopping civilians hundreds of thousands of times each year, often on the slightest of pretexts and disproportionately in minority communities. A federal judge ruled that the way New York police practiced the tactic equated to a “policy of indirect racial profiling.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Trump cant run a campaign and introduce policies based on xenophobia and fear then have people say &quot;who is he punishing?&quot; </p>

<p>Both of those are literally the policies he ran on, both highly unconstitutional that target largely minorities. How are his literal policies he campaigned on &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; ?</p>

<p>Please show me the data that substantiates the claim: &lt;officers were stopping civilians hundreds of thousands of times each year, often on the slightest of pretexts and disproportionately in minority communities&gt;.</p>

<p>Recent studies by police departments and researchers confirm that police stop persons of racial and ethnic minority groups more often than whites relative to their proportions in the population. However, it has been argued that stop rates more accurately reflect rates of crimes committed by each ethnic group, or that stop rates reflect elevated rates in specific social areas, such as neighborhoods or precincts. Most of the research on stop rates and police–citizen interactions has focused on traffic stops, and analyses of pedestrian stops are rare. In this article we analyze data from 125,000 pedestrian stops by the New York Police Department over a 15-month period. We disaggregate stops by police precinct and compare stop rates by racial and ethnic group, controlling for previous race-specific arrest rates. We use hierarchical multilevel models to adjust for precinct-level variability, thus directly addressing the question of geographic heterogeneity that arises in the analysis of pedestrian stops. We find that persons of African and Hispanic descent were stopped more frequently than whites, even after controlling for precinct variability and race-specific estimates of crime participation.</p>

<p>2) Not sure what Stop and Frisk has to do with Trump&#39;s policy to properly vet incoming persons?</p>

<p>3) The data you show for Stop and Frisk has to do with racial profiling in NYC.  It does show that some racial profiling occurred there. What exactly this has to do with immigration laws and Trump&#39;s proposed policy for vetting incoming persons or how Stop and Frisk in NYC is related to immigration is beyond me.  Do you think HLS is going to <em>frisk</em> people to find out of they&#39;re Muslim and then send them back to their country of origin!? </p>

<p>If so, that is really funny. </p>

<p>You ask how someone checks to see if someone else is a Muslim.  I don&#39;t know.  Maybe you ask them.  Maybe you look at their background.  Maybe you check Mosque records.  Maybe you look on facebook.  It seems like there are 100s of legitimate ways to check this.</p>

<p>And by the way, not saying that &#39;all Muslims are terrorists&#39;.  But saying that given the history of terrorist Muslims embedding themselves in non-terrorist Muslim populations in order to commit acts of terrorism, I&#39;d say that developing a sound, thoughtful, and peaceful way of properly vetting people to route out the nutjobs from entering the country is a good idea. </p>

<p>Not...make claims and let the claims speak for themself w/o providing evidence.</p>

<p>Hi you must be new here. This thread may have looked attractive to you and it would be easy practice. But no one says anything remotely positive about gold here, we actually think it&#39;s a pretty good indicator of CTR shills. 29 day old account with a post on the <em>bullshit</em> Megan Kelly and Alefantis interview? Cmon man this is r/conspiracy, the shit you&#39;re arguing is now identifiable as part of the controlled narrative, and it makes me actually want to believe the opposite of what you&#39;re trying to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who&#39;s &quot;they&quot; for you? There&#39;s liberals who treat white privilege as a way to feel superior to white people, but there&#39;s also liberals who view white privilege as inevitable since people will always favor their own race. Since America is mostly white, there would be white privilege. Or there are even liberals who don&#39;t necessarily believe in white privilege.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t like that Trump supporters are being all generalized as racists, so you choose to be the same thing back? There are liberals who think that Trump supporters are all racists, and there are liberals who recognize that there&#39;s many non-racist reasons for why people would vote Trump over Clinton. I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re being racist, I&#39;m saying that you&#39;re being hypocritical if you really believe in &quot;liberals are the most racist of all&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s their rabid and hypocritical approval of this that bothers me most. </p>

<p>No doubt, it would have been worse under Clinton. But to give Trump a free pass on this is abandoning everything they claimed they were against. </p>

<p>Thankfully, over on <a href="/r/asktrumpsupporters">/r/asktrumpsupporters</a> there&#39;s plenty of good Trump folk that are against it and disappointed. Have a read though, they too are under attack from the group that <em>are</em> making it into a new radical oppression group. </p>

<p>It was wrong when Obama did it, it would have been if Clinton did it, and it&#39;s wrong that Trump is doing it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more disappointed that his supporters are blindly flip-flopping on this than I am about him doing it as expected. That they&#39;ve convinced themselves of his taking points that they&#39;re &quot;experts in their fields and the best people for the job&quot; after years of campaigning against this <em>EXACT THING</em> is indlcredibly sad. </p>

<p>That so many free thinkers, in one fell swoop, stopped questioning authority because of the euphoria of some twice removed victory is even sadder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you don&#39;t because the most popular post in the subs history and <em>all</em> the posts criticising the mods decision to censor threads critical of Trump have been removed! </p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying &quot;the_Donald wasn&#39;t unfairly censored from all (it was), I don&#39;t see a single post of theirs complaining of it on /all today&quot;. </p>

<p>Remember people were saying &quot;I&#39;m glad t_d is gone from all, they&#39;re all lunatics and I don&#39;t agree with what they say&quot;? That&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what&#39;s being endorsed here. </p>

<p>Let me take the politics out of this and switch it with race to make it easier to understand. Imagine the hot_girls sub, with the only submission rule was that submissions have to be of women. Now imagine the mods censored submissions of white girls because they were black. Next, imagine if all threads calling this hypocrisy out were either deleted or filled with black men defending the decision saying &quot;white women are ugly, what&#39;s the problem?&quot;. </p>

<p>Do you really not see this? Have a read of the outoftheloop thread to see the sheer volume if bans, censorship and mods being fired/leaving in a coup. </p>

<p>If this is a pro-establishment, Trump-positive conspiracy only sub, fine. The takeover worked. But at least don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s the same old sub. Label it and set a rule that no Trump criticism is allowed. </p>

<p>To those of you who proclaim to be woke free/critical thinkers, you should be ashamed. You&#39;ve <em>literally</em> become establishment thought police. Sad. </p>

<p>its easy to doubt. its easy to laugh when the strong man stumbles or point out wjere the doer of deeds could have done better. the credit belongs to the man wjo is in the arena, who is marred by dust and sweat and blood, wjo comes up sjort again and again, for their is no effort withour shortco,ing, wjo at his best knows the triumph of high achievement, and at his worst, at least he fails while daring greatly so that jis place shall never be with those cold and timid souls wjo know neither victory nor defeat.</p>

<p>any pussy can whine about people that genuineky do their besr to help arent doing a good enough job. shutup faggot. either be part of the solution, or stop bitching. donald is a fucking blessing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets see if we agree. I am posting this here because our president is quietly appointing the biggest cronies in our country to the most important positions to cover their own asses. We are appointing a goldman sachs lawyer to HEAD THE SEC which was put in place to oversee wall street and to prevent (or at least attempt to) corrupt wall street dealings. Now we are putting our faith in someone who worked for one of, if not the worst big bank in our country to be objective if issues arise? How do we know that these appointments are not a secret set up to protect them from a big event that could be on the horizon? It seems too fishy and I believe it is a conpsiracy</p>

<p>I would be honestly very interested in hearing from some Bernie to Trump converts. I&#39;d like to understand what would sway them this way, as other than being non-traditional politicians with weird hair, I don&#39;t see any common ground between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie won 47% of the Democratic primary vote and 22 states with 0 name recognition, while calling himself a Socialist, and while the primary was extremely rigged against him by the DNC (a claim actually based within reality, unlike Trump&#39;s rigged election claims), but you don&#39;t think he could have gotten in? Seeing as to how much more effective he is at holding Trump accountable to his own words than the rest of the Democratic party, I personally believe he would have won.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t call him a loose cannon if he&#39;s doing the establishment Republican&#39;s version of a revolving door, just because it&#39;s what the &quot;corrupt evile cow&quot; would have done too.

    <div class="md"><p>Draining the swamp to me meant getting ride of potential conflicts of interest, what&#39;s to stop these cabinet members from showing favoritism to their respective banks and companies to others, or to there friends within the bank or company to their employees?</p>

<p>If he gets the Federal Reserve under control then the Goldman cabinet isn&#39;t as big a deal as I believe the printing and issuing of the nations money is a much bigger threat then who holds it. Furthermore, if he cuts back on regulations so smaller banks and businesses can breath again, then I have no issue with that and he gets my applause again. Also I don&#39;t hate ALL his cabinet picks, I love the Tillerson pick for example.</p>

<p>Tillerson I feel would put an emphasis on more American oil and natural gas production then relying on Saudi oil and EVER increasing wars in the Middle East. This way Russia can handle the Middle East since it has ample oil and natural gas reserves itself. Also this would deescalate WWIII as it would allow Russia to keep Central Asia gas reserves to itself and sort out whatever needs sorting out between itself, China, and India as to who gets what share of it all. This also allows certain western nations from further encroachment which will lead to more wars in the Middle East and elsewhere in Eurasia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, social politics within the US will crumble even further under him as president. Essentially it&#39;s a trade off between that and hopefully bringing to light the crazy corruption that&#39;s been happening under Bush/Obama/Clinton and further back.

    <div class="md"><p>as a trump supporter, i 100% agree with you guys. People should always be cautious and open minded no matter who they vote for. As for trump, i do not like him appointing the 5 sachs members at all, but i remain optimistic.</p>

<p>What other choice did we have? Hillary? we already knew how corrupt Hillary was so there wa sno chance i was going to vote for her, at least with Trump we have some hope of things changing. He&#39;s already bringing many jobs back to the U.S due to his great persuasion and communication skills, and him bringing Steve Harvey today along with other black leaders to try and help inner cities is fantastic as well. No way in hell Hillary would have done that.</p>

<p>We just have to wait and see how this plays out, i understand people&#39;s concern, but it&#39;s too early to make judgements imo.</p>

<p>That&#39;s great to hear, because unfortunately, many people won&#39;t be that mature. Trump could be one of the greatest presidents to ever live, and that still wouldn&#39;t change people&#39;s minds on Trump.

<p>Sadly, I think there&#39;s a lot of that, and on both sides. Everyone just wants to &#39;win&#39; and forgets that we all have to live here. </p>

<p>I read a quote recently about Sherman stopping his soldiers from cheering after the south surrendered. &quot;These are now our countrymen. We will not celebrate their defeat.&quot; I may not have that wording exactly right, but the sentiment is the same. We need to stop treating politics like sports because an actual &#39;win&#39; would benefit us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes perfect sense. I didn&#39;t choose either. I&#39;m do feel HRC was <em>much, much</em> worse, however. That&#39;s not even to prop up Trump, I didn&#39;t actually vote for him, mostly because I felt the way you still seem to... but now I am cautiously optimistic. His current war with the Intelligence establishment and media establishment is astonishing, like nothing we&#39;re seen in our lifetimes. The threat of assassination is as strong as it was leading up to JFK. And if he can get through this, we could finally see the CIA reigned in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why people are so worried about his cabinet... it seems to be a dislike of the business class, or a deep distrust, which is understandable. However, if these people are there to put their money-making skills to work for the country, we might see a wave of prosperity like never before. Only time will tell. For now, we can be glad we&#39;re not facing an HRC presidency with imminent war toe to toe with the Rooskies.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a quote that says something like &quot;You can&#39;t effectively judge a POTUS until 2 years after he leaves office, because it&#39;s only after roughly that passage of time can you realize the true effectiveness of his policies.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand waiting to judge what policies he implements, but most criticism of Trump hasn&#39;t been debates about policy, it has been discussion about whether or not he has met or attempted to meet the legal and historical obligations of the office before he enters.</p>

<p>Trump refusing to attend intelligence briefings in the time between election and inauguration is something that SHOULD be discussed critically.</p>

<p>Failure to adequately distance yourself from control of assets before they constitute a conflict of interest with your government job is something that should be discussed critically.</p>

<p>Appointing people to key positions who have an apparent conflict of interest is something that should be discussed critically.</p>

<p>None of these are things we need to wait two years to discuss... they aren&#39;t questions of policy and its fallout... they are questions of ethics and legality.</p>

<p>Were they banned for breaking the rules? (specifically 4, 5, 9 or 10 because I&#39;ve seen a lot people breaking those the past few days in particular)</p>

<p>Or are you saying people have been banned for anti-trump comments? I only ask because I&#39;ve never seen anyone get banned or even reprimanded in anyway for making anti-trump comments.</p>

<p>In the past 2 days especially, I&#39;ve seen a lot of people say things like &quot;Oh maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said that, I&#39;ll get banned for going against the narrative&quot; and I just don&#39;t know where it&#39;s coming from.  I could just be missing something though I suppose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I even got a PM from someone who was shadow banned saying they were just asking what was up with all the pro Trump posts.</p>

<p>Are mods able to shadow ban people? I thought that was an admin only function. Or did they mean they were muted or something? Again, I could totally be wrong. I just thought shadow banning is an admin only thing.</p>

He claims that he was talking about censorship in the sub (as was I which is why he PM&#39;d me) and that he got a ban resulting from that. I personally believe him, his post history wasn&#39;t crazy and he messaged me, one of the lowest no names of Reddit to give me his story. He also mentioned one of the corrupt mods on this sub but I can&#39;t say his name cause I&#39;ll just get banned no doubt, i can PM the name if anyone is actually interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump wants people who understand business and trade to lead this country, which makes sense to me. These people backed Hillary 100% and Trump has stated everyone he appoints will be following his lead. The difference is that if Hillary won and did this, she would be controlled by them completely, and she wouldn&#39;t put them in public office. They&#39;d just control the US from behind closed doors. What Trump&#39;s doing is purely transparent and is good.</p>

<p>The big difference is that people trust Trump, and Hillary would be indebted to them. Trump isn&#39;t. You&#39;re ignoring these large differences, and you are also drinking the mainstream media kool-aid that anyone successful (CEOs, banksters, etc) are all inherently evil, when in reality the people who are evil are those controlled by them -- corrupt lifetime politicians like Obama, Hillary, McCain, Romney etc. </p>

<p>If Trump doesn&#39;t owe them anything, they have little power. On top of that if they were going to be doing blatantly illegal shit, they wouldn&#39;t be put into public office. You have to remember that these people are much smarter than the general public. The idea that they&#39;re going to pull one over on America in broad daylight, while taking on risk of getting hit with corruption of public office is laughable. </p>

<p>Trump has a lawsuit pending, the attorney general gets a donation from Trump, and then the lawsuit is dropped. Sounds like a bribe to me (imagine if Clinton did this, you would think so too).</p>

<p>There are various stories of contractors doing a good job, then Trump not paying the contractors unless they take a far less than what is agreed upon. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/01/11/509168365/trump-d-c-hotel-contractors-say-theyre-owed-millions">http://www.npr.org/2017/01/11/509168365/trump-d-c-hotel-contractors-say-theyre-owed-millions</a></p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t even pay for his hotels. If it only happened a few times then yeah maybe the contractor was in the wing, but when it happens over and over....</p>

<p>They were declined for good reason. The Trump U case was completely politicized as slander, and Trump settled because it was a waste of time when he has better things to do, like set up his administration. He settled for far less than tuition and lawyers fees divided over the claimants and if they had a real case they would have denied it. Trump U never claimed to be an accredited university and I&#39;m willing to bet their contracts stated such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a Trump supporter for a while now, but have always had reservations about whether he would be compromised or whether he has been already.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I have to go with my gut feeling and it&#39;s that he likely has at least some level of independence and is a threat to the elite on some level. Otherwise the campaign would not have been as vicious as it was, and the coordinated attacks and betrayals directed at Trump wouldn&#39;t have been so extensive.</p>

<p>He may have had to make some unsavory allies, but there is definitely something that separates him from the globalist elite who backed the Clinton crew.</p>

<p>Even just the fact that he has created this movement and brought to the forefront certain narratives - this is a HUGE blow to the power structures and the global elites. I can&#39;t see why he would be &quot;allowed&quot; to start this fire if he was totally compromised.</p>

<p>So, they&#39;ll call him a &quot;hot dog&quot; or &quot;show off&quot; as negative insults.  The guy is who he is.  Why does anyone care what&#39;s his personality is like unless the attention he&#39;s attracting is not in your best interests?</p>

I&#39;m still suspicious of him, but I&#39;m cautiously optimistic. What do you think of my reasoning?  Why would he be so fiercely opposed by the obvious wealth and power that put itself behind Clinton? Why would he be given a platform that allows an obviously extremely anti establishment, anti globalist narrative? I understand there could be meta levels of manipulation, but I feel like there would be simpler and cleaner ways than getting Trump elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean? Im open to hearing about it.</p>

<p>But it just seems to me that the global elite have consolidated enough wealth and power that they are more or less able to push a singular agenda. Most of what I see from Trump is very counter to what are seen as globalist goals. I mean his rhetoric is very much in opposition. That&#39;s a big deal I think. Just speaking the words harms them as far as I can tell. How many millions have been shaken it awoken by Trump&#39;s message? Even if Trump himself doesn&#39;t believe it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are my thoughts, the old administration/power structure was there sure, they destroyed places like Syria by giving terrorists weapons, started civil unrest in the Ukraine, let banks rob people, spied on everyone, made indefinite detention an option, and many more things. We can all know that these are things they did do. There&#39;s proof. I understand that you have good reason not to like the &quot;old boss&quot;</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking. Trump has just filled all his high level positions to his other billionaire buddies. Bankers, Exxon ,you know all the villains. Just as an example, what caused things like the war in Iraq in the first place? Big oil! And Trump happens to be climate denier and will still be best buds with them. That&#39;s just one example. I see Trump as doing all the same old crap but now just doing it to enrich himself and all his buddies and people he wants to? So a bunch of new players in the game, but still same old bullshit game. And it&#39;s all being done so transparently. I feel like this is a perfect storm of stupid. Maybe in the long run this will end up making things worse then better...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I could ever believe that Hillary was a better choice (not suggesting you&#39;re saying that). I don&#39;t think any of the other candidates were as good of a choice really.. maybe Stein was the least compromised? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I honestly believe nothing can save the West from decline. I believe it will be very drastic, and Trump might be used as a patsy. He can&#39;t save us because we&#39;re far too weak and entitled at the moment, and in need of a correction. </p>

<p>But as a leader, I like that he&#39;s saying that we should take care of our own first, and get our own house in order.  And most importantly, I like that he at least claims to want a foreign policy driven by practicality, and not more of the same ideologically driven bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, really salty, Trump is completely incompetent, and he&#39;s just filling up the cabinet with cronies. At a rally recently, he himself said that Drain the Swamp was a &quot;silly phrase&quot; that he just used for the election.</p>

<p>Same with &quot;lock her up&quot;, he literally said &quot;that&#39;s what we said before the election, now that we&#39;ve won we don&#39;t really care, right folks? She&#39;s a good person.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;re also not supposed to take him at his word apparently, according to Kellyanne at least.</p>

<p>Keep putting your fingers in your ear for your god-emperor, but I hope you figure out you&#39;ve been conned at some point in the next few years.</p>

<p>The man speaks almost exclusively in lies. He has a ridiculously long track record of lying through his teeth on every little thing.</p>

<p>And what did Trump supporters do? Said that the fact checkers who were stating the <em>objective fact</em> that the words coming out of Trump&#39;s mouth were untrue were FAKE NEWS.</p>

<p>He has a long history of screwing people over in his business deals. There are several instances of Trump hiring contractors to do work for him, and then not paying them for it or paying them a small fraction of the agreed upon price, because he knew they didn&#39;t have the resources to sue him for it.</p>

<p>But it was <em>literally impossible</em> to see that this man would screw you over just as quickly, apparently?</p>

<p>There were lots of ways you could have known ahead of time if he&#39;d stay true to his word. You actively chose to ignore the things that would indicate as much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She spent seven years 1970-76 in the West Wing of the White House, working her way up to become a member of Henry Kissinger&#39;s National Security Council staff.[4] After the Ford Administration, McFarland studied at Oxford University[3] (BA, MA) in Politics, Philosophy and Economics,[citation needed] and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with concentrations on nuclear weapons, China, and the Soviet Union[3] (study toward PhD, all but dissertation).[citation needed] She returned during the Reagan Administration as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee staff. Then, in President Ronald Reagan&#39;s administration, she served as the speechwriter for Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger from 1982 to 1985 and later as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs and Pentagon spokesperson.[3] Lessons from the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and reflections of military officers with experiences from the 1970s led to a November 1984 speech by the Defense Secretary. The Weinberger Doctrine, as it came to be called, laid out the Reagan administration&#39;s policy regarding use of force: In essence, only go to war if it is in America&#39;s vital national interest, and then only to win.[5]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and those &quot;couple individuals&quot; are high-ranking bankers who absolutely knew about the corruption and did nothing to stop it. They screwed us over once, they&#39;ll do it again. It&#39;s incredible to me that people in this sub will pretend to be rational skeptics and then pivot and defend Don the Con. This country is full of morons, fucking Christ.</p>

<p>Tell me, do you think Trump was correct that there are millions of illegal voters, and that&#39;s why he lost the popular vote? That&#39;s the only tweet that matters, I won&#39;t bring up any of his other man child rants, but that tweet by itself should be enough for any rational person to realize he&#39;s an incompetent petty piece of shit.</p>

<p>And before you ask, yeah I&#39;m mad. Donny is a piece of shit, and he&#39;s gonna be running this country for 4 years, it&#39;s unimaginably terrifying.</p>

<p>No, it shouldn&#39;t. Be very careful about trump because I think this issue could divide us on this sub. However, if you visited this sub before the election, before DT even announced his campaign, we ALL would have been skeptical of this douchebag, and we were as soon as he announced he was running. Don&#39;t let them pit us against each other, stay strong and above all keep an eye on this guy Trump..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright fam, I posted this before, but this time I&#39;ll put a full disclaimer in the front, because you assholes downvoted an honest discussion question.  I vote Trump.  Based on the cost/benefit analysis I did, I thought he would be the best choice.  I&#39;m skeptical about picks like this, but I do recognize that it probably wouldn&#39;t be best to put someone like me (took 3 college economics classes) in the position.  I&#39;m clever and all, but I don&#39;t have anywhere near the knowledge to undertake the class, and I&#39;d bet most econ majors don&#39;t either.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real enemy here is central banking, and it&#39;s how the economy is controlled/fucked with. Obviously we would prefer that the whole system be dismantled, but I doubt that will happen without a scheme on part with Operation Snow White. The second best choice would be someone like Ron Paul, but that&#39;s nearly as unlikely as the first option.  </p>

<p>This leads me to my question: Who is a better choice? Not in the specific case of this one person, but who can do ANY part of government banking work better than GS execs.  </p>

<p>To clarify, I don&#39;t think this was a &quot;good&quot; choice. But does a good choice exist?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads me to the final question.  What the fuck should we want in such a cabinet pick?  </p>

<p>Not everyone they works for GS is a Satan worshipping baby killer. Some are competent people who know how the system works.
He&#39;s hiring thousands of people to work on behalf of him, while he has the final say. Do you know how NIRP works? Should he have hired backwood dumbfucks to come on board to address the dark money markets that launder and circulate cash for criminal organizations?</p>

<p>Bannon himself described a scenario i won&#39;t repeat that would result in an intra-central bank war. Anyone who is familiar with what he spoke up knew...</p>

<p>Prioritizing corporate profit is literally their job, so u can&#39;t fault them for doing their job.  If their job was saving lives from Malaria deaths in Africa you wouldn&#39;t fault them for saving the most lives as they can.</p>

<p>On this sub, people claim to be hip to the government and their tricks; yet, most of you can&#39;t see through the bullshit propaganda that is coming out en masse.</p>

<p>Almost all of the claims made against Trump during the primary were proven BULLSHIT.</p>

<p>Now, claims are being made ** without a shred of evidence**, and every one is eating it up.</p>

<p>You are playing into their <strong>divide and conquer</strong> strategy before he even takes office and proves what he can do.</p>

<p>Its really sad. We have the best sheep, don&#39;t we?</p>

<p>However I do work in finance and will not let blind ignorance hate Trump... </p>

<p>&quot;OMG OMG GOLDMAN SACHS IS SO EVIL OMG!&quot;</p>

<p>Trump is filling his cabinet with ITELLIGENT BUSINESS MINDS.. not LIBERALL ASS PHD PROFESSORS WHO HAVE NEVER HAD TO DO THE THINGS THEY TALK ABOUT..</p>

<p>There is a saying in my business when management makes a rule that isn&#39;t going to &quot;help the client&quot; on paper perhaps, simply will frustrate and confuse them when I have to explain the new rule ... &quot;management has never had to sit across from a client and do this job.&quot;</p>

<p>With that being said ... I understand this is a Conspiracy sub and I read the post yesterday about not buying in full to Trump because of cronyism etc ..</p>

<p>HOWEVER .. watching the Globalist canal bumble and stumble and try and stop with from
Russian hacking, to pissing on hookers to GOD KNOWS WHATS COMING NEXT... let&#39;s not look at the situation like a manager let&#39;s look at it zoomed out ... THE GLOBALIST ELITE HATE THIS MAN AND WANT TO DESTROY/DISCREDIT HIM.. let&#39;s not, through honest skepticism, help them make his life harder..</p>

<p>Pyrnnism Skepticism says &quot;Nothing can be known, not even this.&quot; I understand being skepticle .. but for enlightened ones like those on this sub.. I think it&#39;s clear who the enemy is.</p>

<p>Just how I feel! </p>

<p>We&#39;ve only been tenuously hanging on to fact based media for a while but now we&#39;re completely unhinged. This is at the level of 1984 double-speak. &quot;Drain the swamp&quot; actually meant &quot;fill the swamp to the brim&quot;.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s the opposite of a conspiracy. It&#39;s be done wide out in the open with high profile appointments. I guess...maybe we WANT to believe that it&#39;s a conspiracy because the alternative is really not good. There&#39;s terrible stuff going on that <em>should</em> be hidden, but isn&#39;t, it&#39;s right out there in the clear. You don&#39;t even need to look hard to see it.</p>

<p>Is it a conspiracy if it&#39;s public info that people all want to ignore. Is the public conspiring against itself? Fuck. Just...fuck.</p>

He has made a lot of promises that normal political bullshit won&#39;t be able too talk him out of when they fail to happen. I&#39;m going to give him 100 days.

    <div class="md"><p>On the surface, this looks damning; but, Wikileaks revealed that Obama&#39;s entire cabinet was picked from a list from Citibank. Therefore, I am wondering how much the Goldman Sachs relation is for Trump&#39;s appointments relative to former president&#39;s. 5 may or may not be an extraordinary without context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s their rabid and hypocritical approval of this that bothers me most. </p>

<p>No doubt, it would have been worse under Clinton. But to give Trump a free pass on this is abandoning everything they claimed they were against. </p>

<p>Thankfully, over on <a href="/r/asktrumpsupporters">/r/asktrumpsupporters</a> there&#39;s plenty of good Trump folk that are against it and disappointed. Have a read though, they too are under attack from the group that <em>are</em> making it into a new radical oppression group. </p>

<p>It was wrong when Obama did it, it would have been if Clinton did it, and it&#39;s wrong that Trump is doing it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more disappointed that his supporters are blindly flip-flopping on this than I am about him doing it as expected. That they&#39;ve convinced themselves of his taking points that they&#39;re &quot;experts in their fields and the best people for the job&quot; after years of campaigning against this <em>EXACT THING</em> is indlcredibly sad. </p>

<p>That so many free thinkers, in one fell swoop, stopped questioning authority because of the euphoria of some twice removed victory is even sadder. </p>

Seeing as to how much more effective he is at holding Trump accountable to his own words than the rest of the Democratic party, I personally believe he would have won.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t call him a loose cannon if he&#39;s doing the establishment Republican&#39;s version of a revolving door, just because it&#39;s what the &quot;corrupt evile cow&quot; would have done too.
