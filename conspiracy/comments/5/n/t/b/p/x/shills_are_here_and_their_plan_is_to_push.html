<p>Lets upvote the guy that&#39;s worried about hookers and the least fucked up accusation to get thrown into the echochamber but not raped children forced into prostitution and most likely ritually murdered.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be honest here. r/conspiracy has recently felt a little one sided. Bashing liberals and praising The President Elect. Often the posts feel like a side project of T_D. I like reading all conspiracies, even if I don&#39;t agree with them. Pizzagate is stupid (to me) but I still feel like it belongs in a sub called &quot;conspiracy&quot; and I enjoy reading about it. Pissgate is a valid conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing important to note is that everyone in this sub has always been for the most part polite and understanding of each others beliefs. Suddenly, shortly after the &quot;pissgate&quot; story came out, I&#39;ve noticed a lot more attacking and slandering and anti-trump comments. I&#39;ve NEVER seen anyone so strongly dismiss pizzagate in this sub until recently. It&#39;s so obvious that they&#39;re trying to divide us and pit us against eachother. And the scary thing is it&#39;s working. We need to figure out a way to combat this, and I think the secret is to remain positive, and accepting of everyone&#39;s beliefs. This way, anyone who tries to tell someone they&#39;re wrong or foolish is automatically a shill and should be banned. But then again the issue arises where if tons of shills start giving attention to a story (pissgate), how do we go about combating that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It amazes me that this many conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t more interested in this Russian Trump conspiracy.  Unlike pizzagate this one actually makes sense and there&#39;s A LOT of circumstantial evidence to support it.  Pizzagate requires you to apply some kind of code to an email between two people you likely don&#39;t know in order to assume that they are running a child sex ring out of a business with high foot traffic and high employee turnover.  Surely the smartest and most connected people in the country could come up with a better front than a pizza restaurant if they were running a child sex ring, don&#39;t you think?  Meanwhile, the Trump campaign, with more ties to Russia than there are grains of sand on a beach, benefits from hacking that all of our intelligence agree was performed by Russians.  All the while, nothing comes out from the RNC hack.  Funny isn&#39;t it?  A very thin and elaborate fabrication of a conspiracy comes out of the DNC hack and not a peep about the Republicans.  And don&#39;t forget that around the time of these hacks Trump met with Preibus for a come to Jesus meeting.  Prior to the meeting the RNC was largely never Trump.  After the meeting they warmed greatly.  What information does Russia have on the RNC?  Is the RNC being blackmailed?  If Trump worked with the Russians he can never say no to Putin, because even if the pissgate thing winds up being bullshit (which honestly, a lot of it is likely true) Putin will have evidence that Trump committed espionage for them.  At this point Putin essentially owns our country.  It&#39;s really the most reasonable connection of the dots we have.  And people here are ignoring it.  People here who are desperate to notice a conspiracy and to figure it out before anyone else are ignoring what may be the single biggest conspiracy of our lifetimes.  And why?  Because they trust RT, the english voice of the Russian propaganda department more than their own intelligence agencies?  Fucking seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, that whole post was one big strawman. It&#39;s even dumber when you read it a second time. You would agree because you&#39;re both in that delusional bubble. Acting like globalists will choose you over their other globalists friends is just about as stupid as it gets. Lets talk about the yellowcake uranium that the Clintons dug their talons into. Are they all Russian hackers or will your Left vs. Right mentality hop, skip and jump away from logic again at the expense of the children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree something is going on but i don&#39;t think it has anything to do with pizzagate, i think it&#39;s about deligitimizing trump&#39;s presidency (you can argue that trump&#39;s a fucking bonaparist moron, as i do, but you can&#39;t argue that he is not the legitimate POETUS). </p>

<p>the SCOTUS coup in 2000, which had the air of legitimacy at least due to the respect afforded SCOTUS before tgat decision, can&#39;t be emp,oyed this time around. so they&#39;re kind of stuck with the old faithful method.</p>

<p>the new gilded, stickied mega threads seem to be trying to sway opinion in order to soften us up for a coup. the current is a logical fallacy laden trojan horse if ever there was o e.</p>

<p>bothering to do this in a conspiracy sub, esp with such vigor, i can only think would be because this sub could be expected to jump on a deep state coup theory by assassination or impeachment faster than it jumped on the poor MKULTRA ft lauderdale shooting patsy.</p>

<p>the true left is pretty freaked out about the hints of coup, but from the CIA/deep state/coup/WW3/democracy/rule of law angles, not the pizzagate angle:</p>

<p>silencing pizzagate and the toppling of a democratically elected president are not mutually exclusive, i just think since WW3 has been in the pipeline for several years now, whereas covering up/silencing pizzagate is obviously only several months old, the wrench trump threw in the spanner is more about war than satanic pedophiles.</p>

<p>but since both likely overlap considerably particpant-wise it could be a two birds one stone thing.  </p>

<p>trump wasn&#39;t supposed to happen, and he proves khrushchev&#39;s observation about while smearing a modest man ruins him, it makes the immodest man stronger. trump is as immune to scandle as the clintons. the people behind PEEPEEGATE messed up by including the pee pee part, because it&#39;s all anyone remebers and nobody cares, because it&#39;s about a known pussy grabber. i think this terrifies the deep state, their greatest weapon in this country has always been blackmail and threat of scandle, esp perversion.</p>

<p>epstein wasn&#39;t just a child fucking, sex slave trafficker, he was a blackmail hub. trump flew on the lolita express, yet he also kicked epstein out of del margo for approaching another member&#39;s daughter.</p>

<p>if they had photos of him on the lolita express, they&#39;d have been leaked already. who knows, sometimes you get invited to a party that you only realize wasn&#39;t your thing until after you get there. his germaphobe rebuttal is pretty strong...just ask howard hughes. </p>

<p>but epstein taints all and can&#39;t be ignored so...who the fuck knows.</p>
