       Hey you came to a conspiracy sub, made a sloppy drunk nonsensical post in the effort of race baiting. Followed up you made threats of violence toward another user. 
So sure I will bite away. How much of the gubment cheese you getting on the reg? 
Stealing land is the best. I am white so yes I am super proud of everything about white history. Too bad there are not any other unclaimed lands we can invade and eradicate.

       Well. Do you need a pic?  All of us Dakotas (north dakota/manitoba) were chased up here by Custard, and you want us to be proud of that? Fortunately, we claimed land. Could you wiki that? Too long to explain to you white-moo. By the way? All of my hunny-bugs have been white-men ;D I said I look like Marilyn Monroe, did you even see my FB pic? Wow, sheesh, wish you were with me.

       Ooooh I get it now. 
I'm sorry I did not realize you were a lady. 
Why should I have to wiki anything you are making the arguments here. 
Stop saying we like you had anything to do with the past and get over the fact that fucked up shit happened. Stop shaming people for being white and even more so quit with the female card. 
I'm real proud that you fuck white men. So do I. 
What are you trying to accomplish here?

       Not in America but from another white person land were same thing happened. We didn't take them that was our great grandfathers that did that they were following orders from their chiefs who were taking their philosophical outlook from the bible and at the time the bible was interpreted as saying heathens have no souls and its ok to treat them badly.  I am sorry for that and i have rejected all faith and own no land. It does not feel good. I have family on both sides of that fite if yours are like mine its incredible that they lived that was a victory in itself most did not.

       Let's keep something in mind about American Indians and land acquisition.  The different tribes weren't all peaceful, groups staying within their own valleys and plains.  They fought each other, enslaved other tribes members, made treaties with different tribes to make war against other groups, expanded their territories through bloodshed, practiced genocide against other tribes, made peace with each other, made war with each other, traded land, sold land, stole land, and practiced every trait that they accuse Europeans of doing.  Europeans being better at it because of technology (steel and gunpowder, ships and cannon, wheel and wagons), numbers, and cunning is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.  If the Indians could have done it to us, they would have.  Atrocities and murder occurred on both sides.

       I find it interesting that the tribes keep talking about returning their artifacts (many with captured scalps) to preserve history and keep them where they belong with their "rightful owners" but I never hear about any returning of captured scalps of massacred pioneers or soldiers to the families of the people scalped.

       The true problem in our country in classism - which is the elite 1% exploiting everyone else. If we were smart, we would stop letting race divide us and go after the people who directed these atrocities in the past and who are destroying the world right now -- our parasitic, pedo elite.

       Funny that; people who lacked the intellectual capacity or drive to bother recording their own history now want to harp endlessly upon it.    Life is suffering, and some are better at overcoming it than others.  Looking at the sexual assualt/methamphetamine/incest/violent crime issues that persist amongst your demographic even to this date one needn't wonder long why they ended-up as they are.
