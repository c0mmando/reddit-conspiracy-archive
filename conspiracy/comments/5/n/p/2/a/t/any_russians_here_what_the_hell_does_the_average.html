    <div class="md"><p>WRONG. YOU HAVE UNWITTINGLY BECOME A PART OF THE NWO CONTROL. YOU HAVE SIGNED A DEAL WITH EVIL YOURSELF. THE SOVEREIGN STATE IS ALL THAT MATTERS. WE MUST FIGHT THE GLOBALIST AGENDA. WE ARE WINNING THAT FIGHT. FARAGE, BREXIT, TRUMP, LE PEN AND MORE. NEXT WE MUST FIGHT CULTURAL MARXISM. TRANSGENER IS A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH. THE FAMILY SHOULD BE PROTECTED. WESTERN CHRISTIAN VALUES MUST BE PROTECTED. PEDOPHILIA CAN NOT BE NORMALIZED MUCH LESS INSTITUTIONALIZED. DONALD J TRUMP IS A HERO, A PATRIOT, HE IS A BRAVE MAN WHO RISKED HIS LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD. PUTIN, TRUMP, FARAGE, LE PEN AND MANY MORE ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES AND REPUTATIONS FIGHTING THE NWO AND THEIR CULTURAL CONTROL MACHINE. HOW CAN YOU SAY FIGHTING FOR SOVEREIGNTY IS A BAD THING?! WE HAVE 8 YEARS TO TURN THIS WORLD AROUND AND RETURN POWER TO NATION STATES. JOIN ME. DON&#39;T UNWITTINGLY FIGHT FOR THE NWO. BREAK THE PROPOGANDA CONTROL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump, Le Pen, Farage etc are just as much puppets of the NWO as are Obama, Clinton, Merkel etc. They&#39;re just a little bit lower down the ladder from Soros, the Rockefellers, and Rothschilds. They&#39;re two sides of the same coin. Their aim is to get you to hate those who vote for the &quot;other guy&quot;, whatever side you think you&#39;re on, instead of them. But really they are all the enemy, and we, the regular people, are all on the same side. I don&#39;t blame you for falling victim to this trap because I feel victim to it to. Billions of people fell victim to it. But it&#39;s not or fault, so I forgive you as I forgave myself. We need to unite against them, not wage a phony war between ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you truly believe trump is on your side, then please at least stay skeptical. The 100% faith and loyalty to a particular person or party is what got the world into this mess in the first place. Don&#39;t fall victim to it <em>yet again</em>. If he&#39;s legit, then a healthy dose of skepticism will help with transparency and boost his credibility. But if he&#39;s not then skepticism will bring that to light. Just think how you would feel if after all the time and effort you put into supporting him he turns heel and fucks you in the arse just like all the politicians before him have. It would be emotionally devastating. Blind faith is dangerous. Just don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t regret your actions. Regret that he wasn&#39;t who he said he was if you&#39;re to regret anything. You fell victim to believing the lie that he was who he said he was, and that&#39;s not your fault. If you&#39;d had voted any other way you would not be the you that you are right now, today. Every action you&#39;ve ever made was necessary to get you to right here, right now. To get to you writing your comment , and me writing this reply. Do you regret being here now, knowing what you know, and thinking how you think? The past is the past, unchangeable, helpless and needless to regret. It doesn&#39;t help you or anyone else to regret it. It only holds you back. Accept that it happened, learn from it, and use it as a tool - a stepping stone - to get you to your next destination. Use it to plan your future. We can always reflect on our past actions and always find something new among them by utilising what we know now and thus gain new perspectives. Combine a bit of knowledge from now with a bit of information from the past and voila! You made some wisdom! Our minds are creation machines! Don&#39;t chain them down with regrets. Let them thrive in boundless openness. An open mind is a learning mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is the least of evils that we could have. Putin does have large popular support, he&#39;s done a lot of great things for the country, especially considering how bad of a state it was in when he assumed office. He is corrupt, no doubt about it, however that&#39;s the only way the country functions. You can&#39;t root out corruption just yet, it has to be a slow process, which is currently underway. The rest of world is corrupt as well, but it&#39;s more concentrated on top, as this and many other subs indicate. Our corruption is also in the middle, where middle men make money on bureaucracy, because sometimes when you want stuff done quick (doesn&#39;t have to be illegal), you pay extra. </p>

<p>You can see some Russians accusing Putin of heinous crimes and generally opposing him. I can&#39;t blame them, since they are right. But he&#39;s the necessary evil. He has authority, he has respect from those who matter. I&#39;m certain that once he&#39;s gone (election in 2018 would be his last term most likely), the country will go to shit, unless he has some plans in place. This year would be very important for us, because there are major shifts in the elite atm. We&#39;ll see how it goes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medvedev has fallen out of favour completely. Recently, one of deputy ministers close to Medvedev had been arrested for allegedly taking a bribe from Rosneft to make a favourable decision regarding the acquisition of Bashneft (large but not the largest oil company in Russia). Interesting fact: he&#39;s been arrested and detained for 6 hours without any legitimate reason, then after such reason appeared, he was trialed and everything. He was not jailed, just got home confinement. The whole thing was possibly just a scare act to show who&#39;s the boss. So this particular strategy won&#39;t work this time. There&#39;s pretty much a consensus among politologists that this is going to be Putin&#39;s last term, and I&#39;m not qualified enough to doubt them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s all very much unclear at this point. I&#39;m sure there are multiple candidates from different areas of the state like, so whichever group gets ahead in terms of influence, a candidate from that group would lead the country. Just so you understand, the Russian State isn&#39;t singular - there are multiple power groups that are in constant motion and there is competition among them to gain as much reach over Russian assets (companies mainly) and power. So whichever group prevails would most likely result in a successor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good topic... I always had a bad case of the Red Scare for most of my life... until one day I started expressing how dangerous and powerful and bloodthirsty Russia  was in a large chatroom... several people from around the globe corrected me... Russian speaking up about how it was miserable there for a lot of people... in no small part due to the misconception that they are some sleeping giant. It seemed honest and heartfelt... and made me rethink my beliefs and dig deeper. This was years ago... it is possible the room was infiltrated with communist disinfo agents... but I had a good long conversation with some english speaking russians and people who had visited. I came out if it feeling sorry for Russia more than being scared. </p>

<p>My story is entirely anecdotal, but your approach is good... This probably isn&#39;t the time or place for it... though. But maybe you could get away from reddit and check a less shill infested place to ask around. </p>

<p>How is a link to a real email &quot;real politik&quot;?  That&#39;s utter bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s saying the bar of evidence he&#39;ll need to consider someone disloyal and fit for public admonition is low.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he&#39;s saying the bar is at zero.  He literally said he would make an example of a suspected leaker with no real basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And his intent is to send a message and tighten the screws inside the organization (their concern throughout the conversation is the number of loose cannons rolling around), not to affect the coverage of the hacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This email occurred before even a word of hacking was being spread.  They new they had internal leakers.  I outright CHALLENGE you to find a single email prior to this where they mention a SUCCESSFUL HACK.</p>

<p>Because they haven&#39;t.  Even after they left the door wide open, letting everybody on the planet have access to their democratic database complete with all their SSNs, Addresses, income levels, answers to their political questions... Nope, not a single peep about any kind of responsibility for their TOTAL INCOMPETENCE.  They have to now toe the party line of &quot;Russian Haxors!!!&quot;, not because it&#39;s true, but because it&#39;s the only way the democratic party can survive.</p>

<p>&quot;As far as hacking - I think it was Russia. But I think we also got hacked by other countries and other people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure exactly. I do know that we teach people differently. History used to be regarded as the most important class back in the 50s. Before the 80s, news was just exactly as it happened with no commentary. Families would discuss these topics. Communities would figure out their opinions on them.</p>

<p>We have kids in college who are angry at the system, but don&#39;t know exactly who to be angry at, or what exactly about... Because colleges are more concerned with using all of that feeling in class rather than figuring out solutions... Or to protest the same way people did decades ago even though the avenue and environment has changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I have. Loads of them. You have to take the good with the bad though. You can hunt and peck through archives and find lots of amazing stuff; books predicting the cold war (or something like it) written before even Hitler took power; opinion pieces eviscerating the Fed from day one; but that&#39;s not really representative of what the media environment was like day to day. Fake news isn&#39;t something that sprouted in our lifetime. Ever read a William Randolph Hearst biography? And it&#39;s not just people today who are distracted with celebrity nonsense either. After all, Kim Kardashian is only this generation&#39;s Peggy Hopkins Joyce. And not every reporter was an H.L. Mencken. or an Edward R. Murrow. And even if they were, it wouldn&#39;t mean that the average person wasn&#39;t more interested in that day&#39;s pro wrestling results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your reasoning. The electoral college electors simply voted in line with the popular votes for their corresponding states. The problem with the electoral college, according to some (most?) people, is that the individual votes of Americans in some states have more clout than the individual votes of Americans in other states. For example, <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fairvote/pages/199/attachments/original/1450119297/2008votersperelector.pdf">the vote of an American in Wyoming is &quot;worth&quot; 3.18 times the vote of the average American for purposes of the electoral college, but the vote of an American in Texas is worth only 79%</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, yeah, any Russian influence leading to changes in popular vote by state could have very well changed the results of the electoral college.</p>

<p>What is more likely, that Russia did a magic trick? Or that the DNC is full of shit? Occam&#39;s Razor.</p>

<p>Now if you were to say &quot;Russia influenced&quot; the election, that is totally different.  And I&#39;m pretty sure every business, whether its a country or a corporation; influences as many elections as possible.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was wrong on one point but not really overall. Nobody can explain the question of why people were buying into the idea that we should arm the rebels. It was the poor op-eds I suppose, it was clear given the reported information that it was a risky proposal. RT made it simple as hell to see that, straight from the beginning, so I still give them props. They never ran some glowing op-ed about how we need to help the moderates win the war, they always questioned the veracity of the claim that there were any moderates to support at all. Much better IMO. At least I learned something from all this muck.</p>

You have CNN and others clinging to the moderate rebel myth when the main fighting force has been ISIS for a while. Even Jon Kerry admits that the US wanted to help Daesh overthrow Assad even if it meant a Daesh government. That&#39;s not the narrative promoted in the mainstream media sir.</p>

<p>I would be worried, but since younger generations are overwhelmingly liberal and white nationalism isn&#39;t returning, I&#39;m not.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, are you seriously trying to turn this discussion into racist thing? I mentioned &quot;white Nationalist&quot; because it is a fact that Russia and US are still &quot;white Nationalist&quot; Countries. Countries where the majority of the population is still white and Patriotic. Countries that the failing Globalists would love more than anything to take both the &quot;white&quot; and the &quot;nationalism&quot; out of, which a war would between the 2 would do. How can you say Hiccup after Brexit, Trump winning, and populist movements in much of the rest of Europe pushing to leave the EU as well? Rightfully so, Countries  should not be controlled by outside Bureaucratic interests and should protect their cultures and economies. Maybe we have a different idea of what &#39;liberalism&#39; currently is. Hopefully, we can both agree that it has lost it&#39;s identity somewhere along the line. </p>

Yes, a man was elected where less than 25% of all possible voters cast a ballot for him. Less people voted for him than the other horrible candidate, and his approval is historically low.

<p>I think it was a little of both. The new president was a very shady individual. According to some sources, once he became president his net worth grew 10 fold. There was also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Odessa_clashes">this event</a>. Pay particular attention to Trade Unions House fire. While unclear who was the real culprit, the interesting thing that there was no investigation and nobody was found guilty of it. Surely torching people alive, no matter which side of the barricades they are on, should warrant at least an investigation and people should be held accountable. There were also a number of laws such as <a href="http://www.osce.org/pc/151976?download=true">this one</a>. ctrl+f for &quot;domestic separatism&quot;. This is highly unconstitutional, even by Russian standards. </p>

<p>Basically, the new government was a pile of shit. Not only were they not loyal to Russia (which is what our higher-ups care about), they are horrible towards own people. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I have any valid info on this one, but my previous point should partly illustrate it. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I kinda think that it was the right move, however hypocritical it may be. The new government was illegally installed there (external funding was rather obvious). We always considered Ukrainians our brothers, a lot of people still have relatives there. It&#39;s a real shame what state disinformation does to gullible people. After the whole thing, real brothers from Ukraine and Russia were ready to jump at each other (was a witness of this myself, through friends). So the intervention was a) to protect our geopolitical interests (e.g. don&#39;t let Ukraine be a NATO country so that US wouldn&#39;t put their bases that close to the border) and b) to actually do something about unlawful government that was trying to force the country to assimilate into the West, which would never ever happen, but they for some reason couldn&#39;t see it. I don&#39;t have all the information about Ukraine, as it is very hard to actually find reputable sources, since we&#39;re so close to the issue and are very biased.</p>

<p><em>DISCLAIMER</em> I might also be very biased towards my own country, but that&#39;s the vision quite a few people share. So take everything with a pinch of salt</p>

On the flip side, Putin really wants to bring back the former glory of USSR and make Russia a world superpower once again (making it great again, you see). It might be a dangerous path, but it&#39;s hard to imagine Russia not striving for that. I think it&#39;s in our blood by this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been too busy these couple of days to actually know what people think of such a recent event, but it just reinforces the &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality that we&#39;ve got here. Basically a large chunk of people believe that everything that&#39;s bad in the country is because US is always plotting against us. It&#39;s actually makes some sense, because the sanctions (not the sanctions themselves, but counter-sanctions on import of certain goods like good cheese) makes everybody&#39;s life much harder. Economy deteriorates, the budget pillow (government savings) is practically gone, so shit&#39;s about to get down for real for us. I live in the capital atm and it&#39;s kinda alright here, but remote regions suffered quite a lot. </p>

<p>Despite the pessimism, Russia won&#39;t break like that. In the end, we, like a phoenix, will rise from the ashes new and strong nation. </p>

<p>Jokes aside, the country has been forced to change. The power elite is in motion. So hopefully, the change will result in better and more balanced economy and higher standard of living for all of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we straight up gearing up for war. Everybody understands that there&#39;s a different war going on, the war on information that is. We&#39;re generally pretty chill and peaceful people, minding our own business. I think the general mood is more like struggle with day to day stuff. Nobody wants war, nobody needs it. Unlike US, our GDP isn&#39;t that dependant on selling weapons and fueling wars to no end, so it&#39;s not in our interest to engage in any sort of conflict. Syria was a way to get rid of a lot of old ammo for rifles, cannons, planes etc. Not the main purpose, of course, but also worth mentioning. </p>

<p>For your second question it&#39;s definitely against the government. If you were to come to Russia, nobody would do anything to you. People are people everywhere, so the decent folk realise that. We&#39;re all getting screwed by the system. Some are more, some are less. But deep inside we&#39;re not evil. So if you try to show interest in our culture, our language, you&#39;ll notice that people would be very open to you, regardless of your nationality. Hope that answers your questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing related to hacking or US elections, but just a little observation.</p>

<p>My mother is Russian, my father is Lithuanian. I was born and raised in Lithuania, but spent the last 12 years living in London, UK. I tend watch Lithuanian news most of the days just to stay up-to-date on current events and I have noticed that over the past six months or so the amount of fear mongering about Russia has been ridiculous. </p>

<p>Every single day there&#39;s a story about Russia planning to invade the Baltics, story about how Russia fucks with freedom in the US, story about how we should invest millions into defence to arms ourselves against Russians.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a mass hysteria in the state that is fuelled by mainstream media. Head over to <a href="/r/lithuania">/r/lithuania</a> and you will see that there&#39;s thread after thread about upcoming Russian invasion and how we should all be ready.</p>

<p>The thing is, for a small country like Lithuanian, there are far greater and more important social and economic issues that actually matter, but media is diverting everyone&#39;s focus on some perceived threat of Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit off topic, but can give us some insight on the Lithuanian &#39;peasant&#39; party and their recent win? </p>

<p>Are you hopeful for the change of power, or is it similar to the U.S. where all parties are in bed together?</p>

<p>What changes can we expect to see in Lithuania? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peasant party won, but they didn&#39;t get the majority, therefore a coalition had to be formed and using your own words all parties are in bed together. </p>

<p>At the first glance they do seem a bit different and more progressive, but once again coming back to the whole rhetoric related to Russia, some of their policies are just ridiculous and very nationalistic. </p>

<p>For example to promote nationalism each year the government wants to gift schoolchildren a folk costume. Such policy would cost the government tens of millions of euros per year. Thing is, in years time the costumes will be outgrown and the whole exercise will be rendered useless. Think about it. When you was 14 did you really give a shit about wearing folk costumes?</p>

<p>Another example is the reintroduction of mandatory military service (conscription). All young males, after high school, will have to serve the country for 9 months. Now, I&#39;m not a pacifist and do value military, the fact is that there&#39;s no fucking need for this. Once again, millions of euros will be wasted on something that has no positive net effect for the economy. Germany, US, Russia and the rest of the states that have powerful military forces have developed economies where the military industrial complex creates jobs, exports and brings in tax revenue. For a tiny Baltic state shit like this is useless and the whole rhetoric behind this reintroduction of military conscription is that we need to be ready in case Russians will attack.</p>

<p>The country is literally dying. Young, educated men and women are flocking to Western Europe, States or Australia. SMEs that create most of the jobs in the economy are being raped by bureaucratic and archaic tax system. </p>

<p>Who am I to say this, but in my eyes this whole anti-Russian rhetoric in Western MSM distracts the majority from issues that really matter. We should be focusing on education, on the young, on creating jobs and empowering individuals that do so. We shouldn&#39;t be blowing millions of euros on nationalism and some perceived threats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an old Marine buddy that moved to Russia about 3 years back to help take care of his wife&#39;s mother. I talk to him about this a lot. He basically says Russians think we are all mindless idiots that don&#39;t think for ourselves. We just wait for legacy media to make up our minds for us. All of the Russia slamming our govt and legacy media are spewing is just laughable. At the same time, they are nervous because war is not fun for anyone.</p>
