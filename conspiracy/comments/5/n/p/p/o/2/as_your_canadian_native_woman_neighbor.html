       I'm a Native American who's tribe came from North Dakota (Sitting Bull), was chased by damned custard and hid by fucking English names. If you want to see a pic of me, just ask, but still. You should be proud that you have a man against the establishment. Fucking watch the film 'thunderheart' and feel glad again! Anyone, AMA

       I understand you're upset about this.. But I honestly want to ask what the intended outcome of posting this? To make white people feel guilty for the stuff their great grandparents did? Because if that's the case, it's not only ineffective because it distances you from the target, but also because it's hard to feel guilty for something you didn't do.

       Na.  Zero cause to be "proud" at this point.  This country and it's people have been absolutely burned
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too many times by
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too many corporate-owned, political con-men who've promised A and delivered
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       A for any even halfway intelligent individual to fall for that same trap again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know many will and have anyway, but even though Trump seems to have done a few things as of late that seem to be pointing in a "fight the system" direction, there is absolutely NO cause for anyone to get behind him, much less be "proud" of him at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm super glad Shillary didn't get in, but it's not like I'm necessarily championing Trump as a result.  Hardly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel he has to do and show a lot more than he currently has before he should get supported.

       I'd almost say that Clinton struck more of a nerve than Trump did...lol.  That's why Trump got in - cuz Clinton struck a nerve in the American public.

      <p>
       Granted it was the
       <em>
        wrong

       nerve that Clinton struck, but yeah.

       It seems to me that the reason that Trump got in wasn't because of something
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       did to deserve it, but because Clinton was/is in fact so God damned horribly, criminally corrupt and inept.  I think Trump might have lost against almost
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       other candidate that was out there that he could have gone up against. lol.  Seriously.  But Clinton ended up being shown to be
       <em>
        sooo
       </em>
       horrible that she literally shot herself in the foot.

       They're calling you a shill - which is someone who is getting paid to spread propaganda (lies) in favor of a certain person or cause.  You don't strike me as a shill, but there's certainly a lot of deceit that exists in the U.S. (and the world, for that matter) that perhaps you might not be as fully aware of as some others in this sub are.

       Yeah.  I can see you're new to Reddit.  Seriously don't sweat it.  Just ignore that person.  They'll go away if you simply don't worry about responding to them.  Ignore them.

       I'll be glad to answer you. the 'establishment' is the so called 'white people', and yet you must understand that I am not part of my grand parents who hated the 'white people'. However, Trump represents going against the establishment, which in my age, mean money. He struck our nerve. We answered.
