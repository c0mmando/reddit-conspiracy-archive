       So, if the news is to be believed the Russians have leverage on Trump because of secret videos of him paying prostitutes to piss for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no Trump supporter at all, but frankly whatever people do sexually is their business so long as the acts are consensual and of legal age.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are things that mainstream America might think is gross or taboo but so was homosexuality, interracial romance and even simple oral sex at one time, and aren't liberal progressives supposed to support the spectrum of sexuality?
      </p>
      <p>
       So as a fairly liberal anti-Trump citizen this seems weird. Like, what what's the big deal? Are the girls underage? Or Is this to distract away from pizzagate? Is Don being thrown under the bus to protect the dirt on the rest of them? (Dems and Republicans)
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       Okay so here's the story behind this:
/pol/'s trump general thread made these documents up for the hell of it and sent them to ricky wilson , who then gave it to buzzfeed. And buzzfeed , being the retards they are , didn't actually check any of the sources and now it's "BREAKING" news.
I'm fucking dying i haven't laughed this hard in a while.

       It's called confirmation bias.  They're looking for evidence to support their notions and found it, Q-E-D.  That's how our politicized intelligence community leadership works.  Remember WMDs?

       I'm not a trump supporter , if that's what you're saying. But if you're going to read the documents , and tell me that it's 100% real and not fabricated , then I really have to wonder what a bias can do to the mind.

       Just like with all the other criminal accusations, the deviant left is projecting their sickness on Trump.
      </p>

       No proof, no film, no name attached, no journalist would touch it for months, so of course CNN plays it as a last attempt to cause riots at the inauguration. If there was such a film, the skeezy Clinton Foundation that takes bribes and sold Russia our uranium would have bought it and played it in Times Square by now.

       This sub has been taking over by the pro-Trump circlejerk.  I'm not saying its not true or not, but the fact that the source was deemed so trustworthy that they gave Obama, Trump, and 8 high ranking members of congress a briefing on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since when has this sub gone off the deep end that Trump, a politician, can do no wrong and can't even be questioned?  There are blatant ties with Manafort and Putin.  The fact that Carl Bernstein (Watergate journalist) is working on this should at least make you question it, even a tiny bit.

       What we know:

      <p>
       1)Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign manager, has
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       indirect ties to Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Trump's campaign has deemed this worthy enough for a press release tomorrow, out of all the other allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)It was deemed necessary for Trump, Obama, and 8 high ranking members of congress to receive briefings.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)The source of the allegations is a former MI6 spy.

       5)Carl Bernstein is reporting on this.

       Threads like this are shooting down the questions before they're even asked without looking at them because they're anti-Trump.  You're right, this isn't r/politics, it isn't a pro-question sub either.  Looks a lot like r/The_Donald since you have people giving more credit to random 4chan posts rather than looking at the facts.

       Allegations that were found to have enough importance to bother PEOTUS, POTUS, and high ranking members of congress, and are important enough for Trump give a press conference over for the first time since the election.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On the same day that the President-elect was briefed by the intelligence community, the top four Congressional leaders, and chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees -- the so-called "Gang of Eight" -- were also provided a summary of the memos regarding Mr. Trump, according to law enforcement, intelligence and administration sources.
The two-page summary was written without the detailed specifics and information about sources and methods included in the memos by the former British intelligence official. That said, the synopsis was considered so sensitive it was not included in the classified report about Russian hacking that was more widely distributed, but rather in an annex only shared at the most senior levels of the government: President Obama, the President-elect, and the eight Congressional leaders.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       CNN checked out the whole thing, but not the president? Shouldn't he be briefed on the whole thing, and not just a summary tacked on to the end of a different briefing?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        CNN has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos, from which the two-page synopsis was drawn.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         his synopsis was not an official part of the report from the intelligence community case about Russian hacks, but some officials said it augmented the evidence that Moscow intended to harm Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's, several officials with knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.

       This thread could go on forever back and forth. People who already suck Trump's dick and believe in all these conspiracies favoring him will just dig a deeper hole in the face of any facts presented. We know this already, hence his successful election in the first place. It's a pointless argument.

       Pro piss. Song.
Listen little girl it´s near the hour 
Come with me and take golden shower 
Listen little slut, do as you´re told 
Come with daddy for me to pour the gold
Golden shower, it´s getting near the hour 
For a golden shower, 
I´ve got the righteous power 
All through my excrements you shall roam
Open your mouth and taste the foam 
Bend up and smell my anal vapor 
Your face is my toilet paper 
Golden shower, I´ve got the power

       According to the document, Trump had been collaborating with the Russian government, and Russia also has proof of Trump's behavior that they could use to blackmail him.

       I agree that the interaction with and blackmail by Russia is huge. I'd hope that hooker pissing wasn't all they have on him in order to make this stick, because as is my other point, people's freaky sex lives, so long as they're legal, are not illegal.

       I hope its true, Surely knowing he likes to be pissed on by women because he likes women being dominant is a good thing. The SJWs should be praising him right now. His sex business is his sex business. You try some weird things when youve been married for a long time. As long as its not underage like the rest of the fuckers we have in positions of power.

       Since so many are saying there's nothing illegal about this, makes me wonder how old the prostitutes were.

       if it's fake, why has no one posted a link to the 4chan thread? not saying they should of published it, but the thread would prove this, instead of wasting our time with theories...

       The unnamed source is a British intelligence officer whose credibility has, for the most part (according to the CNN article) been verified, the source originates from June 2016, and it's coming out of investigations into the Russian interference in the election. Basically, the source would suggest Russian intelligence community had damaging intel on Clinton and Trump, and appear to have strategically leaked Clinton's while keeping Trump's under wraps.

       Pizzagate is vacuous and totally unfounded nonsense, any careful reading of the supposedly 'damning' documents or other 'evidence' supporting it demonstrates that.

       With this, they planned to wage war on Russia. They would tell congress that Trump is a Russian puppet who would do whatever he could to keep Russia from releasing the  blackmail.

       Congress and the House would force a war. This and the "muh popular vote, you're illegitimate" meme was their ace. They spent the last several weeks on this and it was a whole lot of nothing. Looks like WW3 Plan-B is a failure.

       i mean i agree - strange as shit. so is a guy who goes to UPenn Wharton and then loses 1Bn, builds a business on media, and then trashes it. i'd love to see the original 4chan thread for this... would go a long way in disproving this - why has no one posted it yet is my question (just screencaps)
