        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>I wanted to explain why I stepped down from my position as moderator on r/conspiracy yesterday.</p>

<p>Ultimately moderating a sub of this size requires a lot of time and dedication, after much thought I came to the difficult decision of stepping aside, this was spurred on by a number of recent events as well my own current life commitments. </p>

<p>The sub continues to grow and the direction in which it takes should be as a result of user participation and subject interest, the current and future moderator teams should preserve this sentiment and act only as caretakers.  </p>

<p>I would also hope that the sub continues with its tradition of questioning authority and elected governments, campaign trail promises are easy to make but it should be the <strong>responsibility of everyone</strong> to make sure elected officials honour them.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is arguably at its best when the crowd pull together, investigate and expose political and corporate corruption &amp; crime, these areas are of increasing importance and relevance to more and more people. It is my hope that the page continues to challenge and to question wrongdoing and crookedness for the sake of everyone. </p>

<p>Interest in the fringe and esoteric conspiracy subjects on r/conspiracy has become less and less over the years, whilst I find this regrettable, it is what it is. The users decide what gets attention and which subjects become the staple of the page.  Such topics are still encouraged however.
Subjects such as the war on consciousness, UFOs, secret space programs and forbidden archaeology were always among my personal favourites. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nsd1z/am_i_the_only_one_who_has_some_nagging_lingering/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=conspiracy">To answer the questions raised in this thread</a> by  <a href="/u/sudo-tleilaxu">/u/sudo-tleilaxu</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/u/enfrozt">/u/enfrozt</a> is a highly competent CSS hand, he was added to the moderator list for the purposes of rolling out the new sub style. We had hoped to complete this earlier in the week but <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">/u/Sarah_Connor</a> noticed a few issues with the nightmode. All being well the page should be spruced up imminently. </p>

<p><a href="/u/enfrozt">/u/enfrozt</a> has helped us with this before, the current layout was developed by himself and me. He is not a permanent moderator - neither does he wish to be one. </p>

<p>This should answer any questions as to why he is currently on the moderator list. </p>

<p>The current team, led by <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">/u/Sarah_Connor</a> and <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> is in good hands. I know the sub will continue to move forwards and to garner attention, letâ€™s hope that any attention given to the page is for the right reasons. </p>

<p>I have no hard feelings towards any of the current team, they all have their own beliefs but are all equally passionate about the page, and they are all good people. </p>

<p>It has been an interesting sojourn but now is the time for me to move on.
This decision was mine alone. </p>

<p>I sincerely hope that the page can be impartial, open and a free space to discuss ideas.</p>

<p>You can all play a part in making sure that the page stays true to these values. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really glad to hear people saying this. Those topics are what brought me here and made this my favorite subreddit many usernames ago!</p>

<p>I always try to make sure I upvote those topics and contribute to the conversation. </p>

<p>Lately, there&#39;s been a lot of anger and hatred here. And not just toward the Clintons or Trump, but towards each other.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a shame that all the mainstream politics subreddits have become propagandize bubbles.</p>

<p>Real life has been so influenced by conspiracies that we end up simply using this place to talk about the truth in the face of widespread lies.</p>

<p>The fact that this almost entirely now is consumed by modern politics has pushed deeper and more important fringe searches for ancient truths to the wayside.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t. There is no reason that a user cannot create a personal (private) sub and implement the CSS there. once that CSS is &quot;perfected&quot; it can be moved over by an existing mod.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, it&#39;s a bummer to see you go. I was always pretty aligned with your and <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>&#39;s interest in some of the more fringey topics. (Can there ever be too much suppressed archaeology and hidden history??)  You have always been a fair mod who I always knew was acting in the best interest of this sub and it&#39;s users. You and your experince are going to be missed. </p>

<p>I hope you did not take my questions in that post too personally or anything, it was not meant to impugn anyone personally. I guess I have to admit I am probably a bit hyper-vigilant right now when it comes to what&#39;s going on in the sub. There is a lot of shit going down when it comes to controlling of different aspects of social media and I am a bit dismayed about some of the recent resignations from the mod team. I have concerns about the balance, bias and objectivity of the mod team at the moment and seeing you leave at this particular moment in time does not do much to allay those concerns. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has had a longstanding tradition of being able to see through the illusions of politics and has striven to be politically neutral and balanced, this has always been &quot;<em>Rule Zero</em>&quot; here and I always knew you understood this. Even though that may not be completely reflected in the current state of the sub, one could at least count on the moderator team to have the necessary balance to be a consistent and fair officiator of the rules. With some of what I am hearing now about recent moderators stepping down, this is a particularly unfortunate time to see you go.</p>

<p>Take it easy my friend, I wish you well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So long, Mr. Dong!  Thank you very much for all your efforts over the years.  We know modding is hard and we appreciate it.  I think this mod team here and CST are the best ones on reddit.  I&#39;ve been in this sub in some forms or others for 10 yrs, and I&#39;ve seen you guys to be the most fair, uncensored in reddit.  That&#39;s what makes this sub really good.  Thanks again and best of luck to you, though I suspect you&#39;ll still visit occasionally.  Because some of us, like yourself, also like the UFO / fringe topics and we know you can&#39;t totally quit us :)  Good luck man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. All of the comments in this thread also give me worry. I love the esoteric, war on consciousness, all that stuff. I would also like to see pizzagate be a top post until it is resolved. I don&#39;t think the two are separate, and most investigators into the occult would agree?</p>

<p>I have been a lurker since 2006 (granted I was young and for a few years I did not even lurk very much, and I didn&#39;t even realize I could create an account and control my front page until a couple years ago) . In the beginning almost every news post on r/all was conspiracy/skeptically oriented. I have seen many of the rises and falls, coups and suicides, that have led Reddit to where it is now. As sad as it is for me, r/conspiracy seems to have been going the way of the rest of Reddit. First it&#39;s the shills, long time users leave for elsewhere. Then it&#39;s the mods. The. It&#39;s. Gone.</p>

<p>See y&#39;all at Voat.</p>

<p>I was on VoAt for a while but stopped because it was invaded by white supremacists. It was getting to much, but I might go back.</p>

<p>Either way, we are (if we have not already) lost our freedom of speech. The saddest part of all is that people are still convinced that we have all these freedoms, when in reality, the Patriot Act says they can jail people at anytime for any reason without even letting their family know why.</p>

<p>Suspicion isn&#39;t allowed here.  As soon as somebody mentions anything about it their comments are removed and they are banned (apparently due to Rule 10 violations).</p>

<p>You were the mod who banned me 3 years ago for getting in the middle of a shill fight and I think I called you out for censorship. </p>

<p>You reinstated me a day later and flaired my account with the Owl (which I brought over to <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>) and got me to actively participate in my reality (here and IRL). Since that day I&#39;v3 lost a bunch of weight, gotten off booze and two prescriptions, and have never felt more clear headed now than ever before in my life. Sure, it was hard work, and it didn&#39;t really have a whole lot to do with an Internet spat and pixels on a forum, but it&#39;s a day I still remember.</p>

<p>Your knowledge, calmness, and clarity will be sorely missed. </p>

<p>When I grow up, I want to be like <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a>.</p>

<p>And I bought you gold you bastard, so you definitely owe me a beer whenever you get out my way.</p>

<p>Long days &amp; pleasant nights, old friend.</p>
