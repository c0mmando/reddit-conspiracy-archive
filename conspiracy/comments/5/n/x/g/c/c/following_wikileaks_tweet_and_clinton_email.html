       Reportedly Robert K Boyce said  “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to
       <strong>
        WikiLeaks
       </strong>
       or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”

       Also, the emails on Weiners laptop were quickly found to be duplicates after the FBI found out.

       How so? Truepundit literally published fake news like the " drone him" story. Amongst many, many others.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On October 2, True Pundit posted an article claiming that during a meeting of “State’s top brass” in 2010 to discuss how to deal with Wikileaks, Clinton asked of Assange, “Can’t we just drone this guy?” The site only attributes the comment to anonymous “State Department sources. ”The fact-checking website Snopes looked intothe True Pundit article and found their claim “unproven,” pointing out that the source of their purported Clinton quote was “a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification.” (It’s also unclear why multiple sources with knowledge of this supposed incident that took place in a meeting of senior State Department staff would choose to leak them to a minor conspiracy blogger rather than a credible news outlet. )

       There were 650,000 emails on the laptop.  The Clinton server had like 60k.   The "they are duplicates" thing doesn't really make sense.  I mean I'm sure it hade dupes, but almost certainly had much more

       I am leaning heavily towards the tweet about health being that the insurance file is near to being cracked open by those going through the block chain.  Once Pandora's box is open, Wikileaks loses all their leverage keeping any would be revenge back.

       Oh, when the key is cracked, sadly you will know it in a few awful ways.  If it is as half bad as expected, it will shake a lot of things up, maybe to the core.  You won't need to open it, people will be diving into it and releasing things.  It will be like in Ghostbusters when the laser containment unit is turned off and everything flies out,
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it will be boring.  No one knows.

       The containment analogy is a good one. That's basically what I expect as well. Just waiting for a Justice Department with people willing to prosecute.

       if the guy can be verified further it would be interesting why he wasn't widely publicised/followed up specificaly for "fake news" and being a "liar in chief of police" maybe that's overdramatic but I'm not that familiar with how it works

       There is nothing in the blockchain relevant to the insurance file, that's just nuttiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The insurance file has a meaning that can be understood from the medium, not the message.  Everybody blackmailed by it must know what it's about.  Lots of us know what it's about.

       1) they feel blockchain is key to atleast a part of the dead man switch and by the sounds of it, they feel it is the final part.

       2) JAs life is highly valued but the autists are on it and won't stop until they solve the puzzle.

2) That's OK, they are on a wild goose chase.

       You are correct with the blockchain nuttiness... no one would be trying to crack open the insurance files unless they valued entertainment over the life of Assange.

       I'm usually pretty up on the FBI stuff... and they just "updated" the vault... no new files but the added descriptions for some of the file drops that weren't there before... I think they are strongly hinting at more Bill Clinton stuff coming...

        This
        <strong>
         initial release
        </strong>
        consists of material from the FBI's files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005. The material is heavily redacted due to personal privacy protections and grand jury secrecy rules.
