       Hey Guys, so Mr_Dong and I have worked on the new style the last few months. Really it's just a subtraction of style, we didn't add much, just removed old style to clean it up a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us know in the comments any style issues, with screencaps and what browser with version you use.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Try to give constructive feedback / changes, saying "It sucks" provides us nothing. Compared to other subreddits our style is really old and needed updating and as you can see below, the changes are as minimal as can be
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Differences can be found here:

      <ul>
       <li>

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Less black, more light grey
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sidebar is thinner, and has bootstrap style buttons for the IRC / Confirmed Conspiracies

       I don't think we changed the fonts, what do you mean? I noticed in the screen shots I posted there might be an accidental change to "clicked" font, so I will change that back.

       Maybe it's an illusion, but I thought the font looked bigger and slightly heavier weight on the article titles.  It might be that the surrounding changes created an illusion of that.

       I get what you mean. It's cos now the tabs are centered in a big white bar whereas before they were on a grey bar that blended in with the header and were positioned to just hover above the box with the posts in it.

       Dislike it. Conspiracies are a deep dark rabbit hole. The theme should be black. The light colour just isn't right for the setting/mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should have asked users before if they wanted a change. Maybe we should have a popular vote on it by users (I kid...)

       The only black removed was the entire black border. The black border didn't look that great to begin with, so it definitely needed to be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a dark style, there is RES - Nightmode, which I personally use, but we'll see what the users say, maybe we can make the header / top menu darker.

       I don't have a problem with changing it per se, but I think regular users ought to consent to it or at least be told if we wanted a change. Just my 2 cents.

       Why build your base CSS to require night mode? That's fine if you don't visit any other subs, but it really is not the way night mode is intended to be used.

       a few years back, and was kind enough to rejoin the team on a temporary basis to assist with the roll out of this new CSS.

       We are very grateful for the work that he has done, and we very much appreciate his willingness to answer the call when the mod team reached out to ask for assistance.

      <p>
       In other news, due to IRL constraints, mr_dong stepped down last night from the mod team after many, many years of dedicated service to this community. mr_dong provided invaluable leadership throughout his time on the mod team, and he reflected the very best of what a reddit mod should be; dedicated, unbiased, and willing to lead by example when the chips were thrown on the table.

       There will be a larger post incoming from the mods with regards the current state of the subreddit; as it truly has been one hell of a week, after sustained brigades from subs as wide ranging as
       <a href="/r/outoftheloop">
        /r/outoftheloop
       </a>
       to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , along with an article in The Verge (which we were never contacted about for comment, wonderful journalism on behalf of the Verge! /s), were taken up by the usual suspects (
       <a href="/r/top">
        /r/top
       </a>
       ********ed and srd), who have always jumped at any opportunity to sow discord between the userbase of this sub and it's moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, we will address that situation further in the coming days; however, we did want to note that
       <a href="/u/enfrozt">
        /u/enfrozt
       </a>
       will be stepping down after 24-48 hours of troubleshooting the new css (if the need arises), just to settle any concerns in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers and thanks to all of you for keeping this community strong in the face of mounting opposition and persistent brigading.

       I mostly mod in
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       for oversight purposes, although the situation in
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       was entirely unfortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those unaware, I was a mod in
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       until a large influx of concern trolling by srd and elsewhere lead to my removal from
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       as a mod. This was truly unfortunate as every other mod of
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       was new to reddit, and the admins really dislike moderators who don't have a feel for the "nuanced and unwritten rules of reddit". The dislike arises from the fact that mods who are new to reddit don't truly grasp the suite of available tools on the platform, and manual moderation of questionable content (Personal Information in this case) is a very nuanced task. I wrote more about that situation
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5eis9z/the_admin_closure_of_rpizzagate_and_its/dacywfy/">
        here
       </a>
       , and concluded at the time that;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a perfect storm of mechanisms came together to engulf the sub in a conflagration; as an inexperienced mod team, with no understanding of how reddit admins apply their tos during maor "shit storms", simply let their guard down and received their inevitable third strike. With no presence of any automod rules to help deal with the large influx of doxxing following the NYT piece (You can read former reddit ceo Yishan Lee's comment on how press effects reddit operations here, wherein yishan makesit quite clear that during "press events", the influx of new users tends to overwhelm a community), the mods of
        <a href="/r/pizzagate">
         /r/pizzagate
        </a>
        were only one slip up away from being banned. Whether that slip up came in the form of a malicious actor intentionally trying to subvert the flow of information by having the sub banned, or simply a new user unfamilair with the rules of reddit as a whole, is, for the most part irrelevant as the sub was literally on its death kneel and there was nothing anyone could have done to save her.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To that end, the goons from srd and elsewhere realized that by sowing discord in
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       , and having the only "reddit savvy" mod removed from the ream, the sub would inevitably be banned for failure to comply with the standards set by the reddit admins (often silently implemented), over the past 10 years on this platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       A former admin of reddit (the admin who actually oversaw the
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       situation) has said that
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       most likely would not have been banned if I had remained a member of the mod team. And that is what is truly the most frustrating aspect of that entire situation; the srd goons actually managed to get a subreddit banned by preying on a community simply because the goons disliked the nature of the pizzagate investigation.

       So it goes on reddit I suppose :/

       I agree, your participation would have made it calmer.  It was a bad situation and emotions were high.  It appears to be thriving well where it is at, but it was a net loss to the reddit community losing it.

       Dong specifically wanted the MIB snoo gone, said it was a bit "jokish". I created that maybe 3 years ago. If the community wants a new snoo design, or a refurbished MIB that can be arranged, but I admit it was poorly done as I wasn't a graphic design artist at the time.

       I am quite emotionally attached to that snoo. Just yesterday I was reflecting on it being my favorite snoo on the whole of reddit. When I first noticed it I thought it was great that the mods had a sense of humor. But if they think it stops the sub being Taken Seriously
       <sup>
        TM

       I will just have to find a way to cope with my loss.

       Higher quality in terms of pixels. The old was was scaled images, which made for a really low quality snoo. New one is pixel drawn, so it's as high quality as can be in terms of pixels not being blurry.

       The old snoos (plural, there were 2 of them) had a nicer feel. To me this sub has always been about looking deeper into the shadows, where details are less clear. The old snoos embodied that feel. To new snoo looks all shiny and happy. Like I said elsewhere, this feels like change for the sake of change, no change for any actual improvement to the sub.

       The old style kind of looked like a site from the 2007-2011 era, which it kind of was. While the style is pretty much the old with higher res graphics. I think give it a week and you'll not notice the changes, and if you guys do changes can be made.

       I've always set my preferences to ignore subreddit styles because 99% of them are so full of extraneous junk. Even this sub had too much.

       The changes you've made makes it sooo much better and easier to read. I especially like the removal of all the black. Thank you.

       I like the YouTube icons on the side of the thread titles, not sure if you did that. Sometimes I'm doing something that doesn't let me do a lot of reading so I come here to find a video to play in the background and listen to.

       the style is all right. I have my likes and dislikes about it but it doesn't really matter. More than that I'll just say thanks for working on it. One thing though that seems to be more a technical issue than a personal preference is the whole header area in the top left corner seems all bunched together. Like the snoo graphic and the "reddit" graphic and the text to the right of it are all very close to each other to a degree that does not seem aesthetically ideal. Just a heads up
