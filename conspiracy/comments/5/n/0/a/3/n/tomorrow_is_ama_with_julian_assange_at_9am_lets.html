    <div class="md"><p>So are you are telling me that Hollywood/Cable TV/CIA has the technology to create 100% convincing videos from multiple angles of anyone they choose... but when they use that tech in movies they specifically make CGI people like young Princess Leia and young Tony Stark and young Micheal Douglas look fake so that people won&#39;t suspect that better CGI exists? They&#39;ve conquered the uncanny valley... but still insist in hanging out there in blockbuster movies. </p>

<p>So do many other people. Just look at interviews of same person over the time span. That&#39;s what cameras, lighting angles etc does to you. I guess it doesn&#39;t hurt to ask and I&#39;m pretty sure someone will ask in his AMA. The interview is enough for me. I simply do not believe they have perfected a technology where they digitized someone to near perfection.</p>

<p>that would be for the best.</p>

Proof of life isn&#39;t going to change that unless JA somehow magically shows up at the Ecuadorian embassy and starts doing RT interviews again, specifically addresses what exactly he&#39;s been doing the last few months, why he&#39;s not been using his PGP key, and why he hasn&#39;t tried to convince people he is alive if he is in fact alive instead of going to the fake MSM to talk about unrelated matters.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump started with as a millionaire and through his investments in real estate including golf courses and casinos he became a billionaire.  Hillary Clinton came into politics dead broke and became rich by making illegal weapons deals, overthrowing countries and stealing their resources, and pay to play politics.  Through Wikileaks we learned she has no smart ideas, is basically the result of a think tank of other stupid people including John Podesta and Huma Abedin.  If you can&#39;t see the difference at this point really I shouldn&#39;t waste anymore time on you because you refuse to see the truth.  Time tells all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See all you have is a bunch of opinionated bullshit..  Hillary Clinton is directly responsible for murdering hundreds of thousands of people and toppling countries.  If you can&#39;t see the difference between the two that&#39;s on you.   Luckily for you, as we rid ourselves of the cancer known as the past administration, life will get better for the whole world, non believers included.  And yes, Trump does have good ideas.  If you haven&#39;t noticed, since he&#39;s been elected we&#39;ve averted a nuclear war with Russia and businesses have been moving their operations back to the United States.  The stock market is at all time highs, and just today it was released small businesses are the most optimistic they have been since 1980.  Stop with the &quot;were fucked&quot; attitude and start thinking positive.  This is the most progressive movement of our lifetime and your throwing a god damned pity party.  Get over it.</p>

I don&#39;t disbelieve him - Russia is an easy scapegoat to distract from the content of the leaks - but I recall that in a 2011 appearance, when asked about Manning, he stated that the easiest way to protect a secret (e.g. the identity of a source) from state intelligence agencies is to never know it in the first place (and that WikiLeaks&#39; infrastructure is set up such that they don&#39;t need to know the identity of all sources). I&#39;d be curious to know what makes this instance different - did the source deliberately make themselves known, or did WikiLeaks ask in order to prove the origin/validity of the leaks?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>I just want your evidence that Assange is Mossad.</p>

<p>Simple: what has he published that is damaging to Israel? Nothing. What does top spook Zbigniew Brzezinski say about Wikileaks?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They’re getting a lot of information which seems trivial, inconsequential, but some of it seems surprisingly pointed. …The very pointed references to Arab leaders could have as their objective undermining their political credibility at home, because this kind of public identification of their hostility towards Iran could actually play against them at home.</p>

<p>Editor’s note:  The use of the term, “pointed” is key.  This indicates two classes of information and also begins building a hypothesis to support “intent.”  If there is “intent” in the leaks, then they are an intelligence operation, not a leak.</p>

<p>It’s, rather, a question of whether WikiLeaks are being manipulated by interested parties that want to either complicate our relationship with other governments or want to undermine some governments, because some of these items that are being emphasized and have surfaced are very pointed.</p>

<p>And I wonder whether, in fact, there aren’t some operations internationally, intelligence services, that are feeding stuff to WikiLeaks, because it is a unique opportunity to embarrass us, to embarrass our position, but also to undermine our relations with particular governments.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: Brzezinsky goes exactly there, indicating his belief that Wikileaks is tied to an intelligence agency.  This is a full and direct challenge to the credibility of wikileaks showing no reservations whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, to get those documents they would need to exist, someone with high enough access would need to then decide they should be leaked, I think Assange/Snowden is not a gatekeeper here.</p>

<p>Think about the type of person who would be involved in 9/11, if it was an inside job or something other than the official narrative (I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not this.)</p>

<p>You would have the top level planners (they&#39;re not going to leak shit, they planned it, benefitted, and would hang for it.) Then you have those who implemented it. If the implementers are not already dead, then the personality traits that make them willing to do the act also make them unlikely to leak that they did the act.</p>

<p>This is a fascinating article about a Cold War spy:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38261956">http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38261956</a></p>

<p>In the article they talk about the reasons he was selected was that he was &quot;... defiant, a womaniser, highly intelligent, prone to violence, patriotic, and a risk-taker.&quot; You can&#39;t just ask someone to be involved in 9/11 and hope they said yes and don&#39;t rat you out. You need a complex psychological profile that tells you this person will do it and won&#39;t rat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people do get distracted by 9/11. That&#39;s not to say 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag. It&#39;s just that people ignore the after effects of 9/11, which are possibly more damaging than 9/11. We likely won&#39;t ever know the truth of 9/11 or JFK, but we do know a lot about what those actions allowed. By focusing solely on the truth of those events, we miss out on the things that we can actually know about.</p>

<li><p>outright refused to respond to several of the most important issues with such a powerful and unchecked publication like WL (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uktsw/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9un6hg/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9umchd/">here</a>, for example), </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9umva5/">championed the citizen journalism on reddit</a> in spite of the <strong>constant flow of misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors</strong> that were created and perpetuated by these &quot;investigations&quot; that fail to live up to your alleged standard of journalistic integrity and ethics, </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9unh7o/">sensationalized non-stories</a> and actively <em>remove</em> context to be most damaging to Hillary&#39;s campaign,</p></li>
<li><p>passively <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uoxzw/">encouraged witchhunting</a> businesses with little-to-no evidence to substantiate the baffling rumors that you&#39;ve encouraged, </p></li>
<li><p>touted the anonymity of your sources without acknowledging the agendas you further <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9unf8f/">by never questioning the leakers&#39; political motivations</a>, </p></li>
<li><p>openly declared that you time the releases for &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ujqro/">maximum impact</a>&quot; as opposed to the &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uncbe/">get it out as quickly as possible</a>&quot; model you also claim to employ (i.e. intentionally waiting until after the primaries were finished to leak the DNC emails), </p></li>
<li><p>hid behind the claim that you never received any leaks about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uk41g/">Trump campaign</a> even though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uoawv/">Assange has said otherwise</a> (not to mention how incredibly convenient an excuse that is, since it&#39;s completely unverifiable; I find it nearly impossible to believe that <em>no one</em> leaked <em>anything</em> about one of the most polarizing figures of modern times, especially considering the breadth of the scandals in the mainstream media...you&#39;re telling us that <em>no one</em> who leaked these stories/tapes/whatever to CNN <em>also</em> sent any of it to you? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9urfmr/">Or was the information just supposedly not of interest or consequence</a>, while Podesta&#39;s family&#39;s taste in performance art and Hillary&#39;s daily musings with Huma were?, </p></li>
<li><p>refused to respond to people questioning your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9unl85/">merchandising</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uonlb/">supporting Trump</a> while still claiming impartiality, </p></li>
<li><p>claimed that you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ukyjx/">research and contextualize the leaks</a> before publications yet refuse to identify the sources and their motivations and do nothing to investigate the opposing campaign for a truly nonpartisan stance, </p></li>
<li><p>repeatedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9upfon/">failed to</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9umv4l/">accept your</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ul7e1/">direct role in</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ujodx/">the election</a>, regardless of your intentions or those of your sources. This isn&#39;t an academic exercise in open-journalism, this is a real life issue with real life consequences that require a level of nuance and counter-investigation to <em>truly</em> remain impartial.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s just to name a few of my burning questions/concerns. While I understand your stance on your sources&#39; anonymity may be genuine in your minds, your claims &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9up6ox/">Every source of every journalist has an intention and an agenda, may it be hidden or clear. Requesting the intention from our sources would firstly likely jeopardize their anonymity, and secondly form a bias in our understanding of the information we received</a>&quot; are inherently contradictory - every source has an agenda and a bias, but somehow WL and your choice/timing of publications does not? And investigating further would form a bias? Or...it would make your decisions more informed and, as you put it, contextualized...</p>

<p>You also say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9um1j9/">&quot;Working at WikiLeaks I know we do work with our submissions a lot for validation, <strong>how to present and where and when</strong>.
What we do not do is censor. We believe in full access to information and knowledge for all citizens. <strong>We do not think we are the gatekeepers of information</strong> and your right to know. We publish what we receive that is true, for you all to see. <strong>Your right to information shouldn&#39;t be controlled by others</strong>&quot;</a> yet you <em>become</em> said gatekeepers by default and <em>control</em> the information you release by dumping it all instead of picking and choosing as well as timing it for impact. </p>

<hr/>

<h2>So after all of this, my actual question would be how can we, as ordinary citizens (deprived of <em>your</em> internal communications that would verify your nonpartisanship etc), hold WikiLeaks as accountable as you would have us hold every other leader and publication?</h2>

I got a few weird posts about how it was just a wacky coincidence and the CIA no longer ran WTF and the real WL just appropriated the name... and there wasn&#39;t anything fishy going on... then the topic magically disappeared at some point later without any notification. </p>

<p>We havnt had proof of life in over 3 months but audio files only which are 500x easier to fake than a video itself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the 1 question we need to ask JA is the backup for statements he made over the past 5 years. If you look at the File Dump in October, there has been issues with what is true &quot;bombshell leaks&quot; as well as various moments he has walked back his &quot;Revelations&quot;, including his big &quot;Hillary Announcement&quot;. </p>

<p>This accountability ties into the Hash changes to the insurance file. The AMA should frame what sort of &quot;social contract&quot; wikileaks wants with its followers, so that people treat it as an information broker (like a Intelligence clearing conduit such as Eurasia) and less like a cutout/propaganda arm.</p>

<p>JA also needs to explain in some manner why he vanished off the grid and the failsafes triggered. Did he intentionally set the Deadman Switch&#39;s fuse on twitter or was it unintentionally activated when the Embassy cut off his connection.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wikileaks needs to determine how JA can verify his integrity to the public. In the case of websites the &quot;Canary Clause&quot; has proven effective. Going forward, whistleblowers will need a similar setup to ensure Wikileaks can not be tampered with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Julian said he respected the investigation? 
I use to investigate pizzagate when we first found the food code words in the Weiner emails. I heavily researched for a month and half until it really got to me. The shit they do to those kids are sickening. When ppl started learning about pizzagate is when I backed away. It fk with my head too much reading that everyday. 
I know something will come of it bc too many ppl know now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to know how releasing the leaks right before the election was not considered meddling in foreign politics, which he claims wikileaks is against. Why didn&#39;t he release it when he first got it instead of waiting and cryptically tweeting how he has an election bombshell. </p>

<li>Although they don&#39;t curate they do go through the leaks beforehand which can take a long time to verify</li>
<li>Out of respect to the leaker, who is in fact risking their life, they release it to generate as much awareness as possible.  Wouldn&#39;t it be a shame if this guy risked his life but the ppl of America had their heads to far in the sand to notice.  Look at how they handled Snowden.   Think about how we (the public) hardly bat an eye when say-the Saudi papers of the 9/11 report were finally released, or how nobody cared about mkultra, mockingbird, the Tuskegee experiments, gulf of Tonkin false flag, etc when they became public knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<p>The media/military/industrial/political machine would push it all under the rug and label the ppl who digested all of the information &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;alt right&quot;.  Meanwhile if the source were to be caught, they would face dire consequences for nothing.  </p>

<p>Wikileaks respects that and I think that is why leakers keep going to them-from the right and left.</p>
