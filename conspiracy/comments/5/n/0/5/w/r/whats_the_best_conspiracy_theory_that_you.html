<p>Freemasonery wasn&#39;t around until 200 years after the Society of Jesus was formed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a sense. Yet, the Knights of Malta of York Rite freemasonry link themselves back to this earlier time. Of course, they say it&#39;s all symbolic, there&#39;s no actual link...It&#39;s odd, though, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Do you know where the Freemasons came from? It&#39;s important to study history. The Templars were run out of most of Europe, and fled to the 4 corners.</p>

<p>Some went to England, and lodges were set up to house those who had lost everything. These retained, but modified many of the rituals of the Templars.</p>

<p>Some had ships, and took to the seas. They flew the skull and bones, but were more than mere pirates. They were smugglers, and even operated their own ports. Far more organized than mere bandits:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_haven">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_haven</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a modern society that uses the Skull and bones as a symbol, too. In 2004 both presidential candidates were members. Funny isn&#39;t it...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Freemasons were infiltrated by the Jesuits. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a look at some of the symbols used by the Jesuits. Kind of looks like a sun, and that cross sure looks like a cross I&#39;ve seen other places. Wasn&#39;t it red before?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>911 is not a conspiracy theory.  It&#39;s a mainstream accepted event that ~19 conspired to highjack airliners and cause bedlam.  It&#39;s already an accepted conspiracy.  The question is what is the true 911 conspiracy?</p>

<p>Why was there a media blackout of 911 footage for years after it happened?  Why zero focus on building 7?  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to jump to inside job and thus into &quot;you&#39;re crazy because CNN doesn&#39;t report this&quot; when a first baby step is:  there&#39;s no way those two planes took down WTC 7.  Next baby step:  there&#39;s no way they took down WTC 1 or 2.   Inside job or not, those planes did not take the buildings down.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no rational discussion over anything.  History was:  kill all the Muslims, Saddam is bad, OBL did it all from a sat phone and laptop in a cave.</p>

<p>Are we that stupid?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One that I&#39;ve been thinking is that somehow the rest of the power elite are grooming Trump to be a scapegoat for some sort of event that will befall the United States such as WW3 or another even bigger financial collapse that results in the ruin of the dollar. They&#39;ve made a large portion of the American population believe that they have &quot;beat the system&quot; by electing Trump. When the dust settles the media will wag their finger at the American people saying &quot;this is what happens when a political outsider gets elected,&quot; &quot;you asked for this&quot;. Thus the American people will resign to be a part of the system, stifling any questioning of authority. </p>

<p>Wrong terminology for me. I don&#39;t &quot;believe in&quot; anything. For some things there is a very high probability of them being true and for others there is a very low probability. And for others it&#39;s anywhere in between.</p>

<p>For me, one of the most important recent conspiracy theories with the highest probability of being true is that the 9/11 attacks were false flag events. </p>

<p>But if Aaron was such a genius, why does Reddit have such an obvious, glaring flaw as vote manipulability? (Just to name one &quot;flaw&quot; example).  It&#39;s a fatal feature that is coincidentally so useful for such a DoD project as mass-manipulation that it would be naive to think that DoD wouldn&#39;t be interested in duplicating Reddit if it didn&#39;t already exist.  Like Facebook.</p>

<p>Aaron&#39;s martyrdom, real as it may indeed be, serves the DoD in exactly the manner you use it, as a noble credibility shield for Reddit.  As for DoD research connections to Reddit, look into the <em>milieu</em> surrounding Reddit&#39;s previous owner Conde Nast.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of the surveillance programs, the manipulation of social media (and &#39;real&#39; media), the backdoors, the hacking, etc..</p>

<p>I just think you&#39;re taking a bunch of loose threads and trying to knit a sweater out of them. You have found a bunch of interesting points, but you somehow assume that they&#39;re all tied together.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely that Swartz and friends created an online program for discussion. Swartz was probably the most moral of them, but he&#39;s dead now. His friends over time were easily swayed and led down a bad path. There is vote manipulation going on, and it&#39;s used for government manipulation, but also corporate manipulation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the DoD makes much use of reddit and other social media. I don&#39;t think that means they created reddit. I don&#39;t even think they&#39;re the main ones using reddit to manipulate (thought they are definitely one of them.)</p>

<p>I think your argument is stronger if you don&#39;t reach so much. I think it&#39;s one of the main problems among conspiracy theorists, as by trying to offer this unified package, you gives a hundred and one ways to discredit yourself. Then people assume the true and proven parts of your argument are false as well. You end up making people more ignorant than before.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a classic trick of poisoning the well. Tell 90% truth, and 10% lie, and let that 10% discredit the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you ignored my points, most notably using Swartz again as some type of proof of Reddit&#39;s integrity.  Swartz did not apparently seem concerned with Reddit&#39;s fatal design flaws.  You do seem more concerned with me than with Reddit, but I&#39;ve learned to notice which posts of mine don&#39;t get ignored but bring defenders out of the woodwork, who usually have usernames reflecting fascination with anus functions in striking opposition to their deadly serious tone.  You share an overabundance of energy to discredit my position and a rather curiously subtextual (albeit non-anus-oriented) username.</p>

<p>I find that there&#39;s plenty of circumstantial evidence for Reddit&#39;s true provenance which doesn&#39;t even need to be as direct as <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">the Eglin AFB participation</a> to support my position.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s really underlying our disagreement (although it&#39;s interesting to see you accuse me of Poisoning The Well, a psy-ops tactic common to intelligence &amp; military, which would seem to suggest you&#39;re quite willing to leap to a conclusion beyond our Venn overlap) is an outlook about the fundamental nature of the <a href="http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-74-the-civilian-military-rift-in-american-society/">military-civilian rift</a> in U.S. society.  You see the military as a low-profile servant of civilian leadership with plenty of oversight and accountability to civilian elected officials, it would seem.  Whereas I see an illusory civilian bubble inside a military-controlled society who have already shown a willingness overseas to remove democracies and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-killings-assassinations-tear-into-iraq-s-educated-class.html&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZtorB-LvRAhXEzVQKHc_hCKIQFggdMAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG7oDI1F4Kt1o_B1zcrrmbPr_SERA">murder civilian leadership using well-researched profiles of individuals</a> from Op. Phoenix in Vietnam to Op. Condor in Latin America to the &quot;Salvador Option&quot; to Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen &amp; Syria.</p>

<p>Yes, Reddit is DoD.  Yes, there are many corporate players and others manipulating and astroturfing.  But the design is too social engineering-friendly &amp; inherently psychological-profiling-friendly &amp; surveillance-friendly to have been an accident of poor design.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, look, it&#39;s a new Swartz sidebar photo.  Not posted suddenly for any new relevant story link.  Just for old times sake suddenly.  So photogenic.  Couldn&#39;t have been more photogenic if he&#39;d been an actor who was cast to play his role.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen some good but vague answers here and so I will try and explain mine a little and cite some sources.</p>

<p>Vince Foster was murdered. This is the conspiracy that made me really believe that there was no difference between right and left and that the press is complicit in maintaining the status quo. To understand why I think this, it is necessary to do some reading. I first became involved in going down the rabbit hole on Foster&#39;s death by watching a Corbett Report video called <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-247-requiem-for-the-suicided-vince-foster/">Requiem for the suicided</a> about the death. </p>

<p>Then I started doing some reading. In looking for info on this case, I found some really great non-mainstream sources. <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/FOSTER_COVERUP/TEXTS/foster_texts.html">Hugh Sprunt&#39;s pieces on the Starr and Fiske reports</a> are indispensable reading on the topic as he uses the government&#39;s own documents to refute their insistence that Foster killed himself.</p>

<p>Also Patrick Knowlton, who is a very important witness, and his attorney John Clarke&#39;s <a href="http://www.fbicover-up.com/">website</a> is a really amazing resource and I would recommend reading further about Knowlton&#39;s story there. </p>

<p>Finally, I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.dcdave.com/article1/961127.htm">&quot;DC&quot; Dave Martin&#39;s six-part essay</a> comparing the Foster death to the Dreyfus Affair as really great for a broader, historical perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t a war-crime involving torture and human rights abuses, but planned obsolescence pisses me off. It&#39;s difficult to tell whether a product is designed for durability and sustainability, or for temporary compatibility with all the cool new softwares, that will soon become &quot;essential&quot; to any social person. I&#39;ve seen planned obsolescence described as &quot;De-emphasis on durability, to allow for innovation.&quot; I still believe it is wasteful, deceptive, and/or lazy.</p>

<p>It makes me slightly worried about the future of VR and AI. I still support emerging technologies, but I hate much of what the big smartphone companies are doing. I&#39;m not a commie, but those resources ought to go towards automation experiments that could benefit everyone, not better built in cameras for the updated version of snapchat.</p>

<p>9/11 did not happen how we have been told. A plane didn&#39;t even hit the Pentagon. There are MANY people who should be charged for their connections.</p>

<p>There are groups of power elites who meet very secretly (even the organizations we know about are uber secretive) and probably do things they don&#39;t want us to know about. These are the people who have real pull in this world. They&#39;re pushing what they themselves call the new world order. Some call them the illuminati. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook was a false flag. I don&#39;t think any kids died. I&#39;m as sure of this as 9/11. </p>

<p>The Holocaust didn&#39;t happen how we have been told. Many people died and it was horrible, but that doesn&#39;t make lies true. Saying anything about it makes you a neo nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SANDY HOOK!</p>

<p>I already doubted 9/11 and honestly thought the majority of people just knew the official narrative was BS. Just like everyone &quot;knows&quot; the JFK story is also BS... but Sandy Hook just killed me.</p>

<p>I heard about the shooting on the radio and fully believed every work of it. I cried for 2 or 3 days because it was so horrific. It affected me as if there were my own family who died. I was devastated. I started reading about it because I was kind of obsessed, and the very first parent interview I watched gave me the chills. It just spiraled from there. I spent a good 6-12 months just obsessed. I tried talking to people about it and friends would either just laugh in my face or get ferociously angry at me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s weird that none of my intelligent friends and family are even remotely willing to entertain that the truth might be different than the narrative. No one will even LOOK at the videos or research sites I try to show them. Really, will not even look. </p>

<p>I started keeping it to myself and the people close to me still make constant jokes about me being crazy.</p>

<p>One close friend grilled me about what conspiracies I actually believe, and I finally told him Sandy Hook. He became furious and was shaking and wanted to throw me out of his house. I finally convinced him to look at some of the evidence showing multiple crisis actor eyewitness and family members, and of the Super Bowl Sandy Hook choir, and I could tell it made an impact. </p>

<p>He couldn&#39;t refute it because it&#39;s so obvious if you just look. </p>

<p>But then it made him more mad because he couldn&#39;t understand WHY something like that would be staged. </p>

Then, one of the actors is John Candy. Well, John Candy is dead. And it&#39;s really hard for me to belive anything on the site.  </p>

<p>If your average person sees Sandy Hook and chemtrails, aliens, 5th dimensional beings, and lizard humanoids on the same website, they&#39;re automatically going to associate Sandy Hook with other theories that sound ridiculously absurd. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of &quot;conspiracy&quot; garbage. It got to the point for a while where my friends would tag me in any photo of chemtrails, even though I don&#39;t really know that I believe in a lot of chemtrail conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what happens: first you realize that Sandy Hook is BS, because it&#39;s so ridiculous obvious once you actually do some research.  Then, because you&#39;re convinced that&#39;s a hoax, you start wondering what other conspiracy theories may be true. After all, it&#39;s only human nature to be curious.</p>

<p>Then you research many other things, and pretty soon you start questioning everything. This is what I consider &quot;unplugging from the matrix&quot;.</p>

<p>Now that you&#39;re unplugged, you tell a friend or relative all of these things. Again, it&#39;s only human nature to share interesting things you found may be true. But then what happens? The person you&#39;re telling says &quot;you believe everything you read online&quot;, and then they shut you out completely.</p>

<p>You have to expose the truth very, very slowly. Only share one theory, the one you believe in the most and have researched the most. If that fails to convince them, they&#39;re sure as hell not going to believe anything else you present, so you might as well give up.</p>

<p>One caveat; while Sandy Hook is by far the most obvious I&#39;ve seen, everyone you tell will deride you as being &quot;insensitive&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; because children are involved. This will sometimes stop a person from looking it up for themselves, and thus perpetuates the illusion.</p>

<p>Hence, we have a nation of sheeple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is what happened. You are very wise. Got to the point where I&#39;d dived down almost every insane rabbit hole. I was no longer certain of anything. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t understand how anyone can be. </p>

<p>Exactly about Sandy Hook, because it was kids everyone thinks you&#39;re disgusting for thinking maybe it didn&#39;t happen as they say. I considered for a long time that I might be attracted to conspiracy because believing the &quot;reality&quot; narrative was too horrible and maybe my mind couldn&#39;t handle it or something?</p>

<p>But I learned these past years to keep it to myself. Most people don&#39;t  even care if the narratives they believe are true.</p>

<p>And when I find conspiracy-minded-kindred-spirits, they&#39;re usually wayyyyyy too crazy for me (i.e. Tony Hawk was a crisis actor at Sandy Hook).</p>

<p>All this election business brought me here to Reddit where I&#39;ve lurked for years, but never posted. It excited me that on all facets of the political spectrum, conspiracy theory is front and center. Unfortunately a lot of it is my parent&#39;s perspective: &quot;Well, the Democrats, Obama and the Clintons, are working with the bankers and Soros to ruin America,&quot; or my Liberal friends &quot;The Alt-Right is trying to make America white again&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so happy people like you exist. I&#39;m so happy most of the people on this board exist. I don&#39;t post often but I read ya&#39;ll every day and it warms my cold black heart knowing so many other people have also &quot;unplugged&quot;.</p>

<p>If you read he rest of post you&#39;d see that the people I do get to actually look at the evidence end up feeling the same way I do.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_(testimony)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_(testimony)</a></p>

<p>The Nayirah testimony was a false testimony given before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990 by a 15-year-old girl who provided only her first name, Nayirah. The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H.W. Bush in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah&#39;s last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيره الصباح‎‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by American Hill &amp; Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government. Following this, al-Sabah&#39;s testimony has come to be regarded as a classic example of modern atrocity propaganda.[1][2]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you ignored my points, most notably using Swartz again as some type of proof of Reddit&#39;s integrity.  Swartz did not apparently seem concerned with Reddit&#39;s fatal design flaws.  You do seem more concerned with me than with Reddit, but I&#39;ve learned to notice which posts of mine don&#39;t get ignored but bring defenders out of the woodwork, who usually have usernames reflecting fascination with anus functions in striking opposition to their deadly serious tone.  You share an overabundance of energy to discredit my position and a rather curiously subtextual (albeit non-anus-oriented) username.</p>

<p>I find that there&#39;s plenty of circumstantial evidence for Reddit&#39;s true provenance which doesn&#39;t even need to be as direct as <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">the Eglin AFB participation</a> to support my position.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s really underlying our disagreement (although it&#39;s interesting to see you accuse me of Poisoning The Well, a psy-ops tactic common to intelligence &amp; military, which would seem to suggest you&#39;re quite willing to leap to a conclusion beyond our Venn overlap) is an outlook about the fundamental nature of the <a href="http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-74-the-civilian-military-rift-in-american-society/">military-civilian rift</a> in U.S. society.  You see the military as a low-profile servant of civilian leadership with plenty of oversight and accountability to civilian elected officials, it would seem.  Whereas I see an illusory civilian bubble inside a military-controlled society who have already shown a willingness overseas to remove democracies and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-killings-assassinations-tear-into-iraq-s-educated-class.html&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZtorB-LvRAhXEzVQKHc_hCKIQFggdMAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG7oDI1F4Kt1o_B1zcrrmbPr_SERA">murder civilian leadership using well-researched profiles of individuals</a> from Op. Phoenix in Vietnam to Op. Condor in Latin America to the &quot;Salvador Option&quot; to Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen &amp; Syria.</p>

<p>Yes, Reddit is DoD.  Yes, there are many corporate players and others manipulating and astroturfing.  But the design is too social engineering-friendly &amp; inherently psychological-profiling-friendly &amp; surveillance-friendly to have been an accident of poor design.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, look, it&#39;s a new Swartz sidebar photo.  Not posted suddenly for any new relevant story link.  Just for old times sake suddenly.  So photogenic.  Couldn&#39;t have been more photogenic if he&#39;d been an actor who was cast to play his role.</p>
