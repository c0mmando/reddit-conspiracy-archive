       Esteban Santiago had his first federal court appearance today and this is what MSM is saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       Esteban says CIA controlled his mind and implanted voices in his head telling him to kill. MSM says by Esteban surrendering to the police after the shooting proves he knew what he did was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today's technology with super computers and artificial intelligence software has revolutionized the development. Most technology is classified and only a few patents registered. The latest was in 2002 when voice to Skull was patented. Today's technology enables a 2 way communication with the brain with voices and images (holograms). Pentagon says the brain is like a huge computer without a firewall. It's all about the electric signals going to and from the brain. This technology is according to the experts the most important invention since the nuclear bomb

       Did Esteban break through his MK Ultra after he killed all these people and surrendered? The MK assassins are suppose to follow through their program and self terminate after the operation is finished... this DID NOT HAPPEN. 
I.e Kanye West broke through his MK Ultra for 17 minutes  during his concert and spoke truth.

        Mk Ultra Explained
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no secret the government uses MK Ultra in Hollywood. Did the CIA use Hollywood celebs for their first group of guinea pigs before they started producing assassins to pull off mass shootings for their special "gun control" agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Steven Seagal knows the dark secrets of hollywood and he stands behind the Second amendment and Constitution. He believes the CIA is engineering mass shootings with MKultra to push harsher gun laws and eventually will take our guns away.

       A Famous saying is HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF...
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1933, the ultimate extremist group, led by Adolf Hitler, seized power and used the records to identify, disarm, and attack political opponents and Jews. Constitutional rights were suspended, and mass searches for and seizures of guns and dissident publications ensued. Police revoked gun licenses of Social Democrats and others who were not “politically reliable.”
      </p>
      <p>
       During the five years of repression that followed, society was “cleansed” by the National Socialist regime. Undesirables were placed in camps where labor made them “free,” and normal rights of citizenship were taken from Jews. The Gestapo banned independent gun clubs and arrested their leaders. Gestapo counsel Werner Best issued a directive to the police forbidding issuance of firearm permits to Jews.

      <p>
       I live in Texas and we love our guns! Last year there were a lot of military exercises in towns with tanks, and talks about FEMA camps etc  We feared obama was going to declare martial law before leaving office so everyone I know bought more guns and ammo and was literally ready to put up a fight.

       Let me ask you this... how did the government get the mass population to agree with invading Afghan and Iraq? 
Organizing the biggest false flag of them all... 9/11. 
After 9/11 majority of the masses agreed to go to war! 
History repeats itself... the government is turning to false flags AGAIN to help convince the mass population to agree...WE NEED GUN CONTROL!

       If you think The elites are gonna surrender and drop their NWO agenda bc Trump won... you're crazy. Trump has the right words but so did JFK and you see what they did with him. So, what will make a difference? Us... the people! We need to push the TRUTH out to the mass sheeple and wake them the f up.

       If the CIAs MKUltra and Voice to Skull program is exposed during the Fort Lauderdale shooting case, then the mass sheeple will wake up and their NWO agenda will CRUMBLE.

       EDIT: Many countries are involved with developing electromagnet weapons. They are like the new toy all the countries are Getty about. So, how far will they go? I've noticed  "weapons in space" in the news lately and always referred them to nuclear type weapons. What if the countries agreed putting Electromagnet weapons in space so they can control the whole planet?

       Trump is part of the elite ruling class, he is not your champion just another rich guy trying to help himself and other wealthy people. Before you come back with a political response do you have a link on those Kanye 17 minutes and anything else on celebrity MKUltra projects? I haven't heard to much about that and I am very very intrigued.

       I don't "trust" him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the main stream media has been going absolutely crazy over him... to the point that previously respected news outlets have taken enormous risks. The actions by the media (and the big business elites that fund it) seem to be actions of fearful organizations. The fact that these elements seem to be afraid is somewhat encouraging.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I've seen some interviews with Cheney... and he seems completely smitten by Trump. And even seems to boast about Trumps tweeting as a way to bypass traditional media. (I think he said something like "
       <strong>
        we
       </strong>
       don't need them anymore").... the "we" part of that sentiment scares me... as does the authoritarian and militaristic aspects to his politics and personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who the fuck knows though.  Alls I know is that I am glad we have:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Crapshoot that is trump (and the corresponding newfound vigilance and suspicion from the left)

       Thank you. This to me sounds like the only rational response. So many people here saying "duh, you've been duped! Trump's a billionaire!" As if there was any alternative. (And as if billionaire itself is any proof of anything). At the very least trump has rattled some feathers. This will go a long way to making the masses wake up from their 'government loves you' slumber.

       There was another option who the powers that be would not allow us access to. His name is Bernie Sanders. He would have beaten Trump. He would have dramatically changed our society. They would have assassinated him. The people might have woken up at that point. Then again ...

       Yeah its tough...part of me asks why the media would spend so much energy and money to slander him and his supporters, and the other part of me wonders if this just isnt a more intensified divide and conquer strategy...that self post on this sub (today or yesterday, forgot) about this election cycle totally eliminating modetates and  centrism and futher radicalizing both sides into a managable hegelian dialectic thats easier to control defintely seems to have merit... What better way to clamp down on EVERYONE than to convince the Black Lives Matter people that all white people hate them and visa versa.

       i had hopes that after this election that the left/right, our team/their team divide had suffered a fatal blow, but my hopes have faded into resignation. until people check that baggage at the door, ain't nothing good going to come of anything....i saw someone around here ranting a day or so ago about the evil marxist capitalists....a self loathing capitalist? a capitalist with a conscience?

       I think most of shady things they do is just to divide and conquer us as a nation. That has always ben their goal, because it is far easier to control everything when the idiot masses are busy bickering amongst themselves.

       I think the issue is people tend to group the "elite" as a single group, when in reality it's probably more like Game of Thrones, different factions jockeying for power. Trump is clearly from a faction with a different agenda than the establishment faction, but it doesn't mean their intentions are any better/more noble.

Rex Tillerson is in the oil biz and literally ran his own version of the CIA.   He'd never be in biz with trump, but for the cabinet, sure.

       HAHAHAHAHA. WRONG.

      <p>
       Trump received 40 million in 1974 from his dad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the USInflationCalculator, $40,000,000 is $195,823,935.09 today.

      <p>
       He is literally born with billions in today's money.

       He was born rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       He received 40 million in 1974 - that is $195,823,935.09 today.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are rich, it's way easier to make money than if you were penniless. Politicians can be bought off, companies can be bought, invest in real estate, be landlord, buy shares, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also gave to the Clintons, and it was revealed that he tried to bribe Jeb Bush, of all people, at one point. He's just like the rest of them but the Trump supporters just can't accept that fact.

       Also, debt is money. Pay off the debt, and cause deflation spiral. Everyone would be shitting themselves and US would be like Japan. The only thing stopping that from happening is the US Armed Forces which the US uses to maintain the global support of the Federal Reserve Dollar and Petrodollar status.

       I'm in total agreement with you. Running a country like a business is insane thinking. Pay-per-use police and fire services? Toll sidewalks? We are a society and should take care of each other, not constantly battle each other, in business or otherwise.

       Yeah and on the outside looking in on European politics where you're literally cutting off your nose to save face by letting a bunch of third world savages turn thousands of years of western civilization upside down so you can feel like you helped...that's the real lunacy.

       Let's not forget he was real buddy buddy will the Clintons before this, not exactly the "champion of the common people who fights corruption" the people with REAL power don't care who the President is, the two candidates in the US were not that far apart politically if you really look at what HRC has said in her writings and various speeches before the campaign, the media focuses on their differences to keep up the facade of a two party system, but we've gone RDRD and our foreign policy of military intervention and spending hasn't really changed in that time, our policies of defending big businesses haven't really changed either when you talk about things like Citizens United and corporate personhood

       Trump consistent? He's gone back on nearly every major campaign promise already. He did what he had to do to get elected just like the rest of them. "Build the Wall" and "Lock Her Up" became the new "Yes We Can", not a ton of substance in the campaign, big promises but no real plan laid out. "Start winning" is not a campaign promise.

       Do you still feel the same? Wall is being built, TPP is dead, nafta is being renegotiated or killed, factories is coming back, immigration policys is ongoing. He is literally doing everything he promised and it's only been like 12 days. Also she will be be locked up along with the rest of corrupt establishment.

       Yeah I still feel the same, he's one of the elites and he's not gonna change the system that made him that way, look closely at the deals he's made with corporations to keep a few hundred factory jobs here in the states, they've gotten yuge tax breaks, make no mistake they're staying here because it's a better deal, and while jobs are good what's better for the economy? A few hundred factory jobs or cheaper products that more people can afford? Tough argument for either side and idk enough about macro-economics to make a judgement so we shall see. As for the wall it's going to cost the taxpayer billions and will take 15 years to finish so there's literally no guarantee it gets done, the whole "Mexico will pay for it" thing won't happen, even taxes on imports coming in would only raise costs for the consumer, and even if the US government gets the money back what will assure that the taxpayer is reimbursed? Nothing. Even if they get the full amount back from Mexico it'll just belong to the government. Trump has shown I his professional life that he has only looked out for himself, actions speak louder than words so that's what I expect from him as a president. Finally, he's not putting anyone in the establishment in jail, if he does you can reply to this comment again and say I told you so all the live long day.

       i think the MSM are just in the seven stages of grief for having failed at the task they'd been paid to do, and which their hubris never let them doubt they could do:
      </p>
      <p>
       ensure trump was the rep candidate with unprecedented free coverage, and relatively mild commentsry during the primary, then knock him flat in the general. they failed as magnifcently as clinton did, and they truly seem to have never even seen it coming...a very emperor's new clothes sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is an elite. but he's one of the check writing class of elites, like all of the media mogals who backed clinton, not the check receiving elites like clinton and the MSM talking heads, who backed her (as much because their bosses said so as not).
      </p>
      <p>
       trump doesn't care about the little guy. if that was the only issue, no other elites or powerbrokers like the CIA would care. trump only cares about trump. that's why they care.
      </p>
      <p>
       the elites care about him because they know the check writing class is caprious, unruly, and unmangeable...they're always happy to get money from people, but they pull any strings attached right off and toss them back at the giver, unlike the check receivers, who tie those stri gs arou d their wrists like kabalah strings.

       And what does that matter to you? Where do you get your news from? The MSM is so freaking colluded with our corrupt govt it's hard to trust any of it. What's wrong with having a large group of ppl piecing things together? 
If you don't agree with it then post your thoughts. A lot of ppl in here are open minded, just like myself. I'm not saying this post is correct.. it could be completely wrong but atleast we are piecing it together instead of being spoon fed a bunch of shit from MSM

       Enjoy that thought process mate.  A non career politician who lives in the fucking moment is what we need.  Your feelings can eat a dick and that is what PC culture does it cuts you dick and balls off and makes you a cookie cutter shape.  This is literally divine intervention.  Mother fucking deus ex machina is real it is a law of the universe.  You are given exactly what you need at the exact time you need it, just wake up and feel your fucking body for once cause it is a super intelligent machine. You'll feel pain cause you're in ducking pain and sick but you spine and nervous system is literally a homeostasis regenerative machine.  You body is electric and what does electrocute do it puts out light.  You shoot and receive electromagnetic signals constantly vibe with the source and there are no worries. You're a ducking antenna and what you think is sent back to you creating feedback loops.  Wake the fuck up all of are divine children of the source.  We have lost our way and lash out on others because we aren't our true selves.  So please take deep belly breaths and know thy self be chase we all have something to offer in this plane of existence.  We are all Mr. Meseeks.  We are keys to a door and lemme tell you existence is pain and with how big our population is there is a lot of pain.  Find your purpose fulfill it and die.   No holding on to the gift that is given cause that attachment is apart of this sick society we live in.  Wake the fuck up we are all prophets, muses, gods, goddesses.  Whatever you are listen to and know thyself cause holy fuck we are reaching  critical mass here. Die a noble and honorable death and death will honor you.  Thank you thank you thank you.

       This is not directed at you but you touched an issue which is really hard to comprehend. What does the government, CIA, or illuminati have to gain by controlling someone like Kanye or other whacko celebrity?  Kanye has been crazy for years, he was always so goddamn egotistical, but his personality has always been off. The illuminati in hip hop really makes no sense to me, but apparently it's a thing people believe.

       I mean I'm not saying I believe it, like a lot of theories on here I find it really fun to think about and explore possibilities with a little imagination, now of course that's not to say there's nothing on this sub I actually do believe. As far as what they'd have to gain is influencing the culture and having someone under their thumb who is at the forefront of hip hop would be a huge way to influence a whole lot of people with propaganda that they probably couldn't reach otherwise. I'm sure way more young people listen to Kanye than watch the news.

       Higher power just means they get funding from Uncle Sam to do whatever they are gonna do. They are pretty much only accountable to themselves, so war just means they are trying to undermine the other branch for more power and funding to themselves since all the federal government cares about is results for whatever agenda they themselves are pushing.

       Using a VPN with Tor adds very little as far as I can tell. Main risks when using Tor:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Timing/traffic correlation attacks to determine the source of the traffic. If that's a risk you are facing, it's likely from a state intelligence service, and I suspect the same traffic analysis techniques could be used to find a VPN user (especially as using a VPN gives a more or less fixed endpoint that can be tampered with if required)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Malicious content (malware etc.) being added to requested webpages by compromised exit nodes. Using a VPN does nothing to prevent that - the exit node can still tamper with any unencrypted traffic, and if you are vulnerable to the exploit used it doesn't really matter how it reaches you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Accidentally revealing identifying information in traffic visible to the exit node - this can range from logging into a known account, or even just searching for the weather in a given town. The former is an obvious risk, and would enable any exit node operator to ID you if they wanted. The latter requires passive mass surveillance, but if you appear to be connected to a specific town and only, say, 20 people were using Tor from that town at that time, your anonymity is easily lost unless you are exceedingly careful. Again, the VPN doesn't really add anything - if those sort of tells are visible to an exit node, it doesn't really matter how they get there.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       I have no clue friend, i just go with zero protection so i have a degree of plausible deniability. It's probably dumb, but I'm not doing pizzagate level research or anything. I just keep an eye on this stuff in case something pops off and it'll give me a head start out of town lol. Also conspiracy theory has become a form of entertainment more or less. Like brain puzzles for the paranoid set haha.. But yeahh, i have little knowledge of encryption stuff. Seems like if somebody big enough wants in, they get in..

       Tor does not provide anonymity, it provides access. If you're behind a firewall, Tor can get you through it. That's primarily what it was originally intended for and what it remains useful for.

       Think of it this way. The gov't spymasters know every trick in the book. As a general way of keeping your info from being intercepted by third parties, TOR + VPN = best you can do. Data collection agencies and such have less access to your info. But the spymasters are using the same tech they use to track spies and terrorists to track you, and you can bet your life that they have cracked any commercially available way of hiding communication over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you worked for them, what would be a high priority? To infiltrate TOR. Then what do you do? Tap into VPNs. I read that using encryption and TOR and such actually makes you a priority target. That's why, in the cases of terrorism I've read about, the communication was pretty much in the open. They use WhatsApp and just create new email accounts as needed. They know better than to take steps to hide their communication because they know that's the best way to be targeted.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So Tor is useless for anonymous activity?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Useless is probably too strong a word to use, as malicious exit nodes should be part of your threat model even if intelligence agencies aren't a concern - malware or ads being injected into your traffic can be a problem even if not specifically targeted by anyone. That doesn't mean that Tor is useless, only that it becomes merely one part of keeping your anonymity online rather than a silver bullet. If you ensure all of your communications are end-to-end encrypted (e.g. by using hidden services), a bad exit node isn't enough to reveal your identity - it raises the bar to requiring active attacks on either you or the server, which is probably enough for most people (most people aren't going to be specifically targeted, and active attacks are easier to detect and take the appropriate action).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, and more importantly, if using an exit node to reach the "public" (for lack of a better word) Internet, NEVER do anything that connects back to your real identity. Sharing accounts between Tor and non-Tor usage is an obvious risk (even if the site uses SSL, there's a non-zero chance it leaks enough info. inadvertently to reveal the account name), but more subtle clues, such as looking at opening times for nearby stores, or even using distinctive writing styles or phrases, may also enable you to be identified by a determined adversary. If you take those precautions, the main risk in using Tor in from traffic correlation attacks, which have relatively limited success in identifying users.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least, Tor is an improvement over just using the web in the clear, and unless you doing anything that would attract attention (e.g. frequently visiting known terrorist-involved websites, or organising some sort of smuggling operating), the level of anonymity it provides is still useful (providing you know the risks and take the precautions necessary to reach your desire level of anonymity).
      </p>
      <p>
       N.B. - For Tor vs. VPN as anonymity tool, I treat Tor as more useful as it is a known quantity. It's deficiencies (compromised exit nodes etc.) are likely more problematic than an ideal VPN, but I know, more or less, what they are and can account for them if necessary. Setting up a VPN that doesn't leave a paper trail back to you (either by payments to a provider, or by hosting your own server somewhere) is non-trivial, and likely requires some degree of trust in the VPN provider (e.g. are they
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       not keeping logs?; are they a intelligence agency/criminal organisation front company?; the company may be secure and trustworthy but I think it's all but a given that
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       outgoing Internet links will be tapped and analysed). For avoiding the more public forms of surveillance (such as ISPs being forced to keep logs), they are a useful tool, but, as with Tor, are not a silver bullet.

       Working at soup kitchens I've met about 2 dozen homeless guys who say the CIA controls their mind. Now since almost every mass shooter is supposedly "controlled by the CIA" according to Alex Jones and beforeitsnews then that means the testing phase is done, yet somehow these absolutely useless to the grand scheme of things homeless people, whose ages range from 17-48 are all to this day controlled by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what I'm saying is, just because someone who is obviously not right in the head says they are controlled by the CIA, does not make them controlled by the CIA. Just because you connected some dots doesn't make those dots a picture.

       I like to view things as they are until new facts emerge that change that perception. Too many of these events are passed off as "the elite doing this because reasons" simply as a coping mechanism because a lot of people don't want to believe that these horrible things happen. There's no rhyme or reason, they just happen.

       The MSM isn't tightly controlled. It's controlled via access to lobbiests, access to information, etc. It's still private companies run by individuals, these people are entirely self interested and they'll jump ship the second they think they're on the "wrong" (aka losing) side of anything.
      </p>

       If the people you have to lobby are pedos, you'll cover up pizzagate. But they aren't about to place themselves between pitchforks and politicians and lose everything themselves.

       I don't think the people doing the mind control are a homogenous group. I think sometimes they do it to set up the other bad guys. Like NSA has their mind control killers, CIA has their mind control killers, Navy has their mind control killers, Airforce has their mind control killers, and the departments hate each other and keep trying to pin it on the other agencies.

       That's correct.  It is multiple groups with the same MO and the same technologies, jockeying to control the narrative.  Look very closely at who the perpetrators are in these events, what kinds of legal questions the events (inevitably) conjure, what kind of political backlash results, and even (in the case of back-to-back events) the timing and locations involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of information out there that can be used to create a map of the actors involved.  All it takes is a willingness to consider all likely possibilities.  Even though nothing can be known for certain, with the possibility of flase-flags, probabilities can be multiplied, and compared.

       It's like when there was the shutdown, there was a increase in no of events of TIs killing themselves, attacking others etc. to put pressure to restore funding. Like a woman transcriber who "God" instructed to go on a rant about the Founding Fathers being Freemasons during congress. The media censored the Freemason thing.

       Because it's unlikely that the public accept the reality. There are victims of these crimes that fight for credibility, supported by psychiatrists and experts that back the testimonies. Still ignored by media and officials.

       The process required for the public to accept or even doubt these new ways of domestic terrorism by state agents isn't proportial to the truth itself:

       Also, in case you doubt microwave/electromagnetic weapons can and have been used to harass here's the example of US officers victims themselves (Wikileaks cables about the Russian use of microwave weapons against the US embassy):

       I agree with you. I think he's compromised by the CIA too. where was he all of October-December? I think he was forced to make a deal with CIA to save his family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that's why they are exposing the CIA MK program  with this mass shooting? Bc they know the CIA overthrew Julian Assange. And CIA has too much power and needs to be taken down?

       Oh yeah I saw that!! 
So, Julian was an asset of the Australian CIA. What if he was able to break through his MK and started leaking damaging emails? 
I remember reading somewhere Julian always ran a couple microwaves in the Embassy to stop the electromagnet waves from outside to researching inside. 
I tired to find the article but I can't find it :/
Do you think he's back under MK after possibly being captured by the CIA?

       FOX News confirmed it's douchery by running a story about pi22agate being fake news without getting into specifics. I still think something was odd about that interview. What was up with Assange's gigantic hand? It was bigger than Hannity's head. And the weird lighting gets me excited for the XBox 2.

       From RiseUp's (wikileaks email service provider) warrant canary not being renewed, to the repeated ignored requests of a PGP signature and proof of life - wikileaks and assange are compromised. The extent we don't know...

If this happened in the 70s and we are here 50 years later... just imagine how far in advance they are.

       I highly recommend you check out Colonel Aquino's paper "mindwar" which discusses using existing technology to control the masses through EMF and ULF frequencies. The last paragraph in the PDF is especially disturbing and fits very well into your theories.

       Camp King was strategically located in the village of Oberursel, eleven miles northwest of the United States European Command (EUCOM) headquarters in Frankfurt. Officially the facility had three names: the U.S. Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel, the 7707th European Command Intelligence Center, and Camp King. In 1945, the place housed captured Nazis but by 1948 most of its prisoners were Soviet bloc spies. For more than a decade Camp King would function as a Cold War black site long before black sites were known as such—an ideal facility to develop enhanced interrogation techniques in part because it was “off-site” but mainly because of its access to Soviet prisoners."

       Wow. I knew Alex Constantine would have an interesting piece just as I knew you would. Still working my way through the links but your theories on ways to distinguish schizophrenics from people exposed to DEW is interesting.

       Thanks for your interest in biochemistry. I researched the biochemistry of schizophrenics and people who have paranoia and compared the histamine level of people with radio wave sickness. I don't have the time to summarize the papers on brain EEG, neurotransmitters, biopterin, minerals and vitamins of radio wave sickness and compare them with the levels in schizophrenia. The papers are in the wiki index of
       <a href="/r/electromagnetics">

       I didn't know that about AC. I have one of his books somewhere- I believe I loaned it to my ma- I think it's called "the covert war on rock" and details how various rock musicians were killed and harassed in Operation Chaos and Cointelpro.

       You heard about Chicago because it had a near 40% increase in murders. It's such a huge city with such a high murder rate. That's why gun control is on the table for them. I'm not saying I agree with it just felt the need to clarify that.

       maybe its all about gun control? how is Orlando and FLL related? To DWS it is just another "mass shooting" that requires more gun control. Perhaps like the laws in Chicago or DC where its impossible to own a legal firearm?

       Because this attack is all about israel/ jewish americans, and DWS is nominally representative of jews in the DNC (first jewish congresswoman in florida).  Ft Lauderdale is one of the most jewish places on the planet.  This attack is re-enforcing the ageless concept of jewishness that the jews are constantly under attack by forces (whether islamic or christian or religion in general, or state oriented, or ideologically oriented) seeking to murder all the jews.  Their victimhood and need to struggle together and persevere over their enemies is represented by every aspect of both the secularist culture and religion (this philosophy can be both positive or negative depending on how it's applied, but it unfortunately often applied to manipulate the jewish people and supporters of israel by appealing to a general sense of neurosis and personal/ ethnic victimhood).  This is how they keep jewish people pliable and demanding more security/ gun control/ "defense".  Everything about it is reactive.  Every tragedy gets a visceral reaction- "they need to do more to keep us safe from those who seek to harm us".
      </p>
      <p>
       So dws is representative of the clinton wing of the dnc.  she was perfectly placed.  she's the victim of the russians (much like jews consider themselves the victims of the russians/ soviet union) and is lending her support while re-enforcing her own need from the support of her people.

       Apparently they choose targets who are hard to turn into psycho bombs, like nice kids. Their system of torture and coercion is that good, they make it hard on themselves to get more data.

       Think for example that woman who tried ramming a barricade at the whitehouse and was shot. Just a young mother. Complained Obama was torturing her 24/7.

       THere is just sooooooo much info on it. All you gotta do is type( celeb illuminati) and a shit loads come up. It's literally a HUGE rabbit hole that would need a whole thread to itself. I haven't been down that hole for a long time so I wouldn't know which video that would be good for you to watch. I normally like long videos bc it touches base on everything I have questions for. 
If u want to learn about it... just search around on YouTube. You will be amazed with all you learn. 
I'll try and find a good video tonight and send to u if u really want but I don't have time right now.

       Also lemme tell you quote unquote people with bipolar are some of the most intuitive, loving, creative people as long as fear and delusion is transformed into something creative.  I believe bipolar is similar to how we actually are.  Undeniable powerful confident, unstoppable force.  They use their energy and drain it then they hit the low to recharge.  Our society likes labels and they are traps that ensnare your consciousness to only see thru the peephole.  But holy fuck our brain isn't processing the whole picture on default it is a information filtering machine.  But like a damned radio you can change what your attune with.  I prefer the sound of the universe the music of the spheres of you will 432hz is.  Also everything is alive and has a consciousness your fucking turd you just dropped is alive that toliet paper to wipe your ass is alive.  Consciousness cannot be destroyed on changed/transformed.  Wake the fuck up and see the reality for what it. Is.  A canvas that we are all painting on.  We are creators and the destroyers and it is fucking beautiful. Take your power back and be the witch you have always been.  Only you know the answers outside sources like me are retarded when it comes to practicality for your life.  This is mostly and exercise to get my consciousness warned up for that day and if the byproduct of that is a slightly tip in the scales then it is a collective win.  You are a fucking god we all are.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, YOU DONT STAND ABOVE OR BELOW ME.  Thank you for your time as this was most beneficial for myself. Also signing off here with my philosophy and that is be SELFISH thru SELFLESSNESS meaning you gain more when working/helping/ giving your self to something.  Use alchemy gain and lose stuff constantly, barter with the universe and never never sell you self short or to something not serving for you.  For if you ascribe to angels then you see they are your servants and guardians just open a dialog with them.    Peace you cheery cunts

       When? First time I heard this.

       I know they cover up the seriousness of these weapons. A KKK General Electric engineer created a death ray and microwaved his muslim neighbours. FBI claims non ionising radiation doesn't cause cancer (it does).

       He actually caught an ex FBI agent who ran a huge electromagnet weapon operation in Fort Worth/Dallas. He went on the news with all this info and tried took them to court. 
Which leads me to think, I wonder if his company was behind police shootings in dallas?

       Ground based radar is used in mind control you're right, but the range of these is huge. This is a global phenomenon, not just restricted to states with HAARP. Satellites are also used, and some believe mobile phone towers too.

       Wow, the FBI said they will contact Dr hall over the latest shooting? That's a good sign. At least they are looking into it.

       During my research I came across a lot of different types of mind control Weapons. It seems like those are the main type of weapons most countries are into these days. Is this why they want to put weapons in space? I always thought the "weapons" in space they were referring to were nuclear etc but I'm thinking it's radioactive weapons to mind control the whole planet.

       The thing is, though, that if anyone right now had the ability to "project images into a person's brain" they'd be so, so far in advance of the present state of neuroscience that, well, I'd feel pretty demoralized if I were a neuroscientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a MASSIVE difference between stimulating the skull to vibrate or subjecting one's auditory nerves to an electrical signal to produce the sensation of hearing something to actually decoding the stream of consciousness or the visual cortex or whatever to inject imagery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Science™ and its popularizers try to sell the idea that we're up to that stage already, but we're not. Not by a long, long, long shot. Uninformed people will just believe it. "Scientists can now read your thoughts with a computer!" – most would believe it, but it's total rubbish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best I've seen is that experiment where subjects were shown various images, their electrical brain patterns recorded, and then, using that information, they were able to predict with some accuracy which picture they were looking at (or perhaps thinking about) by statistically matching brain patterns to those already observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's clever, but it says nothing about how the brain encodes, well, anything. It's just a bit more sophisticated than looking at someone flushing red and predicting that they're experiencing embarrassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The brain is not "like a computer without a firewall" – it's a multi-dimensional, massively parallel quantum computer designed (in a way) by a process that is perfectly cognizant of every last detail about how this reality functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the world around you. That's not the world, actually, it's a concept inside your head. However, what you see isn't like a painting – or two paintings – it's a fully articulated, high resolution 3D raytraced virtual reality. Mostly, it's self rendered – one only need glance briefly at a tree to see it in its totality. That's because your brain
       <em>
        knows the fractal mathematics underlying life on earth
       </em>
       It only needs a little information and generates the rest procedurally.
      </p>
      <p>
       How all this works is completely unknown to current science, and I really doubt covert interests have much more of an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, all this is just to scare people into behaving. Like Santa Claus.

       GWB heard voices, to be exact he heard god telling him to invade Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       voice to brain using doppler technology with either ultrasonic or microwaves was known about, not common knowledge back then but awareness was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if some CIA clic decided to influence GWB with voices during his nightly prayers, it was not beyond the bounds of possibility.

       The things about listening to spirits is they are deceptive and most likely false.  They manipulate and do their bidding in delusion and fear.  Your true inner voice is thee only thing to listen to.  Find it listen and heal yourself.  You have a purpose and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  If you don't do what your soul wants then enjoy the endless cycle.   A lot of religion has taken our power away but we are all manifestations of God consciousness in the physical.  We have to bear pain because pain and beauty are one and the same.  I thank you because your body is in severe pain mentally/physically and once you recognize it your body will prioritize the pain and allow itself to heal.  Don't let anyone tell you other wise.  We are fucking gods. We are the source experiencing itself.  Fuck labels and duck this sick society most of have been molded by.  Hug your mom, forgive cause t frees you not the other person, fuck something, love something.  You're not gonna change the world by trying to. You must change it by changing your own reality and that will manifest into the whole collective than you'll ever realize.  Fear is a weak emotion but is the best fuel in the world. Fuck your sentence structure cause consciousness stream is the only way to blow off steam.

       Yeah but Bush's supporters were all big fans of GWB's claims that God was talking to him. There really doesn't need to be any more complex an explanation than that. People were willing to gobble it up, therefore he said it.

       There are countless people who believe in God and say they hear him all the time. GWB said he heard God tell him to invade. It wasn't God, or the CIA, or the FBI or NSA. It was his own voice or worse, duck Cheney.

       I know it's a little funky to recommend people take large amounts of psychedelics when you aren't willing to yourself but if anything it humanizes him. If you have ever heard his brother Dennis talk about it I get the vibe that he felt that not disclosing his shroom fears was necessary to continue his public persona as a PR rep for the mushroom. I don't really think it discounts any of his ideas beyond proving that no matter how experienced you are with psychs it's always possible to spiral out.

       Well, it's good advice, even if he did get discouraged at some point. I never expected that the psilocybin experience would be so 'open ended' – i.e., that the more you take, the further and further out you get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I started doing 5+ grams of shrooms (up to 7g at present, but need to grow my own before going higher on account of price) I'm of the opinion that psilocybin is just The Best. Not really sure why people get so excited about ayahuasca – shrooms is a much more hmmm

       That video makes no sense. If they actually had technology to make one have the experience of driving a truck, everything else they mentioned would be totally obsolete. To me, this sounds like anti-Russia propaganda; i.e., to make it seem they are in possession of scarily powerful technologies.
      </p>

       I'm not saying that technological advances are never kept hidden, but c'mon, this was apparently made in 1985. The best thing they'd be able to project would be pacman.

       I gave a link. Seriously what is your problem? No one ever asked for sources until I started posting about CIA mind control. Seems like its being done just to waste my time so I can't talk to as many people about this issue. I'd like to be on the MSM sites saying this shooter isn't crazy not be ordered around by redditors too lazy to google.

       Not just on CIA mind control. Subscribers of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and I have asked you to cite sources when you threadjacked by bringing up other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should subscribers of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       believe everything you say? Why make them beg for a source? You need to cite sources when you initially make claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have made numerous exaggerations this week in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       :

      </p>
      <p>
       I am still waiting for you to cite sources. You bully and derail. Therefore, I  created a post for you to cite sources for three claims out of over a dozen claims you made this week in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Cite sources or retract your claims:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5mvsew/rebuttals_assassination_barrie_trower_says_the/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5mvsew/rebuttals_assassination_barrie_trower_says_the/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Majority of your sources are fake in that they do not substantiate your claims. For example,
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5n7y3t/definition_of_a_ti/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/5n7y3t/definition_of_a_ti/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As my  mod, it is essential that you accurately describe targeted individual issues. I am giving you three days to cite sources that actually substantiate your claims or retract your claims. Otherwise, I will demod you.

       I don't know, I ask for sources. When you make such a major claim though you obviously want sources. I don't have to tell you that youtube videos aren't sources. I'm trying to be charitable and checking if you have any actual evidence for what is a tremendous claim.

       No, it's not a source, certainly not for such an extreme claim, a source would be a meta analysis of double blind peer reviewed studies. Also, you should stop with the name calling, it doesn't really contribute to anything.

       What is your criterion of 'retarded'?  You're certainly incorrect if you mean it in any scientific/psychometric/neuropsychometric way; I think you're just frustrated that you don't have evidence for your assertion. Anyway do you have evidence for any of your claims?

        The human body, much like a computer, contains myriad data processors. They include, but are not limited to, the chemical-electrical activity of the brain, heart, and peripheral nervous system, the signals sent from the cortex region of the brain to other parts of our body, the tiny hair cells in the inner ear that process auditory signals, and the light-sensitive retina and cornea of the eye that process visual activity.[2] We are on the threshold of an era in which these data processors of the human body may be manipulated or debilitated. Examples of unplanned attacks on the body's data-processing capability are well-documented.

       No. I believe he sounds like a pretentious fuck talking shit cause did did a hallucinogen. I dabble myself. I accidentally (ish) took more shrooms than he had during this "epiphany" as well.

       I'm a big fan of hallucinogens and partake here and there. But thinking you are all of a sudden "enlightened" because you took some is bullshit college student talk.

       Our brains are evolved to communicate primitively without language and we most certainly communicate with thoughts.  We're are so distracted is all and getting bombarded with info it is insane.  Like you said bout shrooms it opens your mind.  But shrooms are exactly like a deep trance state where I believe you have the ability to communicate with your higher self. Who is super intelligent and intuitive.  Our society has the people at war with their shadow self. All mental disorders are manifestations of the shadow self communicating to the conscious being.  Please listen to your inner voice.  Also death has no grip because you will die but you will live and love in a new dimension.  Death has respect for those who have potential.  Tap into you fucks and know thy self. 393

       Sure – higher self and all that. I don't think that the material/spatial aspect of reality is fundamental, and I see our body and brain as more of a directly-experienced mathematical explanation for the phenomenon of one's being able to perceive the material/spatial aspect, but I don't like to consider a 'higher self' as a separate thing to me.

       On a high dose of shrooms – to the extent that you can see in clear and vivid detail everything you wish – one can ask something like 'show me how I might make a machine that does x' – and within moments it appears, in full, detailed animated 3D and you can zoom in or out and just do anything, really, just ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what computers can and can't do and how fast they can do it. I say with fair certainty that what one sees in these states is impossible to achieve with conventional computing.

       Awesome your right the two are not separate but our society doesn't appreciate our shadow self that is super intelligent.  Everyone has the potential to be a genius.  Those people who are take inspiration from anything and don't get to attached to things but most importantly they fail and damn we are good at failing then learning to bounce back up.  So yes your body is super powerful a don honestly I think the mind isn't the issue I believe it is the gut area the the lungs because we hold a lot of trauma and stress in out hips and gut area.  Any memory is stored in you body depending how emotional that memory is the more energy it has.  Please take care of your spine because it is you life force.  Be in alignment and you fluids and electrical circuit is running at optimal levels.  You wouldn't want you cars fluid lines kinked or twisted woul you? No so this isn't for you or anyone else it is to brainwash myself into believing what is true.  We are super powerful beings that when we don't tap or use that energy our it manifestors in our body as junk.  Be like river let the spirit flow violently be not like damn which slows and collects the garbage and gets blocked up.  Also I'll leave you with this.  You're on the right track mate and I'm telling you if you're atheist or not. Please know thyself because this world is looking for its identity and you can be a beacon of that.

       To me, it really seems that in order to be able to project images into a person's mind, one would have to understand the nature not just of thought, but consciousness itself. There's no "screen" in your brain that you "watch". We're not looking at an image but an idea. Influencing that would necessitate a comprehensive understanding of all processes, at a fundamental level, that operate in the brain; i.e., a perfect understanding of not just material physics, but everything else about this reality. Anyone with that knowledge would be unassailably powerful. Why not just project images into everyone's minds so they just do whatever you want them to. What would be the point of playing politics if you can simply induce mass hallucinations at the flick of a switch?
      </p>
      <p>
       While it's not impossible, do you really think that every neuroscientist, every computer scientist or AI researcher, every physicist, etc. etc. is working in vain? Did you know that neuroscience, at present, is arguing about how a network of less than 10 neurones interoperates, and as yet haven't achieved a great deal of insight into it? I'd consider making a bet that even in 50 years, this will remain science fiction.

       Our system is setup so we are in debt and are slaves to that debt for the majority of our lives. Yes I do believe we are being held back from knowledge that is vastly more advanced than what was ever taught in our cuurent schools systems.

       Well okay but this argument begs the question. You've stated the conclusion in the opening sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then go on to inductively argue that it seems so unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1950s this argument was used to prove that the Mafia couldn't possibly exist because everyone knows that criminals aren't intelligent enough to organise themselves. Now this belief isn't just naive because, well the Mafia do exist, it's naive by several magnitudes in that not only does organised crime exist, it is prevalent in banking, in politics, in business etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mistake comes from the inappropriate use of occam's razor. When all of the factors are known, it can be a powerful tool. When we have gaps in our knowledge it appeals to inductive fallacy (common sense fallacy). This is the very reason magicians are able to fool us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that you can't avoid doing some hard grunt work to attempt to answer the question. You have to consider witness testimony, which apparently is too challenging for us. We apparently have to brush all testimony as lies, even if stands up in court of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more concretely, we do have tons and tons of data on classified project and black projects. We know for a fact what they were studying and it goes beyond MKULTRA. We know that projects go dark when they are being integrated into the private sector. We understand enough about the process to make the statement that the government posesses advanced technology. And yeah sorry to all the scientists' life work and stuff but inductive arguments are a waste of time.

       The fact that the shooter just placed the gun down after shooting and then laying down with his arms out, says a lot about this situation. Hearing voices is the second sign people need to pay attention too.

        Authorities were so concerned when Esteban Santiago visited the FBI Anchorage, Alaska, office in November that they confiscated his gun and ordered a mental health evaluation. A month later, Santiago retrieved the weapon from police headquarters.

       Yes, but his intentions were pure, he literally just wanted to rid the world of evil. But evil tricks you. How to trick evil? Do no harm. Protect yourself. Be like water - Bruce Lee. Ask yourself, how was he able to do seemingly super human things? Does he maybe know something that you may not know? Was that the full extent of his true power? I know the answer, if you want to know.

       Damn right I can! I really think the eastern front missed out on the WWII craze that Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers started, but then again it would be unseemly to portray the ruskies in a heroic light.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I found this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A6UWkK2U4s&amp;amp;list=PLnNmfyY_ccRHl0yAJZy3r5Nfq2-Xr22di">
        18 part (I think?) documentary
       </a>
       on the eastern front that was made for Russian audiences but has been dubbed over in english by the BBC (the maps are still in Russian so it's kind of a fun geography test).
      </p>
      <p>
       I first became aware of the whole eastern front history from Dan Carlin's 4 podcast episodes called
       <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-ghosts-ostfront-series/">
        Ghosts of the Ostfront
       </a>
       which is super easy to listen to. It costs money but it's pretty cheap and I'm sure you can pirate it somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that is striking to me is that as an american who grew up during the WWII pop culture bubble I really thought that D-Day was by far the most action that happened in the war (as a sea invasion it technically was) but when you start hearing that the civilians under siege up in Leningrad resorted to cannibalism and that the Russians were surprise invaded and managed to completely move their manufacturing industry to Siberia it gives you a taste of nationalistic pride for a country which is certainly no good these days haha.

       No one is "taking our guns". They spooked us into buying them all so we slaughtee ourselves. Theyre attempting to incite civil war, and if there were ever a time for a powder keg event to kick off the whole thing, Trumps inaugeration sure seems like it.

       I know they are in control but their last puzzle piece is to take control of our guns. 
And yes, there's instances of them being able to take our guns. Just look at the false flag Boston marathon.. seized guns. Or, hurricane Katrina... seized guns. Maybe those were drills to practice and see how we would react when they seized our guns. 
They are coming after our guns. When you listen to the news, notice how much they talk about guns, shootings, deaths etc. They are pre-conditioning us want and accept gun control. 
Obama has already passed a law a couple years ago forcing healthcare provider to report mental illness to the govt. I find it weird a lot of these shooters are "mentally ill" You know how big of a group that could be disarmed if they pass a law anyone with  MI can't own guns?

       This might be a bad time to bring up the fact that Santiago's gun/murder weapon was taken when he admitted himself into a psych ward, and was then returned less than a week later. When someone experiences a clinical break from reality, are you in favor of letting that person have their firearm back in one week's time?

       No not at all.. that's why I think the govt agencies are behind this. They knew his state of mind so why give him back his gun after he said he was hearing voices which are telling him to join Isis? Doesn't add up.

       You seem to suggest a scenario in which he WAS mentally ill and also an MKULTRA victim, which kind of wipes the Just mentally ill option from the board while recognizing it's validity in a larger narrative.

      <p>
       Psychotic breaks from reality, when they occur in the early stages of paranoid schizophrenia, are just that, breaks, as in temporary. My buddy experienced this, was hospitalized for a few days, got fluids, evaluation, and came out of his psychosis rather quickly. While pretty goddamn shaken, he was back to his usual self for the most part, until the next break occurred. A few days of rehydration and sleep maybe put Santiago back to some semblance of rationality, he stopped talking about the government forcing him to view murder videos, and was released and re-armed, as per law.

       I 100% agree with you. At this point in time there is a manufactured divide in the populace of this country. They absolutely do not need to take away guns from anybody. They are definitely providing arms that will be used in the civil war that comes from the divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a time to worry about guns. What are they going to do, honestly. They will have drones with surface-to-air missiles. What we need is to come together and awaken the masses to what is going on behind the scenes.

       people will just say they don't use it anymore. they (the powers that be) will never admit it through mainstream channels, so the dumb masses will never believe it. it's a shame but that's how they think. idiots are waiting for the evil powers that be to spoonfeed them everything.

For those who sense will hear/see/smell/taste/and fele the gifts that are given in the moment of NOW.  The moment is infinite and the powers that be try to say no it is this way.  Fuck that bitch I'm a random number generator and I manifest my own reality you shit bag go eat a dick.  So thank you thank you thank you for reading.   You have all the power at your disposal. Just ask your higher self what to do with it for it is divine.  Also any fear mongering fucks can go eat a dik aswell.  Change your momentum and shit on the world that is being peddled to the masses.

       Unfortunately, its not 'about to be exposed'. Those that are aware of these programs and technologies will continue to be aware, while the sheep will continue to be part of the herd. 
MSM is all over the place claiming that people who believe in MK ultra are "crazy conspiracy theorists", and that's exactly how the general public will view this situation we well.

       I think most people who know about MKULTRA in the past believe that it is real and likely still ongoing, but that doesn't mean that every disaster labeled Possible MKULTRA is in fact an instance of this. With this case, there's basically no way to prove whether or not Santiago was sane before this shooting-- he checked into psych watch under his own volition and was never charged with a psych-related crime (aside from previous domestic abuse cases), and was never medicated. I would like to hear from those who evaluated him then and those soon to do the same.

       Consider this scenario: the idea of an ISIS Delusion Disorder is proposed and promoted, focusing on the internal mechanisms that occur in someone who views and is intrigued for whatever reason by ISIS propaganda, how they either buy in fully without question or look for/invent reasons why they are so intrigued (the government is making me do it). If this school of thought was established in examining ISIS-inspired attacks and the general way in which a consciousness processes violent propaganda and directed snuff films, would you consider this some sort of MKULTRA spillover into academia and psychological research?

       I'm actually a psychologist who works in forensics and academia. Delusional Disorders with religious components are not uncommon, but I don't see the DSM adopting a specific "ISIS DD". That would be a major ethic violation, and I dont think most members of APA would consider it. There are already v-codes to use with DD that specify if it has a religious component , anyway.

       I definitely see the ethics-violation angle, but I don't think there's anything too religious in the draw of watching ISIS's actual propaganda videos-- they're just well-produced snuff videos with some bizarre shouting about Allah thrown in. Their digital magazine is where they really try and justify their actions and intentions by mixing in all the "apostate" rhetoric. They really are master classes in blending ideologies into their own incoherent stew.

       There are other religious groups that have in the past or currently use similar tactics. I just think that as far as academic research, outcomes from viewing these films/magazines would be studied as a larger concept of religious propaganda. Yes, some studies will look at specific religious, but the cognitive processes in those viewing, despite which religious affiliation, would likely be the same.

The clicks are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device.

       The sad fact is even if pizzegate was true. All those kids are now died. Most didn't get to live anyways. But pizzegate did stop the activities for the time being. So it was just a lose/win kind of thing.

       It's been said that Trump will deflate the intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is less interested in fighting with Russia or GINA than making a shit ton of money for himself, his friends and feeling international power for 4 - 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump decreases the size of the CIA - the bad agents will likely move into full on crime-life, like importing/exporting through Mexico for ex. Maybe the cartel bosses will give 'em jobs.

       Or they will kill him and have their puppet Mike Pence up to bat. You really think they were are all sitting in their Beligan Chateaus going "oh well" on election night? I do agree with your assessment of trump though, Putin is similar but far more cunning from what I've seen so we may see Russia pulling some sneaky shit while playing the nice fellow mob boss with trump.

       What if this is just another ploy to add to the whole "tinfoil hat" perception that the general public has regarding conspiracy theorists? What if the CIA (and/or whoever the fuck else is involved in all these hoaxes and false flags) somehow planted this guy specifically so he could say all this stuff as a way of further discrediting, in the public mind, any and all conspiracy speculation?

       I heard it on Fox News today. If you google CIA voices fort Lauderdale shooting it should come up 
Here's one where he says CIA was controlling his mind and  making him join Isis. On the news today.. he said in court CIA put voices in his head.

       I was casually flipping through tv channel and saw fox 5 ny say that Esteban went to the FBI in Alaska and claimed the CIA was forcing him to watch ISIS videos. I thought it was odd MSM would even mention that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I had channel 5 on the 10pm news came on last night.The first story was about this case for the trail so I was interested if they would bring up the CIA part. This time they changed it to Esteban said "hackers" were making him watch the ISIS videos. I was shocked and angry that Fox would think that nobody would notice they changed CIA to hackers?! I shut it off immediately and won't be watching again.

       I found this CNN report from the 80s and they were straight forward to the public about these electromagnet weapons the countries are developing and using against the citizens. What ever happen to that type of journalism?

       Like how Shia Lebouf said the NSA was recording our phone calls for blackmail and said an FBI agent had demonstrated it to him by playing a dirty sex call Shia had made. This was BEFORE Snowden. It was to promote the film Eagle Eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that all this shit happened to him, he acted crazy, was raped, trouble with police, lucky to have never been admitted to a Psych ward really.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now if you mention what Shia said, people say "but Shia is crazy he just made it up".

       Rape is not a playground game of tag.  Laws are not game rules.  He was fully capable of telling the bitch to stop and he didn't.  Let's not compare this to women who are raped under threat of violence or children who are molested by their relatives.  That does them a huge disservice.

       Ignorance of what?  I am fully aware of consent laws.   If you were, you would know that "capacity to consent" is a large part of them.  Like I said, this isn't a schoolyard game.  At some point it just gets into playing with words, and no longer looking at what actually happened on the ground.  He had the full capacity to stop the situation and he didn't.

       So to clarify, n your estimation, if I walk up to a girl on the street and grab her by the vagina, I'm totally cool to continue massaging it until and unless she says stop....and as long as I stop at that instant, I should not be charged with sexual assault.  Is that your final answer?

       Ah, so you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       think a crime was committed.  That clears that up.  To me, there isn't much of a distinction because whether it's a sexual assault or rape you are considered the lowest piece of shit in our society, are still a sex offender in the eyes of the law and basically fucked for life....unless you are a billionaire and can afford your own island.

       he was doing a "performance art piece" where he stayed in one spot and didn't move or speak even while people were all around him trying to interact with him. During this time he says someone messed with him sexually. He wasn't able to stop himself from being molested because he couldn't move or speak during the performance.

       His legs were whipped and he had a bullwhip inserted in his anus. It's rape. He was obviously scared/shocked. No body cares because people hate modern art and think such artists deserve worse.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One woman who came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened, whipped my legs for ten minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me… There were hundreds of people in line when she walked out with disheveled hair and smudged lipstick. It was no good, not just for me but her man as well. On top of that my girl was in line to see me, because it was Valentine’s Day and I was living in the gallery for the duration of the event – we were separated for five days, no communication. So it really hurt her as well, as I guess the news of it travelled through the line. When she came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn’t speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful

       Do some research on Psychiatrists who use trauma to split personalities.

       These same Psychiatrists are the ones who write the definitions.

       There is no blood test to determine if someone is schizophrenic. They are trained by textbooks and if something you say is similar to the criteria in the DSM manual, you are mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, claimed he was stalked by the FBI. The psychiatrists said he was paranoid. He later killed himself (probably programmed too via electroshock "therapy")
      </p>
      <p>
       Decades later, FBI revealed that they had stalked him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was never crazy, just victim of a corrupt system. His friends must feel like shit, knowing they helped kill him, because they couldn't think for themselves and just went along with whatever the Government said. Sheeple.

        I mean voices are the easiest ones (to create) because all you have to do is stimulate the cochlea with a set frequency.  It’s very easy.  Voices are very easy.  And it isn’t that people are imagining voices.  They physically hear them.  They physically hear as I’m talking to you.  My voice isn’t inside your brain.  My voice goes no further than an inch into your ear.  It’s the electrical signal that makes you interpret how I sound and once you’ve got this electrical signal which can be a chip or lots of things you can physically make people hear voices.   It can cause insanity and it was an experiment to take an ordinary sane person, cause insanity and have a psychiatrist, who was unknown to everybody, diagnose schizophrenia or paranoia or a psychiatric illness.  That was a successful outcome and the person would spend the rest of their life in an asylum and in misery but to the government scientists that was a success.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       PS. hearing voices that use grammatically correct sentences and issue instruction and do follow up is not a "mild variant of paranoid schizophrenia" lol even if someone just hears knocking noises which aren't real they are schizphrenic according to DSM manuals. You're ignorant of your own bullshit lol

       hahaha eloquent and directive voices do you honestly believe that it could be anything other than the CIA issuing instructions using their neuro weapons. Do you honestly believe a brain malfunction would output grammatically correct sentences and not just noise?

      <p>
       And let's go further into what you mean by eloquent, what you mean is a voice that uses CIA 2 stage torture to break the will of the target. It's been documented that these supposed schizos get broken down in the exact same method as Guantanamo Bay prisoners. In fact many Guantanamo Bary prisoners complain of voices in their heads and are diagnosed as "sluggish schizophrenics", whatever that is.

       A common term like command hallucination is an easy counterexample to your assertion that schizophrenics don't hear full sentences, I have no clue where you got the idea schizophrenia doesn't include those types of hallucinations. Even if it's true what would be the diagnosis for a person hearing full sentences?

       It's impossible for a malfunctioning computer to output sentences that are grammatically correct, let alone issue instructions and follow up on how accurately they are followed. Same with the human brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how you could believe something so preposterous. Oh wait, I know why, because you saw it on "a beautiful mind"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "fake diagnosis" is schizophrenia, full sentences or not. The real cause, if full sentences, CIA mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets even funnier. The CIA for some reason near this army base didn't even bother trying to hide the pattern of mind control. They torture homosexuals using their v2k weapons in the same way. All of them tortured by a voice that introduces itself as sally. What is the probability that all of these people would have the same brain malfunction???
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway they just get a psychiatrist (gay one too, so the tv news audience thinks "gee he must've looked at it from all sides, cos he's gay like them, i'm sure he left no stone unturned") to say they're all schizo suffering from a group delusion.

        The human body, much like a computer, contains myriad data processors. They include, but are not limited to, the chemical-electrical activity of the brain, heart, and peripheral nervous system, the signals sent from the cortex region of the brain to other parts of our body, the tiny hair cells in the inner ear that process auditory signals, and the light-sensitive retina and cornea of the eye that process visual activity.[2] We are on the threshold of an era in which these data processors of the human body may be manipulated or debilitated. Examples of unplanned attacks on the body's data-processing capability are well-documented.

       2A is not so we can hunt, target shoot, and protect our homes.  Was this the urgent issue 200+ years ago- preserving hunting and target practice?  No.  It's right behind the 1A for the same reason, to protect us from a tyrannical govt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forces within and without our govt want to take that away.  Our 2A is the last wall they need to crush. Problem for them is the more they do this crap the more people obtain more guns and ammo.  They will never put the toothpaste back in the tube.

       Okay here's my theory. Maybe he was downloading all this propaganda and was enjoying CP and the FBI or CIA caught wind of one or the other and said hey since we know your have CP and we know you are watching the propaganda, which the CIA made, so he was already exposed to easy manipulation.
  So they maybe talked to him, took him some where, or maybe fed him certain types of propaganda to subconsciously imprint something in his mind. This way they could trigger him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now idk how.this all works so here is another theory. 
Maybe certain types of images make the brain relax its mental walls or some type of field, plus any medication could add to this and a myriad of other things. Maybe they use a MK Ultra psychics or they have some kind of technology that control brainwaves or maybe he has a chip in him. They the could remotely access people or at least take control of their thought process to make them do things. Put their personality aside and take control of their consciousness or some crazy shit who knows. I'm just putting crazy things out there. We live in probability universe so anything is possible.

       Dude a Muslim registry won't matter.  They are like 2% of our population.  You'd be a fool to think the NSA is keeping tabs on muslims already, considering they have all our info whenever they want.  And no I don't think all muslims are bad.  I think some bad people are muslims however.

       What's stopping people from lying anyway?  Are they gonna raid every Americans home looking for any hidden Qurans?  I doubt it lol.  Don't compare this to nazi Germany out of respect to the people who died in under hitler.

He was in Iraq in his early 20's, probably a great opportunity to see and or do some fucked up shit that can manifest itself as a legitimate mental condition.

       I just hopes he gets a fair trial and if the CIA  is behind this mind control.. it should be exposed. Too many lives have been taken by these "false flags" just to push a political agenda.

       Thank you for mentioning this. I lost a friend who was in his early 40's to suicide due to untreated schizophrenia. His illness technically didn't show signs until his mid-thirties. His symptoms were ignored by friends and family and brushed off as anxiety, they acted like he was too old to be mentally ill or something.

       Also have you every done a shit load of lsd? It doesn't brain wash you, something like scopolamine would be more effective for that.

       This guy sounds like he is schizophrenic that went of his meds. The gov't screwed the pooch on this one if the story of him turning himself in is true. But honestly the gov't is probably more inept than you give it credit for.

       Tanks can be stopped with mud. Just mud. Our military has had their asses handed to them for the past 15 years by goat farmers in the desert. Not to be a dick, but how effective do you think the US Military actually is?

       By what stretch of the imagination have they been getting their asses handed to them? Do you realize more of our soldiers have died from suicide than from actual combat, that for everyone of our   soldiers that died more than 200 ''enemies/civilians'' died? We shouldn't be over there in the first place, but do you know how long it took to take out saddam? 3 weeks, to go to the other side of the planet and blow up a country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with the war, or how much we spend on the military, or a lot of things this country does. I fully support the second amendment and enjoy shooting and hunting. But to assume you and a bunch of AR-15's or whatever the cool toy is now would have more than a snowflakes chance in hell is ludicrous.

       I have no doubt MK Ultra is a very real entity however, what was the point here? I mean unless there was something about someone he killed in the airport....why kill random people when the government has a hit list a mile long?

      <p>
       It kinda makes no sense (to me) at this junction unless or until there's some specific meaning to this otherwise senseless killing spree (although it's very odd how he was able to claim a LOADED gun with no question)

       I don't get it. So given that the CIA is an illegal fascist organization, what do they win by supporting saner gun control laws?

       Is the CIA now controlled by the extreme left or the extreme right?

       Voice to Skull having a patent doesn't mean it works. I can patent my idea for a time machine too. The flip side to telling people it's the big bad government beaming messages into their skull is they don't get the mental health help they need. This shooter was probably on the gangstalking sub here where all the mentally ill encourage each other to not take meds or get help and believe V2S is a real thing. If you hear voices you are insane.

       I don't think obama was going to outlaw guns but he was put in place to bring it one step closer to gun control. The NWO puppets are put in place to bring them closer to harsher gun laws. The NWO was counting on Hillary winning and would of gave her orders to carry out false flags bringing America one step closer to gun control. They are very patient ppl and plan stuff like this decades ahead of time. 
That's why obama is so pissed Trump won bc the elites who own him might not agree with the "gun control". So, trump will bring the NWO 10 steps back, which means Obamas efforts during those 8 years can be wiped out. 
U see where I'm coming from? They NWO elite know Americans don't want a NWO and can't put it in place with all of us armed. they have to strip our gun rights small pieces at a time so we don't notice what they are actually doing. 
I.e. Say for the next 20 years the NWO succeeded in electing their puppets. All of the puppets are for gun control. 
One puppet organizes false flags with mental illness shooters. Eventually the mass population will say take gun rights away from mental illness ppl bc that aren't in their right mind. So a law is put in place
       <a href="http://www.mrconservative.com/2014/01/31501-obamas-gun-confiscation-begins/">
        and healthcare providers are forced to hand over any mental illness records to govt
       </a>
       That's a HUGE group that will be disarmed. 1 out of 4 ppl in America take some type of anxiety or depression pill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next puppet works on disarming the military with pstd. The puppet reforms the military benefits (like trump wants to do) and majority of the vets apply for the benefits saying they have pstd. Then false flags are organized with military men who have pstd. Over time the mass population will force gun control on that group. That's another large group disarm and this time its the group that is TRAINED to protect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see where I'm going? They start with 100% ppl armed to 30% armed. 30% is a better number for them if they want to force NWO on us.

       US military won't drop a bomb bc it makes it extremely obvious their intensions. U gotta look at how the elites have operated in the past. They are smooth and make everything look as an illusion.

       The new world order which is a group of elites who are owned by the Rothschilds who want to form a one world government, one world currency and one world religion (luciferian). The elites that are involved are obama Bushes Clinton's pope queen Merkel... basically all the country's that are ran by the central banks, which is owned by the Rothschild. The only countries that ARENT under the central banks control is Russia, china, Iran and Cuba, which are our enemeys bc US is owned by the central banks. 
YouTube new world order documentary and get familiar with it bc that's what our world is fighting against right now. Once the NWO is ushered in we are slaves to the elites and a lot of ppl say that's when the antichrist will rise to the thrown. 
There's a few things that need to happen first before the NWO can be put in place.. ww3, and economic collapse of the US dollar and the third temple needs to be built in Israel.

Jay z and Beyoncé are the stop of the illuminati pyramid for the music industry. They are what you call the king and Queen of the music industry for the illuminati. He mentioned "jayz talk to me, just call me, I know you got killers and don't put them at my head" he's wanting jays to talk to him person to person and not as the illuminati music king who has access to hitmen (star whacking)
       <br/>
       He says radio (illuminati)  lies to you, fb lies to you, Google lies to you... which means they are all controlled by the higher power elites. 
He said he was his Trump shit... this is almost immediately after the election and trump won AGAINST THE ILLUMANTi (establishment) this gave Kanye hope which is why he went out and ranted against the establishment. 
Kanye said something like the new powers are here and the old power structure is dying so don't get HILLARY clinton. Basically saying ppl are waking up to the old power structure which is why Hillary clinton failed. 
Kid cuddi was once controlled by the illuminati but now speaks out against the illuminati.

       The only part of this I'm going to comment on. Schizophrenia COMMONLY develops between the ages of 16-30, most commonly in late adolescence. It's not impossible for it to develop even later than that.

       The MSM isn't tightly controlled. It's controlled via access to lobbiests, access to information, etc. It's still private companies run by individuals, these people are entirely self interested and they'll jump ship the second they think they're on the "wrong" (aka losing) side of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people you have to lobby are pedos, you'll cover up pizzagate. But they aren't about to place themselves between pitchforks and politicians and lose everything themselves.

       Remember when a guy complaining of mind control and said George H Bush was watching him tried kidnapping a girl from walmart, and the Police found illuminatti literature in his apartment?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the people doing the mind control are a homogenous group. I think sometimes they do it to set up the other bad guys. Like NSA has their mind control killers, CIA has their mind control killers, Navy has their mind control killers, Airforce has their mind control killers, and the departments hate each other and keep trying to pin it on the other agencies.

       Because it's unlikely that the public accept the reality. There are victims of these crimes that fight for credibility, supported by psychiatrists and experts that back the testimonies. Still ignored by media and officials.

       The process required for the public to accept or even doubt these new ways of domestic terrorism by state agents isn't proportial to the truth itself:

       This shit was painfully fucking obvious right from the start, to anyone with two braincells to rub together... if you look at the list of this major campaign donors for the republican primary, all of them are transnational corporations. He was funded by many of the same people as Hillary.

       Thank you. This to me sounds like the only rational response. So many people here saying "duh, you've been duped! Trump's a billionaire!" As if there was any alternative. (And as if billionaire itself is any proof of anything). At the very least trump has rattled some feathers. This will go a long way to making the masses wake up from their 'government loves you' slumber.

       I gave a link. Seriously what is your problem? No one ever asked for sources until I started posting about CIA mind control. Seems like its being done just to waste my time so I can't talk to as many people about this issue. I'd like to be on the MSM sites saying this shooter isn't crazy not be ordered around by redditors too lazy to google.

       Your brain can imagine a fully fleshed out, grammatically correct sentence. Why should you not hallucinate one? Your thoughts are much less under your control under the best conditions than you might assume, friend.

       I don't think obama was going to outlaw guns but he was put in place to bring it one step closer to gun control. The NWO puppets are put in place to bring them closer to harsher gun laws. The NWO was counting on Hillary winning and would of gave her orders to carry out false flags bringing America one step closer to gun control. They are very patient ppl and plan stuff like this decades ahead of time. 
That's why obama is so pissed Trump won bc the elites who own him might not agree with the "gun control". So, trump will bring the NWO 10 steps back, which means Obamas efforts during those 8 years can be wiped out. 
U see where I'm coming from? They NWO elite know Americans don't want a NWO and can't put it in place with all of us armed. they have to strip our gun rights small pieces at a time so we don't notice what they are actually doing. 
I.e. Say for the next 20 years the NWO succeeded in electing their puppets. All of the puppets are for gun control. 
One puppet organizes false flags with mental illness shooters. Eventually the mass population will say take gun rights away from mental illness ppl bc that aren't in their right mind. So a law is put in place
       <a href="http://www.mrconservative.com/2014/01/31501-obamas-gun-confiscation-begins/">
        and healthcare providers are forced to hand over any mental illness records to govt
       </a>
       That's a HUGE group that will be disarmed. 1 out of 4 ppl in America take some type of anxiety or depression pill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next puppet works on disarming the military with pstd. The puppet reforms the military benefits (like trump wants to do) and majority of the vets apply for the benefits saying they have pstd. Then false flags are organized with military men who have pstd. Over time the mass population will force gun control on that group. That's another large group disarm and this time its the group that is TRAINED to protect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see where I'm going? They start with 100% ppl armed to 30% armed. 30% is a better number for them if they want to force NWO on us.

       It's like when there was the shutdown, there was a increase in no of events of TIs killing themselves, attacking others etc. to put pressure to restore funding. Like a woman transcriber who "God" instructed to go on a rant about the Founding Fathers being Freemasons during congress. The media censored the Freemason thing.
