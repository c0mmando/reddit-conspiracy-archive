If you are skeptical you are a shill from Russia, massive upvotes and swells of those online are just because of how &quot;juicy&quot; this &quot;conspiracy&quot; is.  If this is true, or even is perceived by the masses as true, the situation could become dangerous quickly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They definitely want to control the narrative and its an often used tactic because its so effective. The real problem facing conspiracy theorists/alternative groups, is that we get hung up on the conspiracy theories and the little details. We never make the leap to actually trying to create real world SOLUTIONS.</p>

<p>We can shout pie in the sky ideas all day like &quot;end the fed&quot; &quot;get rid of money&quot; &quot;take back the power&quot; &quot;we need unity&quot; &quot;people are waking up&quot; &quot;tptb blah blah blah&quot;. This doesn&#39;t get us anywhere. We woke up a few more people, ok? 100% of our efforts shouldn&#39;t be concentrated in waking people up. When we wake the people we have no alternative to show them.</p>

<p>What does &quot;end the fed&quot; really mean? How do we actually do that? Do we pass more laws? Do we organize? Are we just replacing it? Hows it going to work without the fed?  &quot;Take back the power and unify!!!!&quot; Ok so what does that look like? Do we march on washington? Ok we marched? Now what? We dragged the politicians out of the country? Now what?</p>

<p>We have no plan, and we need people working on plans/solutions. Show me the data, the money less trial runs, the stats, the facts, the numbers, the implementations of your alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a way we can prevent this from happening, as I said in another thread.  In the major news subs, I now add to my ignore list anyone who floods the sub with stories about the following topics:-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israel/Palestine.</p></li>
<li><p>The supposed global Islamic invasion.</p></li>
<li><p>Hitler revisionism, Nazi apologetics, white nationalism, or anything else related to fascism.</p></li>
<li><p>Feminism, homosexual or transsexual advocacy, or any other form of Leftist identity politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Marxist advocacy, including gun control advocacy, or mention of any traditional Marxist social/economic issues.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the above five broad categories are out of the way, the path is then clear for news about archaeology, new scientific discoveries, environmental news, and really any other topic you can imagine.  The five above listed subject areas are white noise generators; they are designed to blanket every forum or venue for news so that nothing of genuine relevance or consequence may be spoken about.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s completely avoidable.  I am avoiding it right now.</p>

<p>None of the subject categories that I listed matter.  People&#39;s focus on them in no way constructively contributes to anything.  It&#39;s just conflict for conflict&#39;s own sake.  As one example, Israel/Palestine has absolutely no relevance to me personally at all.  There is no sane, practical reason for me to focus on it whatsoever.  It is exclusively noise.  Those who have relatives in the affected areas might have reasons to care, but I do not.</p>

<p>Feminism is likewise a non-subject.  It is perpetuated by women who are mentally ill due to abuse, and who have no meaningful reason to exist; so they created a movement in order to give themselves something to do.  If they were working towards doing something concrete and specific about the abuse they suffered, then I could perhaps get behind that; but they don&#39;t.  They just scream, and again generate noise.</p>

<p>It might not be censored but it&#39;s certainly an echo chamber, where valid but conflicting evidence is voted down while posts that support this sub&#39;s worldview are being voted to the top. But that&#39;s the nature of conspiracy forums in general and I&#39;m always glad when something like the top post in the recent Nestle thread happens. </p>

<p>However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in <strong>cognitive infiltration</strong> of the groups that produce conspiracy theories</p>

<p>What can government do about conspiracy  theories?  Among the things it can do,  what   should   it   do?   We   can   readily   imagine   a   series   of   possible   responses.   (1)   Government  might  ban  conspiracy  theorizing.  (2)  Government  might  impose  some  kind  of  tax,  financial  or  otherwise,  on  those  who  disseminate  such  theories.  (3)  Government  might  itself  engage  in  counterspeech,  marshaling  arguments  to  discredit  conspiracy  theories.  (4)  Government  might  formally  hire credible  private  parties  to  engage  in counterspeech.  (5)  Government  might  engage in  informal  communication  with  such parties,  encouraging  them  to  help.    Each instrument  has  a  distinctive  set  of  potential  effects,  or  costs  and  benefits,  and  each  will have  a  place  under  imaginable  conditions.<br/>
However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has been mentioned in msm more than ever before since the election as a source of information. It comes up I conversations I&#39;ve overheard from non-web savvy people.</p>

<p>This sub (and places like 4chan and boat) are now the scary places generating dissent. </p>

<p>You all know this already though. I&#39;m the newcomer. I finally realized every meme and interesting news story starts here and the spreads a day or two later to other places. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>COINTELPRO, JTRIG, cognitive infiltration, and using disinfo agents to poison the well are old tactics, online or otherwise.</p>

<p>I can say with confidence I do not believe the mods here are compromised, and that the majority of users who post regularly appear genuine, and equally so that there are those who routinely attempt to manipulate the sub and its discourse in pursuit one agenda or another, at times resembling a form of counter intelligence. So yeah, this is nothing new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the &quot;F-35 conspiracy&quot; the DoD and their contractors controlled both sides.  Side one was &quot;cancel it&quot; which would have netted Lockheed billions in quick profit (cancellation fees).  On the other was &quot;it&#39;s the best airplane ever&quot; which also makes billions for Lockheed over a longer term.  People are still revved up on that one.</p>
