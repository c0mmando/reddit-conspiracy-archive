       There are now 4,000 users online, which is more or less 3-4 times more than the usual 900-1300 around this time of the day. There were only 2,500 users  30 minutes ago. The anti-Trump posts are skyrocketing to the top, yet it was never the case before.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Could it be that they are trying to take over this sub like they did with
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       ?

       <strong>
        Update 1:

       <br/>
       The number of online users seems to have peaked around 7,500 users, and now it starts to go down. Users are removed from the online counter usually when their session expires because they have stopped to interact with the system, which I can believe happens after 60 minutes
       <strong>
        (can any reddit expert confirm this?)

       . This would match the start of the online user increase that was around 10-20 minutes before this post.

       . Look at the peak on the "uniques by hour" graph today.

       Looking at this series, you can be pretty certain that someone is using a army of bots and fake accounts...

       That link looks like a nice civil discussion. Those happen every now and again here.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a non-brigaded day there is no simple answers to how an organic sub would act/look. We see the controlled subs and they always act the same. This sub is different. Of course we have our spam posters trying to get web traffic to their sites.. And we have a few hot heads looking for an argument to start (It may even be me if I'm having a bad day).. Yes large socially events effect the sub for a time. I have seen white, black, and even Jewish racists here. What other sub can claim that kind of diversity?...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a prophetic prophecy. In just 2 weeks the face of this sub will change again just as the tide rises and falls.

       Take a look at the comments. They're throwing Reddit gold around like it's candy. Not that that's

       The earliest relevant archive is in November. The documents got to the FBI October. There is absolutely no proof /pol/ had a hand in this.

       I noticed this as well. Gold is almost nonexistent in this thread. I also noticed a lot of gold in the comments of the Assange AMA, of course all the gold comments were attacking Assange or trying to tie him/Trump to Russia. Pretty odd if you ask me.

       I got other accounts here that are linked with personal information but I can't comment with that because I post pizza pictures and occasionally play dominoes while eating fresh pasta given to me from my grandpa on christmas. Which according to your guys means I run a pedo torture chamber.

       Curious, do you find God status in helping us "all get along"? In a way, you thwart free speech while enforcing a (Decent) Rule. But you're vigilant. That doesn't sit well with some of us. You care, that's great, but what do you choke to keep a quo?

       Assuredly has since deleted his comments on other subs, and his diary here, about this item.

       So which is it - is a mod of this sub knowingly spreading disinfo in order to discredit a conspiracy theory? Or is he just gullible and easily taken in by obvious hoaxes without checking their source? Skepticism, indeed! The rot in this sub, as with many, starts at the top.

       Just to be transparent, I did vote for Clinton, reluctantly, in Massachusetts. I had planned to write in Bernie's name (because in Mass it don't matter), but at the last moment I didn't. I wanted to give her as many votes as possible to repudiate the noxious cancer of trumpism. I live with a (non-religious) woman with an obviously Muslim surname, and she is scared. It would just take one spectacular terrorist attack, and the whole conversation would change. We'd be debating about the conditions Muslims are held in rather than whether or not they should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I utterly despise Clinton's foreign policy. She was totally, 100% wrong about Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, the list goes on. I read a
       <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/americas-failure-russia-success-in-syrias-war">
        long interview
       </a>
       today about how her policy was totally wrongheaded. As far as I'm concerned, when it comes to foreign policy, Clinton is in the jihadi-making business. I don't know to what extent she grasps this (though I suspect more than she lets on).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was shocked by the wikileaks revelations - at how little they revealed. I was expecting, you know, something. Clinton is remarkably un-corrupt for someone in her position, probably because she has so much scrutiny on her. I'd wager you'd find worse if you plucked out a politician at random. The truth is, the Clintons don't need to do favors to get money thrown at them for speeches etc - it happens anyway. I may hate the dynastic nature of American politics, despise her foreign policy, etc etc, but any idiot can see trump is at bottom a fraud and you can't believe anything he says. Yes, that's worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not agree with the analysis above, of course, but I'm just trying to be open and explain my thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just as a side note, this sub has become totally swamped by right-wingers. Us lefty conspiracy theorists are totally left out in the cold. It would be one thing if they'd admit it, but no, they've got to incessantly pretend they're equally skeptical of everything. No, you're right-wing, and lots of you are transparently and anachronistically antisemitic (speaking as a hardcore anti-zionist who think Israel, like the caliphate, like the vatican, shouldn't exist).

       Thank you for your comment, even though what someone does is always more predictive of his future actions than what someone says. Clinton is a war criminal - that's utterly disqualifying. Infinitely more than any pussy-related remark. But you've acknolwedged that, you just don't rank it that high ("I dislike her foreign policy, she's a war criminal who's killed millions, but who isn't really these days, I'll vote for her").
      </p>
      <p>
       An intellectually honest left exists: for example, the one that denounces the institutional discrimination of women in the Gulf (instead of receiving millions of dollars from sheiks while pretending to care about women).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't buy into the false right/left hegelian dialectic. It is meant to divert from the truth, i.e. the philosophy of liberty. Everyone would be a classical liberal (libertarian) if it wasn't for the manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       About your wife, I'd be worried if I were her too. Indeed someone is pitting the (Christian) West against the Islamic world (who doesn't know most/all "islamic" terror attacks are Gladio-like clandestine ops?). I wonder who that could be? Who is making us fight their enemy? I'd surmise they surround Trump and specialize in storytelling. And these mastersmof his will make sure he'll prosecute the envisioned "clash of civilisations".

       If you think that Trump's past actions and words indicate that he'd be a more peaceful pres than Clinton, you're as gullible as that mod.

       You don't. The idea that turning the middle east into a massive war zone doesn't breed fighters and terrorists, that we then need to further "fake" them somehow, is pretty silly. Again, I agree that there are people in government and business etc who are pushing for this clash of civilizations thing to increase their own power. You just seem to think their methods are needlessly elaborate for some reason. Given that the mods seem to have a hand in disinfo on this very sub, I'd be more skeptical of that info, if you're getting it from here

       That's the tell. Let me help you, with a short lesson called "having your own mind".
      </p>
      <p>
       That state of being, unfortunatly unknown to some, consists of relying on your eyes and ears to observe facts, and then on your mind to uncover a coherence between them and reach an informed conclusion. No space or time for beliefs, and especially no regard for identity (let me guess - you regard yourself as a progressive liberal, that's your identity, and you'd strongly shy away from any idea that would alter that self-image; if confronted with contradictory facts you'd simply enter cognitive dissonance and cling to your belief by getting angry, using ad hominem, or saying things like "this is where you got this argument", thus refuting while relying again on identity rather than on fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to be condescending or mean. And you can rest assured you are not in the minority. The phenomenon is widespread. You were educated beyond your intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As per the subject at hand, unless you believe in the crazy conspiracy theory or aerobats who throw passports out of aircraft cabins seconds before bringing down 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes, you must admit, starting with 911, that "islamic" terror attacks tend to be carried out under false flags. There is precedent for this, during the cold war this "strategy of tension" was called GLADIO. Now Sibel Edmonds calls it Gladio B, but who knows what it's actually called. The goal seems clear however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump IMO (this is speculation) is part of this Kabuki - he was built as a pseudo superhero - and every superhero needs a supervillain. The latter role was assumed (knowingly or not) by Clinton, the caricature of a hypocrite, a scarecrow at its best. Trump will be a "Republican Obama" (promising hope and change, getting elected by well-intended people, and then being even worse that his predecessor). I fear many in the liberty movement (see T_D) will fall into cognitive dissonance and continue supporting him regardless (sort of Republican Michael Moores). Trump will thus have free reign to oversee the demise of America.

       You'll notice when I argue I don't have to make ad hom claims like "you were educated beyond your intelligence." Why do you feel you need to resort to that kind of stuff? Putting others down like that (in your oh-so-learned tone) is a sign of deep insecurity. And it's way more obvious than you think.

       And no, telling you to be skeptical of sources on this sub is not "ad hominem." You don't even know what these terms mean.

       I guess you are right, it wasn't a nice thing to say. My goal wasn't to hurt your feelings. I'm sorry if I did. At the same time my goal isn't to protect anyone's susceptibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I wrote this is because I wanted to make that point, of people being educated beyond their intelligence. Perhaps you aren't one of them, I don't really care. Nevertheless it is a plague.
      </p>
      <p>
       People ingurgitate a bunch of words and factoids, learn how to regurgitate them, and are thus able to project a false image of erudition. Then they're given a degree that comforts their illusion. As time goes by they become increasingly mirred in their condition, as forming an original thought becomes increasingly risky (for their image could shatter). They'll repeat what they read in the NYT (or what other "intelligent" people say or write) because they believe it reinforces their signaled identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It the same btw as with fashionistas wearing certain clothes/styles (or guys with certain cars) because it helps them form and project a certain self image.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I've described are corollaries of snobism. But intellectual snobism is the worst kind, the most dangerous IMO. Not a new phenomenon either, but seemingly greater nowadays because of the socialization of education (every last moron has a pretention now he didn't use to).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I don't know if this applies to you. Probably not. I guess I can't get my head around the fact someone can know how to read and write and "vote" for Clinton, an avowed serial murderer and abuser of women (an analphabete would have had a mitigating circumstance, with all due respect you don't at all).

       This sub should understand there is a bicephalic single party in America. This blue/red divide is utterly artificial. At the summit of power, the private sector, public sector and organized crime converge. Let's refute the hegelian dialectic, and let all humans, of all backgrounds, colours and creeds, unite against the imperial power structure that tries to dominate us all.

       Sure, people are divided on (relatively) trivial matters. The fields are polarized, and each party ends up promoting un-defensible ideas. The hegelian dialectic is everywhere (thesis, antithesis, synthesis).
      </p>
      <p>
       You mentioned abortion: the choice in America is between adhering to an eugenicist ideology of "late-term pregnancy terminations" (abortions where the foetus screams) or full-spectrum criminalization ("your body does not belong to you"). How about settling on moderate policies like in European liberal countries, whereby abortions after the 12th week are severely restricted? That would be unacceptable to both "parties".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example, the police. You're either for the ongoing militarization/federalisation of police forces, or you think police is inherently racist and you implicitly support BLM and the police snipers.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other "host of issues" as you say, the consensus seems pretty strong:
      </p>
      <p>
       Minimum wage: the State shall require physical violence to fix the price of labor. We can argue on how much violence and against whom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign policy: we are the exceptional country, we need to "project power" in all areas of the globe. We can argue on which brown people we shall bomb today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economic policy: we need a politburo that fixes interests rates, we need it to be controlled by a cartel of international merchant banks, these banks need the ability to print currency, and we shall require physical violence so people use that counterfeit currency. We can argue on nothing there.

       Pretty much how it's worded, the timing of the release, the formatting and the source. Oh yeah and the content is quite outrageous, sounds like the usual demented fan-fiction from 4chan. But i digress, the propaganda war is in full effect and the left/Donalds opponents have somewhat succeeded at playing Donnie at his own game (not wikileaks tho) by releasing unsubstantiated slander from "Mi5Anon". The report is left in a state of limbo, much like the religion, there is no proof for it and there is no proof against it, but people are still forced to take a side regardless. Divide and Conquer continues.

       Basically the same as the report. If you weren't there when something happened how can you assert something to be a fact? You have to trust a source, who had another source and maybe even a third source. The "fact" becomes detached from what really happened by several degrees of separation. Thus this report, which is sourced by buzzfeed really doesn't tingle my factual senses and instead makes me skeptical. It is also further sourced by Anti-Trumpists who have motive to slander and de-legitimize Trump and once again doesn't tingle my factuals. If you want facts stick to science. Facts only exist in politics when they support an argument, if they don't they can be disregarded.

       This is hilariously misguided and a testament to how deluded you are. Political facts happen. Bush invaded Iraq. Obama escalated Afghanistan. Trump got help from Russia. To say you can't know these things because you weren't there is to embrace total ignorance about everything.

       No i'm saying you can't know these things for sure because you weren't there. By definition you don't know for sure because someone else told you. Use some logic. And those are surface level facts, descriptions of what happened. You have to be more interested in why things happened so ill rephrase your "facts" for you and all of a sudden you need more facts bro. "Why did Bush invade Iraq?", "Why did Obama escalate in Afghanistan?" and "Why did Trump get help from Russia?".

       It's shocking to me how most conspiracy people I see take right propaganda at face value but anything negative about the right or positive about the left is fully false. Most conspiracy theorists I know aren't skeptical they are just fully gullible to right leaning propaganda. Open corruption is nothing when you can harass a pizza place because a guy on the left ordered some.

       I don't know if you are new but we had criticized Trump
       <strong>
        a lot
       </strong>
       in here and especially when he announced his cabinet picks full of globalists, Goldman Sachs etc, anyone who claims Trump is an outsider is instantly reprimanded in here. The fact that we don't buy that Russian hacked the elections (Wikileaks's source was Russian) is seen as pro-Trump for some people that come from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
Trump is no better than any other polititian in the elite, they are all the establishment. Though I
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       want to see how he carries his presidency and what decisions he makes to judge him.

       I don't subscribe to this subreddit but I read posts that make it to r/all occasionally and yes from an outsider's perspective this comes across as another alt right haven. I mean pizzagate? The proponents of this kind of crap are either batshit insane or pro-Trump propagandists. I'm all for healthy skepticism of the world fyi. I just think that a lot of the people subscribed here are very selectively skeptical.

       Could be, but I sincerely think it is just r/conspiracy briefly surfacing onto r/all. What you are seeing is a combination of the new algorithm and the typical reddit user mindset. For another shitshow, look at Julan Assange's AMA...that one I can almost believe was brigaded and manipulated.

       I think this sub is anti-msm. It's also generally a less contrarian sub. You can post a conspiracy theory and people don't dispute it, they either ignore it or add on.

       Yeah if you really want to know what's going on, it's a pseudo brigade. People brought up that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would probably ignore an actual conspiracy, and as a result people started coming here and upvoted the anti trump post. It's not a bot network or organized, it's just people who aren't conspiracy theorists like me visiting your sub, independently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it a bit strange that this sub has a hard on for Trump anyways? He's the type of guy that legitimately inspires conspiracy theories, with his blatant corruption. Obama didn't do a single thing this sub said he would - from FEMA to chemtrails to rounding up your guns.

       &lt;Obama didn't do a single thing this sub said he would - from FEMA to chemtrails to rounding up your guns.&gt;

       Well, for one, you haven't been paying attention if you believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       For two, 'upvoating an anti-Trump post' is not a
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       , it's a brigade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       is that the legacy media took as their source a 4Chan fabrication and used it as real intelligence.   The top post here is now IGNORING the conspiracy lurking in its midst and focusing on slavishly bashing Trump without examining facts.

       As for chemtrails, they piss me off almost as much as vaccine conspiracies as an engineering student. The idea that there is a hidden compartment in all airplanes meant for dispersing mind control drugs is ridiculous because of the fact that tens of thousands of people design planes, and all weight and airflow has to be accounted for, for it to function properly. A secret chemical chamber would have been noticed by said tens of thousands of engineers, and at least someone would've whistle blown. Maybe if you said that they put it in the water supply it would be believable, as well as far easier and cheaper, but chemtrails are retarded. No idea about FEMA though.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the brigade, it wasn't organized, the influx of people happened organically, without anyone directing people to come here. I mean it really comes down to semantics but the best word would be the Reddit hug of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm fairly certain that the idea that the PEOTUS being controlled by blackmail by a foreign government is a lot more likely than chemtrails, FEMA death camps, and turning the US into a police state. Hell, we do it to other countries all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       To not be skeptical of Trump is to be unamerican. By that, I mean that everyone should be skeptical of all public officials, and to never blindly follow someone, especially when that person has blatantly lied on the campaign trail.

       You barely are allowed to own any ammo.

      <p>
       As for the brigade, it has already been discovered that some 'tipped off' people to come here in a non-organic way: "boy_of_soy [score hidden] 20 minutes ago 'Well I came here because someone said there was no chance that the people who frequent this sub (which many people see as an extension of t_d) would abandon their partisanship to treat this like any other conspiracy theory. It seems from the amount of threads dedicated to slapping down the theory that their assessment was correct.'"

       I am far more skeptical of the legacy media at this point.

       Yeah but that's my point, someone raised the idea that conspiracy theorists won't legitimize this actual conspiracy, and people organically came over here, albeit with the intention to upvote anti-establishment posts. It's just a bit funny because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       thinks that they elected the ultimate anti-establishment candidate, when all they did was elect a washington insider, who has spent his career buying politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that he actually admitted to buying politicians by the way.

       What the fuck are you talking about with regards to ammo? Have you been to a gun store ever in your life? Jesus Christ. I just bought a thousand 5.56 rounds for cheaper than I ever have. And it was stacked in a pile with probably another 100k rounds. Where you could buy any type of round from .22 to .50 cal.

       I disagree, on several levels. Buzzfeed is New Media. The unnamed MI6 source assembled his report long before /pol/ got wind of it.

       I just wanted to say that I came here after seeing the main article on World News. I've been a lurker in Conspiracy for a while so I wanted to see what everyone was saying about the latest Trump allegations. I assume that's where most of these visitors have come from as well, but if paid shills are a more interesting conspiracy to you than an international blackmail scheme, I won't stop you. I'm just here for entertainment anyway, so whatever floats your boat.

       It explains why I was here at that moment. I'm sure at least some of those other people were occasional visitors like me who all showed up at once when the story broke. I bet a lot more were people who just happened to see either this post on New or any of the posts in Politics or WorldNews. There might have been some bots or shills in there too, I don't know. But I do know I saw users in here saying they were posting on Voat to try to get more people to brigade these posts and downvote anything related to the new information. Why was there so much organized effort to hide this before anyone even had a chance to research it? It was dismissed as a 4Chan prank based on a single vague post that only addressed one small part of the conspiracy. It sure feels like there is a strong attempt to hide this new information around here.

       You have to admit it was a very organized attempt to downvote and hide the new information. Even if you agree with the motives that doesn't mean it isn't against the spirit of this sub. We should welcome all conspiracies, even ones that go against our political beliefs. The fact that mods slapped the "Unverified Allegations" tag on it when no other post in the history of this sub has used that tag makes it seem like the effort to hide it was coming from the top. I see no reason why this is any less believable than some of the other stuff that gets posted around here.

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the 4Chan post only claim responsibility for the whole golden shower allegation? I didn't see anything that addressed the other claims in the document. Not to mention the fact that Trump is now denying even knowing Carter Page, despite the fact that he was one of Trump's foreign policy advisors. That seems suspiciously like he is trying to distance himself who may not have a good alibi. All I'm saying is there is a lot of substance to this conspiracy theory that deserves looking into. It was irresponsible of the mods to delete references to it so quickly and a possible sign that they are working a certain agenda.

       Are you really that dumb? He gave an anecdote about why he came which could be broadly applied to many people, which could potentially explain the user spike. How is it hard to understand that an interesting potential conspiracy being posted to

       would compel people to come read about it?

       Uh... I've been sub'd here a long time. I just don't usually say anything because it's become a right-wing echo chamber whereas I would consider myself a slightly left leaning centrist skeptic. Anything besides accusing HRC and friends of pedophilia gets downvoted and spammed with shill accusations.

       If you have been "a lurker for a while now" you can be counted in with the average number of users this sub gets so your logic is thoroughly flawed. Had you said this was your FIRST time here along with the other surplus thousands, it would make sense, but in this case it does not. If we get 2k average, that INCLUDES lurkers like yourself, so your being here now too does not explain why there are now thousands more than average.
      </p>

       Also, what a surprise to see your post getting nearly triple the amount of upvotes of the post you replied to, nothing suspicious at all there. Now watch me get downvoted to hell.

       I certainly don't spend every waking minute here, but I check in at least a couple times per week. Is that using the word lurker incorrectly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so inconceivable that people who know of this sub but aren't regulars here would suddenly flock here when a big story like this breaks. Who better to dig into it than the place that has spent the last two months analyzing food related code words in some leaked emails. I'm just surprised how quickly this sub dismissed this new conspiracy based on a single 4Chan post that only referenced a very small part of the released documents. I'm starting to think there is a conspiracy within a conspiracy here based on how much effort this sub put into suppressing this new information without actually analyzing or researching any of it. Flat Earth posts manage to make it to the front page every week but an international bribery and corruption conspiracy is dismissed within hours of being posted and quickly hidden behind a brigade of downvotes and shitposts? That seems incredibly fishy to me.

       This is a great time to de-stigmatize the control phrases like "nice tin foil hat," "yada yada lizard people," etc. on all the Trump conspiracy threads.

       If folks want to respond to our conspiratorial ideas with those comments, well they should receive the same response for espousing ideas of their current intelligence-agency-backed-conspiracy.

       No, no money for me. I subbed because I 1: despise the fact that America has embarrassed itself with a Temp presidency, and 2: a post reached

       that looked like this divestiture will likely get really interesting in the near future. Remember, anti-Trump voters make up the majority of the US population, so it makes sense that stories like the one on

       I don't think it'll work.  r/politics already had a lot of people drawing a line in the sand over politics and at the very least focused on politics.  r/conspiracy has never really been politically focused so we kind of meet these brigades with eyes wide open.  They try to tell us how bad Candidate X is and we say "Yeah, we know, think bigger, who do they answer to?  what is being kept from us ?"  It's just a better sub than the others that got manipulated in every single way.

       I'll go ahead and post an answer I just left in a similar thread...
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics, a sub with a pretty damn high level of traffic, exploded about 2-3 hours ago over a potential Trump conspiracy. In that thread -- a thread with literally 10s of thousands of comments and upvotes -- many references to the r/conspiracy sub were made, being that this sub is for, uhm, well, conspiracies. So why is it a surprise that several thousand individuals like myself, who have never been here before, then checked this sub after seeing it discussed in a massively active thread now on r/all?
      </p>
      <p>
       For a sub that claims to be super thoughtful and logical... I'm not sure how they haven't pieced that together, and are instead assuming "nah bro it's Hillary Clinton's bot army" and shit.

      </p>
      <p>
       This exact same article, to the exact same source, was posted 1 hour prior to this one
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5n8lq2/read_new_trumprussia_intel_report_here_deep_ties/">
        HERE
       </a>
       . It received a couple dozen votes, with only about 60% being upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact same link was somehow allowed to be linked again in the same sub with a new title (which in itself is baffling, since any time I've ever attempted to do that on Reddit, I would be re-directed to the previous thread with that link). Except the second time around, the link received over 2000 points in 2 hours time, and continued to grow by hundreds of points per minute to the point we're at now (over 7000 and counting). In addition to this being the most rapidly upvoted story ever seen on this sub, it also happened to be from a source (Buzzfeed) that is usually not given many upvotes at all, let alone so many. For many reasons, this was not only out of the ordinary, but was astounding to witness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more reasons that I won't bother elaborating on.

      </p>

       It's the fact that the r/politics thread and now r/all thread mentioned r/conspiracy in the comments. That's exactly how I personally ended up here, having never stopped by before. I guarantee that plenty of others found their way over here the same way. That's a much more parsimonious explanation than "nah someone is paying shill armies to invade this sub".

       I don't see a link to r/conspiracy. Are you trying to say that because this scandal is technically "a conspiracy," that's why everyone from r/politics decided to check out this sub and brigade the hell out of it?

       Lol I literally can't find it, but I'll trust you I guess. Either way, I'm confident that over half of r/politics is controlled and coordinated by an organized group. Either way, I'd consider that a fucking brigade.

       Well try sorting by top comments, and only looking all the way over the left hand side, where original comments begin. The second one, 2nd or 3rd reply, is where the linking to r/conspiracy begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for half of it being a paid group of professional internet posters,  I'm just a regular dude wasting time on the internet. For free. I'm not so special that I'd consider myself unique in this regard...I'd imagine that hundreds of thousands to millions of others out there are just like me. I find it hard to rationalize that half the users are carefully coordinated, paid professionals and not regular time-wasting dudes like me. It's just a stretch, and I think the simpler reality is that most are just normal users like you and I.

       Thanks, I honestly appreciate it. I don't think it explains what happened here though. At the very least, it should have been considered a brigade and should not have been allowed to happen, because any frequent r/conspiracy user knows that what just happened could not have been organic.

       Do I look like I give a shit about your opinion or the supposed "fact" that line is tired as hell? I don't ;) it's a statement of discontentment and I'll post it whenever the fuck I want. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'm finall my moving over to voat, and I'll post that another 15000 times over the coming 15 years if I feel like it, willy.

       Really? You do realize that there's not one, but two fairly meta subs dedicated to making fun of this subreddit? So not only is traffic coming from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       , but also the other meta subs,
       <a href="/r/all">

       ...this is potentially the biggest political scandal story in a decade and you think it require shills for people to be interested?

       Solid argument. My dumb reddit handle discredits my statement. Solid. I guess by that logic you're nothing more than a Donald sycophant/shill, so anything you say may be discounted as sycophantic shilling for your king.

       Whether or not you can post the same link to a sub or not is based on the sub rules if I'm not mistaken. Some have it where it has to be at least a month old,  some never allow duplicates, others don't have restrictions.

       Well I came here because someone said there was no chance that the people who frequent this sub (which many people see as an extension of t_d) would abandon their partisanship to treat this like any other conspiracy theory. It seems from the amount of threads dedicated to slapping down the theory that their assessment was correct.

       People aren't interested in 'slapping down a theory' for no reason.

       People are rightly suspicious of an artificially upvoted story where there hasn't been sufficient time to examine the evidence and where what evidence we DO have suggests that this was a massive troll from 4Chan.

       It's kind of plausible, but it's sketchy. If that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       megathread has 25k upvotes and ours has 9k, those numbers alone hint that a huge percent of those upvoting the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       submission also came here to upvote this one, if only because we don't even have 9k viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is, how often do you follow a link to another submission then upvote it? It links to the comments or the actual URL, generally not the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       front page. How often do you navigate to the very top of the comments page and then click the up arrow in the top left? If I'm already in the comments, I never take the time to upvote the actual submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, something like half of the people that upvoted the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       megathread went into the comments, found a link to the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       submission, then took the time to go to the very top of the comments page and make sure they upvoted the submission? Seems sketchy.

       Or try asking an admin if it's actually bothering you. In my opinion, no, it's not 'a brigade' because no one is organizing anything, it's just general interest from a bunch of individuals not acting as a group, let alone a paid group.

       I assume this is because many long-time redditors who despise Trump embarrassment if America (such as myself) are thinking, hey, this could get interesting, let's sub to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Remember, this sub was pretty left-leaning before the election brought the mouth-breathing, MAGA-hat-wearing crowd to reddit. And despite being a little to the left, this sub used to be equally critical/skeptical of both political parties. But lately it has been a sub-subreddit of
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       . Just look at the "unverified allegations" tag, or any of the top posts from the past few months. You'd be hard pressed to find a popular post that is critical of
       <strong>
        <em>
         President-Elect, Donald Fucking Trump
        </em>
       </strong>
       . Jesus Christ, between the initial hacking reports and the fact that he might be violating the emoluments clause of the constitution on his first day in office, you'd think this sub would have one or two conspiracies about the guy. It's so partisan and ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree with your assessment. There aren't bots or shills taking over, it's reddit's "silent majority" popping their heads in for the first time in months because a crazy story is developing. Given the nature of this Trump story, I'd bet that there are thousands of comments all over this site that are linking to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side-note, wtf is up with
       <a href="/u/Bernie4Ever">
        /u/Bernie4Ever
       </a>
       ? This guy is constantly posting anti-Clinton conspiracy theories, and doesn't seem to have anything to say that might be critical of Donald Trump. You'd think a die-hard Bernie supporter would be slightly critical of the billionaire president who keeps appointing millionaires and billionaire to his cabinet and administration.

       Haha When I say the post about "being brigaded" was from Bernie4ever I chuckled because all he does is brigade this sub with constant anti-Hillary post, I've seen days where a majority of a page on "New" was nothing but his shit postings.......
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm still skeptical of this article right now, I do think it's funny how badly the people who have ruined this sub are flipping the fuck out right now, earlier today there was a circle jerk about a "leaked Clinton document" that was just a list of people posted from some random dudes twitter account and it didn't seem like people cared to much about sources or credibility in that post.....or where was the "unverified allegations" when pizzagate started taking off?
      </p>
      <p>
       NOWWWW when a post they don't like is big enough that they aren't the loudest voices for once and can't control narrative of the sub.......
      </p>
      <p>
       seems like everyone here complaining about vote manipulation is some type of expert? That's Weird, I wonder how they know so much about this? Past experiences with it from the other side maybe? if they couldn't understand why people hated the_d brigading during the election they should imagine what happened here tonight happening over and over multiple times every day.......

       I went several months without visiting this subreddt before making a fun little post here last month. I was shocked to see the direction it has gone. It's nothing like how it used to be. It's a shame that reddit's algorithm changed because now it's really inconvenient to find popular posts from the past. Since leaving my initial comment, I've been poking around this sub and have seen some embarrassingly terrible stuff. The third-most popular post from this past month is about an online poll that says CNN is not trustworthy. How is that a conspiracy? Then the 13th most popular post is from a
       <a href="http://accmag.com/">
        totally random blog
       </a>
       which has a
       <del>
        wildly inaccurate
       </del>
       probably fake story about Clinton being "under fire" for fake twitter followers. There is nothing critical about Trump, in fact, the only popular posts about him are defending him from accusations that Russia was in his corner.

       Uh. This sub was definitely never "left leaning". It was more anti Hillary then anything else.

       is a good example of a left leaning group.  This sub favored Bernie and then favored Trump later on.

       I'm talking about years ago, before this election cycle. This sub had a mix of liberal/libertarian undertones. It was anti-Hillary, but not like it's current form where Clinton is the devil and Trump doesn't exist/has never done anything wrong.

       This sub was anti Bush. Then anti Hillary. It's never been about left or right leaning. It's always been focused around a single candidate that was not liked. Sometimes it alignes with the majority of reddit. Sometimes it doesn't.

       I pretty much dropped out of here post-election because the narrative got too crazy.  I'll come in occasionally when some weird shit goes down.  I took a look at the Pizzagate claims and made my own opinions based off those claims, but the entire sub became way too biased towards one side...  R/Conspiracy should be untrusting of EVERY side, imo.

       Ill tell you why this sub doesn't fall for Donald conspiracies. Because those conspiracies come straight out of the Horses mouth, the CIA and or government agencies or the shillary herself. Those are the entities that are responsible for 90% of the conspiracies that are discussed on this sub. Why the fuck would anyone believe what comes out of there? Especially when most conspiracies prior to the election had those entities as the source for lies, deception and coercion.

       i agree completely. once a story gets big enough swings right into r/all and basically gets flooded with blue pilled zombies. however, this story in particular got to the front page r/conspiracy faster than  bullet, which leads me to believe that this was orchestrated. Seriously the story is not that big for it to explode that fast on this sub. it was at the front page withing 20 minutes and to top it off the story came from buzzfeed? really?.  Not really a trump supporter or shillary for that matter but something smells here.

       and your this adamant about the whole thing being made up by 4 Chan when it was literally British Intel that handed everything to him. Like this is cut and dry here's 35 pages of details and you're just saying "nope lies" without anything to back that up. Give me a link detailing this isn't real.

       And? The source of the hack is irrelevant. It is what the hack exposed that matters. Anyone can make it look like someone else hacked something. What really matters is what the hack shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is zero evidence Trump had anything to do with the hack. So, he has no responsibility. However, the hacks show that the MSM and DNC are colluding and breaking laws.

       What I'm saying is you've been proved wrong about this before, it's only a matter of time before it happens again. Saying it right now, there is
       <em>
        no way
       </em>
       that Trump makes it through a whole term without evidence of an impeachable offence appearing. Not if it's already been this bad and he hasn't even been sworn in yet.

       I haven't been proved wrong about anything. There is no definite proof the Russians did anything. In fact, it is pretty suspicious that Russia would leave so many digital fingerprints.

      <p>
       However, again, the source of the "hack" never mattered to me and I can say many other Trump supporters feel the same way.

       That's not what I said (same poster). I said if one page is true then he could still be convicted, and to elaborate some more, The rest could be straight fabrication but if only a few things is true (less than one page even) then he could face criminal charges. Irrelevant of the rest.

       true, but thats only if one page is true. If the rest of the pages are false then the one page that might be true loses all credibility. Which is a shame. Then they should of released that one page that is true instead of mixing it in with a bunch of garbage..

       This isn't a conspiracy it's an anti left sub. Like most conspiracy theorists it's filled with people who take right propaganda at face value and shout about anything no matter how tenious it is negative about the left. Trumps openly corrupt but no a guy on the left likes pizza there is clearly a massive pedophile right operating out of a pizza place.

       Yeah, it's really sucked. I would have never guessed this place would become so biased towards a billionaire conman that has connections to a known pedophile and other shady individuals... but here we are. And as silly as it was, the more esoteric content that used to be discussed here years ago was great, as well.

       That isn't true. Maybe if you aren't an active member or you are new to this sub, but if you are a real member of this sub, than you know we need evidence and evidence from MSM and intelligence agencies isn't reliable. We all know that. I am very skeptical about trump, as EVERYONE should be. It isn't who gets elected, it's who gets selected, remember? I doubt this has changed but who knows.

       Okay, then go look at the evidence that shows Trump had a close friendship with known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein(who provided underage sex-slaves to his wealthy associates), or his associations with the American mafia, or the business dealings he has had with Russian oligarchs (his son is on tape in 2008 saying Russians make up a "disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets" and "We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia").

       It's because this is so obviously a good story for r/conspiracy and people in r/news, r/worldnews, and r/politics want to see how the community here reacts. Particularly since they consider the community here entirely too pro-Trump - there was a pretty big standing assumption, for example, in r/politics that we might not even be talking about it or we'd be 100% dismissive of it. Even many Trump supporters in other subs consider this sub either A) basically r/The_Donald2.0 or B) taken over by the FSB. So curiosity compelled visitors, they noticed that the only story - apparently ever - flagged "Unverified allegations" was the Trump story and so they stuck around/upvoted. That lead to the story ending up on r/all and here we are.

       There were two major hacks during the election, neither were Russian. First you had the DNC leak, which was called a leak and not a hack and was sourced by insider, who many on this sub believed was Seth Rich as he was found murdered shortly after. Secondly you had the Podesta emails, which was not a hack either but the poor fella fell for a phishing scam. What's a phishing scam? Well you've probably had one sent to you at some point. He received an e-mail from a scammer that appeared to be an official email from a trusted source, Podesta then proceeded to fall for the fake email and type his log in credentials into the fake email. It's bad op-sec 101 and surprisingly many technologically inept people fall for this stuff. And as events show, Hillarys campaign was filled with technological incompetence.

       I'm well aware of what a phishing scam is and it is a form of hacking - hacking is not all about cracking encrypted passwords by brute force, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the targets OS, etc. Most successful hackers utilize combinations of social engineering and malware. It is, after all, much easier for me to trick someone into opening a compromised file than it is to attempt to worm my way through a firewall and implement changes - as an intruder - on a system myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the murder of Seth Rich goes, it makes little sense to publicly assassinate a man so blatantly after proving your opsec is so shoddy, given the scope of the actual data lost. It also makes little sense - speaking as a Democratic insider - for a Democratic insider to leak the information he did to Wikileaks. Frankly speaking I believe the Pizzagate allegations to be fantasy and the rest I consider to be a relatively minor internal DNC matter - blown out of proportion due to the timing and manner of Wikileaks releases and the hyperbolic nature of the recent election. The DNC had their thumb on the scale in favor of HRC? As a supporter of Senator Sanders, I can attest that everyone knew that. (I wanted DWS gone before the election cycle specifically because I knew that was why she had been placed there.) Occam's Razor suggests that this was done to damage the DNC and their primary candidate - not the likely act of a DNC insider. Occam's Razor also suggests, to me, that murdering that insider for leaking this simply creates more potential for self-harm to the organization. What's more, as a cyber security contractor, I'm very familiar with the means and methods of COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR - I have no trouble accepting that the original DNC Hack was their work based off the evidence I've seen out of Crowdstrike.

        As far as the murder of Seth Rich goes, it makes little sense to publicly assassinate a man so blatantly after proving your opsec is so shoddy, given the scope of the actual data lost.

       Well their opsec was so shoddy so they very well might of done it. Also occams razor suggests that the best way to silence a person is to remove them from the equation, i.e kill them. Otherwise good points.

       This sub invented a label "Unverified Allegations" and this is

       with that label.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why this sub is seeing a lot of anti-trump visitors is because of this explosive news (even if it is untrue you can't deny how elaborately awesome the conspiracy is).

       I'm so confused. Who is controlling the narrative? It's a classic conspiracy post but trumpets are rejecting it because it doesn't fit the narrative of this sub. If it's not pizzagate bullshit or Hillary emails they actually don't care... just stupid. Make Reddit great again.

       Nobody complains about inflated online users when it benefits them. People have suspected shills promoting pizzagate shit before the election. Online users inflated quite a bit then too. This is a big news item which caters to the majority of reddit. I'm truly not surprised and not suspicious. Just wait it out and they will leave again like every time before.

       r/conspiracy posts reach r/all fairly frequently and this post single-handedly just multiplied the viewer count to almost 6x normal numbers earlier.

       Absolutely. Try it. Google doesn't bite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you figure out the basics, I also recommend trying searching for other similar and related terms. You can also use syntax to change your search parameters. Google has tons of info on it. Just type your question in the box and discover the world of information the indexing site can show you.

       There's ZERO evidence of this Russian bullshit with Trump. Only main stream media trying to stir up a pot. The investigation was funded by Anti-Trump Republicans and Hillary Clinton donors. It's allegations with no proof being thrown out.

       Have you read the leaks? If you don't find anything suspicious or or strange that's your problem. There's definetly something creepy and strange in the leaks and the further connections people were able to draw from them.

       This sub invented a label "Unverified Allegations" and this is

       with that label.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why this sub is seeing a lot of anti-trump visitors is because of this explosive news (even if it is untrue you can't deny how elaborately awesome the conspiracy is) and people want to talk about it.

       It has been brigaded with pro trumpers since june or august. Trump threw out a lot of truths during his campaign to a lot of uneducated people. It's pretty easy to tell who's who if you spend any time here.

       And there is no 'name dropping' or verification from the legacy media pushing this story, so nothing to go on from them.  In other words, they are making the claims, but not backing them up.  NYT literally wrote in their article "But the declassified report contained no information about how the agencies had collected their data or had come to their conclusions."

       It's pretty amazing that they can't understand this. Anyone who's had a submission hit the top 50 or so will notice a sudden influx of messages to their inbox. You can tell the moment it's hit that point. Not that hard to comprehend why there are more people in here then usual. I came from a high up comment in the
       <a href="/r/politics">

       There are serious allegations that Russia has unprecedented dirt on Trump. Including that he was in a hotel room with prostitutes engaging in golden showers. When in our life time has anything this bizarre happened ? And days before inauguration we may have a President who is compromised ?

       Nope, I'm very much a sane person. What's more bizarre is these allegations are based on a 4chan troll post which the CIA ate up. However, if it's not a troll post and Russia has actual evidence (like video footage) why wouldn't they show that....why has the media held on to this story for so long. That's because nothing is really backing it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The buzzfeed article as well as the NYT article on this clearly states the info is unverified and holds a tentative narrative on if these allegations are even remotely true. Serious allegations is an absolute joke statement to make if you would actually read any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in knowing this the majority of the 7500 people that were here basically didn't read a fucking thing of it and were only here in the fleeting hope this thing is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is arguably much, much more bizarre. High ranking officials possibly raping children, but hey, that didn't bring in 7500 people here because that isn't a serious enough allegation apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what the number of people here and the massive upvoting of this article tells me that: A) people think it's funny B) there's a narrative being pushed C) people are much more interested in the entertainment value of a ridiculous story (even if true) as opposed to actual discussion of how the government doesn't give a shit about you or I or, and D) any chance possible to hang on to the notion that Clinton is any better and use any means necessary to somehow disqualify Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: before you assume I did not vote for Trump. I'm just not irrational and care about sensationalist stories that have so many god damn holes in it that it's laughable.

       1) i guess none of the other conspiracies to rock the internet and news over the past few months come close to this one? I suppose none of the other conspiracies that regularly hit r/all from r/conspiracy should receive the same interest or even remotely the same visitor count.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Yeah I don't actually believe everyone is a bot and shill, that's ridiculous. Do I believe there are paid shills? yes, and that is a fact it happens as there are companies and organizations who hire these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what really grinds my gears? That people are more concerned about some pissing story (lets be honest, most of the people here are here because of the blackmail story as opposed to the meat of the story about Russia's involvement in grooming Trump) then engaging in discussion about other conspiracies.

       I want to see 7500 people here discussing how the FED is actively engaging in ripping off the entire nation while we all pay for it. Lets fucking talk about that. Probably not sensationalist enough, though, and too boring for most.

       we are critical of Trump all the time here.  there are straightline trump supporters here, but that doesn't make up the majority of users.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as was seen with Reddit shutting down subs that were making unverified allegations about John Podesta and certain friends of his who run DC pizza shops- it would be a bit of a double standard to expect the mods here not to qualify a blatant and currently unsubstantiated accusation against the president elect.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are particularly sensitive to state-generated propaganda around here, and that's what it sounds like.  So you aren't flipping the script on us with this one.

       It depends on how the post title is worded.  A definitive unsubstantiated allegation is marked with "Rule 11" and subsequently removed from frontpage.  The reason they tagged this more specifically was because it had so many upvotes and they didn't want to just remove it immediately the way mods in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or

       would for a similar post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the title was something along the lines of "Intelligence agencies ALLEGE Trump was blackmailed by Russians" it would have stayed up if the post title is accurate and verifiable.

       you're right, but did the tag change?  because it's currently tagged as "4chan hoax and raid".  Maybe they deleted it because it was being brigaded.

       They did change the tag and its a ridiculous tag.  If anyone is brigading it is trump supporters trying to change the narrative that the document is the product of 4chan which is completely false.  4chan is photoshopping images to make it looks like ridiculous claims were made like dressing trump up in costumes and being put in an anime or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that an addendum relating to a report on Trumps ties to Russia exists is not what is in question.  The question is, is the document going around the internet legit and the actual document that was handed to obama, trump and 8 other high ranking officials
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fact that
       <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">

       some things are better off called out as propaganda.  I don't think this sub owed buzzfeed page views.  Let's donate those views to this excellent article by Glenn Greenwald:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Their most valuable instrument is the U.S. media, much of which reflexively reveres, serves, believes, and sides with hidden intelligence officials. And Democrats, still reeling from their unexpected and traumatic election loss as well as a systemic collapse of their party, seemingly divorced further and further from reason with each passing day, are willing — eager — to embrace any claim, cheer any tactic, align with any villain, regardless of how unsupported, tawdry and damaging those behaviors might be.

       No, why don't the Trump people get out. People who were against oppressive government, and oligarchy, just like Trump is going to enforce on The US, have been here long before the election, and we will be here after he has been impeached, and all his crooked elite cronies are kicked out of Washington.

       ' megathread about this, as an example of how the right would ignore actual conspiracies, with more evidence than Pizzagate. Not a traditional brigade but I'd guess that 90% of the upvotes aren't from regular browsers.

       Still, his point stands, it is a legitimate conspiracy theory, it's just against the republicans for a change, something we haven't seen since Bush did 9/11.

       really less evidence than some unnammed source no one is willing to support?

       lets see so far ive seen half a dozen twitter/imgur accounts with a bunch of really really sketchy shit involving kids, and a pizza place owner whos threatend the life of people doing research (who is now being investigated by the FBI for those threats) who has a ton of pedophile imagery on his social media and businesses, and is directly tied to a bunch of very high up people.
      </p>

       most of it is very circumstantial, but that is the only reason he hasnt been arrested or questioned as of yet. the fact that as they make a break through in finding the supposed "farm" and then this stupid crap gets dumped on the sub and mass upvoted by non-subscribers is usually a pretty good indicator they are trying to derail things.

       I keep seeing people post that, but as a long time lurker, theres often threads posted without any evidence or only a natural news link as the evidence. And people used to call those people out, same as there used to be a lot of people who would genuinely worry about the mental state of a poster and encourage them to get help (remember the guy who kept saying an evil AI controlled him?), and in the last few months its just become massively partisan and anything that hints that Trump isn't anything less than 100% perfect and Democrats 100% evil is automatically discarded as being posted by shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are failiable, every person and organisation has skeletons in their closet to a certain degree, and conspiracy used to be very on the nose about it, but since pizzagate got shut down, this place has just become pizzagate 2.0 to the exclusion of anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the shill accusations get really tiresome, just because someone posts something you don't agree with doesn't make them a shill, I'm sure it does happen though I don't agree it happens with the scale to which people here allege, but 63,620,704 people voted for Hilary, is it really that unbelievable that some of them post on reddit and are members of conspiracy and not shills?

       the reason for the shift is the sub has been under nearly constant attack since the snowden leaks came out, something that people have berated us for believing for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       the same groups started attacking trump and bernie during the primaries and then actual evidence of hillary and co rigging the primaries to fuck Sanders, and promote trump came out in the wikileaks releases.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason trump is given more of a pass is Hillary and the clinton foundation have been on our radar for nearly a decade, and the email leaks were the proof we have all been waiting for.
      </p>
      <p>
       from what i have seen it is a very small group who actually support trump directly, and the vast majority who know the Clintons were complete moral Voids and borderline monsters. trumps gotten a pass here, because a) the dirt on him is pretty laughable b) he doesnt have 10 years of ties to really dirty shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       for all the bullshit people peddle about the people here most of us are critical thinkers that are waiting to see what trump actually does before we bust out pitchforks knowing how much of the campaign accusations were utter horseshit.

       Thats a reasonable explanation, I don't agree 100% but I also don't see you as a rabid foaming at the mouth Trump supporter either.
   I still think if the pizzagate sub had been kept open and they cracked down on leaking personal info instead that r/conspiracy would be in a better place than it is now.

       as for the pizzagate stuff take a peak at voat.co, theyve kept things going, and are digging in to them. its still pretty circumstantial when its all looked at individually but there is a pretty disconcerting pattern emerging that is pretty fucking unsettling. actually look at the proof they are digging up and make your own judgements.

       It's amazing that the rest of you guys think you're important enough for people in r/politics to coordinate an attack on us, r/politics doesn't give a shit about us and thinks this sub is a huge joke, especially after we've pretty much been taken over by r/t_d. The people that would actually be bothering with us over Trump stuff would be r/EnoughTrumpSpam, r/SubredditDrama, or r/ShitRedditSays or other similar subs. r/politics is only interested in the current topics and their own circlejerk.

       It's not that we don't believe conspiracies about Trump, good number of us are BernieBros... it's that when you have to use a brigade of botnets to make your point, it kinda discredits you altogether.

       The related post in Politics hit like 25k comments last I checked. Seems probable that, given the allegation is of conspiracy at the highest lebels, this sub would see a spike in traffic given its hyper-relevant name.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's a much less exciting take on the situation than a shadowy cabal working to undermine your pure bastion of truth. Where's the good vs evil story in people looking at a topical sub? What a snoozefest that idea is.

       The news just broke, there's probably more on the way. Why do you jump to saying where is the proof when there's no proof for PG even though it's been discussed here forever. If that doesn't show you a bias I think you're blinded by your views

       I once saw a massively upvoted post about how Hunter S. Thompsons mentions of that gland that produces DMT are an obvious link to what the pizzagate people are doing to the kids, and then related it to the garden of Eden and said that the forbidden fruit is this gland.

       Not the first response to the garden of eden stuff.

       The trick to this sub is to never attack one side or the other, but rather bring up points in a nice manner while taking no sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, anything involving trump automatically has sides to it which is where all this comes from. And, its
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       difficult not to be angry sometimes in this sub, which we all slip up on from time to time. Especially if
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       chimes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all said, I personally believe this sub is ridiculous and I read it for the comedic aspect. Its genuinely interesting what some people think up!

       They appear to be burying the 4chan narrative, and boosting anti-Trump posts.

       Did the media, and CIA seriously believe a 4chan Trump fanfiction was a legit intelligence report?

       What happened yesterday was clearly a brigade, and the story has essentially been confirmed as a hoax. The report in question even contained Trump fanfiction from 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you may be human, that doesn't mean the sub wasn't brigaded yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       GoldenshowerGate or whatever you want to call it is mostly a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Trump support here, I've noticed some cross over of content between the_donald, but the comments are usually more balanced and critical here. More and more people are waking up because of the alt right which I consider a good thing. We're all just people and mostly Americans here.

       Not to mention almost ALL the comments are speaking about the "unverified allegations" and how that's ridiculous. However, part of the reason that it has that tag is the fact that buzzfeed literally stated in their own article "this is just unfounded allegations" it's kind of ironic to get upset about giving you the same information as the "article" makers.

       The post about trump for deleted even though it hit all and got so much attention. If you went in and saw people discussing it, it was obvious that the influx was from hitting all and not bots like the Donald uses. The mods of this sub put a tag on it which they don't on any post, even the most retarded of theories but now they deleted this one and made "unverified allegations" that 4chan started this theory. They're probably paid by Russia or the trump campaign to do this

       So it's begun. voat.co is more transparent than reddit.com, even if the model suffers from some of the same issues. But when you can see the exact number of up and down votes, it makes a difference.   voat.co

       Or, you know, an article that is different from the usual fare of r/conspiracy was posted, and people who have been part of this sub but who disagree with the general political flow of the sub upvoted it because it was something new and different and interesting, then it hit the front page for users that are subbed but don't always visit this sub, and they upvoted too, causing them to become active for the first time in a while.

       Yup, they claim we're all supporters of Donald Trump and claim how we "used" to be great and now we're shills. Their formula is super basic to figure out. If they turn any discussion into a political one, they're shill bots.

Just look how childish the front page is, "wah people dont believe my theory but believe others, wah a conspiracy is popular but it goes against my narrative please delete, wah you can be a so and so buy not a something else why is everyone unfair to me."

       It's a shame Reddit's admins won't do anything about blatant brigading but will happily create opaque 'algorithms' to bury organic user activity.

       I suspect that whoever or whatever has come here, the intention behind it seems to be to create the illusion that the completely bogus and unsubstantiated 35 page report that suddenly went public in another back-handed effort to try and smear Trump is true or that a majority of people actually believe that it's true, or more like a majority of people
       <em>
        should believe
       </em>
       that it's true... just like they were supposed to run with the pack on all the phoney election polls and unrelenting media hype surrounding those and constant trashing of Trump was supposed to goad them into doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's already been revealed that the report was a completely made-up hoax and something of a prank that went viral and seriously awry behind the scenes among Trump's enemies in both major parties and an over-reaching CIA who tried to use it in some desperate last ditch effort to save their own sorry asses and garner more support for disrupting or preventing Trump's inauguration and as an excuse for the inexcusable fuss and foot-dragging that the Dems are trying to delay and derail the confirmation hearings with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same kind of swamping by creatures or creations from "the swamp" also occurred when newer discussions over the long-standing controversies over fluoride and vaccines recently picked up more steam here with some further evidence to suggest that the government conspiracies behind those seem to be growing ever more evident and believable by the day.
      </p>

       The fluoride discussion was prompted by fluoride finally, and "officially" being declared to be a potent neurotoxin in a well respected medical dictionary, despite that fact that's been well-established one in scientific journals for decades. It's initial and major use was as a highly successful insecticide and they're a damn sight harder to poison and kill than mere humans are.
      </p>
      <p>
       That conversation naturally enough drifted into the toxic elements that are also in vaccines and that whole can of worms just ahead of the major and real news announcement that Trump wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to finally lead a full and thorough investigation into the whole vaccine controversy.
      </p>

       Of course this forum exists precisely because those of us here all harbour big-time suspicions and have a general distrust of any authorities trying to convince us of something they have a vested interest in getting us to believe in the face of any number of relevant and related facts and incidents that all stand in direct opposition to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relevant and related facts and incidents that they go out of their way to ridicule and dismiss out of hand or else viciously attack anyone that happens to raise any quite honest and legitimate concerns about and who are only looking for a straight answer but never seem to be able to get one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The globalist and elitist house of cards has quite literally been "Trumped" and is now collapsing with no way to stop it and it's picking up speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The looming audit of the Fed making it's way through Congress will be yet another major blow to them if it makes it's way all the way through and that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is merely the thin edge of a wedge rising from the ground up beneath it on the backs of all the ordinary people who are beginning to remember that they were and actually are free and not obliged to bow, kow-tow, or kiss ass for anyone and are tired of being told to bend over for some more abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't sell or give up any of their rights to be free, equal, and fairly treated, or to have themselves governed according to those principles, that's a lie that's been deliberately foisted upon them by utterly ruthless elitists who've never respected those principles or values in the first place and are motivated by nothing more than their own unadulterated greed and a perverse ambition to rule over everyone else like petty dictators and tyrants. An ambition that doesn't just affect ordinary Americans, but the vast majority of all the very ordinary people around the entire world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously Trump's enemies are seeing themselves being steadily undermined and undone by social media, forums like Reddit, and an alt media on the net that pays as much attention to that as it does to all the double-talk, misdirection, and fake news the mainstream media dishes out for those elitists and they're trying to find some way to stop or steer it as far away from of the spotlight as possible.

       . I don't understand how so many forget that people don't have to actively come to or seek out this sub. This sub can make it it to the front page and be seen by everyone. Especially when the top post on all of Reddit right now is a conspiracy, it's only natural it bleeds over here.

       i agree completely. once a story gets big enough swings right into r/all and basically gets flooded with blue pilled zombies. however, this story in particular got to the front page r/conspiracy faster than  bullet, which leads me to believe that this was orchestrated. Seriously the story is not that big for it to explode that fast on this sub. it was at the front page withing 20 minutes and to top it off the story came from buzzfeed? really?.  Not really a trump supporter or shillary for that matter but something smells here.

       Yeah but that's my point, someone raised the idea that conspiracy theorists won't legitimize this actual conspiracy, and people organically came over here, albeit with the intention to upvote anti-establishment posts. It's just a bit funny because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       thinks that they elected the ultimate anti-establishment candidate, when all they did was elect a washington insider, who has spent his career buying politicians.

       Remember that he actually admitted to buying politicians by the way.

       I'm talking about years ago, before this election cycle. This sub had a mix of liberal/libertarian undertones. It was anti-Hillary, but not like it's current form where Clinton is the devil and Trump doesn't exist/has never done anything wrong.

       I've been coming to this sub a few years now and have never seen a post mentioning this, nor the sheer number of people in here at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy posts reach r/all fairly frequently and this post single-handedly just multiplied the viewer count to almost 6x normal numbers earlier.

      <p>
       That's quite bizarre, especially considering this whole thing seems to be about a made up 4chan fantasy story.

       No i'm saying you can't know these things for sure because you weren't there. By definition you don't know for sure because someone else told you. Use some logic. And those are surface level facts, descriptions of what happened. You have to be more interested in why things happened so ill rephrase your "facts" for you and all of a sudden you need more facts bro. "Why did Bush invade Iraq?", "Why did Obama escalate in Afghanistan?" and "Why did Trump get help from Russia?".

       What the fuck are you talking about with regards to ammo? Have you been to a gun store ever in your life? Jesus Christ. I just bought a thousand 5.56 rounds for cheaper than I ever have. And it was stacked in a pile with probably another 100k rounds. Where you could buy any type of round from .22 to .50 cal.

       Showing my ID to the cashier was the most oppressive thing in my life though!

       Nope. Yesterday this comment appeared almost at the top of the thread when sorted by "top", at the top of the 2nd or 3rd highest rated comment chain. Right this very second it still appears very high up, meaning it's been seen by literally 10s to 100s of thousands of individuals over the course of the thread's existence.
