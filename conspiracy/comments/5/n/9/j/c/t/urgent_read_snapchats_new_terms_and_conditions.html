        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">48</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RedTapedSpacePanda.html">RedTapedSpacePanda</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recommend you do NOT accept their new terms and conditions. Read them for yourself if you&#39;d like (i recommend you do this, here is a link --&gt; <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms/">https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms/</a> ), but I will give a breif summary of what I&#39;ve found.. By accepting to these terms and conditions, you are legally entering a legal contract between you and Snap inc. It&#39;s important you keep this in mind, because it could cause legal implications down the road (and remember, I am no lawyer, just a concerned citizen. If you can add anything, make corrections, offer up your own thoughts, or choose to discuss, I highly encourage you to do so below in the comments) </p>

<p>By accepting this:</p>

<p>-&#39;You give snapchat a license to use whatever you create, send, receive, post, upload, and store as content.&#39;</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;You grant Snap Inc. and their affiliates (which could be ANYONE they say they&#39;re affiliated with) a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content.&#39;</li>
</ul>

<p>-&#39;You also grant them a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).&#39;</p>

<p>-&#39;To the extent it’s necessary (which could be to ANY extent that they deem necessary), when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant Snap Inc., their affiliates (Again, possibly anyone), and their business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice.&#39;.. (This means they could legally impersonate you, or even frame you, for anything or any reason they want.) And it states &#39;either on the Snapchat application or on one of their business partner’s platforms.&#39; So they can use it on other things besides snapchat.</p>

<p>-&#39;They may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if they think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.&#39;.. They can legally silence anyone who speaks out against the establishment or tries to spread truth or awareness. </p>

<p>-&#39;Much of the content on their Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although Snap Inc. reserves the right to review or remove all content that appears on the Services, they do not necessarily review all of it. So they cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.&#39;</p>

<p>-&#39;You must also respect Snap Inc.’s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:
 • use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.
 •copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.
 •use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.&#39;..
&quot;In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.&quot;</p>

<p>-&#39;You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your Snapchat account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure.&#39;.. This means that anything that happens on your account, you&#39;ll be responsible for. So they (cause you have them permission to impersonate you) or anyone else who has access to your account could easily frame you for something. </p>

<p>-&#39;By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:
 •You will not create more than one account for yourself.
 •You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.
 •You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your Snapchat account, Live, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend link without our written permission.
 •You will not share your password.
 •You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.&#39;</p>

<p>-&#39;For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.&#39;.. With what was stated before, they could use this to impersonate you. </p>

<p>-&#39;You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Inc., their affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.&#39;</p>

<p>Of course i cannot get into all of the terms and conditions or the privacy policy, nor go through all the possibilities of what accepting this could lead to. I&#39;m merely spreading awareness about the possible dangerous side of this contract. I highly suggest you go over this stuff yourself (here&#39;s the link again --&gt; <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms/">https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms/</a> ). I am not a lawyer either, just a concerned person. With the possibility of martial law coming and freedom of speech being limited even more, this could be bad in the future. Btw, i use apostrophes ( &#39; ) instead of quotation marks ( &quot; ) because i copy and pasted most of this directly from the terms and conditions and i mainly just changed ownership stuff (i.e, i changed &quot;our&quot; to &quot;their&quot;, &quot;we&quot; to &quot;they&quot;, ect. Basic stuff like that.) Hope this helps someone! You should ALWAYS know what you&#39;re agreeing to before you accept. </p>

<p>Edit: I have no idea why that Snap ic. picture is there, I did not post that. </p>
