       No posts from here on r/all. Suspicious number of anti-Trump articles with the same message appeared at the top of the front page within minutes. Explain.

       I'm all for unpartisan discussion, but this just seems incredibly fabricated. And please tell me if the 2500 users here is not out of the ordinary because I don't think I've seen that many users here in over a few weeks at lease.

       This is insane. Clearly a fabricated, and planned event. Over twice the normal users are here. That means it's likely that over half of them are shills. Complete sub takeover.

       Oddly enough, Buzzfeed is currently employing a pretty good team of journalists. At some point they decided to move beyond the lists and actually investigate.

       How is this one of the biggest conspiracies?  We generally agree politicians at the highest levels are controlled by TPTB.  I would say most in this sub would be in agreement that this reads are some serious fucking propaganda.  So time to be critical thinkers and consider the motivations for this story and what is at play in the bigger picture.  Who is pulling the strings...It's continuing the pattern of "allege" and Russia, but we aren't biting.  Certainly not the biggest conspiracy ever imo.  Political candidates are not worth us arguing over.  We do not need any of them.  Their function is unnecessary, and not worth the division of man.  But how to we take control back from TBTP?  We got to think bigger and continue to talk about these things

       This is over 5 times the normal amount around 1200. I have been noticing reddit servers were bogged down about an hour ago. 
Youtbe was acting weird to. Video's wouldn't play. And bing search engine servers were over loaded couple of hours ago. IC have never seen bing servers give a overload message before. Then I come here, and the numbers are huge. Something is going down.

       it cant be so hard to figure out if someone is a bot or a paid actor... just analyzing and adding swarm behavior and bots to the reddit upvote algorithm with correction factors should be possible by a admin script.
6000 users upvoting the same thing roughly the same time and moving being logged in at the same time ... having the same interactions.

       You can tell they are shills or don't post here cos literally all the posts are partisan shit like "oh you're so mad now trump is caught out!!!"

       I come here once every few months, pretty much whenever some crazy shit happens. It's fun to see what the people here have to say about important issues of the day. I'm guessing that's the main reason why everyone else stopped by. The popped in, saw the show, and then started leaving. I didn't even see your post on the front page, for that matter.

       I know it might be hard to believe, but once in a while people do stuff without anyone pulling their strings behind the scenes.

       <a href="/r/wikileaks">

       . They have this sub listed in their side bar. It's how I first discovered this sub in the first place. I'm not sure if

       A steadily increasing number of users as a post about the president elect possibly having ties to America's longest standing enemy hits the front page and then the number of users decreases as the US goes to bed. I wonder what on Earth could be going on here...

       Conspiracy got a post that reached r/all by the time you posted. That usually makes the numbers tick up temporarily. There are still shills galore but I don't think that's the answer here.

       And that anti-Trump buzzfeed piece? From a user that almost exclusively uses Reddit in Russian? I have the front page of r/conspiracy open at all times and browse it continuously at work. That article got from nowhere on "hot" to #1 within at most 5 minutes that I didn't refresh. And the fact that there isn't anything from here on r/all makes the number of users here very interesting.

       I never thought they'd do something as obvious as this. They are getting desperate. I'm excited to see what their final play is. I saw another post that said that they are going to go all out and stage the Alien invasion. Who the fuck knows at this point.

       I think something may happen before January 20th and Obama will stay in office, or they will influence WW3 or an economic collapse (maybe both) and blame it on trump. Or trump is really on their side could and is just be playing an act and he does bullshit stuff over the next few years. I guess only time will tell, if anyone had info or sources or ideas or anything, I'd love to hear them!

       I'm sure you came from r/all. I was here as it was breaking. IF the thread wasn't manipulated, it would have been heavily downvoted initially, and then slowly gained momentum as it got more popular. It would have taken awhile to put that on the front page here organically. However, it was at #1 within nearly 5 min, followed by the users on the sub tripling within an hour
       <em>
        without anything from here being on r/all.
       </em>
       I was checking, I wanted an explanation for the absurd amount of users. It's obvious that this is fabricated and if you frequented this sub often, you would know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recognize that this sub is significantly pro Trump. I am not a Trump supporter myself, but knowing how significantly pro Trump this sub is, there is no fucking way that it got upvoted that quickly. It's from fucking buzzfeed, that shit flies in r/politics but anyone here knows buzzfeed is cancer.

       America is the #1 military power in the world. The possibility that another country has succeeded in implementing "their guy" in control is a big, big deal. And allegations from the government carry a lot more weight in swaying public opinion than random people on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . Whether this report is true or not it is a conspiracy either way because it impacts public opinion massively. Besides that, the vast majority of reddit is American so that's what we're concerned about.

       Holy grail?  Trust us, the holy grail of conspiracies will have nothing to do with politics.  These political figures, false idols, serve TPTB.  There is much that is being kept from us, and a buzzfeed article with the words "allege" and Russia doesn't exactly register as the "holy grail".  Think bigger brother.  Our politicians will never take an interest in you and I but you and I can help each other in many tangible ways...Unless we are arguing over politics, you know?

       You and I have never had any say in who becomes president.  If you are sincere you should stick around the sub after this passes.  There will no doubt discussion on things bigger than these false idol politicians.  What's on the horizon?  What are TPTB aiming for?  Personally I am not so interest in the politics as I am in the occult knowledge, but either way, this sub is fucking great.  Think bigger than politicians, there is much being kept from us.

       That's your view. There are 400,000 other subscribers here. They all have different views. Not everyone subscribes to the NWO idea, nor to flat earth, lizard people, flouride, etc. That's what
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       make this sub great - a genuine variety of alternative minded people examining different possibilities of what's really going on. Also I'm not sure if this is an alt of someone else but if you really are a 1 year old account I'm pretty amused by your suggestion that I "stick around the sub".

       But we should both agree arguing over political false idols is small small picture stuff.  We should both strive for a better community.  A political candidate causing division is an absurd thought when you consider the big picture.

       Honestly, this is very different. Those posts hit r/all. Those grew organically. This is clearly a forced article that got thousands of upvotes within an hour, it was at the top within 5 minutes. That is not normal, and there are currently over twice the normal amount of users,

       Bud I've been a regular on this dumbass sub for 4+ years, I'm not sure why you're implying that you're more "real" than I am. It's the #1 topic on the internet now so yeah of course I believe it would get some upvotes from people like me. There are 400k+ subscribers here and believe it or not there actually are a variety of viewpoints.

       So being a regular on the sub, you'd know that there's a max of 1500 users here normally, maybe gets up to 3k if it's something big. There are nearly 6k here right now and that is significant. I understand that there are a variety of viewpoints, and I, myself, am not even a Trump supporter. But when I see an article get artificially upvoted to r/all within an hour, it should be pretty clear what's happening. This was not an organic thread, it was taken over and controlled from the beginning. It's naive to think that an anti Trump article from
       <em>
        buzzfeed
       </em>
       would make it to the top in 5min. That just wouldn't happen. And that's me acknowledging that this sub has been overwhelmingly pro Trump lately. That post was manipulated to the top within minutes and there were over 2500 users here before anything hit r/all. That is extremely significant.

       I really doubt it, I wish I had done that, but I just had one page open to the front of r/conspiracy after continuously browsing hot and rising and didn't see the post anywhere, about 5 min went by because I was working, and I opened another r/conspiracy page and saw it sitting at #1, looked at the amount of users and immediately recognized something significant is occurring. I wish someone had proof.

       I always try to take everything with a grain of salt, but regardless of my political leanings, that kind of vote manipulation is fishy, especially so with shift that came with the events of the last year on this sub. I'm not trying to start a debate, but the main reason i believe you is how impossible it would normally be to upvote to the top anything critical of Trump.

       think it would be possible to pull up that timeframe on archive or wayback?

       Exactly. Thank you. I don't support Trump, there's a lot I'd like changed, but I spend nearly all my time on r/conspiracy and I know for a fact that a buzzfeed article critical of Trump would not make it anywhere
       <em>
        for at least a half hour
       </em>
       on r/conspiracy
       <em>
        even with help from r/all.
       </em>
       I recognize how uncomfortably pro Trump this sub is. I think that will likely go away as he has time to be corrupt
       <em>
        in office
       </em>
       if he decides to be corrupt. I think once he is actually president and has to be held accountable for the "because you'd be in jail" sort of stuff, r/conspiracy will go back to being a more normal conspiracy sub and be less partisan. But right now, anything anti Trump goes nowhere fast and that article would have been no different because it's unverified and from buzzfeed. Any regular here knows that's bullshit and would downvote the shit out of it. No way it happened organically, this was a fabricated and coordinated takeover. I'd say maybe half weren't shills and real folks from r/all, but the way it started, there's no way that wasn't a coordinated brigade of some kind.

       They are not downvoting completely. They are in "downvote control", just making sure the posts that they don't want to catch fire stay down, without getting them under the 50% threshold of upvotes. They're suffocating gently the truth to make it less noticeable.

       I can speak as someone who was looking around here that doesn't often stop by: I came to see if you all were actually
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , or just the wild ideas division of

       .  Its a bit funny to see, actually, how something that has just as much evidence as things posted on here just get dismissed forthright because it might be bad for a conservative leader, instead of a liberal one.

       That's not what's happening. I'm always happy to entertain any conspiracy about anyone. I prefer the discussion be nonpartisan because the two party system is the source of America's unproductive government. What is happening now is over double the normal amount of active users are active. An anti-Trump article appeared at #1 within 10 minutes of being posted, a very rare occurrence in this sub if you haven't noticed. I don't think
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       buzzfeed article has been #1 before, for good reason. This is so clearly a fabricated event, it's hard
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to support Trump at this point, for me. Just because of how much is obviously against him.

       The thread is entirely against the spirit of this sub.  Be in Trump or Clinton or whoever each candidate is met with an inherent distrust as they are controlled by TPTB.  Politics dumbs people down and gets them arguing over false idols.  When really is any candidate worth that sort of division?  That's why it's shady as fuck that thread is reading the way it is right now.

       Right? The first comment, and the most upvoted, defines "conspiracy," justifying the thread being here. It's so clearly fabricated it makes me want to puke. How can they not see that this is

       All I can say is that the political spam started about a month or two ago.  Both sides spammed political nonsense.  By large as a community the idea of allowing division because of political candidate is absurd, petty, and small picture thinking.  tptb run the show and whoever is the president will not be serving my best interest nor your best interest.  But you and I can help each other in many tangible ways if we stop arguing politics.  Stick around this sub, I think you'll be able to discern the real conversation from the spam that's been hitting this sub hard the past 8 weeks.  We are all bigger than politics, we just have to address this truth together

       You just have to look at what the mods favor. The one  anti trump article gets plastered as "unverified". The only unverified tag the sub has ever seen. That's not partisan? This is 80% a pro trump subreddit and donald2.0

Both parties have active "shill" campaigns going on in this sub, but is it so hard to look past them?  Again, what political figure is ever worth arguing over when I can help you in many more tangible ways?  Can we at least consider that the comments in this sub are at least possibly artificial as well as the posters?  Who is really sitting there posting these political articles, suddenly, day after day, every minutes, for 8 straight weeks now.  That alone should incite a bigger discussion about how and who is shaping our reality.

       If the mods bring it up, great. If not, this is basically the same as politics or the Donald. One side has totally dominated here and it turns off moderates.

       You and I are still here.  Others as well.  I think people are genuinely attracted to this sub and slowly will make their way here organically.  The spam is easy to identify, so when someone says they smell shit, you and I and others will still smell the shit as well.  Shitwinds of truth, Randy

       Or maybe the majority of reddit doesn't share your opinions? Actually I'm going to go so far as to say not even the majority of people that know you share your opinions. Shit, everybody I know doesn't share my exact opinions, but I don't call them shills for liking something I don't.

       I understand that. But you don't realize that that post got forced to #1 in less than 10 min. I was watching. The sub normally as 1500 users top, and at this time it's more like 1200. Before the article was even posted, there were well over 2k here. This sub is extremely pro Trump if you haven't noticed. I'm not a staunch Trump supporter, but I'll admit that this sub tends to be significantly pro Trump, and most who frequent the sub would know that a buzzfeed article wouldn't make it anywhere. And, if everyone came from r/politics to upvote that thread to r/all and go off on their bullshit, wouldn't that be considered brigading? The thread was obviously manipulated. There is absolutely no way an anti Trump buzzfeed article would be accelerated that quickly on r/conspiracy without a coordinated brigade.

       I was asking for a link to the comment that linked somewhere to r/conspiracy because that would explain the timing of the absurd increase in users on the sub. I saw that it was in r/politics and it should have stayed there.

       Honestly, I think everyone is well aware about how this sub is significantly pro Trump. I'm not personally a Trump supporter, but you would have to do a lot of convincing to make me believe that an anti Trump buzzfeed article
       <em>

       </em>
       organically on this sub. Nothing does that, not even if the Bill Clinton raping a 9 year old girl video was released.

       But that's not how news works. When you hear of something happening in the news and want more info or want to discuss it, what do you do? You turn the news on or go to a news site. You hear about something happening with politics? You go to a politics site. You hear about something that sounds worthy of a conspiracy, you check out
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . Relevant content draws users.

       This subs Trumpiness has been wavering and fluctuating, but more importantly, all bets are off when users start coming from elsewhere.

       I haven't seen spez make that claim about mods. Admins would almost certainly have that power, but I suspect mods wouldn't. Also, the mods here seem to generally be quite good about supporting Truth and not being corrupted, so I'm inclined to think they don't shoulder any of the blame here. Admins could be rigging votes, but honestly, I think the more likely scenario is just organized sockpuppet accounts and bought votes from businesses dedicated to offering that kind of "service".

       you seem to have read it. His point was that anyone with access to the back end of the site has the ability to change anything. He's also openly talked about his efforts to engage in vote manipulation via their algorithm. The mods of various subs have their own censorship methods through their "rules" . Go be butt hurt somewhere else

       And that happens every week with some bs article with nothing backing them up. It gets pushed to r/all, flooded with stupid and distracting comments, and points out a caveat discrediting the entire argument.

       As opposed to basically being r/the_donald the last few months? If half of this stuff is true, it's a massive conspiracy. And you people can't understand why it would be a big topic on a sub called r/conspiracy. Jesus Christ. Just because this isn't a safe space for trump supporters doesn't mean that the big bad shills are out to get you.

       If the whole thing was a troll that the media just propagated, then they'll lose even more credibility. It would be nice to show more evidence of the media's corruption and bias.

       No, because it shouldn't be taken seriously. It's buzzfeed, and they say themselves that the claims are unverified, parts could be false, and it's from an anonymous source. No one should take that seriously and anyone who frequents r/conspiracy would know that. Sure, it's a conspiracy, but when it gets upvoted to 11k in a few hours, it should be clarified that the article is full of shit.

       Nobody thinks this is because of Julian Assanges AMA? Thousands of redditors visited that AMA, it being so conspiracy heavy just makes sense that this subreddit gets more trafic.

       I came here to see how this sub reacted to the recent Trump allegations.  I was hoping this sub wasn't just designed to attack any opponent of Trump.  Sadly, this sub isn't about conspiracies but about taking dpwn anything that makes Trump look bad or his opponents look good.

       it seems like there's a ridiculous amount of pro-vax propaganda going on today. i'm fully vaxed with a fully vaxed kid so i'm not an over-the-top hate all vaccines, hate all pharma kind of person, i'm more just a cautious, skeptical trying to figure things out kind of person, and i just see a lot of really, really pro-vax stuff in the last 24 hours. i wonder if teams were sent out in response to the kennedy news or if it is a true reflection of the general public's views.

       I agree. I don't know what it is, but it's hard to believe there's not something bigger at play. There's a lot going on that we're unaware of. All this propaganda is the result of a coordinated effort to manipulate and deceive.

       try sticking to non partisan based logic while you are here. The two party system is bullshit and it's the reason our government is divisive and unproductive. Don't conform to it.

       I haven't seen spez make that claim about mods. Admins would almost certainly have that power, but I suspect mods wouldn't. Also, the mods here seem to generally be quite good about supporting Truth and not being corrupted, so I'm inclined to think they don't shoulder any of the blame here. Admins could be rigging votes, but honestly, I think the more likely scenario is just organized sockpuppet accounts and bought votes from businesses dedicated to offering that kind of "service".

       If these allegations are true, Trump is literally guilty of treason for collusion with Russia.  Sounds like an actual fucking conspiracy, but what do I know, I'm just a paid shill, right?
