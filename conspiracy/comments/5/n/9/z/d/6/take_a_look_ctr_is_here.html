    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a suggestion: to spread disinformation and confuse discussion. When the lower classes organize to a certain point, the upper class gets guillotined. It&#39;s in the interest of corrupt political groups to hire shills to interrupt that process of organization.</p>

<p>Turn their attention in every direction. Break up cohesion. It&#39;s the Russians, no it&#39;s the CIA, no it&#39;s Trump, no it&#39;s Hillary, no it&#39;s Pizzagate, no it&#39;s Fake News, no it&#39;s the Alt-Right, no it&#39;s BLM, no it&#39;s...and on and on. Turn them against each other. Invent plausible fakes to distract discussion. If and when a critical mass start going towards a fake lead, advance another fake, or even the truth, but in a divisive way. <strong>Make them unable to tell who is a shill and who is not.</strong></p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which is the right lead. It doesn&#39;t matter, in the end, whether a small group keeps going after the right thing. What matters is that in the end, nobody be able to tell real from fake, and that the folks who take direct action are few enough and dehumanized enough to be dealt with by security, ideally as they tilt at a purpose-made windmill. Obfuscate enough and the targets start doing the decohering on their own with no further input from shill groups.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the real hits, the original ones before the obfuscation efforts, were Pizzagate and the CIA. That&#39;s my intuition derived from observations that aren&#39;t easily cited, so I don&#39;t expect you to believe me instantly. But right now it&#39;s easy to see how divided things are and how the country has well and truly decohered into Right and Left, with the moderates being subsumed into either faction, and with both factions following competing and mutually exclusive narratives. But two armed camps are still dangerous to the elite. They&#39;ll be looking for ways to divide us more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kinda sad. The logic is right there in their face. r/politics, a sub with a pretty damn high level of traffic, exploded about 2-3 hours ago over a potential Trump conspiracy. In that thread -- a thread with literally <strong>10s of thousands</strong> of comments and upvotes  -- many references to the r/conspiracy sub were made, being that this sub is for, uhm, well, conspiracies. So why is it a surprise that several thousand individuals like myself, who have never been here before, then checked this sub after seeing it discussed in a <em>massively</em> active sub now on r/all?</p>

<p>For a sub that claims to be super thoughtful and logical... I&#39;m not sure how they haven&#39;t pieced that together, and are instead assuming &quot;nah bro it&#39;s Hillary Clinton&#39;s bot army&quot; and shit. </p>

<p>Thanks... I needed a chuckle this morning. </p>

<p>See how anti-Clinton material is treated on this sub. See Pizzagate, the stupidest fucking thing I&#39;ve heard in my life, being treated as gospel. And then look at this sub having a fucking aneurysm over some anti-Trump material being posted. How many &#39;we are being brigaded by ctr/bots/commies&#39; posts are there on the front page right now? Do you remember that when a Pizzagate post reached the front page?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Some experts on digital campaigns think the idea of launching a paid army of “former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers” and others to produce online counterattacks is unlikely to prove successful. Others, however, say Clinton has little choice but to try, given the ubiquity of online assaults and the difficulty of squelching even provably untrue narratives once they have taken hold.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, using a super PAC to create a counterweight to movements that have sprung up organically is another reflection of the campaign’s awkwardness with engaging online, digital pros said.</p>

<p>“It is meant to appear to be coming organically from people and their social media networks in a groundswell of activism, when in fact it is highly paid and highly tactical,” said Brian Donahue, chief executive of the consulting firm Craft Media/Digital.</p>

<p>“That is what the Clinton campaign has always been about,&quot; he said. &quot;It runs the risk of being exactly what their opponents accuse them of being: a campaign that appears to be populist but is a smokescreen that is paid and brought to you by lifetime political operatives and high-level consultants.”</p>

<p>The task force designed to stop the spread of online misinformation and misogyny is the brainchild of David Brock, a Clinton confidant who once made a career of spreading such misinformation and misogynistic attacks against her and Bill Clinton. His critics say he kept his taste for dirty tricks when he switched sides to become one of the Clintons’ most valued operatives.</p>

<p>The mere mention of Correct the Record makes some critics seethe. Super PACs are typically prohibited from working in tandem with candidates, but Correct the Record is doing just that by exploiting a loophole in campaign finance law that it says permits such coordination with digital campaigns.</p>

<p>“Clinton, herself, is saying we need campaign finance reform,” said Paul Ryan, deputy executive director of the Campaign Legal Center, an advocacy group. “Yet her lawyers are pushing the boundaries to get around campaign finance laws.”</p>

<p>Brock referred questions to Elizabeth Shappell, a spokesperson for the super PAC, who emailed a brief statement saying that Barrier Breakers, as the effort is labeled, &quot;is only engaged in positive content, even when responding to offensive content, and is always identified&quot; as Correct the Record, she wrote. The email also emphasized that Correct the Record is spending the million dollars in a way that it argues is legal under rules governing super PACs.&quot;</p>

In fact, most of them focus almost entirely on anti-Clinton, anti-Democrat, anti-left politics - something I had never seen on this site (on this scale) until last year.

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, buddy. All I&#39;m saying is that there are a lot &quot;anti-CTR&quot; accounts that are super young and spam anti-Clinton shit. I tried to make it clear that I wasn&#39;t specifically calling you out, since you&#39;ve posted comments and posts in a variety of subs. I thought maybe you would see the flaws in your reasoning, but you got defensive and acted like an asshole. Still, you should check out some of the accounts in those subs I mentioned, because I&#39;ve seen quite a few young ones that spam bullshit posts and comments like yours.  </p>

<p>BTW, I did ctrl + f &quot;pizza&quot; in that thread and scrolled through the 24 mentions that were available on the first page. You know what I saw? A majority of the accounts posting about pizza have been active for years. Those that are younger have been active in numerous subreddits. Maybe you forgot where you are, but here on reddit, you&#39;ll see the same joke told 100 different ways. Yes, there are a handful of users who don&#39;t hang out in this retarded circlejerk of a subreddit that are smart enough to see that pizza gate is bullshit. That doesn&#39;t mean there are bots or paid shills brigading this sub.  </p>

<p>Afraid that some politicians name might get a smudge next to it versus investigating the largest child sexploitation ring in recorded human history(allegely)</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t make sense, i know skeptics of pizzagate but i don&#39;t know a single person who is not okay with a investigation to get to the truth. </p>

<p>And when put in context of church sex scandals, people will be more suspectible to believing that the super profitable Child Trafficking might be involved with a $1,500,000,000.00 HRC Loss</p>
