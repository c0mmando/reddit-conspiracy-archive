<p>This literally isn&#39;t true, I was repeatedly called &quot;CTR&quot; because I made fun of trump.</p>

<p>Face it, you guys are pro trump and call anyone you don&#39;t like CTR. You ignored all the obvious fake pro trump shilling on here.</p>

<p>Now you have to make up that CTR is somehow still around AFTER the election because face it, you cannot handle discussion with people that have different views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really think it is the new algorithm and the typical mindset of redditors. Maybe a nudge here and there, a bit of bots/brigading to start off the avalanche, but this is the what the rest of reddit looks like. They hate Trump (and Wikileaks -his AMA was a shitshow). Here at r/conspiracy we want real proof, real fucking verifiable sources, and we distrust the msm and government...not out there. People believe that shit. &quot;If the CIA says something, it must be true.&quot; </p>

<p>So no, I just think we got on the radar and hopefully we will get off it soon. And the the real work will begin. Finding out where, what, how and who. The truth will emerge here, but by then all the tourists will have left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, you Hitlerinas really are a pathetic joke.</p>

<p>You act smug about &quot;evidence&quot; while fucking running around parroting talking points about how anyone who doesn&#39;t suck down some anonymous <strong>claims</strong> from a fuckign PDF is a &quot;Russia bot&quot; or &quot;Trumpet&quot;. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a fucking moron and a piece of shit fucking shill. Go fuck yourself with a rusty knife, CTR trash.</p>

<p>Newsflash: Hitlerinas like you do not dictate reality with your feelings.</p>

<p>Your feelings are not &quot;evidence&quot;. </p>

<p>Claims by an authority figure you <em>FEEL</em> is a good person are <em>NOT EVIDENCE</em>.</p>

<p>Fuck off.</p>

<p>They&#39;d have to ignore a ton of hard evidence to come to that conclusion...so I don&#39;t really know. </p>

<p>a few thousand paid upvotes in the first hour or so is enough to push it to social media critical mass to get it on to the front page and then brings in non-subscribers. but there is no way something this stupid ever got that many upvotes from actual subscribers here.

The default subreddits like politics/news/etc are completely controlled by left-wing CTR shill mods, and places like T_D are controlled by the opposite side and ban if you present dissenting opinions/facts.</p>

<p>This place is closer to neutral and speculative theories aren&#39;t buried by downvotes, so it&#39;s a good place to exchange ideas with people. I&#39;ve actually started coming here over most other subreddits to talk about current events and i&#39;m definitely not paid to do it.</p>

<p>IMO everyone should refer to it that way too, don&#39;t use their name. It&#39;s a 4chan RP story 100% just looking at it, and there&#39;s no evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Brock&#39;s Correct the Record shill team never went away. They merely reformed under the &quot;American Bridge&quot; name. Look:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Liberal political operative David Brock, a close ally of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, told reporters on Tuesday that his super PAC, American Bridge, has established a war room that will act as an aggressor and a watchdog for the Trump transition team and his incoming administration.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>American Bridge has established a rapid response team that will fact-check Trump’s claims in real time.</strong> Experts are said to be combing through Trump’s domestic and foreign business interests, his personal life, his charitable foundation and those he has associated with, using Freedom of Information Act requests to uncover new details.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Brock said that Media Matters will need to retrain its focus from monitoring Fox News and conservative talk radio to <strong>combating a scourge of fake news and conspiracy theories that have percolated online.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/308978-top-dem-super-pac-launches-anti-trump-war-room">Source</a></p>

<p>David Brock owned and operated Correct the Record.</p>

<p>The former Correct the Record operation is probably still intact and operating under the American Bridge name now.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t tell if something was released that they are now going to try burying, or if it&#39;s finally hit /conspiracy -</p>

<p>if it has...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expect massive anti-trump instead of the usual lack of give a fuck, other than refuting bullshit claims.   </p></li>
<li><p>Expect liberal beliefs to be spouted repeatedly - when this happens, there will be no links to their claims.  They will not argue your point, but instead either alter what you&#39;ve said into a claim you didn&#39;t make, then argue that, or claim you are attacking them (Victim card OP).   They will not become enraged, this is what they are trying to evoke from you.  They will remain calm and shill on.   I&#39;m not saying people like that don&#39;t exist, but not in the numbers it hit other threads at.   The biggest tell is statements like &quot;If you believe that...(insult)&quot; - usually inside paragraphs.  Don&#39;t get paranoid, but remember someone who truly believes something will have a very in depth explanation and will defend said belief and argue the counter points you produce.   They will not change your argument unless they are mentally unwell, or shilling/trolling.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Screaming shill at them does nothing.  It also just so happens that a lot of people who claim shill are wrong - I also believe this is a tactic used by shills to discredit, but can&#39;t prove it.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do, is to just argue the points, and if they go off topic, state that if they would like to remain on topic, you&#39;ll continue the conversation, if not, you have no interest.  </p>

<p>As Secretary of State, Hillary approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to the Russian state-owned firm ‘Uranium One’, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.  She literally sold off a rare and prime material used in nukes to a country we are at odds with for cold hard cash.  John Podesta also has ties to Russia exposed through the WikiLeaks, owning 75,000 shares in a Putin-backed energy company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no longer Trump vs Hillary. This is no longer Republicans vs Democrats. This is information (I&#39;ll refrain from using the word evidence until it&#39;s been verified) that implicates long standing and <em>subversive</em> contact between our President Elect and Russian intelligence officials. I don&#39;t understand why everything to do with Clinton here is taken at face value but <em>now that it&#39;s someone that you all like,</em> it suddenly is ridiculous and how can everyone be so stupid to accept it. </p>

<p>All I ask is you open your mind to the <em>possibility</em> that this is the case and, whether you think it is or not, don&#39;t you think that just the possibility of our PE having hidden, subversive contact with Russian intelligence who also has blackmail material with which to control our <em>soon to be president</em> makes it at least <em>worth</em> investigating?

    <div class="md"><p>This is no longer about Trump vs. Hillary? It never was about either side of that decaying and irrelevant system. It&#39;s about the hypocritical bias of the MSM. The cry for justice over rumors of Trump on the internet that have no real evidence. </p>

<p>Yet we have hundreds of <a href="http://www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com/">e-mails</a> leaked by Wikileaks, verified legit, from the DNC, Hillary, Podesta, and Weiner that should be enough to throw them all in jail for good and yet there is silence in the MSM. </p>

<p>Pointing out actual evidence that implicates Hillary in numerous crimes against the United States of America, is not taking her actions at &quot;face value&quot;. Do not assume I like Trump just because I&#39;m not quick to put his head under a guillotine over rumors on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I&#39;ll refrain from using the word evidence until it&#39;s been verified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s kind of the entire point of the disinterest you see. None of these sources are verified. Wikileaks at least has a system for verifying encrypted signatures for the likes of US official documents and e-mails.</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely open to the possibility that Trump could be currently involved in any number of illegal activities. I think this allegation is worth investigating, solely to see if any of these claims can actually be verified in a satisfying manner. I mean honestly so far there isn&#39;t much of a controversy to investigate, they claim he pissed on hookers and has Russia intelligence. Ignoring the fact that all of this is ridiculously vague, that&#39;s a pretty tame controversy honestly, compared to what most politicians get into.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy posts never hit the front page that is why we are concerned this breaks the norm here by wide margins</p>

<p>This is a reasonable conspiracy that impacts the PEOTUS. I came to this sub out of curiosity after seeing the news on CNN. I thought maybe this place would really grab onto a report of Russian manipulation that is backed by one of the most credible journalists out there.</p>

<p>But, instead, I just see a bunch of Trumpettes claiming this is fake news and making up claims about 4chan (which are growing by the minute. Soon, people will be claiming someone on 4chan wrote the entire memo.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean you would be right normally if this wasnt so obviously engineered. 
1. this is fucking buzzfeed, buzzfeed is viewed as a completely ridiculous internet tabloid by the majority of this sub.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>this rocketed to the top of the sub, and then on to r/all in complete contravention of the normal workings of this sub.</p></li>
<li><p>this occured just hours after Assange heaped prasie on Reddit for investigating and going through the initial DNC/Podesta/Clinton emails, something that was primarily done by this sub.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>this sort of surge in traffic is very very abnormal here. even the Snowden leaks did not cause this sort of surge, to us that is very very suspicious. the explanation of well it was on r/all also falls flat because the fact it gained that sort of traction based on the normal users here is also very very abnormal.</p>

<p>who is this credible journalist you are reffering to because it certainly is no anyone from buzzfeed, at least in the opinions of the reg users. wikileaks and Greenwald have already called bullshit on the story, and those are two that are held in, relatively, high regard here for the things they have exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the rules here are a little lax on credible sources but the idea that CNN has the most credible journalists out there is laughable. It&#39;s common knowledge that Obama&#39;s cabinet and respective lobbyists have a stranglehold on CNN. It reminds me of the dark days of Bush&#39;s relationship with Fox News. That&#39;s not to say CNN is completely incompetent at their job but they are definitely compromised. I would take anything they say about Trump with a huge grain of salt. </p>

<p>This is the guy who broke Watergate. He has decades of credibility and would lose all of that if this story were false. </p>

<p>And John McCain has confirmed the report from CNN. So, unless you think McCain is in on the Democratic conspiracy.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a journalist that had credibility in a completely different era of news media 40+ years ago, now strives for relevance in the age of news 2.0. Which is a completely different beast that encourages a lack of journalistic integrity. </p>

<p>The MSM has been playing the same smear campaign like a broken record for too long. I&#39;m all for finding dirt on politicians and exposing it, but every time the MSM puts forth new content on Trump, it has been devoid of any substantial evidence and is reduced to baseless accusations that only hurt the MSM&#39;s credibility.</p>

<p>Personally I wouldn&#39;t trust John McCain as far as I could throw him, I don&#39;t see any reason to start trusting him now. The man has been beating war drums lately like he&#39;s leading the first charge into battle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that is the scenario playing out, it wouldn&#39;t destroy his career. It is completely legal for him to do so at this point. As long as it is government sanctioned and pushed by Obama&#39;s cabinet to CNN, he is covered under the NDAA(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5</a>). </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing illegal about pushing the government&#39;s agenda in the MSM. I&#39;m sure Trump will utilize this tool once inaugurated as well.</p>

<p>Here are 3 sources that I have read, as well as many others supporting pizzagate.</p>

<p>I accept the inevitable downvotes as these are MSM and not some fringe article that was written on a napkin in a secret bunker in the galapagos islands. For me personally they have provided &quot;proof&quot; that pizzagate isn&#39;t real. </p>

<p>Also I do just want to say, if there is some sort of trafficking ring operated out of a pizza shop, and 4chan was correct then I will be the first to eat my hat and hope the victims get justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how psychiatry works. I&#39;ve been to several, some while I served in the military, some at my university, and some at the VA. </p>

<p>And if some type of reprogramming existed, I wish that he DID get it. He was a threat to his family and to those around him. He was the sole bread winner in his family, and he started to make his children and family stay at home because he thought that all of the food outside was poisoned. A few days later he said that the house was haunted by evil demons, and that his family needed to stay at his mother&#39;s home. A few days later, he was running down the street yelling green green green green. A week or two later, he told his wife that he needs to kill himself to save his children. A few days later he shot himself. </p>

<p>What sucks is that he was a good man who really did care about his family. The problem was that he was developing a mental illness that him and his family did not want to acknowledge that he had a issue in the early days of it, and the worst part of it was that there was forums like this one and youtube videos made by other schizophrenics with misinformation put out by conspiracy sites like infowars that took advantage of him and made his condition much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, i guess if you look on the brightside, because they chose to link this report with conspiracies by linking to this sub and going hog wild here, the report is now forever more linked to conspiracies, foiling their main objective.</p>

<p>whoever directed the brigand campaign forgot or didn&#39;t know rule number one: you create links, however tenuous, with known conspiracy theories to discredit what you are linking...(oops)</p>

<p>piryhhic victory for them at best. even if it&#39;s true, it is now branded with the scarlet CT.</p>

<p>i&#39;m more freaked out by the fact that whoever wants WW3 with russia just can&#39;t quit that shit. even if every word is accurate, those trying to gin up war fever are really scraping the dregs if the barrel with scum and sludge, if this report is what they&#39;ve sunk to.</p>

<p>over/under for false flag &quot;KGB&quot; inargual assiniation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no longer about Trump vs. Hillary? It never was about either side of that decaying and irrelevant system. It&#39;s about the hypocritical bias of the MSM. The cry for justice over rumors of Trump on the internet that have no real evidence. </p>

<p>Yet we have hundreds of <a href="http://www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com/">e-mails</a> leaked by Wikileaks, verified legit, from the DNC, Hillary, Podesta, and Weiner that should be enough to throw them all in jail for good and yet there is silence in the MSM. </p>

<p>Pointing out actual evidence that implicates Hillary in numerous crimes against the United States of America, is not taking her actions at &quot;face value&quot;. Do not assume I like Trump just because I&#39;m not quick to put his head under a guillotine over rumors on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I&#39;ll refrain from using the word evidence until it&#39;s been verified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s kind of the entire point of the disinterest you see. None of these sources are verified. Wikileaks at least has a system for verifying encrypted signatures for the likes of US official documents and e-mails.</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely open to the possibility that Trump could be currently involved in any number of illegal activities. I think this allegation is worth investigating, solely to see if any of these claims can actually be verified in a satisfying manner. I mean honestly so far there isn&#39;t much of a controversy to investigate, they claim he pissed on hookers and has Russia intelligence. Ignoring the fact that all of this is ridiculously vague, that&#39;s a pretty tame controversy honestly, compared to what most politicians get into.</p>
