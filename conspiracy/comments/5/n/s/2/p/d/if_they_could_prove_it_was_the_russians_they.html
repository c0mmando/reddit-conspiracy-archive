If this is the case you have an example of the CIA, NSA, DHS, FBI, etc etc knowing that a Republican candidate was severly compromised by a foreign state, and still allowed that candidate to win the Presidency.  </p>

<p>In other words, if Russia has done everything the MSM is saying they have done, you just saw the nation handed to Russia and the CIA, NSA, DHS, FBI, are to blame because they let it happen through inaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they had any real evidence Obama would immediately have called in the Russian ambassador, shown it to him and demanded an explanation and nothing less than a full public apology to the American public from Putin himself instead of just sending a few of his embassy&#39;s flunkies home. </p>

<p>If there was real and conclusive  evidence Putin would have had no choice but to apologise and it would have been a major embarrassment for both him and Russia instead of one for the US and all of it&#39;s intelligence agencies as it stands now. </p>
