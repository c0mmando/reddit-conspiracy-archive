       Trump openly supports Israel. The Donald has been an Israel circlejerk for awhile. If he doesn't take action to protect his allies, that would look bad.

       Reddit is controlled by shills. Plenty of them in this sub too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ask yourself this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't donald trump supporters have their own subreddit when hillary and goverment supporterss get the rest of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Massive brainwashing, that's how.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not about Donald Trump only. You can't question the government in general in this so called free country or you will be labeled a nut job to the rest of the country and put on a cell or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so brainwashed to the point that they can't like things that are not approved by the masses. In other words they don't have free independent thought and they don't know it.

       Did you visit the day after the election? It was back to normal. Skeptics, debate, conversations... It was pretty great.

       Turned out to be a brief reprieve though. Someone else picked up CTRs tab. I believe it was just rolled back into Brock's older PAC "American Bridge".

       I think talks have to be put in place to open up an Alt News Media subreddit, something like
       <a href="/r/Alt_News">
        /r/Alt_News
       </a>
       where not only do stories get posted, but informative news paper document and ground breaking documentaries on historic events are covered to keep the populace informed on what's going on. If...

       I could dig up some documentaries I think are extremely informative on the global picture and introducing people to the grand chessboard called geopolitics and why it's so important as well as a bunch on other subjects from the Federal Reserve, Central Banking, Stay Behind Secret Wars and Armies, The Industrial Complexes and War Machines, etc, etc,...

       I mean, you can't deny the fact that the sub has a tendency to "support" Trump by antagonizing the Clintons and the general demeanor of many conversations here. It's nowhere near the level r/the_donald is/was, but this sub is not heavily critical of Trump in any way. But I think that will likely change as he progresses through his term.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the false flag thing is very likely. Israel apparently bombed Syria, so all they need is a "retaliation" to get it going. And having it happen right before Trump takes office would put a lot of immediate pressure on him and the establishment will likely attempt to delegitimize his presidency.

       There are some T_D folk here because we have an inherently similar theme: anti-etablishment (I know many believe Trump is part of that establishment but it's what Trump stood/stands for and the T_D users that contribute to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       believe that he is still anti-establishment. People in this subreddit ARE starting to criticise Trump because he is becoming THE government essentially (though hopefully not the useless corrupt type of government). Also it is possible that after he is inaugurated, he will do things that are unconventional for an establishment type so hopefully that will put some of our minds to rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree that calling out the Clintons is 'supporting Trump'. The Clintons are a very corrupt family and there's mass evidence to show that and we as conspiracists despise corruption. Also there is that possibility that the Clintons are of course involved in perhaps he largest conspiracy of all time, this does not mean supporting trump in any way.
I think it's time we dispelled the Trump vs Clinton thing. The Clintons are corrupt politicians and very powerful people but Trump is now the president-elect of the USA. They are not directly head to head anymore (though we will have to wait and see if Trump decides to prosecute after he is inaugurated; I know Jason Chaffetz is not forgetting about those emails).
      </p>
      <p>
       We shouldn't compare Trump to the Clintons anymore, the Clintons are far more corrupt with evidence to support it. I, like many, sincerely hope that Trump doesn't become a conventional establishment type president that does fuck all in office, but it is very possible that he does do unexpecting and surprising things in office which will put a smile on our faces.

       I agree. I put "support" in quotes because I agree with you that being anti clinton does not mean in any way that you support Trump. The two party system is what put us here in the first place, it's time to step out of the hole that the elite dug for us.

       Well good. There is no reason to defend that pernicious puddle of percolating putrefaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very concept of "Israel" as a Jewish State was doomed to failure on the day it was conceived. Better it die a merciful and relatively painless death than the HELL that Zionists seem determined to rain down upon themselves - and the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing that Jews can do for themselves - as a people - is to openly castigate and condemn the Zionist enclave - before it is too late - and they be swept into the whirlpool with the impostors that CLAIM to represent them.

       Trump is sane and doesn't want to go to war with Russia. The current administration is corrupt af and have been planning on going to war with Russia for a while now. They were going to be able to do it gradually with Clinton in power but Trump's unexpected win (in a race rigged against him) has drastically cut their timetables. They are angling this so the public will be on board with war, ostensibly to protect our allies in Israel when in reality they were the ones who attacked. Trump will be put in the uncomfortable position of saying either we won't retaliate against Syria and be vilified as a Russian spy further by the MSM and retarded general public, or that we will and start shit with Russia. It's fucked.

       No source, definitely a prediction but the pieces are falling into play for something like this to happen. George Webb with the Braverman stuff on YouTube has been connecting the dots regarding the big oil plays in the middle east now and has uncovered a lot of the hidden motives of the key players and their MO. Knowing how these people operate, you can definitely see how it's possible that this would be their next step.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wants better relations with Russia but this would be a major obstacle in all of these oil plays. Triggering a conflict between israel and syria could put Trump in a position where he'd have to support israel and distance himself from Putin.

       Trump is an Israeli puppet. Putting him into office was part of their plan to finally make "Greater Israel" a real thing. They have their strong nationalist leader in place now for all the good goyim sheep to look up to for guidance and to rally behind for what is about to come. Hope all you Trumpcucks don't mind bleeding out in the sand and dying by the truckload for your "Lord Emperor", or rather so your Lord Emperor can please his Israeli puppet masters that promised to keep the cash flowing into his horribly mismanaged and failing business empire and to pay off all of the outrageous debts he accumulated through various Wall Street lenders to try to keep his buisness's afloat. I already did my time in the Marines and have an RE code 4 on my DD214, so I really don't give a fuck. This is the future you chose.

       Well seeing how Israel bombed a Syrian Army Airport last night, only 5km from Assad palace, Israel seems to be antagonizing Syria to attack in response.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might actually be genuine attack by Syria / Russia on Israel in response to their blatant attack on Syria military airport.

       How is this not Israel supporting terrorists?

       This is where the Syrian Government houses their elite Revolutionary Guards, you know, the ones who are actually fighting the radical Wahhabis that Israel, USA, UK, and Saudi Arabia have all backed in an attempt to overthrow Assad.

      <p>
       Israel has clearly decided to back the radical Wahhabis including ISIS, Al-Queada, and Al-Nursra, because they are fighting Iran and Shia groups.

       Yes, and Israel just bombed a Syrian airport to make it look more justified. They may have to do more though, beforehand, because if Syria or Russia have responded in any way, I haven't heard about it. Not taking the bait.

       911 was a cheap magic trick. Only bad magicians use CG. The Israelis planted real explosives in the WTC but used CG to make it appear "hijacked planes" flew into them. Want proof?

       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       Again, I'll say I don't doubt there were explosives involved in 9/11 but if there were no planes involved and it was all CGI, why haven't millions of NYC residents come forward saying they never saw planes?

       This is what I keep hearing from people. How do you know there were millions who saw the plane? We have plenty of witnesses say they saw no plane and it was a bomb. Did you even read my comment?

       I'm not as well versed in politics and world affairs as some of you guys so i didn't want to post a new thread about this, but this has been in my head for a while;
      </p>
      <p>
       Is all of this election cycle really a power struggle between isreal and Saudi? Trump indeed seems pro isreal, and there's no denying Clinton is funded by Saudi Arabia. I mean we keep hearing how we were duped and he's a false prophet and he will be the same and nothing will change, well if they got their puppet in, which either way they would have why all the theatrics after he won then, why bother trying to discredit him and incite violence at the inauguration?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like the US has been playing both sides for a while, collecting money from isreal to destroy the middle East but also collecting from the Saudi's to destroy middle Eastern governments so they can install their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more of a question than anything, this is how I see it, but Im not sure I'm seeing the whole picture.

       My guess would be Iran. I'm basing this off of the Iran Nuclear deal, which btw, was unsigned and is not legally binding. The US wants Iran to sell it's oil in US dollars to secure the petrodollar. 
Now Russia will either allie with Iran(ww3), or Trump/others might be trying to negotiate with Russia via lifting embargos and setting up trade agreements, which would also cut back China's profit. China is more of an economic threat than Russia; which is the greater military threat. So, we offer Russia the sweet deal that China has been getting in exchange for Iran, while also reducing China's ability to surpass the US economically.
