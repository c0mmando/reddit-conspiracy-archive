       Well, we were watching the huge influx of people reading the sub at that time, it was amazing.  Later heard mention the story was grabbed on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and that is what brought them in.  But what up voted it up so fast as it doesn't seem the type of link this sub's regulars would up vote readily.

       I upvoted it to see what would happened.  After months of being called a shill, or CTR and even a pedo for questioning how pizzagate was handled here, I wanted to see what the supposedly unbiased would do once the shoe was on the other foot.  Well, as I predicted the reactionaries got very reactionary and starting making their own post to correct the record.  They start using the the term "fake news", even after mocking the term for weeks.  They then labeled the story as fake, which was new move or a move so rare that I had not noticed before.  They then deleted the story all together.   They then offered no proof of an influx of new upvoters.  All while claiming they knew that they were right to delete to the post because they were with the supposed majority here on

       Yeah I saw the GQ article I was under the impression the 2001 date implies that they can't be talking about the time Trump supposedly had hookers piss on Obama's bed or whatever. Is the allegation from the "dossier" that the events took place pre or post 2001?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care who Trump has sex with. I don't even care if he likes getting pissed on if it's true. What I do care about is how the MSM chooses to run full speed with extremely dubious claims that even the intelligence agencies can't verify at all. They have had zero accountability for the repeated character assassinations.

       No mainstream media outlet "ran with" the claims from the dossier besides Buzzfeed. They reported on the fact that the POTUS and PEOTUS were briefed on it last week, which is true.

       Okay I see your point. I am exaggerating but the fact that they were even talking about the story like it could possibly be true without verifying anything to do with it is absurd. It's the exact same shit they pulled with the fake sex assault allegations, racism allegations, etc. They KNEW it was BS but chose to talk about it anyway and lead the American people on a wild goose chase.

       Elements of it very well could be true. Christopher Steele is a former MI6 agent who blew open the FIFA corruption case, this isn't some crackpot off the street. Nobody "KNOWS" it's BS.

       You're losing me now. A presidential nominee on tape claiming that he sexually assaults women is a much bigger deal than a 69 year old woman fainting. There's not a shred of credible evidence that Clinton has any major health issues.

       LMAO okay I'm sorry but are you a prude? This sexual assault shit is absolutely absurd. Sexual assault doesn't involve consent. Going in for a kiss isn't sexual assault unless the woman refuses. Do you have the famous proof that even the accusers themselves can't provide. Still waiting on Gloria Allred's bombshell civil case on the matter.

       CNN did. The whole "we just reported on Buzzfeed reported on and linked to it, so we didn't cover it at all" excuse is laughable.

       Do you think that BuzzFeed thread was an organic r/conspiracy thread that just happened to make it to r/all and reflected the opinions/beliefs of r/conspiracy?

       Although I cannot say yes with 100% certainty that it happened, I can say that people claimed it did happen.

       Whenever something big happens, usually there is an influx here of people voting based on their view point and to say this place is crazy left leaning Trump hating is kind of under selling it.

       At the same time, the pro-government posts here scare the hell out of me. We know both parties are different sides are the same coin why trust them?

       Understandable if we lived in a vacuum. When our current government is doing EVERYTHING they can to fuck over the incoming government I find it a little easier to breathe and be optimistically skeptical of DT. Everything he claims to hate is the same stuff this subreddit hates. I can see where it would seem like it's too good to be true but after the amount of money that was spent trying to defeat him and the amount of Dems that willingly sacrificed their integrity/reputations to try and take him down it's hard to not consider DT my ally.

       Most of those posts happened before the voting  algorithm changed, so no I didn't see those. Still, the buzzfeed post would have been in the top ten or fifteen  posts of all time, which is weird for this sub

       it'll get a bunch more votes on it as well (especially considering it's an anti-trump post).

       When I first saw the "trump allegations" headlines elsewhere my immediate thought was to see if it had been posted here, basically because I knew it wasn't the typical r/conspiracy narrative (being anti-Trump) and fully expected to see a huge amount of hypocrisy... and whadaya know, I
       <em>
        DID
       </em>
       see an insane amount of hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...so I upvoted the thread and the comments that pointed out the hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If r/conspiracy was true to it's cause we would've seen the sub as a whole digging through all these juicy new allegations... how far down does the rabbit hole go? But no, we saw lots of people wriggling and squirming and performing Olympic standard mental gymnastics in order to persuade themselves, and others, why we shouldn't bother exploring this particular conspiracy.

       No just a critical thinker who is waiting for more information on both. Sorry I find one more likely than the other. Doesn't mean one or either can conclusively be shown to be false at this point. But saying I'm being paid for my opinion because it doesn't fit your worldview is idiotic, and if anything undermines the point you're trying to prove.

       Why are you all trying to make it about piss porn? They're talking about the AP story today. Sounds like you're just trying to bury the actual story by focusing on the sex stuff. It's about possible collusion with a foreign power and Trump camp saying first there was no contact and now that admitting there was a phone call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador the day Obama expelled those diplomats/spys and laid down new sanctions on their intelligence agencies.

       I see what point you're trying to make but yeah that's not how PizzaGate is working. I do agree that Pissgate shouldn't be brushed off but the PizzaGate investigation is way more in depth with more results then you're playing off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been called crazy for months because of PizzaGate but I'm still investigating. If you find truth in and passion in finding truth in PissGate, by all means keep digging and if you stick with it and enough evidence is found then the movement will continue.

       I agree completely. I'm not completely dismissing pizzagate there has been a lot of solid evidence so if I had to go one way or the other I'd probably lean towards there being something going on. But some of the stuff offered as proof is ludicrous.

       If I believe it at all (and I'm not quite sure I do) I'm of the opinion that a lot of the people who visited and talked about the establishment are straight, but they were purposefully included as a sort of plausible deniability, to give a semblance of legitimacy to the whole thing.

       There has literally been zero solid evidence of pizzagate. Literally zero. Evidence is not grossly misinterpreted emails. There is zero evidence. I can't even believe that this is a conspiracy. I mean, fuck, this one is just to show how stupid and gullible you people are. Congratulations, you're wasting your otherwise unproductive life.

       biggest piece of evidence is that they ate Walnut Pasta and that's a very odd thing to have for lunch, i mean you'd have to be some form of pretentious lefty weirdo to eat pasta but with Walnut sauce?! no, such things don't even exist! it has to be secret code!
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and someone likes art which is significant and thought provoking and created by one of the big names in the current art world - can you imagine anyone who likes art, has eaten Walnut Sauce on their pasta and supports a left-wing political party? no, of course not - but can you imagine a pizza restaurant that's a secret child rape and cannibalism club used by the most powerful people in the country who discover it when they see it's sign is a secret code symbol for paedophilia? of course you can!

       because parents do that with their kids, every fucking christmas letter we got had the exact same formatting names followed by ages it's the most normal thing ever.

       but actually unlucky for you you're wrong and i do know this email, at the end of it there's an apology that John won't be there -- kinda ruins it, hu? even though it's nothing anyway.

       family has a pool, kids like pools, kids play in the pool to keep then entertained while parents drink wine - this is not in the least bit odd.

       I think it is viewed through that lens for a good reason. The people participate in spirit cooking and do things that have occult references like saying "sacrifice a chicken to moloch" (some say it was joke but i don't think so). They also talk in code sometimes like " a handkerchief with a pizza related map". John Podestas associate, James Alefantis also has a lot of questionable things on his instgram relating to murder, infants, and kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, all of it is circumstantial at best but suspicious at the least. I am glad there are people behind the scenes looking for verifiable evidence. I don't think me, you, or anyone can categorically say that pizzagate is true or false.

       I absolutely believe Alefantis threatened David Seaman over posting the address to Pegasus... since its his mothers house and someone has already shown up at Comet Ping Pong with a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, if you have already reported harassment to the police and FBI and someone is STILL making money selling merchandise claiming you are a pedophile and publishes your mothers home address with the claim that there is a kill room in the basement for disposing of child rape victims... I think at that point, NOT losing your shit is a bigger sign of being a sociopath that flipping tables.

       I think the biggest difference is there is evidence of massive pedophilia rings. That isn't even a conspiracy theory, its a conspiracy fact. They exist. The idea that pedophiles would promote other pedophiles in office also makes a ton of sense, for blackmail and control purposes. So while there isn't a lot of "tangible evidence" regarding Pizzagate, pandora's box just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more people investigate it. Whereas Pissgate just doesn't really make any logical sense. Trump defended himself perfectly, he is a public figure, he knows he is being watched, he knows his behavior is constantly being scrutinized. Why would he travel to a foreign country and then let his guard down and hire prostitutes to piss on a bed that Obama had slept on? Ppl who say Trump is a moron, he hates Obama! Why wouldn't he do this? Are missing the point here. This behavior literally doesn't accomplish anything. I'm not saying its impossible that Trump could be a pervert, I'm just saying that by and large he is incredible pragmatic. If you have a second source corroborating Pissgate, I'd love to see it. I am all about breaking down assumptions and questioning everything, as is 90% of the ppl on this sub.

       they dont need CTR anymore really, that was mostly because Sanders was so popular on reddit. reddit is like 90% liberal so all pro - trump stuff gets downvoed. redacted even came up with an AutoBot that will remove any post that has below 50% upvotes, so the echo chamber censors itself

       The issue isn't so much about whether or not he likes to get pissed on. The issue is how much influence the Russians have on him. That could be through incriminating video tapes or just simply because he owes them a whole lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although obviously pedophile rings exist, the idea that Trump owes Russians money seems much more likely than a government run child trafficking and cannibalism ring.

       The thread is about pissgate. Hence my response to those allegations. The accusation you are referring to is based on the assumption that trump paid the Russians to hack the dnc and leak the documents to Wikileaks. This hasn't been proven, and the narrative is being peddled by the intelligence community which should naturally bring suspicion. I am not arguing that trump isn't corrupt. I've known he was from day 1. And if there is a quid pro quo that's obviously not ok, but it seems pretty much standard operating procedure for republicans and democrats, why would we expect any different with trump? However, It's not foolish to think that instigating war with Russia is a bad idea. It's a lesser of two evils to create friendly relations with Russia, lest we want another Cold War and nuclear threat on our hands.

       The pissing and the quid pro quo are all in the same opposition Buzzfeed published. You're trying to dismiss or separate it by calling it Pissgate and make it sound outlandish. We know what Russia is trying to do. Nuclear war is not the only alternative to electing the prefferred candidate of Putin. If any of the non pissing stuff is true it's worse than what Nixon resigned for. At the end of the day, we know for sure a couple of scary things, whether or not any of the buzzfeed dump is true. We know Russia wants what's in this book and they think Trump being President helps them get there.

       I think the link to this book was posted here a little while ago. I read the summary and it was very compelling and a lot of what it said rings very similar to what is going on here in the USA. Trump very well could be a puppet of the Kremlin, and I have no doubt that thousands of citizen journalists, investigators and other journalists will continue to dig to find the truth. Trumps cabinet picks are enough to cause concern and speculation, but we have nothing yet to really tie him down to any wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at what proof we have right now, a dossier filled with factual errors written by a British intelligence agent, funded specifically by anti-Trump politicians, the veracity of this document can already be called into question, by this fact alone. There is a significant difference between a sketchy document written for political purposes, leaked by the CIA who has been known to spread disinformation to the public, and a set of emails written by elected officials themselves (aka dnc leaks) that have been verified as real. It's going to be difficult to compel a bunch of conspiracy nerds to start investigating a CIA and MSM pushed rhetoric that russia hacked our elections, and even less motivating when that hack resulted in tangible proof of wrong doings by the dnc. I am not referring to the pedo ring, but all of the other corrupt ass shit they were doing which is more along the lines with the accusations against trump, bribes, foreign kick backs, pay to play, etc. Now I firmly believe that Trump and Hillary are of the same cloth, two sides of the same coin. Both are corrupt as fuck, but I can't superimpose my personal beliefs onto the evidence. This dossier doesn't even compare as evidence to the troves and troves of actual emails from dnc personnel. If we get access to trumps emails and it proves illegal behavior, many here will be there pouring through the documents just as they poured through the podesta emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further clarify, I am a former democrat. I voted obama in 08 and 12. Obama was the first president I ever voted for. I hated trump, I thought he was a corrupt, narcissistic, who is going to use the presidency as a 4 year infomercial for his business (the LL bean tweet, his daughters plug for her jewelry,  were beyond repugnant). And yet, I still believe that some of what pizzagate has uncovered could be true. James Alefantis, his friends, and the podestas reactions to these accusations, the medias blatent denial of it, even when they are quick to jump into a very suspect CIA leaked document, is a big reason so many alarm bells in the conspiracy community are going off. Your not going to be able to peg me as some trump supporter and say that that is what is clouding my judgement, it's not. I'm allowed to hate trump and Hillary equally.

       You're lying or obfuscating the real truth. In no way do I respect the bullshit you're peddling. The narrative that the religious right and the pro business centrists (the worst from each side) will push the same policy is either naive or disingenuous. You're simply a dumb person if you think they're all the same. The SCOTUS appointments alone show stark differences that change real life in this country. Trump wants another Scalia, and you're basically saying the dems do too or your argument falls apart when you realize the stark contrast of the kind of nominee it would actually be. This is not to mention putting the EPA in the hands of someone who sued them and copy pasted oil lobby policy as his own work. Seriously, get the fuck out of here with your brainless argument.

       I am neither lying, nor obfuscating, nor peddling bullshit. I don't have an ulterior motive here other than sharing my point of view on the world. And quiet frankly now I'm pissed that you are being so fucking rude because I don't agree with you. You verbally attacking me is getting old, telling me to get out of here? Where do you come off like your opinion and perspective is more valid than mine? Last I checked that's not what this sub is about, get the fuck over it, you only speak for yourself, don't act like you speak for others. I am neither naive nor disingenuous, what is naive to me is assuming that Trump, is going to be somehow any different than Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr and Obama. When you start to look at the big picture, who is the president doesn't actually change all that much. Yes some policies do some good for people, I'm not arguing that they don't, and all presidents and congress have put out some policies that do affect us in a good way and a bad way. When policy affects us in a bad way that's when we have to protest it. But really how does a conservative replacing Scalia have that much effect on our lives? Scalia was incredibly conservative, and all of or civil liberties weren't stripped away when he was on the court. There has to be a compelling case against abortion that makes it completely through the lower courts. That hasn't happened since the 1960s with roe v wade, how the fuck is trump somehow going to magically overturn that? Trump being president just means that the elite get to continue to screw over the people and the government continues to commit fraud and passes policy bandaids and temporary fixes with our tax dollars. Your making this partisan when I'm discussing politics free of that distraction.

       I'm being rude because I'm sick of this idiocy. If this were a bar I'd take it outside. Obama is the same as Trump and Bush? Those are fighting words now. I'm done taking the high road. Your views are ignorant and belligerent. You're telling me that putting religion in the classroom and putting tax dollars into that shit is a non issue and the same the dems would do. You're saying that a nobel prize winner and a lawyer who sued the EPA will do the same thing with the agency and that none of it will effect anything. You're saying that having the head of Exxon as Secretary of State is the same as John Kerry. You're telling me that Obama is the same as the guy who started a war under false premises that my friends fought and died in when Obama voted against it. Either you lie, you're ignorant, or both.

       You haven't taken the high road this entire conversation. You have attempted to belittle me and put words in my mouth. Have you ever heard of projection? It's a term for when you project your own fear of yourself onto others. Just because you don't agree or understand my point here, doesn't mean I am an idiot. I am not saying their policies are the same and I agree with your concerns about the EPA, almost all of trumps cabinet picks are concerning, but to leap to conclusions that his picks are going to somehow change the tide of consumers moving to alternative energy isn't valid. Religion is already in our schools, it's not ok and citizens should keep fighting against it. And obama has continued and expanded bush's wars. We are actually in more proxy wars in more countries than we were under bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at this point, I'm done having this conversation with you, you have no desire to understand a different perspective than your own and no interest in treating others with respect. I'm no longer going to respond to your comments. You clearly have no respect for others. Take care in your bubble.

       I'd argue the opposite, actually.
It seems impossible to me that normal people would ever turn a blind eye to a conspiracy of pedophiles for whatever reason. They'd be turned in by anyone, no matter how fucked up their politics are.
We had a couple of examples of this sort of conspiracy in Australia, one in Sydney in the 80's where the perverts were cooking meth for some crooked cops.
Another where an MP (congressman) was banging young boys in his parliament office.  In both cases a s soon as someone non-perverted knew about it, they reported it, even though it harmed their position/political party.
I can't believe that everyone in the Democrats who "knows" about the pro ring wouldn't put reporting it over party political interests.
That doesn't ring true for me.
On the other hand, hearing about Donald Trump hiring prostitutes while on a trip to Russia does seem in keeping with everything we know about his personal life, conduct, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to start something- I think Trump is likely to be no better or worse than other presidents. But the relative believability of the two stories are Pissgate&gt;Pizzagate

       Take a look at my latest response to coltninja above. I'm too lazy to type it all out again. For all I know pizzagate could be a flaming pile of crap, but there is evidence to suggest that people in power have ways to manipulate law enforcement and evade persecution. Do a little research on The Finders and The Franklin Coverup, I also read about a pedo ring in your neck of the woods involving Nicole Kidmans father. He fled the country after the allegations and died. It's also distinctly possible that the police in Australia are far less corrupt than those in America, given the numerous (17+ intelligence agencies we have). I am not saying that there aren't good cops and CIA and FBI, but there are also bad ones who work for the men in power who will cover this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know Trump could be a perverted, corrupt Russian puppet. I definitely believe he is at least a perverted womanizer and corrupt, as I have seen evidence from his very behavior that prove such claims. However this dossier is super suspect, contains factual errors, was written by an ex British spy, and leaked by the CIA, it can't even be compared as evidence to the actual dnc emails, which are real. Outside of pizzagate those emails prove corruption, but the untouchable elites will never be tried for it. Again, I'm still on the fence about pizzagate, but the evidence is still stronger than this sketch dossier. The reactions of james alefantis, his friends and the podestas, and msm blatant cover up , are all super sketch and flame the fires that something is really there.

       Good points.
I wasn't trying to say that the "dossier" should be taken as gospel- it's clearly just oppo research.
More that the contents are more believable without looking at the respective facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just another. Thing- Nicole Kidman's dad was a respected psychiatrist and recipient of the Order of Australia. The woman who accused him of pedophilia also reported being abused by three prime ministers, the Nazis and satanists....

       Additionally everyone was very clear in reporting that the dossier was unsubstantiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news element of the story over time was:
      </p>
      <p>
       the POTUS and PEOTUS were briefed on it
      </p>
      <p>
       buzzfeed released it and then that Trump reacted poorly
      </p>
      <p>
       Other intelligence agencies and our own intelligence sources confirm the character of the author
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain parts of the dossier are consistent or inconsistent with XYZ.
      </p>
      <p>
       And various other aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM story was never that the dossier was true.

       The MSM as a whole didn't. They ran the story about the briefing to the POTUS and Trump only initially and were openly critical of buzz feed for releasing it when they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once buzz feed had released it, what did you expect the rest to do? Ignore it? They provided context and explain exactly what was verified (which was the stories about McCain and Paul Manafort etc) and what wasn't verified (pissgate) with many going as far as not mentioning the publicly available details to preserve their integrity because they think the leak was poor practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given what they had to work with and given the leak, I don't think they did a bad job realistically.

       I don't think fascists are liberals under any definition. Fascists are pro-authoritarian, liberals are pro freedom and human rights.

       Unless they're brown. Obama is a liberal who won a Nobel Peace Prize and is leaving office having dropped more than 26,000 bombs on six countries and a huge number of civilian casualties. Oh, and billions of dollars in weapons sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia that have only aided in the murder and oppression of the Yemenese and Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the true face of liberalism. Conservatives are no better mind you, they're two sides of the same capitalist coin.

       It's not the "real world", it's a corrupt capitalist system that endorses and encourages malevolence for the pursuit of personal profit and power. Capitalism and corruption are not endemic to existence.

       America is not "strong." Trust in the media and the government is at an all-time low. Do you think torture, funding terrorism, war profiteering, etc should continue just because you choose to give up your freedom to someone who just legalized propaganda?

       No, Trump said that the DNI told him it was fake.  The DNI has only publicily stated that he told Trump that it's validity was still to be determined.  MSNBC just stated that their unnamed source called it "disinformation."

       What do you mean by fake, exactly?  Nothing has yet proven to be false.  The memos exist, that's not in question.  There claims are being investigated.  No one is saying that the claims are true, but the only people saying they are false are those who have everything to lose.

       Except that everyone seems to be choosing their words very carefully to an almost painstaking degree.  I can't remember the last time I heard intelligence officials bounce around "unverified" this much.  I'm not saying any of this is true, I just think that no one should be ready to dismiss it out of hand when so many intelligence officials aren't.

       Just realize we're having two different conversations at the same time lol. And yes sure that's a fine point to have, but the fact everyone is claiming there's any proof for this at all, with some people outright saying it's 100% true, is disconcerting.

       His alibi is actually ONLY for the august 29th, while the reports of his trip were just sometime late august/early september. So no, its no a very strong alibi.

       He said he was in NY for the rest of August and September...

       To disprove him would be very easy. Instead you have a 35 page document with dozens of accusations and not one single piece of tangible evidence to back them up.

       Yeah but the burden of proof isn't on him to prove where he was without first evidence to suggest he was where they claim, is it? I'm not sure. It still seems like a shot-in-the-dark accusation.

       Shouldn't it be easy for him to prove? What's stopping him? Wouldn't it be good for them and the country? I could prove my whereabouts easily with bank statements and receipts. That's what I'd do, because it would completely put it to rest. Instead he tweets the cover of his passport and apparently that's enough. Haha, a sub for conspiracy taking a shady lawyer at his word. What a time to be alive.

       If it would heal the whole fucking country, and massively boost support in my favor, you bet your ass I would. Then again I dropped out of a better law school than he went to because I'm not willing to be a zealous advocate for the highest bidder.

       You're making excuses for why he shouldn't very easily take a shit on this whole thing. Frame it how you want, he could eviscerate his opponents with a fucking bank statement and that he won't do it, raises questions for any true skeptic. Apparently nowadays, skeptics take the word of a lawyer as gospel as long as he's right wing.

       At least you concede. Perhaps in the future you could exercise more patience, rationality and logic. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty no matter how much of a detestable cunt they are. The burden of proof rests with the accuser.

       But.
That's six days out of a possible 30
Not really an ironclad alibi.
It would be very easy for a guy like that to prove it.
Just sit down with a respected reporter, and show his diary for the period.
I wonder why he hasn't done it- this would have shut the whole thing up already.

       Why is this getting some many votes? It went up 15 votes in 20 seconds. Especially for some fake shit. There's no second source? Why don't you link it if evidence is getting stronger... Only more and more new organizations coming out calling it bullshit fake news.

       Second source everyone is talking about. First denied and later admitted by the trump camp. Hope you're not looking for piss porn, all we have is possible collusion with a foreign power and a definite attempt to cover up a phone call.

       I honestly dont think mods are purposefully removing anti ptrump stuff. It's just that everything bad about him is on the surface. He isn't hiding the fact he's a racist.

       When you post actual evidence of something Trump is hiding, like a conspiracy, it belongs here. But just talking about how openly mean and dumb he is belongs on a different sub I think

       When the Buzzfeed article hit, it made it to the top ofthe sub on votes. We could argue that the sub was brigaded, but I haven't seen anyone making that argument show anywhere in another sub with a high enough population where
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was linked. That sort of incendiary accusation is EXACTLY what should evoke that sort of response in this forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the mods deleted the Buzzfeed post, within minutes they stickied a 2 second gif of Biden from the Congressional swearing in ceremony that people are claiming is evidence he is a pedo with absolutely no content and a title something along the lines of "Saw a Biden gif was trending on the front page and thought we needed one here."
      </p>

       That seems like someone with an agenda manipulating what people on this sub are exposed to.

       Feel free to use ceddit and show examples of deleted pro trump threads. I browsed through 8 pages and the only removed posts were obvious shitposts and the Julian Assange meme post. Please stop the DONALD 2.0 narrative and focus on the actual argument being made.

       Well, there aren't any deleted pro trump threads.

       Woops, made a big error, meant to type in "anti-trump".
      </p>

       Didn't they only delete that thread after it was confirmed by most reliable outlets as being fake? I understand that this sub is slightly right leaning and if it was a Hilary post it probably would have stayed, but the mods probably had good reasons to delete that one since the thread was getting raided heavily and was literally fake news.

       The dossier itself wasn't exactly made up by Buzzfeed, but put together by a private company as opposition research, by an ex MI6 agent. Obama was briefed on the contents of the dossier, and McCain brought the dossier to the FBI as well. However, the contents within the dossier were not all verified. I would argue that it isn't fake news because it was important enough to be used as material within a governing agency. However, the fact that the contents within the dossier might not all be true is why some people are criticising Buzzfeed for releasing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm skeptical of all the contents within the dossier as well, I don't believe it's the mods job to delete posts like this, we should be able to make up our own minds about it. Not to mention the mods here don't seem to ever delete anti-clinton or pro-trump stuff that come from spambots and other things that are demonstrably inarguably false.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's be honest, if this leaked dossier contained anti-Clinton information, this subreddit along with the_donald would be claiming all the information is real, and if a similar thread was deleted off
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       these subreddits would have been outraged by it. Anyone saying that the dossier contained fake information would be called a shill and the MSM would be trying to censor the dossier by claiming the contents were unverified.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for raiding: the dossier news was one of the largest conspiracies for months and reached
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       so it seems pretty natural.

       You're so close here, it's confusing that you continue to argue when you support the general idea.

       Words are memes. They spread. If it is useful, it continues; if not, it dies. I didn't like the word "blog" myself.

       I am not sure why you think Post-Truth is a partisan term, but please consider that you continue to name-drop the boogeyman rather than acknowledging the elite's war on truth. Truth is going to remain devalued unless we can revive it.

       Post-Truth implies that Truth has been obscured and diluted to a point that it no longer dominates our public discussions. Think of it like Peak Oil: yes, there is still Truth, but it has been diluted by well-funded lies to the point where it is nigh-impossible to extract.

       And I'm not calling you a Soros shill.  I think you're just a run of the mill pissed off democrat.  You've just mindlessly latched onto the most recent Soros buzzword that has been pushed out to other shill sources.

        It's not as simple as Trump said it was 'Fake News' so r/conspiracy ignores it, MSM said its "Fake News' so

         /r/conspiracy

        pursues it. I think the biggest difference is that there is actual evidence of massive global pedophilia rings. That isn't even a conspiracy theory, its a conspiracy fact. They exist. The idea that pedophiles would promote other pedophiles in office also makes a ton of sense, for blackmail and control purposes. So while there isn't a lot of "tangible evidence" regarding Pizzagate, pandora's box just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more people investigate it. Not to mention the ppl accused are acting super sketchy in rxn to it. 
Whereas Pissgate just doesn't really make any logical sense. Trump defended himself perfectly, he is a public figure, he knows he is being watched, he knows his behavior is constantly being scrutinized. Why would he travel to a foreign country and then let his guard down and hire prostitutes to piss on a bed that Obama had slept on? Ppl who say "Trump is a moron, he hates Obama, why wouldn't he do this?" Are missing the point here. This behavior literally doesn't accomplish anything. I'm not saying its impossible that Trump could be a pervert, he's said a lot of perverted, sexist and weird things. It's not a conspiracy that he is a womanizer, that's a wide open blatant fact. I'm just saying that by and large he is incredible pragmatic.

       Use your brain and read between the lines. It has been widely circulated in the media and among government for several months, and none of it has been able to be substantiated even though Republicans, Democrats, and the media have been digging into this. All have been trying to take down Trump. If this has been around for quite some time and nothing has come of it, guess what? It's not real. You Trump hating clowns are so desperate that you will literally believe anything.

      <p>
       Conspiracies about the elites having underground sex magick rituals have been circulating for 30+ years. These same
       <em>
        conspiracies
       </em>
       were floating around about the Catholic Church too and yet, they've been proven. Same thing happened in the UK and before that, there were many like yourself who fought hard to disregard the research. There's even "circumstantial evidence* that similar things happened in Hitler's deep inner circle in their search for Vril / orgone energy as well. So these ideas, at least on a conspiracy board, aren't that far of a stretch. Now that there's some eerie shit floating around and coded words in emails, symbols, and a strange connection between a pizza place, neighboring buildings, and some of the most powerful people in DC / the world, some boarderline satanic / magick mentions in emails (m
       <del>
        oloc
       </del>
       h, spirit cooking / Abramovic, and a human trafficker being pardoned / explicitly mentioned multiple times in the emails - it's natural that people on conspiracy boards are trying to connect dots, difficult or even impossible as it may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you really care, keep people honest, but don't make blanket statements over and over again about "those kooks who are ruining this sub with their constant digging at something fake!" there's a lot of
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       behind why they're interested, and it's not simply delusion.

       I've watched that movie. The whole thing was uncovered when the victims came forward. They're welcome to do so now. With all the stuff "circumstantial evidence", you kinda forgot to figure out if there's a crime in the first place.

       Okay, if you consider every instance of a pedophilia ring to be pizzagate then there's a lot of evidence for pizzagate, because pedophilia exists. But then you can't claim that details about Podesta or a certain pizza place has anything to do with pizzagate. It's one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the material you posted, only the really long Reddit post is about worldwide pedophilia. I might skim over it later if I have time. But again I'd like to emphasize that it is not about pizzagate.

       As a child I was sexually abused by my cousin. It was the hardest thing in my life telling anyone. And they didn't believe me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make it sound easy. As if this cannot be happening because no children or adults abused as children have come forward.  You forgot these aren't just my cousin, a person with no wealth and power.  These are people who can have their victims killed and wiped off the earth and kill any person who gets too close to tangible evidence.  At the very least they can ruin them financially or get them in trouble with the IRS (tax law is so crazy confusing anyone could be gone after).

       Thanks for informing me on proof... do you know what resonable doubt is? If a guy posts a photo of a crystal and tags it #molly, molly is street name for mdma, you might not be sure if he means the drug or some inside joke but if the same guy keeps posting stuff like that, you can guess with pretty good accuracy that he is AT LEAST a drug user.

       The problem is people dont want to believe there is a possibility some famose people and politicians are pedophiles. Human and organ traficing is a $50 billion dollar industry, thats five times more than prostitution.

       Please stop. The fact that you have to ask me that question shows who you are. You obviously didnt read about this at all or you have a secret agenda. Why did someone pay for robot tweets that said almost the same thing like you? They literaly spammed twitter with a copy-pasted story "maybe they just aet chicken and liked it?". If there is nothing to the story, why are there so many censoring happening? We are uncovering a big evil in this world and nothing can stop as from this. Their attacks are fuel to our fire and they obviously dont know how to control the damage.

       Lol I have no idea what that chain of tweets is about, and I'm sure that there are people shilling for both sides it's how the internet works nowadays. The point still stands that it's way more plausible that the little one has had chicken for the first time, and the bots are probably trying to kill the conspiracy theory because it's dangerously unfounded.

       Lol you are wrong, shilling is a new term for Astroturfing, astroturfing is "paid trolling", someone is actually paying people to go around the internet and spread lies and misinformation. Why didnt Podesta himself say anything about his very creepy instagram photos? Why does he have to pay bots to spread the word when he couldv written a tweet himself?

       There are both democratic shills and shills run by the russians, and you're being ignorant to ignore either of them. It's because the theory is so outlandish, and has no evidence that doesn't rely on 4chan slang for childporn, that he's giving it the media coverage it doesn't deserve by addressing it publicly. Again, what do you think 'chickenlover' means?

       It is not evidence, it is resonable doubt pilling one on another. We have a lot of "maybe they are talking about fucking kids", idk what did you expect, podesta's direct confession?

       If a deug dealer posts a pic of pills and bills, you might think it is harmless, but if he keps posing all kinds of pills, money and hastags like #molly #rollin and other drug slangs that seem innocent at first, you can conclude with a big probability that he is a drugdealer

       You are crazy, i have never heard of someone calling their children like that. "Entertainment" are prostitutes, have you ever watched movies? You are fucked for defending them, if there is God, you will burn in hell. When the sociaty finds out PG is true, every one of you will be hunted down. You think your work protects you? The NDA you signed was not for your silence, it was for your soul.

       That's all you have. Weird, inappropriate things scattered across the net. But for the main premise of Pizzagate to be true, you need to find something more concrete. Victims, testimony, evidence of a crime, direct connections to trafficking.

       That's the thing about circumstantial evidence.  One thing....sure, that's prob bullshit.  A few...now it's starting to get odd.  All these things?  Now I'm starting to wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       While concrete evidence is always nice, and preferable, dismissing a lot of circumstantial evidence indicates a lack of critical thinking skills (not implying that about you, just saying you shouldn't be dismissive due to the nature of the evidence).

       Concrete evidence is not just "nice", it's important. And that's not how you treat circumstantial evidence. You can find coincidences endlessly if you're looking for them. It's called confirmation bias and it can terrible consequences.

       Not sure how much you've looked into this but there's a large number of people that have spent an awful lot of time looking into this that would disagree.

       With what's at stake, I'd rather risk investigating and finding nothing than not investigate and find out at a later time that we should have.

       Do you not see how these two statements are a bit at odds?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We want the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want to hang them and move on.

      <p>
       In the second statement, you're presuming you already know the truth. You don't want to find evidence and then make a conclusion based on that evidence. You already have a conclusion and now you want to find evidence to back you up. It's backwards.

       People also really really want to believe every single negative thing about a given candidate. Being that the majority of reddit is liberal, you will see more people wanting to believe the worst about Trump regardless of facts. Just like if you were to go into thedonald, or even this sub, people are way more likely to instantly believe anything negative about Clinton. It's confirmation bias compounded into echo chambers.

       I'm vehemently anti-Trump and I don't buy into the claims being true without evidence. I also think pizzagate is probably untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between the two is that "pissgate" involves a credible source with actual accusations regarding events that supposedly happened. Pizzagate involves a bunch of things that look weird to people with no actual claims of something that has happened.

       Ok back to the main issue here.  The circumstantial evidence is there (on Pizzagate), and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Dig down just a bit and you'll find the rest about Trump bland as a pure diversion. You know it's still a diversion tactic, right?

       Mass upvoted by bots? The post was on r/all for christsake. What evidence of bots is there?

       You know what IS fishy though? How this place turned into The_Donald2.0 and is blindly following the elected President. Let that irony sink in: r/conspiracy and its mods have sworn blind allegiance to the government of the USA.

       Reddit servers were busy for 5-10 minutes right before the Pissgate story got massively upvoted. Seems like the Reddit servers couldn't handle the mass influx of bots.

      <p>
       Also, it was clear as day that the Pissgate thread in conspiracy was artifically upvoted. I'm assuming it was the same in other subreddits.

       Totally agree. It's just tiring to be shot at with lame-ass arguments of the leftist agenda, which, sadly, reddit has partaken on, with quickfire downvotes and sad/not thought-out establishment defense lies that just seem automatically generated, when not encouraged by censorship, directly.... #fakenews

       It's an hybrid between extreme left ideology/ and extreme right economics  &gt;&gt;&gt; Oligarchy for a few.  We are slaves to the system that has been build for hundreds of years. Simple, sad.. But that will be changing if we take the stand.

       Why is calling people a shill the first tactic people always go for?  Do you have such a low opinion of the critical thinking skills of people in this sub that you have to resort to calling people who disagree with you shills because you think that's actually convincing of an argument somehow?  Why not just go full Godwin and call them a Nazi if you're going to just sling around insults and personal attacks because you don't have anything of substance to add?

       I imagine it's easy mentally.  Rather than actually face a differing opinion, they can just call the person a shill and dismiss the whole argument.  People that do it have already made up their mind on an issue, and no evidence will ever change their opinion

       The trump deal is a 35 page report memo that circulated around the CIA, FBI for weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference in the two is All the evidence about pizzagate is imaginary and more imaginary connections are constantly being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump Scandal has 1 piece of evidence, with tons of news articles, tweets, and other reports that can collaborate with what's on the dossier.

      <p>
       The difference between the two is you can Google Trump and Russia, while Pizzagate requires imagination.

       TBQH, this whole thing is getting tiring. Until yesterday russia supported trump because they are "friends", today they are supporting him because they want to undermine him. Decide which one it is. One day trump is a traitor because he's a russian spy, next day he is an unwilling puppet of the masterful russian masterminds. Again, decide.

       There is no inconsistency. The theory is that the Russians prefer Trump because they think his policies will benefit them. They then took actions to promote his election.  The garnered compromising information to "lock in" his commitment to serve Russian interests with the

        threat
       </em>
       of undermining him.

       Where has CNN debunked the dossier? Sure, the dossier has unverified information, but I haven't seen any evidence of anything within it being debunked (yes, I am skeptical about it's contents, but nearly everything I've heard about the stuff inside from people here have been false eg Obama sex dolls).

       Actually it hasn't. Michael Cohen was in Prague. It's just not the Michael Cohen that people originally believed.

       You're all trying to bury the actual juicy conspiracy stuff. It's pathetic. The sex stuff is meaningless. Clearly there's a collaborative effort to try to frame this as a sex thing when it's actually about possible collusion with a foreign power. Trump team now admitting to a shady phone call they initially denied. This is what government conspiracy is all about. This is the shit this sub used top read and say "it makes you think." Now automatically denied, mischaracterized, and obfuscated.

       How about we do this thing of "objective" contemplation??
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand we have a known, established MI6 analyst bringing forth allegations.  This is followed with the US intel leadership providing material establishing the claims validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand we have various vigilantes stalking a business to "find" nefarious details.  Such as dubious videos of "underground tunnels" which "prove" ... I don't know what, but something to those who make the leap of faith to "believe" the claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shown how little either the mass-media consumer sheeple or the self styled "skeptical" sheeple of alt-media are able to understand or assimilate the technical details of what they read/hear and find even harder to have a "I don't like that truth, but will accept it" perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, both these groups are easily led by the narrative which most appeals to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental problem, which has not yet been addressed in the widespread cluster fuck of "fake news" is that the Establishment and it's Democratic Process is subordinate to an entrenched, archaic and misguided notion of "State Secret."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no surprise that the voting masses (whether "sheeple", "skeptic", "self-aware" or kazoo blowing yokel) have no trust in anything "Establishment", have a deep desire to over throw the current system, and are willing to trust any half-baked, obviously wrong and bigoted claims made by whomever this group perceives as being "outside" the "system" ... falsely believing that "an outsider" can bring about "change."
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of populist demagogues is long through history (as is the havoc wrought by them), and extremely difficult to gain-say until long after the tides of History have flushed the flotsam of their Bullshit out of the popular zeitgeist.

       But someone with a position and knowledge coming from authority is absolutely evidence. You can question the legitimacy of said authority, even speculate on its bias, but it's still better evidence than a bunch of randos on 4chan learning about metaphor.

        It's important to note that this fallacy should not be used to dismiss the claims of experts, or scientific consensus. Appeals to authority are not valid arguments, but nor is it reasonable to disregard the claims of experts who have a demonstrated depth of knowledge unless one has a similar level of understanding and/or access to empirical evidence

       Ans that's bad how? You're citing the authority fallacy. It's usually only used in cases like citing the opinion of a nuclear physicist on how to run the economy. That is an appeal to authority, guy knows his shit on a specific topic and you're sourcing him on a topic he knows nothing about. This is the exact opposite, we have an ex MI6 agent with decades of experience working in Russia.

       All of this he does at the behest of the people with real power, i.e. those who finance him, and control the business sector of the country. That's why there was such opposition to Trump; narcissistic bonehead he may be, he has no ties to the military-industrial complex, Wall Street, etc.

       Yes, this is my whole point. They WERE against him, during the election, because he was an outsider who was antagonistic toward him. Now they're not, because he's filling his cabinet with them, probably because he was instructed to.

       SFM was the Soros firm that he worked for briefly.  Dune Capital is the competing firm to SFM &amp; GS.

       IndyMac/OneWest was purchased, iirc, and then sold.  Soros was a partner while Dune owned it?  That would be news I was unaware of.  If that's what you're saying, I would definitely be interested in reading about it.  Got a source?

       No, I was offering to give undeniable proof that she was working with them and giving wonderfully supportive speeches to them, promising to help them out, during the campaign.  So with her we have confirmation of her ties to GS.

       Because in his cabinets case, everybody who has a tie to GS severed those ties years before the 2016 campaign, competed with them, and basically acted like a normal financial manager - so definitively not a love of GS, but rather people who have moved beyond GS.

       SFM was GS company that he worked for briefly.  I've asked for a source to the claims that GS was a partner at Dune or IndyMac/Onewest.  Do you have a source on that?

       Remember how Obama appointed Tom Wheeler to the FCC and everybody flipped out about how he was telecom shill?  He ended up doing a lot of good and making some awesome anti-corporate decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       GS is huge.  So huge that they have become "too big to care", which is the problem with GS. Also so huge that almost anybody who goes into a wall street career goes through them at some point.  You're going to be hard pressed to find someone who is qualified for something like Treasury Sec that hasn't worked with them at some point.  Bannon, for example, never rose high enough or stayed long enough to be anyone of consequence in the decision making levels of GS.  The GS people I'm aware of are people who
       <em>
        left
       </em>
       GS to do their own thing.  In the case of Mnuchin, starting his own business directly competing for customer dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mnuchin is probably the most questionable that I'm aware of, rising to a damn high position.  But seems to have hit a "fuck this I'm out" point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he turns out to be a Wheeler type, wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Skull&amp;Bones thing has been noted though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has Mnuchin actually been formally announced by Trump?

       When it is said that there is no evidence for Pizzagate, it should be countered by using Laura Silsby as the main piece of evidence. Laura Silsby was caught trying to leave Haiti with 33 children who weren't even orphans. One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook. Also, there's hundreds of emails where Hillary mentions Silsby or Huma sends Hillary information about Silsby.

       Here are the facts on that (not my research).
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, we need some context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate investigators cite
       <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">
        this documen
       </a>
       t as proof that "One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook."
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not true according to their own link. The linked document says:
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at this
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">
        shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet
       </a>
       from Wikileaks where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that "One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook..." This has been edited to say "the Clintons" instead of "Hillary" because the linked 46-page document doesn't even mention Hillary's name. And besides, "the Clintons took over the scene?" The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the "orphans" and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happened to Silby?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3 months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had “[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more about trafficking of human beings.’”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More bombshells about the people who were "trafficking in Haitian orphans," from the same document. Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help. It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this
       <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">
        excerpt from an ICE News Release
       </a>
       to put it all into context:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of "Puello Consulting" in the Dominican Republic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the "alleged" lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.
       </p>
       <p>
        An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it's not even funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">
        this email

       Assuming pizzagate is real Bill and Hillary are both involved. I assumed they're talking about Hillary, as she was the SOS at the time and probable had more inside political pull than Bill, not to say that he isn't involved in Pizzagate, assuming it is eventually found to be real.

       Silsby got a sentence based on the technical letter of the law but willingly accepting a fee for giving your children (or any person) away is trafficking/slavery and endangerment. This allows well connected political persons (Clintons) who know how it works, to actively maneuver around it. Silsby was taking them to an
       <em>
        unauthorized
       </em>
       orphanage. If this were legit, this wouldn't have been the case. It also doesn't explain for the parents who were outraged when this happened. Not every testimony was that of "we willingly gave away our child".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Perhaps they tried but were, in fact, unsuccessful (perhaps because local people were outraged that they just tried to steal/traffick 33 children and weren't going to let this beezy get off the hook) which would explain the quote you listed before this and why they weren't able to get her charges dropped. Also, if someone you are highly connected to suddenly has some crazy charges against them (murder, trafficking, rape) it's amazing how quickly friends/acquaintances and the like disappear. It's called distancing yourself for fear of association and typically the people with the most to hide, distance themselves the furthest. That would explain why there is zero mention of Hillary in the report and explicitly getting everyone involved released
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       her furthers my belief that it's because they were tied so closely together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps Torres was the middle man so they kept their hands clean. He approaches the families, makes a financial offer families can't refuse, moves the kids, delivers them to Silsby, and then collects his money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smartest thing to do when committing a crime is to hide in plain sight. No offender involved in Pizzagate is going to walk up to someone (outside the inner circles) and say "I would like 1 child please. I'm going to take them home and rape, torture, and drug them". Those expecting to find that type of "smoking gun" are wasting their precious time. For a lot of the elite, the higher you get in society, the more it becomes about the subtlety of something. I.e. Hidden in plain sight.

       If the main piece of evidence is that the clintons may have tried doing something (of which there is no evidence of) but didnt end up doing it (of which there is evidence of) then you are effectively claiming that the clintons are culpable for this for the sole reason that they didn't do it.

       She was caught in Haiti and jailed for trying to traffic 33 children and the first thing the Clinton Foundation did when they moved into Haiti was Hillary pardoned her, and she now creepily works on the board of directors for a company called AlertSense that is in charge of issuing amber alerts.
       <a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">

       (Laura Silsby-Gayler)
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawyer Hillary used to help absolve Laura also was a convicted child trafficker, you just can't make this stuff up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts.
      </p>
      <p>
       WikiLeaks also retweeted this story confirming it's truth and supported with emails to and from Hillary:

        https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       WikiLeaks then confirmed Hillary has a LONG history with convicted child trafficker and kidnapper Laura Silsby, and Huma Abedin (vice chairwoman of Hillary's 2016 presidential campaign) has been forwarding emails about Laura Silsby's non government organization to Hillary for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laura Silsby's NGO was The New Life Children's Refuge, the same group that was busted by Haitian authorities trying to traffic kids:

      </p>
      <p>
       And the video below is about a bunch of Haitians protesting the evils of the Clintons, and the man protesting in the video mentions how the Clintons have exploited Haiti's resources for themselves, and even specifically mentions people in Haiti are afraid to go out at night because of  fear of kidnapping.

      <p>
       At around the 2:00 mark he even mentions Tony Rodham (Hillary's brother) is now in charge of gold mines in Haiti and sits on the gold mine's board of directors.

       Many people are talking about this story, continue to spread the word!! We need justice for these
 crimes, and the Clintons should be in prison.

       There's circumstantial evidence. It wouldn't be a conspiracy anymore if we had complete hard evidence, now would it? It's well documented that the Clinton's (an many other politicians) surround themselves with known, convicted pedophiles. To sit here and say there's nothing there when they helped someone caught red handed smuggling children across country lines is laughable. Hell even Silsby's lawyer was a human trafficker. There's too much too ignore, and this is just a small scope into the circumstantial evidence surrounding pizzagate.

       I endorse Pizzagate being investigated and discussed. Some of the "evidence" presented thus far is simply false, pure and simple. There is just as much hearsay in conspiracies as there are in corporate whoring media, this just happens as a natural consequence of our growing flood of information.

       Why do these lies about no evidence keep showing up in what's supposed to be an apolitical skeptic sub? Evidence /= Proof. And I'd say intelligence from the operative who exposed FIFA is definitely evidence. Even hearsay is evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you trying to convince a conspiracy sub it was debunked? How about you let us discuss, debunk, and decide for ourselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you suppressing one conspiracy theory to push another one? They are not mutually exclusive. You can believe in both, one or the other, or neither. The point is this is supposed to be a place to have all those discussions, not force your own narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you delegitimizing an entire packet of juicy conspiracy info by labelling it "Pissgate". Nobody cares about the piss, we care about the Siberian Candidate stuff. The fact that no discussions of it exist on the front page of r/conspiracy and the big thread about it was removed is very telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most telling thing is you're pushing an opinion that Pizzagate is being suppressed, when the #1 top post on this sub right now is pro-Pizzagate. Do people here not recognize this bullshit for what it is anymore?

       It's shows the hypocrisy of the mods and many users who frequent here.  They want proof and when they get some evidence that goes against their vested interests, it's labeled as fake news.  This sub should be about questioning every thing, but that seems to have gone by the wayside.

       First of all, I hardly ever post in r/politics.  I might check it out to see what sort of shit they are cooking up over there, but to say that I brigade anything is childish.  I'm willing to give Trump as much of a chance as anyone, but I will be highly critical of him because he has shown that he doesn't give a damn about speaking the truth.  I have never in my life seen a man take every position there is to take on a subject and not have his political career put in jeopardy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that so many can blindly follow him without questioning his motives or background is highly alarming to me.  Him being held in low regard is nothing new either.  He has been a public figure since the 80s and many people have had things to say about him that don't exactly paint him as a shining knight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, enlighten me.  What news outlets have debunked this?  I'm looking and I can not find a single reputable source that does.

       This is what I started doing after the 2008 election. I had only voted once before, in 2004 (as I turned 18 in 2004), and always leaned more conservative, so I wasn't exactly jumping for joy when Obama first won.
      </p>
      <p>
       But holy shit, the instant backlash and unabashed racism I started seeing from my peers made me stop in my tracks. I started recognizing the very same smear tactics, fear-mongering, and outright lying that the right criticized the left for utilizing during Bush years being employed by those same people attacking Obama, and they were completely shameless in it, too. They didn't have given a single shit that they were acting like hypocrites, and happily perpetuated and passed along every outrageous lie they came across about Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only once I started replacing "Obama" with "Bush" in their absurd accusations, and throwing them back in their faces, did some of them see the point I was trying to make: that they were happily allowing themselves to be manipulated through the use of confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those people were few and far between, and the resulting insanity that gripped the GOP during Obama's administration only reaffirmed my decision to register as an independent at 17. This isn't an endorsement of the democratic party, either, as both sides have batshit crazy hardliners, but as of now, the right is winning whatever terrible game they're playing, and the results are terrifying.

       I don't know where I read it (back then I wasn't on Reddit or Digg, even), but I'll be forever grateful to whoever first introduced me to the concept of confirmation bias. After reading up on it, I immediately recognized so many instances in that four year time period (between first being able to vote and starting to distance myself from the GOP) where I never thought to search out sources, let alone even question the intended or subconscious bias behind what I was being told by the people whose opinions I valued. But back in late 2008, after Obama won, and I watched the party I had loudly and proudly attached myself to with Bush, lose its absolute fucking mind over what essentially boiled down to having their decorated war vet with a long history in Washington lose out to a black democrat who was only a junior senator was the straw that broke the camel's back for plenty of Republicans, including most of my close friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully, though, a lot of my current ideologies were shaped (and, just as importantly, continue to be shaped) by allowing myself to push past that (admittedly powerful) initial urge to reject whatever goes against my narrative, and instead look past the news articles, bloggers, and talking heads who are telling me what they know I want to hear, and instead look for the overall "us versus them" theme between to the two sides. While they'll never align with each other, it's incredibly easy to compile all articles and talking points on each side of the aisle and get an almost-blatant impression of what and how we're being told to feel; one from the liberal side, one from the conservative side, and each full of just as many truths as it they are crammed with as much bullshit as they can get away with (which, in this last election cycle, was a metric fuckton).
      </p>
      <p>
       To avoid the usual circlejerk (and another unnecessarily long comment), I'll try to do something I need to do more often, especially on Reddit, which is remind myself of this very simple truth:
       <strong>
        I am, and always will be, swayed by confirmation bias
       </strong>
       , even in the smallest of ways. Everyone is, to a certain extent, and while I like to believe I do my best to police and catch a runaway thought before it takes root, it doesn't always work, and this last election cycle has been a true test. I despise everything about Trump and his policies, so not allowing my gut reactions to immediately determine every article that paints him in a bad light as true has been a more of a challenge than I would like to admit, especially when I see myself falling for the very same emotional traps I spent eight years admonishing my conservative friends for falling into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I avoided the default politics subreddit like the plague (as just about anyone really should), but, ironically, just as quickly and happily, subbed to EnjoughTrumpSpam knowing full well what it was being used for. I think, there, though, I can (possibly poorly) justify it in the sense that ETS isn't in any way trying to hide its bias, in the same that T_D users justify its bias by claiming the exact same thing. Apart from that, though, having to wade through the not-always-obvious clickbait to get to the real sources isn't always as easy as letting righteous indignation take over by venting about him on Facebook, simply "doing my (weak-ass) part" by sharing a link and moving on. However, as I lament the fact so many of my intelligent friends on both sides of the political divide quickly spread any link to what could be hot garbage so long as it proves them right and the other side wrong, I try to hold off on the Facebook rants until a story has at least been verified true or false. Plus, as was pointed out above, the simple technique of substituting one figure for their political opposite to see if your emotional reaction to that changes at all is a fantastic indicator of how easily you're swayed by confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters have rightfully pointed out the left's unwillingness to even acknowledge a clear, biased narrative being pushed out hourly by certain companies, and by adding the self-same argument I have used so extensively over the past eight years to call out neoconservatives on their bullshit, only for them to call bullshit on the left's now-apparent similar behavior, hit home hard so hard that I actually let out a groan when I realized I had fallen back into that trap again. It had just been long enough between my personal, political paradigm shift and this election cycle that I’d nearly forgotten how easy it is to get swept up in the lies when you're only searching for one narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, though, while I police myself like this, whatever common ground I may be able to find with Trump supporters (or at least begrudgingly admitting when they were right for calling me out on my shit) is usually quickly lost when some of Trump's more zealot-like devotees seem to take a left-leaning bias as "proof" of a greater worldwide conspiracy against them and Trump; a nefarious, far-reaching plan to stop their attempts to end globalization, plus whatever shit the Muslims/Blacks/Mexicans/Jews are cooking up this week, as though Al Jolson was playing every blatantly racist, Legion of Doom character in their paranoid little minds, plotting and executing their plans for the great White Genocide. Instead of taking things a step further after spotting the biases on both sides, and realizing that
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       is now acting so cavalier about how malleable we are in highly emotional states, that this same level of meddling with the public almost always requires government oversight in other industries, or at the very least, approval beforehand, but that’s another topic entirely. So,  for whatever forward progress they made in actively recognizing those issues, they immediately took ten steps back when they all but admit they're okay with Trump's "version of things" since he's just gotta do what he's gotta do to fight back against the establishment (while blatantly ignoring just how pro-establishment Trump, and his cabinet selections, are).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr:
       </strong>
       Long story short, the bias is everywhere, and if you're the kind of person who thinks "It's only on 'their' side," or "'They're' side has more of it" while blatantly overlooking or outright encouraging equally-biased lies to perpetuate on your side, you're just as guilty as those writing and distributing that propaganda. It's become damn near impossible to avoid any level of bias now that the "if it bleeds, it leads" ideology from network news has transitioned seamlessly to the internet, encompassing every facet of life (and covering every phobia mankind can think up) that if there exists even the smallest possibility of causing a few thousand people to share a story, there are those sites with no qualms about flat making shit up, while others may draw the line at outright fabrication, but will take the potential hit of having to print a canned retraction later if it turns out to be false. If you're reading this and thinking of very specific instances where some company you hate pulled shit like this, I promise you there are just as many instances of some company you think has your best interest at heart pulling the exact same stunts, but usually in a way you agree with so "it's not so bad." This may seem obvious to some (or even most) of you, but I guarantee you it’s not so clear to others (and even some of you claiming otherwise, as confirmation bias and denial are so very similar). And since someone just mentioning the phrase “confirmation bias” in passing, on some webpage I visited eight years ago, had such a lasting and profound effect on me during a similarly tumultuous political climate, it seems necessary to repeat, especially now that both sides have dropped all pretenses or senses of decorum and are so blatant in their lies that it only takes a cursory Google search to disprove that it makes you wonder how they thought they were going to get away with it. Then, you realize they expect to get away with it (and will) because a large enough majority are now so willingly nodding along to whatever they hear so long it fits the narrative they’ve romanticized, built-up, or in a lot of cases, completely made up.

       : I agree. Moderates and those who align themselves to the middle by default are a quietly dying breed; or maybe they're not, maybe it really is just one of those "vocal minority" situations, but it doesn't feel like it. It now feels like the old "vocal minority," who pestered us with early morning sound bites set as our alarm tones, but were otherwise easy to drown out, have been replaced by a couple dozen 25-to-40-year-olds who literally follow our every footstep, only inches behind, bull-horns in hand and switching between spewing today's dead-horsed buzzword and calling us pieces of filth who are less than human for daring to ever make

       Even my few remaining moderate republican friends ("few remaining" as in most have gone full alt-right, not in that we've cut ties) are
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       showing concern over seeing their party being eroded from the inside-out by sycophantic hardliners who knew exactly how to play the demographic against itself. My response was cutting ties with the GOP and reevaluating nearly every political (and, by some extensions, moral) ideology I had tentatively held before; their response seems to be flat denial. Although, to be fair, they've had another near-decade's worth of holding on to those ideologies to deal with, too. It's not as though I spent 20 years of my adult life leaning right only to change up in my 40s; they were really nothing more than ideologies I had co-opted from adults around me when I was in my teens, and never bothered to look into.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, 2008-09 was still a very surreal time period for me, not only because I was calling into question my own prejudices after realizing I formed nearly every major political alignment I held out of a gut reaction from the 2003 invasion (I very much bought into the "fighting for democracy" bullshit at 16), but also because my mind couldn't reconcile the fact of just how childish and petty the right was acting over Obama's 2008 win.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was so pathetic, in fact, that I doubted I would ever see that kind of behavior again, yet with each passing year, house Republicans continued to show just how low they were willing to go. But what took the cake was that those very people, both politicians and citizens alike, started going on self-satisfied rants about how "Trump won, so stop complaining," as though they hadn't spent the past eight years going well past complaining about Obama; as though they
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       don't continue to propagate so-thoroughly-debunked "conspiracy theories" that you have to wonder what 12-year-old binged on Alex Jones videos for a week-and-a-half, thought, "I could do better," then swiped a few of his Dad's beers before penning yet another opus showcasing a stunning lack in originality by ultimately ruining the Scooby-Doo reveal at the end, because, you guessed it, it was The Jews
       <sup>
        TM
       </sup>
       all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       As bad as the conspiracy theories are, it's nothing compared to the large majority of my Trump supporting friends who are seemingly so quick to ignore their own past behavior and very-public comments about Obama, liberals, etc. A college buddy of mine went so far as to congratulate himself on the hilarious delusion that if "Clinton had won, I'd have accepted it and moved on," when he had just made a post, only days prior, talking about the " real action" he'd take if Clinton won; that her securing the position was undeniable proof of treason, and that all Democracy-loving Americans should seriously consider Trump's "words" on how to deal with another 4 years of a liberal-run country (as in, that not-so-subtle "second amendment" line from August) Literally only days before smugly jerking himself off over the idea of how level-headed and logical he was for "staying above the fray," he was strongly insinuating that "true Patriots" should take up arms against their country should Clinton have won. As much as I felt like calling that shit out publicly (because there's nothing quite as satisfying as watching a hardliner backpedal when they realize they may have revealed their hand too soon), I forced myself to remember the person behind the rhetoric, and messaged him instead, simply pointing out that it his claims of being okay with a Clinton presidency ring really false when the very next post on his Timeline is talking about "taking REAL action" against Clinton. No hyperbole or petty name-calling, just pointing that one thing out. I got the best response I could have hoped for in that he didn't respond, but did delete or hide the post about taking action against Clinton soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remembering the person is so important, and has been a huge fucking challenge this election cycle. Even after I started leaning more left, I never forgot just how easy it was to get sucked up into those lies and rhetoric, all while convincing yourself that "it must be true if everyone else thinks so, too." So, in that regard, I've always tried my hardest to remember the person behind the politics, at least when it comes to those in my personal life. When I leaned heavily conservative, I didn't have any ill intentions, but I did come to some wildly misguided conclusions based on statements that I just assumed to be the truth from a young age, as opposed to finding out for myself, or, at the very least, questioning the narrative being displayed. So, even when I could only watch in mild horror as the Tea Party and birther movement spread through the GOP faster than herpes through a whorehouse, I told myself to remember the person when it came to those I know and love who are likely getting swept up in the fervor, as going on the offensive and acting pissed off right out the gate, without so much as attempting to hear their side, only ever causes people to defend their stances even harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, when my Dad started regurgitating literal sound bites from Fox News about Obama being born in Africa, it was easy to remember that this is my Dad, a man I love and respect, and not some
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BDbK9Ey.jpg">
        caricature

       of the prototypical souless conservative that others had created (and one I was starting to agree with, even though I hated the thought of it). So, I just calmly pointed out that the birther story had already been debunked, and he countered for a few minutes until I had to pull out my phone and do the least amount of research possibly needed to disprove an obvious lie, yet a step enough people don't seem to take (or one they undertake only in the hopes they'll be right, otherwise ignoring all the evidence to the contrary should they be wrong).
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know what? It worked, at least to an extent. While he felt embarrassed because he had been telling anyone who would listen about his "misgivings over Obama's heritage," he was mostly upset about how he hadn't even questioned it when he first heard it. He just accepted it because of his view of the democratic party, and never bothered to check for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       He still is, and likely always will be, a Republican, or, at least, the kind of Republican he feels the party stood for in the oh-so-glorious Reagan years (which, don't even get me started on the amount of disillusionment I felt over learning about him after 18 years of him being canonized in my house). However, in the years since the birther conversation, the number of emails I get that qualified for ForwardsFromGrandma and the amount of times he's gone on a rant about what liberals are trying to do now have dropped dramatically. Maybe he's just recognizing that he's got an uphill battle with me in terms of trying to "bring me back to the flock," and not bothering. Honestly, though, I like think it's because he had a smaller, but still important, moment like I did in that he recognized a character flaw and tried to course-correct as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, though, that my dad's reaction to finding out he had believed in, and perpetuated, a lie about a politically and ideologically different person has been rare. For every one person (on both sides) who is willing to accept that they'd been duped (and some will even go on to call themselves out for spreading misinformation), there are 100  who double-down on the denial and group-think, giving themselves wholly over to the whims and delusions of a billionaire CEO whose closest brush with any level of adversity is legitimately feeling victimized over being called out for the abhorrent shit he does and says on a daily basis. And all from his gilded Manhattan high rise, a view from which he has figuratively and literally looked down on the every class below his his entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save for extreme cases like the Westboro Baptist Church, KKK, and the many militant groups on both sides, I spent the past eight years looking past the politics and remembering that people have very personal reasons for their political alignment, even if they're poorly formed. But the moment David Duke endorsed Trump, and Trump tried to pretend he was horrified that the once-leader of America's oldest hate group would align himself wholly with all of Trump's policies, I knew things were going to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump straight up mocked a disabled person (oops, sorry, was "doing a standard retard" impression, according to Anne Coulter), I knew all sense of decorum was long gone. The very fact people were even debating that Trump was mocking a retarded person, a disabled person, or just "doing a character" made the whole thing worse; it was as though everyone else got the memo and made an unspoken agreement to just argue about his intentions behind the actions as opposed to having any proper sense of shame the fact that the man leading their party only has enough self-control to stop halfway through calling someone a retard during a speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election killed so much of my compassion and empathy, and I'm doing my best to let it grow back, but the vocal fuckery won't let that happen any time soon.

       Point is, they're shirking their duties as good citizens by not criticizing that which they voted for. You can vote for people and yet still disagree with things they say and do. Criticism is good, criticism is right. People would have criticized Hillary if she got elected. But she didn't, Trump did, and now people are trying to criticize him, but it's not Trump supporters.

       Don't forget being on record talking about Epstein, articles about him walking into the female dressing room for his teen pageants, the lawsuit about him raping a 13 year old, those really weird clips of him talking to little girls and saying how he'd be dating them when they got older, and I'm sure there's someone else there too that I'm missing.

       Trump's comments about Epstein's predilection for young women (in some old magazine profile of Epstein long preceding the revelation of the man's sexual misdeeds) do not necessarily indicate Trump's knowledge of illegal activity. One could argue that the casual nature of his remarks - the fact that he would comment upon it at all - instead demonstrates innocent obliviousness to illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's Trump shortly before announcing saying Bill Clinton has an Epstein island problem:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAmt8Hm25g0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAmt8Hm25g0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That rape lawsuit was likely a hoax, because it was orchestrated by a former Jerry Springer producer with a record of making outrageous claims about celebrities:
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuits-norm-lubow">
        https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuits-norm-lubow
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawsuit attempted to link Trump to Epstein and Epstein-like crimes, so I suspect it was commissioned by HRC allies for the purpose of silencing Trump on the aforementioned Clinton-Epstein issue. It worked.

       Your logical fallacy is: strawman!
      </p>
      <p>
       By exaggerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone's argument, it's much easier to kresenr your own position as being reasonable, but this kind of djshknesty serves to undermine rational debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your logical fallacy is also: to quoque!
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally translating as 'you too' this fallacy is commonly employed as an effective red herring because it takes the heat off the accused having to defend themselves and shifts the focus back into the accuser themselves.

       I've stated many times that Putin is sketchy. But even the sketchiest motherfucker won't get charged for a crime with no evidence. I'd happily take some. The problem is there isn't any. That's why even the most ardent Trump haters are calling bullshit. That's why even fucking socialists opposed to all of the fascism Trump represents are calling bullshit.

       I'm not a trump supporter, I'm not even American but what is wrong if trump is friends with putin. It seems to me that having a president who will have good relations with russia is a good thing.

      <p>
       Also there is no evidence that putin directly ordered the podesta/clinton hacks but the obama administration is pushing that shit like its gospel and the whole world is lapping it up because obama wouldn't lie.

       Then we have hillary taking millions from the saudi's which is fact and nobody cares. This is a foreign government trying to influence the american presidential race by backing there candidate (hillary) who would have owed the saudi's.

       This is who the country voted for in the Primaries. The system did not present these people to us, these are the people that 1/3rd of the country picked in the primaries.

       Part of that equation is the exclusion of third parties from debates and MSM pretty much disparaging them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gary Johnson's and Jill Steins of the world may have a chance to win if MSM isn't either not covering them or telling audiences that they don't have a chance.

       Well, maybe not Jill Stein given she's been outed as being manipulated by Russia too... but I definitely agree that third party candidates are totally screwed over by the current system. Single transferable vote and open primaries for the win!

       I voted for Trump.  I was going to vote for Gary johnson but at the end of the day voting 3rd party is meaningless so long as MSM and the people running the elections alienate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I voted in the interest of keeping Crooked Hillary out of the white house and I'd do it again.

       Do you think the people he's appointing have the same agenda you do? All those Goldman guys?  Are you really OK with the way he's played along with Putin? Some say he was just played, but maybe it only looks that way. I think we're in for a 4 year shit show. 60% of the country hates him, including the media, and he hasn't even been inaugurated yet.

       I think the appointees should be showing everybody that in our current system, it really doesn't matter who's president because the same people behind the scenes are waiting in line to hold such positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a video about John Podesta that says when Obama got in office a citicorp executive was just emailing him lists of people to appoint and they were appointed, as was the citicorp guy.

       I followed Obama's finance appointments pretty closely and I agree with you. He immediately dumped his populist advisers and sold out to the bankers. I'm also absolutely certain Trump will be worse. He's not even president yet and he's already trying to destabilize the EU. How is that good for the US? How is building up Putin good for the US? How is starting a trade war with China good for the US? I could go on like that for a while, but it's too early in the day to get all stirred up. Maybe I'm getting it all wrong and he'll be a great President, but I have a very bad feeling about where we're headed.

       To be clear, I'm not necessarily saying there's darn Ruskie spooks infiltrating every subreddit. What I'm saying is that they generate pro-Putin propaganda that can then spread to sites like Reddit through social circles, intersecting with the people who are desperate to believe anything that's anti-American establishment. If they do that enough times and with enough force, that propaganda can become the norm.

       Since the beginning of the election, there has been a huge influx of these posters on every forum Ive seen on the internet.  From bodybuilding forums, to every board of most chans, to facebook, reddit subs galore, etc.  Everywhere seems tainted and they appear out of nowhere, on topic or off topic doesnt matter.  Im reading them and can only hear

       The allegation is that the FSB (KGB) has a video of DT entertaining two Russian Prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, and they could use it to blackmail DT.  From reading the dossier, it seems that DT was watching some hot girl/girl action, that happened to invoke some good natured lady pee play.  While the details are humorously lurid, it's the blackmail factor that is interesting.

       You do realize that a lot of us were in r/conspiracy way before we backed Trump right? So it's pretty dumb to dismiss a whole bunch of people only because they support Trump. OPs post raises a legitimate question. No mainstream news agencies touched pizzagate but they jumped all over pissgate with nothing but hearsay. There are known pedophilia rings throughout Hollywood and Catholic churches its well documented. So for a lot of people in this sub to be so adamantly against the theory that there is sex trafficking of children going on with Podesta and company really makes me think that it's this sub that's compromised and the constant discredit campaign on anyone who subscribes to T_D needs to stop.

       There's a lot of odd behavior and evidence of something sinister happening around John Podesta, Alfentais, and other people involved in pizzagate. The fact that they had close ties to Epstein who's been convicted of pedophilia doesn't play well to your defense. I don't see why so many people are ready to deny this and say nothing is going on instead of looking more into it. If there's nothing going on then you have nothing to worry about let the people investigating it continue to do so.

       Many wealthy people had ties to Epstein, including Trump. The nature of Epstein's crimes is well documented, and has nothing to do with a child sex ring in a pizzeria. He solicited underage teenage prostitutes.

       I'm not basing it off of the Epstein connection alone. There's numerous things I've seen that make pizzagate extremely believable. For starters besta Pizza symbol was the actual boy love symbol. The strange behavior and posts on Comet Ping Pong Pizza Instagram account showing a young girl with her hands taped down to a table. Then you have the guy from the Department of Justice whose in charge of Prosecuting these child pedophiles in the area where these pizza shops are making comments all these Instagram pictures that are kind of vague and somewhat sexual. I can go on and on but the best thing you could do is actually research it for yourself if you want me to give you some information I can do so after I get off of work. But as I said this stuff is just the tip of the iceberg it's a bunch of coincidences after coincidences after coincidences until you kind of realize it's not really a coincidence at all.

       Yup, lets pick a secretary of state who is a "friend of Russia" and ex-ExxonMobil.  Then Trump says, lets take sanctions off Russia, what a great idea.  So the oil flows and corporate profits rain in for ExxonMobil.  Then Trump says: let's bomb the oil pipelines controlled by ISIS and get ExxonMobil to rebuild them.  it doesn't get any god damn clearer than that.

       You know how everyone used that word "conspiratard" to describe us when we accused the NSA and CIA and FBI of spying on every single thing we do, and then we turned out to be right? They used that word because there were also people who honestly believed that Obama was a secret Kenyan Muslim who managed to fool every single intelligence agency in the world and became President. Those people are retarded. And they're the same ones that vote for Trump. And yeah, they're the ones who think a bunch of emails exposed a secret pedophile ring being operated out of a pizza place. As though these rich people couldn't afford some remote and inaccessible compound in Wyoming to house a bunch of sex slaves, no they had to use a fucking pizza shop basement that doesn't exist according to every single available record.

       This sub has been my favorite for a while. But I more recently spend a lot of time on TD. To me, Trump, even though rich, is about changing this corrupt system. So, tbh, I thought the two subs went well together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be critical of Trump, sure, no problem to me. But the way the media and intelligence agencies (at least CIA), are going after him, he must be doing something right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure why the two subs have to be mutually exclusive.

       If the real enemy for the DNC is the Russians, why did they make a deal to sell them the american Uranium found in oregon ?  (I've followed what happened in realtime. More than a year ago, the whole patriots-occupying-a-federal-building-in-Burns-County.. The resulting death of Lavoy Finnicum? The FBI doing a psyop in the village, the kidnapping of kids for leverage,  the strange undoings of the Judge and non-constitutional sheriff, tied through masonic serment....it went deep! ) who decided not to protect the population and handed it to the corrupt FBI agents... All sounds like a movie plot, but it happened.. Just because of gold and uranium under many acres of land owned privately by citizens.   #LandGrabs #FederalizationOfEverything

       Its somewhat more complicated than that. Well, not really. The US uranium industry is basically dead. The uranium deal was simply just a way to sell a company that had no willing purchaser to an interest that was willing to get back in the extraction process.

       No... The Bundy's were victims too !  It happened to many rancher families.. Imagine if, illegally and unconstitutionally, a government wanted to have your privately own land for whatever reasons (and your life's earnings depended on it),  wouldn't you fight for it to get it stolen?  What would you do if it happened again to another rancher family had the same trouble.. Wouldn't you want to help them up to fight OFF the BLM (Bureau of Land Management-Federal), acting as if they OWNED your property and decided what to do with it? Add to that the fact that the MSM is pretty much owned by the (shadow) government and uses it to tweak the public opinion and sell all this off as a story with crazy people.. It's outraging.

       Article I, section 8, clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution gives the feds control of 10 square miles of Washington DC. It further states that land within the boundaries of a state may only be acquired if they first have the consent of the state legislature. The federal government is limited in it’s acquisition of land to four purposes, military forts, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings. Nowhere in the constitution does it grant the federal government the power to “own” millions of acres. The so called "public lands" that they currently control must be returned to the states.

       Cuz it's not really a rabbit hole.  It doesn't connect globally.  It doesn't involve enslavement of the masses, human trafficking, child trafficking, pedophilia, organ harvesting, tissue research, the fed, most politicians, some/most gov't agencies, or powerful private mercenary armies; all while using a hidden ancient religion that worships Saturn as a fundamental part of it.

       But anonymous sources said so!

       What could possibly wrong if people just believed whatever anonymous sources told the press? You should trust your government - especially when they are supposedly speaking the press anonymously!

       The source isn't anonymous, he's the guy that leaked the FIFA scandal. He's proven he's credible, unlike a bunch of morons from /pol/ who threw a bunch of straight up bullshit together and created a theory that I shit you not is crazier than the one from A Beautiful Mind, strings and paper clippings and everything.

       I keep asking for sources and then people respond with links citing anonymous sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone, last night someone actually had a link to some real journalism with info on Flynn's phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the people posting links to reports from anonymous sources (while claiming they do not rely on anonymous sources) are really drowning out the content with proper sources and research.

       "The AP" is not the same as "AP Source." It matters a lot that they make this distinction very clear on their site. People on reddit making it or not, not so much.

       The AP is not the original source of the claim. The "AP source" which they were communicating with is.

      <p>
       Let's say you read a quote from Obama in the New York Times. If you were talking about the quote, you wouldn't say the source of it was the New York Times, or that the New York Times said "whatever he said." You'd say Obama said "whatever he said."

       Probably because this sub has an uncomfortable way of making it seem like the Left are ALL satanic (a "problem" that literally made me not give a shit about this; the last time anyone thought satanist were anything more than slightly edgy hedonists were uptight religious types from the 80s) pedophiles all in on this crime ring using 4chan word filters as their secret code words, while no corruption that the Right does is worth worrying about, even though there was a time when this sub reminded people that BOTH SIDES are equally corrupt.

       Meanwhile, elsewhere in this thread, the brainwashed-fucktard-Hitlery-supporter crowd are screaming about how Pissgate is a REAL conspiracy despite being 100% debunked by dozens of outlets and not having even a single piece of credible evidence to begin with.

       That, to them, is proof that it has tons of evidence.

       Sound comparison! No really, totally intellectually honest.

       You seem to be suggesting that an anonymous source means the story should not be given any critical thought or attention. I'm saying that claim
       <em>
        by itself
       </em>
       is absurd. How about you give it more than like 4 days since the story dropped to allow people to try and gather some evidence.

      <p>
       That's what the Watergate investigation did. That's not what we did for Iraq. The difference between the two being time and effort by objective investigators. Maybe let that happen.

       They have reported the dates of the calls and Flynn has given excuses as to why he called.  It's out  there as a FACT that is admitted by this member of the Trump team.  Talk about blind partisan.  #fakenews bullshit has to stop.

       It's simple, the mods and most vocal users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are doing everything to push their agenda even if it means denouncing evidence and extolling blatant falsehood. They are afraid of how mainstream the anti-Trump sentiments have become since the election. It's hard to defend democracy while celebrating the election of a candidate that lost the popular vote. It's hard to contradict a growing mountain of certainty that Trump has colluded with Russian agents. It's hard to prove that Hilary is tied to a ring of pedophiles and that one of their own came very close to commiting murder over those claims. It's easy to block out dissent. It's easy to cover your ears and stamp your feet and say "I know I'm right."

       Unfortunately, no. As long as I've been on Reddit, there hasn't been an American politics releated subreddit that wasn't eventually taken over by hard-leaning conservatives or liberals. Considering how hard it is to just
       <em>
        find
       </em>
       unbiased news, it's almost impossible to keep control over a subreddit that doesn't eventually get flooded with a majority leaning one way or the other.

       Mainstream sentiment against trump isn't worth shit, it's an industry of ass clowns. If any single band of liberals try to stop Trump's inauguration every gun owner in us, the armed forces, and the fucking silent majority that is locked and loaded will fucking gut you little shits.

       We already know that the Russians have a team of "Internet trolls" attempting to sway opinion.  This is probably a few hundred people and countless bots posting this nonsense on 4Chan /pol/, the_cuckold and

       I don't think anyone is being paid to post on 4chan, they're just aggregating tabloid sources to justify spinning ridiculous theories about whatever is on the news. Paying people to run bots on Twitter seems a lot more plausible, because there are definitely a lot of bots with a political bias on Twitter.

       why would Russia want to shut down the Trump-Russia link? Russia wants the US to melt down and what better way to do that than to have the Trump-Russia link to be front and center during the Congressional hearings on nominees and in the runup to the inauguration? Russia wants people on the left calling for a disruption of the peaceful transfer of power, that would be Putin's wet dream. Russia could even be cultivating the intelligence with an eye towards its disclosure, that's just as likely as your scenario.

       Because their end-game is removal of oil sanctions imposed after they were involved in Ukraine.  Those sanctions are costing them billions.  Guess who else wants those sanctions lifted?  Exxon-mobil, Rex Tillerson's old company.  They have holdings in Russia.  Who better to ensure Trump gets it done than the "friend of Russia" Tillerson.

       The difference is Pizzagate is a open source citizen investigation sourced from actual emails from the DNC and John Podesta while Pissgate is a "report" that Wikileaks has called fraudulent that only gained traction through a mass bot upvoting campaign.

       Welcome to why some of us don't believe in the idea that Wikileaks is some infallible source of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "report" you so obviously use quotes to dismiss, is intelligence gathered by Christopher Steele, an ex-MI6 investigator. More on this from BBC's Paul Wood:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And the former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by "the head of an East European intelligence agency".

       That is the dumbest thing I've seen Wikileaks claim recently. They claim it isn't an intelligence report. Guess what, it isn't! It was intelligence gathered as opposition research by former MI6.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your opinion is Wikileaks is infallible, I just don't buy it. They are obviously pushing an agenda, unless you believe Wikileaks somehow doesn't know the details of where this info came from.

       That's because the community actually cares about Pizzagate while Pissgate is just an artificial non story that only gained traction by being massively upvoted by bots.

       Are either of them primary? No? Did Paul Wood cite himself? No? So I didn't dance around shit, I'm sorry I understand spies are fucking paid to lie, if he in fact talked to one. If you want to keep playing he said-she said go back to middle school bitch. Also, if you listen to unnamed sources you are a fucking idiot. That is how you get people to think Russia hacked the electric grid in fucking Vermont. Go learn about Gary Webb and Jimmy Saville faggot.

       The mods are trumplets too... which is why they first tagged the original "Trump allegations" thread as "unverified allegations", then changed that tag to "hoax" and finally deleted the thread.

       Just look at the "top" section for week.  For today's listing of top posts for the week there is only one negative post about Trump.  And it's only about his five Goldman Sachs appointments.

       WOW top comment defending Pissgate and dismissing Pizzagate? It looks like the shills are lurking in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your explanation is begging the question, answering a  legitimate question with a bullshit response about "what's your agenda pushing one conspiracy over another??" That's because the Pissgate is reported by the WHOLE MEDIA and is unsubstantiated and its combed over and it's worst case scenario is pushed to the brink. While Pizzagate which is far more dastardly of a conspiracy is pushed under the rug despite rampant child abuse trafficking being evident in governments and institutes of power like the churches all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beware all the concern trolls that try to confuse you from looking into the real conspiracy. A safe way to think about it is: if the legacy media is researching and reporting it, it's fully vetted by TPTB and approved for discussion. If it's being STIFLED by the legacy media for ANY reason, then it's unapproved, and you should look closer.

       Sure. You seem to imply Pizzagate is not suppressed when it's own subreddit was taken down. That is dismissing it. OP has a legitimate argument, that the Pissgate narrative was even dismissed as BOGUS BY WIKILEAKS, who has 100% track record. They extended themselves quite a bit to put that wording on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't entirely writing it off, no, but by trying to give equal credence to this thought that Russia is some huge enemy that they have viable serious blackmail on trump, despite serious journalists like Glenn Greenwald and JA dismissing the "proof" as most likely propaganda... It's disingenuous to put these two things in the same realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that a lot of people want to jump on anything bad against trump and believe me I am ready to join the fight; but don't bite on shit that's obviously bullshit. Legacy media cried wolf every single day of the election against trump and it cried too many false alarms and asserted itself in weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't delegitimize a serious question as to why people are so much on board with Pissgate despite seriously flimsy evidence, and Pizzagate is written off every turn left and right and that's not discussed despite the real creep James alefantis stuff going totally unanswered.

       I fully agree with Pizzagate being discussed here, the claims that it's being suppressed by CTR here are laughable as there are daily posts about it on the front page. By all means, keep it up. All conspiracies deserve to be dug into. I just don't see how you can claim it's being written off when there are daily posts here about it on the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the same note, no source is infallible. Not even Wikileaks. The more I hear "100% VERIFIED" shouted as proof of anything they claim, the more I am reminded of how religion has propagated itself through the centuries claiming to have an infallible source. Be careful how high of a pedestal you put them on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Latest example? Wikileaks calling these memos "fake news" by saying it doesn't look like an intelligence report. Guess what? It isn't one. It's raw information gathered by former MI6 as opposition research. He simply decided based on the information that the IC deserved to take a look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks obviously has an agenda and they are pushing it. Not surprising they would be out playing damage control with these memos, the memos do not make them look very good.

       Okay pal, it's obvious where you are taking this. Comparing holding up a new source for having never released a false document, to compare to people worshiping a religion? The fuck out of here you doubtful swill. Take your CIA propaganda elsewhere. 
"Wikileaks has an agenda" obviously a shill if you're hanging out in conspiracy getting hundreds of up votes with that message.

       You seem to keep referring to him as a god emperor, over inflating people's opinions of him. In a world of so much abuse and propaganda and obvious corruption and collusion between government and media, some people decide to go against this establishment and actually report the things that cost them their lives and freedom. I respect that, and have a higher regard for someone like that than some ex spy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the report you keep referring to about Pissgate has disclaimers that state they don't stand behind the evidence. And don't you question at all when the main legacy media pushes a story? It's usually for the wrong reason, and the OPPOSITE of a conspiracy.

       Wikileaks does not have a 100% track record. They've doxxed the wrong people and shown themselves to basically be petulant and partisan. I don't believe that the things they leak are faked, but I do believe that they selectively leak and act in a manner designed to push a certain point of view. This should be clear to anybody who believes himself to be a skeptic

       Yes because they have incentive to tell us the truth in whether or not they were actively meddling in an American election. I'm a skeptic about this whole thing but of COURSE the Russians are going to deny it. They would deny it either way do their denial is worthless in deciding it's truth.

       One is the product of intelligence community working to maintain the status quo: Russian alienation, Saudi alignment, energy market stasis.  Their motives go all the way back to the rise of opec and Saudi wealth, the energy crisis, the floating of the dollar and end of the gold standard, and the resulting shift in financial power and industrial distribution, and then the demise of the middle class.

       The memos released are not the product of the IC, they didn't even come directly from MI6. They are the product of an Ex-MI6 investigator who was hired (by both Dems and the GOP) to do opposition research on Trump.

        Memos
       </a>
       now referred to as "Pissgate". The golden shower portion is a tiny fraction of what these memos allege, and IMO not even worth talking about. Most of it is Trump's collaboration with Russia over the years and their influence in getting him elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       For context, this is not a report from the intelligence community. This is opposition research against Trump done by a former MI-6 operative-turned-investigator, who was hired by both Dems and the GOP for his connections in Russia. The only real corroboration so far is by Paul Wood of the BBC, who says a former spy in an Eastern European intelligence agency has also told him about Russia having compromising information on Trump. The MI-6 spy in question has been outed since this release, and has gone to ground.
      </p>
      <p>

        Here
       </a>
       is a collection of links posted recently exploring Trump's connections with Russia. More cannon fodder if you are interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like Pizzagate, there is a wealth of this information to go through, and evidence is mostly unverifiable. The sources are more credible than people shouting fake would have you believe (and this now includes Wikileaks, sadly). The MI-6 spy who did this report (Christopher Steele) is the same guy who exposed the FIFA corruption.

       Interesting but just because sombody did something correct ones doesn't mean they did it again. Meaning that because he exposed FiFA does not mean that this information is True... There is so much shit flying around that it's hard at this point determine what is true or false. That's what makes it such a juicy Conspiracy !!! It's like if we where looking inside some crazy family house but the windows are fogged up. We can make out a few things  but we don't have the full picture. That's why we need whistleblowers to clean that foggy windows and get to see what the flying Fuck is going on in there.

       Actually I think this is the start of something bigger... It seems they are 2 different powers to be and they both have shit on it each other, it looks like they are both releasing stuff about each other as warnings of a "Nucl3ar 0ption" but it seems that mutual destruction is not good business.... What would be interesting is if a third party would instigate the powers to be and they would both reveal everything they have on each other.

       The fact that people are comparing a businessman getting pissed on by a prostitute in the privacy of a hotel room while hurting nobody and a possible peodophile ring that possibly goes to the top of the american government, possible child trafficking and child murder is a fucking joke and people need to get their shit in perspective.

       I'm all for hearing everyone's side and making my own mind up and I'm not a trump supporter but who really gives a fuck if he likes to be pissed on. Even if it's true who cares what a grown man does in private. Half the cunts jumping on this like they don't have their own weird kinks that they can enjoy in private.

       The problem with Pissgate is this: The golden shower portion of that document is basically a footnote, it is nothing. It doesn't even make up a single page in a 35 page document.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the document is what needs to be investigated and discussed. I much prefer the label "Siberian Candidate", because that actually speaks to the meat of what is contained within it.

       If there is more to it then definitely investigate. The people acting like Donald Trump is the savior of the American people need to get a grip and if there is something fishy going on then he needs to be held accountable just as much as Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither candidate was good and that's an understatement people need to stop this bullshit of trump supporters vs hillary supporters and come together because as an outsider the whole American system is rotten to the core. Everyone needs to stick together and tear this shit down and start fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are acting like they never heard the phrase divide and conquer. I think this is exactly what is happening the powers that be will always have half the population on their side with the current two party system that is in place over there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I fucking hate hillary and I really believe there is some weight to the pizzagate narrative I am also under no illusion that trump is no better. I wish that people could stop being at each others throats defending people and parties that don't really give a fuck about them and come together.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone in america came together and took to the streets I guarantee there would be change but they have it so there will always be a divide in the people and everyone is too busy defending a suspected pedophile or a reality tv star.

       Amen to that. I can't believe how quickly people have forgotten that Clinton/Trump are buddies. That both are connected to the Epstein plane. That the DNC cultivated both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are both establishment giants, but somehow the protest voters got convinced Trump is anti-establishment, an outsider. The scary thing, is that contained in those memos of Pissgate, is Russia planning exactly this. To convince "protest/sanders" voters that Trump was their candidate :(

       The main issue in the claim isn't the sex act. It's that Russia is allegedly using a video of it to blackmail Trump and control him in the White House. If true, you have Vladimir Putin in control of the US President for the next four to eight years, which, needless to say, would have disastrous consequence for both the US and the world at large.

       I'm open minded and I don't discredit one side because I blindly fall in line with the other. If that is the case then obviously something needs to be done. My problem is most people I have seen in threads on the subject have been so quick to discredit pizzagate but this comes up and they are all over it like it has been confirmed as fact.

       My other problem with this whole thing is that the media, hillary supporters and the obama administration are scare mongering on a foreign government having a say in american policies but seem to forget that hillary was in the pocket of the saudi's who are a foreign government and would have had some leverage on american policy  which is fact. Why does nobody give a fuck about that and why is she not held accountable for selling her country off to the highest bidder. I know a presidential candiate in someone's pocket is not quite the same as as one being blackmailed but at least the one being blackmailed is not willingly selling their country out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a problem with this coming out and I truly believe that people in power should have full transparency and be held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is supposedly the land of the free but has the highest rate of incarceration in the world and has also made prisons and incarceration a business where it's not the likes of hillary that's filling these jails but the average Joe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sound quite anti american but I am not, I am anti bullshit and I think that as an outsider I can't understand how supporters on both sides can follow these parties that do not give a fuck about any of them. Like I said in a different post people need to forget democrats/republicans and stick together and tear this whole shit down regardless of pizzagate or any other scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two party system ensures the powers that be always have at least half the population under their thumb regardless of who wins.
Look at obama and how he acts dropping the mic, telling jokes and acting like he does is just that. It's an act to pull the wool over peoples eyes while he fucks everyone bareback no lube, and while everyone is fawning over how cool he is for a president he is stripping the american public's right to privacy right under their noses. Not only that but is responsible for how many drone strikes in how any countries killing how many woman and children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look how many upvotes and how many threads were made for him and bidens stupid fucking bromance and how many upvotes that got and then compare that to how many threads and how many upvotes were givin to him stripping back the publics privacy even more right before he is out the door.

       First, let me say I don't believe in Pizzagate, Pissgate or the Siberian candidate as you cleverly call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main difference is that Pizzagate is based on verifiable yet extremely weak, really stretched out circumstancial evidence. Each of them could reinforce a case if there was something tangible to begin with, but on their own they mean nothing. It's like nonsense à la Kabbala, you can invent codes that will produce any text you want from any source material, and it will mean absolutely nothing, EXCEPT when you KNOW (and I mean know, not just that someone claims it) there is an encrypted message in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other two on the other hand have no evidence, circumstancial or otherwise. Those who push them claim they have but sorry, can't show them to you because reasons, but trust them, they wouldn't lie to you
       <em>
        this time,
       </em>
       would they?

       That is not true at all, perhaps you are confusing evidence with proof, but unfortunately neither Pizzagate nor Pissgate have anything close to proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence is a much wider category, even circumstantial applies. Hearsay is evidence. So to say that Pissgate has no evidence is flat out wrong, you can read the 35 page document for yourself thanks to Buzzfeed's idiotic release of it.

       The other had a person who was hired by someone to discredit his research subject.   He reported and passed on all these details BEFORE THE ELECTION.  There were so many obvious and glaring ERRORS that can be instantly dismissed like the countries he claimed people were in....

       I don't think it was Buzzfeeds choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ben Smith, editor at buzzfeed, has spent the past 3 years trying to build credibility for the Buzzfeed news department. He knew he was walking into a shitstain of a media property when he took the job and he worked hard to reverse the reputation of the company...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then NBC/Comcast started dumping money into BuzzFeed... $200 million in October of this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly this week, Smith is willing to throw away three years of work in order to publish unverified intel that has been circulating the industry for months without seeing publication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think BuzzFeed was a sacrifice play. NBC/Comcast wanted that document to be part of the public dialog, but didn't want it closely associated with their news team, so they published it using an outlet that allowed them some distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the entire media community can reference that document without being guilty of publishing unverified info. BuzzFeed takes the reputation hit for poor journalism and everyone else can talk about golden showers.

       The Pissgate thing looks like a 4chan joke, taken in my McCain, passed on to FBI and then leaked through the CIA to the news. That is just sick. I don't think it is true, but is that what has become of intelligence agencies? Trying to F an incoming president.

       The source behind the 35-page dossier is the same one that leaked the FIFA scandal. He's proven he's credible, unlike a bunch of morons from /pol/ who threw a bunch of straight up bullshit together and created a theory that I shit you not is crazier than the one from A Beautiful Mind, strings and paper clippings and everything.

       On one hand, a high-profile political figure in Clinton's inner circle was caught with a phishing scam, (post-server scandal) and their emails were collected. When people dug into them, they discovered pedophilia lingo, and an "internet investigation" ensued. What was discovered was fascinating at best, and incriminating at worst--incrimination of global-elite, pay-to-pay, child-sex-trafficking scandal. The response from the elite was to warn us that Russia could plant child porn on official computers.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side, Obama (not Trump) has wanted a pipeline through Syria for years, but Assad gave those rights to Russia. The CIA created, armed and funded ISIS to topple democratically elected Assad, but Russia stepped in to prevent that. We have been fighting a proxy war against Russia for years. Since losing the election, team ObamaClintonSoros have done everything in their power to ensure continuation of said conflict, and demonization of Russia. "bbbbbut Trump's gonna smash ISIS". Simply cutting their funding and letting Putin support a democratically elected president of the region would destroy ISIS without spending a single American taxpayer dollar--in fact, it would save us money. But it would cost (((some people))) money.
      </p>
      <p>
       "bbbbut Trump was in touch with Moscow after Obama expelled those diplomats".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not a conspiracy. That's deft foreign policy. Why do you want to poke the bear?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be a conspiracy theorist, fine. I am. But some things actually DO happen. Not everything is a lie. That is the state of the global chessboard at the minute. If Trump fucked a Russian hooker while in Moscow to discuss all this with Putin, and they have it on tape, I hope shes hot if I have to watch the tape when it leaks, but aside from marital infidelity, it doesn't change a whole lot.

       I think it's also telling that shitposts claiming "pissgate" has been debunked but pizzagate is totally real are upvoted immensely. THIS above all else is why I believe the Russians meddled, even if they didn't specifically hack the DNC... there clearly are plenty of shills pushing pro-Russian narratives on Reddit and elsewhere

       This is how propaganda works. When they don't want you to have the truth, they unleash the army of social engineers into our forums and fabricate scandals to distract you...bonus is when the name of said scandal can be related to or compared to or brings to mind the true issue and in that comparison blends the two together seamlessly in the subconscious. If you dismiss one, perhaps you will dismiss the other.

       piss gate was huge for about 24 hrs before it was debunked and no one credible believes in it. piss gate is a totally reasonable thing to believe. trump an unstable playboy billionaire pays hookers to piss on him; that certainly fits with his public mo. on the other hand there is a bit of a leap of faith to believe that the clinton campaign was a front for a massive worldwide pizza child rape conspiracy. while i will admit the circumstantial evidence is starting to pile up, starting, it is still a bit far fetched for the average person to buy into. on the other hand trump pissing on prostitutes would be about the 3rd most controversial thing he has done this week...

       The reason is that the information released to the public in the "pissgate" thing was reportedly produced by a named ex-MI6 source, and information about where it came into being exists. The claims are substantial, and even if most of it is incorrect, the implications are huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas if you take 100% of the pizzagate evidence as 100% correct, they still don't point at anything tangible. No victim, no criminal, no crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the name of the source for the Trump/Russia thing was released, I was convinced this was a 4chan spoof. I'm still not convinced that it isn't.

       I think you know the answer, because one was pushed by the media who hates Trump and the other wasn't because it does not involve Trump. However, you are right to compare the two because neither of them has any evidence to back them up.

       Pissgate is believable because the report was compiled by Christopher Steele, one of MI6's top Russia experts who has worked with the FBI before, was known as a trusted person by the CIA compiled the report using his personal contacts in Russia, which in-part motivated the FBI to open their own ongoing investigation into Trumps Russia connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Manafort has/had EXTENSIVE ties with Russia and Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump hired a fucking law firm that got a "russia law firm of the year" award.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump fucking asked Russia to hack Hillarys emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump appointed Rex Tillerson, a guy that has a russian friendship award, as sectary of state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been almost completely silent on Crimea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's top national security adviser and Russia's ambassador to the United States have been having frequent contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is complete consensus that Russia interfered and influenced our election in Trumps favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump himself admitted he and Putin have a relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate, on the other hand, is a bunch of extremely tangible links, some going back 20 fucking years, that a bunch of /pol/tars strung together to form a narrative that hundreds of people in some of the highest positions of our government (although oddly enough, only democrats) have been killing, kidnapping, and raping children for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Yeah, Pizzagate is crazy and stupid while Pissgate is actually believable.

       Boystown and Pizzagate are two completely separate issues.  If you have a single shred of evidence linking the two I'd love to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate was an elaborate hoax dreamed up by the sick minds of Trump's troll supporters to discredit solely the Democrats just in time for the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boystown actually happened, and people were arrested for it.

       Not really, its all interconnected. Pizzagate only became focused solely on alefantis according to the news. The posts on reddit before that tied many different things together. I personally dont like calling it pizzagate for this exact reason, because people associate it with the misrepresented news stories. I call international high level pedophillia, or human trafficking because thats what it really is. The podesta emails and comet ping pong are only part of a bigger picture

       Dude the research into this all started long before Trump. The Podesta emails are wbat brought that crowd in, but its a small piece of it all. Believe what you want but i defi,itely think this deserves a real investigation.... Sound to me like youre just partisan in the ither direction, dismissing everything immediately is as bad as believing everything immediately.

       So you're saying this is a partisan thing then?

       I've been aware of Boystown, Jonny Gosch, Jeff Gannon, the Cremation of Care and all of that stuff for years.

      <p>
       Pizzagate and Podesta is just is a transparent way for Alex Jones' supporters to tie together his very visible hypocrisies and pretend that he's being consistent, missing entirely the one thing that does tie his multiple personalities together: an unending, insatiable thirst for money, no matter how many lies he has to tell.

       I do not and have never watched Alex Jones. Ive read through much of the podesta emails and it is my opinion there is code used, at the very least its drugs, but given the sex trafficking code from the fbi people have taken that path which has lead to the discovery of his freaky art, spirit cooking, ties to Dennis Hastert, comet ping pong, one of the emaio contacts has a blog that livestreams children in a pool, etc.... There is enough to at least merit real investigation.

       My bad the pedophile symbols are from the fbi....thats beside the point, i dont pretend to know what it is code for, i just know when i read some of the emails it really sounds like code for something... For example drugs, if you wanted a gram bagged for 3 different people, you could say something like, id like a slice of pizza but sliced 3 times.... Something like that. I am not claiming to know i am only claiming its suspicious and given the ties to known pedophiles and human trafficking related organizations i can understand how that is the obvious route some people take.

       Nah youre just trying to not understand.... When there are multiple emails that read in a way that suggests pizza (among other words) might be used in place of another word i would like it to be investigated. Im not saying anyone can know for a fact what is being spoken about but clearly asking an entire office if theyd like to split 1 slice of pizza is kinda weird....at best its a bad joke, at worst we wont know until its investigated.

       Just fuck off dude. If you cant admit that consistent weird usage of the word pizza is at the least mildly peculiar then i dont care. Have a great day.

       So if i get a sheet pizza and send you an email saying i got  "1 slice of pizza and im wondering how to cut it" does that mean i wrote slice instead of sheet or does it mean we are both pedophiles communicating in satanic code? If i look at your post history and find grammar/spelling/structure errors does that mean your secretly communicating with isis sleeper cells?

       No but if you send weird pizza emails relativeley frequently asking to divide a single slice of pizza between an office of people and just generally weird references that dont quite  make sense if pizza is the actual subject at hand... And if you get emails updating you on the whereabouts of accused human traffickers, and youre personal friends with convicted pedophiles and invite them to jave an extended stay at your house.... Yea thats suspicious and if you were a possible future secretary of state helping a presidential candidate run....yea that should be looked into.

       I dont have them off the top of my head but they are part of the Podesta emails that basically proved Clinton "rigged" the primary against Sanders.... If you go to voat.co/v/pizzagate the best compilations of emails and other various connections/associations are in the stickied posts. Perhaps you could actually go and look into these matters for yourself before dismissing them and jumping to conclusions about what people believe. Heres the top one at the moment, im not sure if its one the lists ive seen before

       Look, you should go through these items yourself and form an opinion after. Some of these are more concerning than others, but all of these emails, connections, art work, etc...when taken together they seem pretty suggestive of the kind of things Podesta and co are interested in.... Can anyone know for sure until a real investigation occurs? No. Is strange taste in art necessarily bad? No.... But all of these mentioned coupled with everything else compiled is enough to raise suspiscions for me. If it isnt for you then i guess we must agree to disagree, but at least now you know that "pizzagate" is more than just one mistyped email being blown out of proportion by crazy people. The podesta emails are a part of research done by individuals that appears to tie into accusations of global pedophile circles. I wont explain everything for you because theres too much and some things might be more intriguing for you than they are to me... Like i said after going through it all, its enough for me to hope it gets looked into. If youd like to continue with your snarky assumption that anyone looking into this is a misinformed idiot then fine, i cant say i didnt try.

       Like i said. I scanned the entirety of the compiled emails, sources, etc and scanned them quickly to find a couple for you and i provided you with a large compilation and summary for you to go through yourself. Either you aren't trying to even consider this, you have terrible reading comprehension, or you're just a dick.

       You said the frequency of strange pizza related emails implied some sort of code. I asked for links to those emails. Despite the wall of text and links you provided ive seen only two. Link to all these emails and perhaps, together, we can crack this code.

       So, in other words, its just three pizza related emails. The pizza/handkerchief one, the three slice one and the how many slices/office one. Are you sure thats it because thats not many. It doesnt seem like enough to say the frequency an oddity of them implies a code. Are you sure there arent more? If there are could you please link them so i can investigate?

       So im wondering where are all these emails? Is it just the three or are you imagining things? Should be pretty easy to link to all these suspicious pizza related emails. So far ive seen three. Four if you count the pasta/dominos email but i dont see how that counts because it doesnt mention pizza. Where are the rest of the incriminating pizza related emails that you imply exist but refuse to share with me?

       So, there is just the three which makes you a liar. Thats a pretty stupid lie considering how easy it is to discover that there is only three pizza related emails. Add that to the fact that theres nothing strange about those emails and im beginning to think youre some kind of moron.

       Its intended to build the case for you to discern that international pedophile rings with high profile people exist. Then when you see some oddly worded emails from podesta, his taste in art, mention of spirit cooking and his friend Dennis Haster you can start to see how it could definitely be possible they are involved in the same circles.... Pizzagate is trying to build a case to get a real investigation.

       I'm not a trump-voter, please don't be abusive AND self-righteous. I voted straight Democrat except for Hillary because I live in California. People can disagree with you without being made mockery of or being your lifelong opponent, dipshit. Trump asked Russia to find her missing emails, not to hack a database. He never said the word hack. The only reason you'd think he meant to hack would be if Hillary had hidden emails inside a secret server ;D

       And I'm not a Hillary supporter or even a Democrat, and more so I dont know why you keep mentioning Hillarys crimes. She is a criminal, I agree with that 100%. But Trump is also, most likely it seems from his actions and the pissgate report, a criminal. You're right, I worded it incorrectly but surly you can admit it was incredibly suspicious for him to make such a statement, even in jest, with all the other evidence pointing to his campaign having heavy contact with Russia.

       What evidence would satisfy you more than him asking Russia to deliver Clinton's emails to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is asking Russia to provide information obtained by hacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he actually asking them to hack... not technically. He is just asking them to provide the results of the hack.

I don't care if he is less bad than Hillary, that doesn't make him GOOD, which is what I want from a president... hell I'd settle for less than awful, and Trump can't make it over a bar that low and he isn't even in office yet.

       I don't believe I have ever referred to Trump as evil. I don't give him that much credit. You have, twice, however.

       I think his treatment of people in section 8 housing is worse than racism, so I don't usually bother with that accusations either. Same with his methods of dealing with unwanted tenants in rent controlled apartments.

       First off... I haven't been screaming about that over and over... I just prefer the argument that Trump doesn't respect working class people over the argument that Trump is racist. I can give you more recent examples of that type of behavior, but then I have to source them, whereas if I mention those two incidents, you already know exactly what I am talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I want unity with people who find that behavior acceptable? If I'm at Jonestown, am I supposed to drink kool-aid I know is poisoned to keep people from being divided?

       From what I've seen on reddit the left is completely against any sort or unity because of how upset they still are that they lost the election. Maybe you'll try to be a decent human being once you calm down and realize the world isn't ending.

       You obviously don't know what an appeal to authority is. When a doctor tells you that you have an irregular heartbeat, do you accuse him of an appeal to authority? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only an appeal to authority when authority is cited outside the area of expertise. This does not apply to Steele. He is an expert at gathering intelligence.

       Because voting is a basic right in this country.

      <p>
       I'm mostly responding to the fact that you seem to believe that if people vote Democrat they are illegal, which is what your original post is implying. I'm assuming you live in a state like West Virginia, which probably explains why you think Democrats are boogeymen/illegals.

       No, its just that annoying rule of law thing I harp on where its ILLEGAL for non-citizens to vote in american elections.   There have been more than a few studies that have shown that at least 1.9 million illegal aliens voted, most likely because they honestly don't know it is even illegal to do so.  Besides why would you feel threatened by voter verification, unless you know that illegals are voting for democrats.   They could very well be voting republican and you certainly don't want that!

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because "“Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and "United Ossetia" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia should use its special forces within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.

       So it's okay to use that book to represent a nation's foreign policy and geopolitical goals 20 years after the fact but the likes of Operation Northwoods, the Gulf of Tonkin, the misuse of the atomic bombs, Iran-Contra, Iraqi death squads, puppet fascist dictators, School of the Americas-trained death squads, Operation Paperclip, MK-ULTRA, etc are inadmissible and not indicative of the US government's integrity? How many scandals and crimes does there need to be?

       Let's not pretend Russia is some alien malevolent force. They're right on some things and wrong on others, something you cannot disagree with being the same for America. I'm sure you can give an equally large list of Russian wrongdoing such as the statistically higher murders of journalists, but like I've said before, it's one thing to call a duck a duck but consider the pond we're all swimming in. It doesn't help to merely let it stagnate and manufacture propaganda (which was legalized recently in the NDAA, not that the propagandists themselves would've told you). You're doing nothing but feeding the military industrial complex's lust for power and profit when we should be advocating diplomacy, not endless accusations, posturing and threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily, there aren't too many people falling for this propaganda and trust in the propagandist mainstream media has hit a historical low.

       Look into Georgia and Ukraine in the first place and realize you're merely regurgitating propaganda. Both nations experienced US-backed coups and the new governments began aggression against the Crimeans, Abkhazians and South Ossetians to provoke Russia. These populations by a majority wanted to rejoin Russia. Russia sends troops to prevent further aggression against them. Russia didn't handle it perfectly, but I'd rather Crimea be in Putin's hands than those of neo-nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is super rich too. What is your opinion of her? It's one thing to call a duck a duck but consider the pond. Doesn't stop CIA sycophants here from regurgitating propaganda from TheInterpreterMag ran by two former oligarchs. Trump is backed by the mysterious Warren billionaires also, a web that never gets discussed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia uses dash cams due to how common traffic accidents are. There are many YouTube videos for you to peruse for an idea of this. Again, perhaps you should actually look into what you're trying to criticize instead of regurgitating corporate talking points.

       There was a case regarding Ukraine when RT's coverage seemed slanted in favor of Russia, and this was largely due to RT relying on the Russian military as sources. Naturally that's a rather biased source. Abby Martin criticized it deeply live on air, and there have been no similar incidents since.

        Trump's national security advisor and Russia's ambassador being in contact IS A GOOD THING. Kennedy being in close contact with Kruschev is the reason we are alive. This is just as "tangible" (I don't think you know what that means...) as the Pizzagate links

       You can imagine him doing both if it makes you feel better. But I honestly don't really care about your imagination and would like to just stick with facts instead.

       Meanwhile, in reality, Paul Manafort was forced to resign from running Trump's campaign over the $12.7 in the Ukranian ledgers from Putin's buddies and his employment and work with Viktor Yanukovych is both factual and documented.

       Except that someone on /pol/ claimed they passed a story to Rick Wilson in November, who passed it to the CIA.  We now know, from Steele and McCain, that that wasn't the path that the information took, and that it happened much earlier than that (since at least July the FBI had the info).

       The problem is that the pissgate part of it is a small piece.  It's literally one bulletpoint among 35 pages of information.  A trump supporter could have fabricated the golden showers so other trump supporters could dismiss the whole thing as ridiculous.

       Because it may actually BE true and no one wants to believe that. As well as, if it is true, it means that a presidential hopeful was being helped by a paedophile, as well as The President as well as Bill Clinton. It could be a house of cards.

       The transcript below, according to your source. There is no mention of "both declared the papers to be fake as hell and piss gate being pure bullshit."
      </p>
      <p>
       CHRIS MATTHEWS: Buzzfeed's editor-in-chief Ben Smith was on MSNBC earlier tonight on Meet the Press Daily. Here's how he defended his decision to release those documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       MATTHEWS: Andrew Sullivan, what do you make of that defense of putting out all this information, even if this gentleman didn't actually believe it was true?
      </p>
      <p>
       MATTHEWS: Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       MATTHEWS: Let me go to Hugh, because it seems to me that even if you deal in opinion journalism, which I do as well, you have to deal with a fact-based mentality. You have to say, “I'm never going to say something on the air I don't believe is true. At least from my perspective.” But to put out a barrel of stuff that's marked as “disinformation” for the public to sort of enjoy, for the enemies of that particular person, Trump, to giggle over and try to exploit, and enjoy generally and say, “This is my day,” is not—It’s certainly not journalism. I'm not sure what it is.

       To be perfectly honest, it just took less effort to believe in pissgate. Even trump's supporters think he's an ass. Pissing on prostitutes doesn't seem crazy. Pizzagate does sound crazy at first. Most people just don't get past "at first". Plus they were too busy being distracted by social issues and feels.

       If you have ever been on 4chan you don't even need to ask that question.   Its both a horrible and wonderful place.
Pissgate was just 4chan lulz, embraced foolishly by leftists hoping to nail trump.

       Pizzagate hasn't been debunked but is ignored because if it actually was investigated, so many wealthy and powerful people would go down.

       Because the oligarch Trump, whom many here worked to get elected is now in Charge of the sole superpower on the planet, and his party controls all sectors of government. That's not just an elite having power, it's now mostly unchecked power. It's more power than Obama had.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why people care about Trump performing a black magic rituals with hookers on a bed.

       I can't speak to "pissgate" because I don't know much about the facts or lack there of, but I can answer the second part. There is no evidence of pizzagate, zero. Weird pictures and spooky words don't equal proof of a pedophilia ring. They just don't.

       *Donald J. Trump ‏@realDonaldTrump  Jan 11
Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!

       Donald J. Trump ‏@realDonaldTrump  Jan 11
Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?*
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it odd that Trump treats US intelligence as liars, incompetent, the enemy etc., yet anything that "Russia says" is given as fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let the piss angle distract from the real issue, which is that Trump has connections to Russia and has given them compromising info and has promised to give Russia what they want politically.

       Maybe because PissGate is ALREADY DEBUNKED, and that thread was a hyper obvious hit job by r/politics, designed to give them cover for a massive 7000+ person brigade they conducted.

       Oh wait nm, I'm sure it's that this "conspiracy" which has no evidence, been debunked by dozens of news outlets (MSM is shit but when a dozen of them say the same thing, they probably aren't lying, imagine that) is just not something the mods want to hear about and removed it despite the mountains of zero evidence /s

       The MSM 100% uniformly denounced izza-pay gate. That's why you should immediately question it. Any time all of the MSM is 100% on point together that's only possible from intentional collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This nonsense about Trump has already been shown to have numerous factual errors. And the MSM had no uniform action with it. It had the extreme left DNC propagandists trying to push it and the leftist MSM sat back and realized it was too stupid to be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also next to nothing has been shown to be false regarding the really important topic of child abduction. The rabbit hole only goes deeper and deeper. Only the media keeps saying it's false. That's a gigantic difference. Regarding Trump, multiple factual errors of /pol LARPing have been publicly verified. Like that Cohen has never been to Prague and was home in America when he was supposed to be there with irrefutable proof he was in America.

       The mental gymnastics is mind boggling. Theres evidence for both and people have denounced both but youre only focusing on the part that fits youre narrative at the moment. Its ridiculous at what lengths youre willing to defend Trump, hes played you like a damn fool.

       Dear whomever: I am now 40, and went to that resturant location for years as a kid (It was then the Thai-Room). There are no underground tunnels, or other locations.  Don't care about pissgate, although it is much more believable that Trump hired prostitutes than it is that Clinton had time to run a sex trafficking ring. As for a child porn ring at that location, I seriously doubt it. (If for no other reason that there is no space there.)

       No I don't. I don't even follow or believe this shit I just saw that idiots comment about being a kid going there and can't fathom how that is proof of anything. The fact that you think some kid would be able to search 4k Sq ft and come to the conclusion that there's no possible secret basement or tunnels, especially when he wasn't looking for any tells me how terrible your critical thinking skills are. That and the fact that your only argument was the size of the building and name-calling.

       full disclosure: Trump supporter here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think to some extent, PissGate was just another thing for Trump's critics to poke fun at, regardless of whether it was true or not. If it's not this thing, then it would just be something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for those that are more inclined to believe in the claims, to them, it's justified as it seems to fit in with the circus act that they perceive in Trump. As such, and as ideological enemies, they don't need as much evidence, nor do they motivated as such, as that would be a challenge to their narrative.

       Agreed! Although Pizzagate is believed to be a VERY large conspiracy as to how many players are involved. This, at least to me, makes it a bit harder to believe. Persons can be clever and sneaky, people can be sloppy and stupid. Large conspiracies rely on everyone keeping the secret, and again, to me, makes it less possible and likely.

       Because PissGate contains things we know have actually happened.  What I mean by that is that the Kremlin is known for recording and blackmailing Diplomats and Businessmen.  Pizzagate requires you to literally believe governments and organizations ALL OVER THE PLANET are coordinating pedophilia between high ranking officials.

       One does not simply "believe" or "not believe" pizzagate.

       There are a lot of made up or misleading pieces of evidence in the pizzagate investigation, but there is also a lot of real evidence.

Anyone with half a brain and five minutes can pop open the dossier, search some numbers, and see that some of what's written there correlates with things that have actually happened. Note that the propagandists put emphasis on golden showering - that's nothing, and milder than shit Trump himself has bragged about - the money transfers are the key.

       How about reading some actual news, like BBC, who had a guy come out and say they had this before the election but couldn't day anything, but there is more incriminating Trump video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumpers may call it fake news. It's not. Fake news is blatantly, demonstrably false information being passed off as true. You guys call anything that disagrees with your personal, non-fact-based worldview fake news. It isn't. BBC might be left-leaning, but they never report lies. And since they're operates by the British government, there's no profit motive.

       People love to hate Trump  (with some good reason and some bandwagon).
      </p>
      <p>
       With pizzagate it followed so many "leaks" that people partially tuned out, partially became skeptical, etc. Also, it was NOT Trump so if you dislike Trump you must like Trump's opponent (some people think this way).
      </p>

       These are the first things that come to mind concerning public response to pizzagate.

       It's a believability issue.  Most people have no trouble believing that a billionaire who has been caught on tape saying some nasty things about women and who was the posterboy for the excesses of Manhattan in the 80s would hire hookers to do deplorable things.  The story involves three people doing something in one place at one time, and is the kind of thing they can believe happened.  Pizzagate, on the other hand, concerns a widespread conspiracy between many players over many years in many locations.  It takes more effort to imagine something like that really taking place.  Doesn't mean it isn't true.  It just sounds more outlandish.

       The difference is the amount of real evidence.  There is none in the piss scandal, but there's plenty of circumstantial evidence in pizzagate, a rather mind boggling amount.  Its like the pizzagate people feel they're so immune they are bragging about their achievements knowing nobody will do a thing to them.

       In the long run, sure. The question, though, was why so many people were willing to believe the Trump rumors so quickly.  The answer is easy - it was a believable story that could be conveyed and digested in less than a minute and that was discussed on a major media site.  Pizzagate, on the other hand, is a complicated story that relies upon an understanding of code words and a cast of players who are largely unknown to the general populous, with a few notable exceptions, and isn't being discussed by major media that anyone pays attention to.

       Human beings want to feel like they're the best. Feeling like you won an argument on the internet makes you feel like you're the best for a few minutes. Earlier this year a whole bunch of people read a whole bunch of Huffington Post articles that made them think it was smart to elect a geriatric Jew that would make tax payers pay off the 200K in loans they took out to pay for their degrees in feminist interpretive dance. When they failed to convince enough of people the who agree with a most of their political views to elect the geriatric Jew, the geriatric Jew told them to support the reptilian Queen who he'd been calling evil for the better part of a year. 95% of the old Jews supporters didn't really possess the ability to think critically so they supported the reptilian Queen. The Huffington Post writers, being in that 95%, wrote articles explaining that while the reptilian Queen was at one time evil, she was not as evil as the tube of bronzed custard, because although their political ideology is almost identical, the tube of bronzed custard doesn't pretend to be as nice to people as the reptilian Queen. When the bronzed custard eventually beat the reptilian Queen in the game everyone assumed to be rigged in her favor, the interpretive dancers didn't know what to do with themselves. The dancers looked far and wide for what went wrong "he's mean" "he's custard" "I still have to pay for this degree?" "He'll probably murder the same brown people she will but she pretends were important better". Being right is important to some people. Now that they have to deal with the fact that they were wrong the interpretive dancers, rather than critically analyze the broken nature of the system, or the fact that they aren't actually represented, they just found ways to justify how they were still right. The reason they found is Russia.

       They're both ridiculous.  "Three may keep a secret if two are dead."  Ben Franklin.  There's no group of people banging little kids and there's no group who has proof of Trump being a piss fan.  If there were, they'd of been a lot better off threatening to release the info when he was a private citizen and relatively out of the govt. eye.

       It's because pizzagate requires piecing many different parts together that involve many people over a long period of time. News is not set up for this, quite the opposite. They are not allowed to connect dots. Everything is taken as little quantized fact packets that ostensibly exist in isolation from each other but the underlying unspoken narrative is how the brainwashing is achieved.

       Look it's far easier to believe that one rich dude had a piss party with a bunch of hookers, than it is to believe that all of the worlds elite esp the president of the US is involved in child porn. One changes the world the other is just another rich spoiled brat.

       The
       <em>
        masses
       </em>
       don't believe Pissgate is fact.  Very few people do.
      </p>
      <p>
       They simply consider it believable (and believing in it and thinking it's believable is 2 different things).  And that it hasn't been debunked yet.  Almost nobody thinks it has been
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       - because it hasn't.

       I think the Hampstead scandal has more evidence than Pizzagate, although Pizza+inaudible is mentioned by the children when asked where they were molested:

       Because, Pissgate is against someone most of the media hate, the entire world of Clinton supporters and half the GOP hate. But Pizzagate is against someone the media loves, the Washington DC elite love, and many of the movers and shakers of the DNC are involved.

       These millineal kids have to simply because they know that Watergate was a scandal, They dont know what watergate is or why it was called that.
      </p>
      <p>
       source: My smoke shop guy, he's 22 and voted for trump because 'hillary is corrupt', when asked why he thinks that its because hillary has been involved in every political scandal since watergate. Yes you heard that right someone was able to graduate highschool and knows so little about american history that he was able to be convinced by 1 article that clinton was at fault for watergate

       It's probably because there is no proof that pizzagste is real. It sounds like the people who used the Intel reports to prove that Iraq had wmd's. I know the symbol has never been used for anything besides child sex trade. The police had never in recorded history let a criminal organization continue to operate after 1st becoming know. Everytime they find an organization that is selling drugs or other illegal activities they shut them down instead of building evidence to arrest more people. Let's not forget that local police, FBI, interpol, air other for police have arrested people for child pornography in the months leading upnto the story being madeup.

       Pissgate completely relies on heresay coming from a paid political hit job.  Its not a conspiracy - its propaganda.  Pizza gate is extrapolated from confirmed emails leaked from Wikileaks.  It may not be true but the pieces are real enough for conspiratorial conclusions to be drawn.

       What i really want to know is when did watersports become a conspiracy? I mean you could tell me any big politician is into it and like, yeah okay. People are into some stuff. I mean if Obama were into pegging or something then we could just go "oh ok" because kinks aren't conspiracies. This is like high school gossip, "Oh well I heard Stacey does butt stuff" and it's all just like. NOT what a conspiracy is. People accept it because this stuff is fairly common but also private enough that you'd never really hear about it.

       Pissgate is the name for the fact that the russians have a number of video tapes of trump in compromising situations involving trump and other men pissing on each other for sexual pleasure ( among other things, it should be noted that the report does not make a single mention of women ) This came to light from a 35 page report which was compiled by a British intelligence officer that was leaked to the media. The source of the report has been verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out that many intelligence agencies have similar reports compiled by their own agents, obama was briefed on this back in september as well as it being included in the intelligence briefings which trump has chosen to skip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only part of the report that has been debunked is that russia claims to not have such tapes, and trump got really angry and started calling CNN fake news ( CNN had a similar but different report that they chose not to publish any information from until they were able to investigate further. Someone else beat them to the scoop so they started reporting about what they had. )

       I am rare as I still have both Democrats and Republicans on my Facebook page.  ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that neither side gives much if any thought to the truth or falsity of any claims they make.  Instead, they mindlessly repost things that damage their enemies or succor their friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the reason PissGate has got more traction than PizzaGate is that it is far less extreme and thus more believable, absent any hard evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the story - that four years Trump paid two prostitutes to piss on a bed.  Suppose someone told you that your male friend X did exactly this - what would you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I'd be surprised - but not horrified.  Assuming he had otherwise been decent (i.e. not physically abusing the sex workers, etc), I'd laugh it off - it probably wouldn't affect our relationship at all.  I certainly wouldn't tell anyone!
      </p>
      <p>
       But the PizzaGate allegations - those are
       <em>
        nasty
       </em>
       .  If a friend told me they were involved in sexual traffic and murder of children, I
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be horrified.  I'd go to the cops in an instant, or if there were no way, I'd certainly cut them off forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claims of PizzaGate are so horrible that even sharing it with your friends is nasty.  This is why it had less traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and you can't underestimate the bias of the media too.

       Because your premise is utter bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump dossier actually has substantial support by independent reporting and corroborating intelligence officials. But assholes think it's been debunked because they're delusional and because their tribal allegiances overwhelm good sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is complete and utter nonsense and has been found so by every single independent professional journalist. It doesn't even pass a cursory bullshit test. Which, to believers, just means it's true because they're barking mad.

       Pizzagate is about as disturbing as it gets.  It's uncomfortable to talk about. People can't joke about it at the water cooler. It's. it a kinky sex claim. It's ritual abuse of children. The very people who are the most outraged about it are also the ones most disturbed by it.

       The primary source for one story is a former MI6 spy who is credited with uncovering FIFA corruption and who is known to have many credible intelligence contacts within Russia due to his prior work there.

       The primary source for the other is anonymous Internet trolls who post on pro-Trump message boards.

       Because most Americans don't take what trump says as gospel while the trumpetts treat trump like a infallible golden god. It's not politics it's the trump cult. When your cognitive dissidents is telling you that your just like trump while you eat instant Ramen you'll fall for people like trump

       No just a critical thinker who is waiting for more information on both. Sorry I find one more likely than the other. Doesn't mean one or either can conclusively be shown to be false at this point. But saying I'm being paid for my opinion because it doesn't fit your worldview is idiotic, and if anything undermines the point you're trying to prove.

       I honestly dont think mods are purposefully removing anti ptrump stuff. It's just that everything bad about him is on the surface. He isn't hiding the fact he's a racist.

         /r/conspiracy

        pursues it. I think the biggest difference is that there is actual evidence of massive global pedophilia rings. That isn't even a conspiracy theory, its a conspiracy fact. They exist. The idea that pedophiles would promote other pedophiles in office also makes a ton of sense, for blackmail and control purposes. So while there isn't a lot of "tangible evidence" regarding Pizzagate, pandora's box just keeps getting bigger and bigger the more people investigate it. Not to mention the ppl accused are acting super sketchy in rxn to it. 
Whereas Pissgate just doesn't really make any logical sense. Trump defended himself perfectly, he is a public figure, he knows he is being watched, he knows his behavior is constantly being scrutinized. Why would he travel to a foreign country and then let his guard down and hire prostitutes to piss on a bed that Obama had slept on? Ppl who say "Trump is a moron, he hates Obama, why wouldn't he do this?" Are missing the point here. This behavior literally doesn't accomplish anything. I'm not saying its impossible that Trump could be a pervert, he's said a lot of perverted, sexist and weird things. It's not a conspiracy that he is a womanizer, that's a wide open blatant fact. I'm just saying that by and large he is incredible pragmatic.

       There's no way this community upvoted that thread that fast. It was clearly manipulated. Plus the fact that reddit servers went down right before these threads were massively upvoted.

       Why is calling people a shill the first tactic people always go for?  Do you have such a low opinion of the critical thinking skills of people in this sub that you have to resort to calling people who disagree with you shills because you think that's actually convincing of an argument somehow?  Why not just go full Godwin and call them a Nazi if you're going to just sling around insults and personal attacks because you don't have anything of substance to add?

       The difference is the media never tried to substantiate Pizzagate. They did, however, try to collaborate Pissgate since it goes along with their narrative.

       Why are you all trying to make it about piss porn? They're talking about the AP story today. Sounds like you're just trying to bury the actual story by focusing on the sex stuff. It's about possible collusion with a foreign power and Trump camp saying first there was no contact and now that admitting there was a phone call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador the day Obama expelled those diplomats/spys and laid down new sanctions on their intelligence agencies.

       Pizzagate is a huge topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       One does not simply "believe" or "not believe" pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of made up or misleading pieces of evidence in the pizzagate investigation, but there is also a lot of real evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing that the pedophiles who have already been convicted (Epstein, Hastert, Weiner, etc) are not the only powerful people involved in that is not a stretch at all.

       Raw intel will always have errors, it was a different Michael Cohen. Now that you've debunked that, and you can ignore the pissing because I don't care about it, how about taking a stab at the rest? You still have ~34 pages to go.

       Look into Georgia and Ukraine in the first place and realize you're merely regurgitating propaganda. Both nations experienced US-backed coups and the new governments began aggression against the Crimeans, Abkhazians and South Ossetians to provoke Russia. These populations by a majority wanted to rejoin Russia. Russia sends troops to prevent further aggression against them. Russia didn't handle it perfectly, but I'd rather Crimea be in Putin's hands than those of neo-nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is super rich too. What is your opinion of her? It's one thing to call a duck a duck but consider the pond. Doesn't stop CIA sycophants here from regurgitating propaganda from TheInterpreterMag ran by two former oligarchs. Trump is backed by the mysterious Warren billionaires also, a web that never gets discussed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia uses dash cams due to how common traffic accidents are. There are many YouTube videos for you to peruse for an idea of this. Again, perhaps you should actually look into what you're trying to criticize instead of regurgitating corporate talking points.

       I think pizzagate is lunatic BUT it stands to reason that pedophilia networks also exists among the elite and not just middle class Belgians though, its not an all-or-nothing kind of thing

       Okay, if you consider every instance of a pedophilia ring to be pizzagate then there's a lot of evidence for pizzagate, because pedophilia exists. But then you can't claim that details about Podesta or a certain pizza place has anything to do with pizzagate. It's one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the material you posted, only the really long Reddit post is about worldwide pedophilia. I might skim over it later if I have time. But again I'd like to emphasize that it is not about pizzagate.

       I do not and have never watched Alex Jones. Ive read through much of the podesta emails and it is my opinion there is code used, at the very least its drugs, but given the sex trafficking code from the fbi people have taken that path which has lead to the discovery of his freaky art, spirit cooking, ties to Dennis Hastert, comet ping pong, one of the emaio contacts has a blog that livestreams children in a pool, etc.... There is enough to at least merit real investigation.

       I've stated many times that Putin is sketchy. But even the sketchiest motherfucker won't get charged for a crime with no evidence. I'd happily take some. The problem is there isn't any. That's why even the most ardent Trump haters are calling bullshit. That's why even fucking socialists opposed to all of the fascism Trump represents are calling bullshit.

       Nah youre just trying to not understand.... When there are multiple emails that read in a way that suggests pizza (among other words) might be used in place of another word i would like it to be investigated. Im not saying anyone can know for a fact what is being spoken about but clearly asking an entire office if theyd like to split 1 slice of pizza is kinda weird....at best its a bad joke, at worst we wont know until its investigated.

       Unfortunately, no. As long as I've been on Reddit, there hasn't been an American politics releated subreddit that wasn't eventually taken over by hard-leaning conservatives or liberals. Considering how hard it is to just
       <em>
        find
       </em>
       unbiased news, it's almost impossible to keep control over a subreddit that doesn't eventually get flooded with a majority leaning one way or the other.
