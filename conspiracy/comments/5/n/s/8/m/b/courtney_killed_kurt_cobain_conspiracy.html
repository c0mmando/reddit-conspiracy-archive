       It seems pretty reasonable tbh after watching Soaked in Bleach. The way she talked about it.The one to discover his body wasn't her but an electrician. Seems quite odd that he bought a shotgun and she basically knew he was gonna kill himself and told nobody. Also the whole he was thinking of divorcing her was a good motive. Plus listening to her at times she seems insane enough to do

       the note is very suspicious and the positioning of the gun and the dosage of heroin. Good documentary if you like Nirvana or Kurt.

       She did it. The book by the private investigator she hired is pretty definitive. He went in to it thinking it was suspicious and when he realized he was being hired to find the body but didn't he completely turned on her and became her worst nightmare.  His case is airtight.

       You see, they always give us (at least) two stories. One is the mainstream story. And for people who don't buy that story, they always provide you with (at least) one other 'conspiracy' story, which is just as bogus as the mainstream on. But because it's a conspiracy and seems to have legs, people buy into it as it doesn't seem official in anyway. It's a good strategy for keeping us in the dark.

       Who knows? Fact is, if he cut his hair short and dyed it dark brown, most people wouldn't recognize him if they were in line behind him at the supermarket. It's very easy to hide in plain sight, though for all we know he could be living in a villa in some remote part of the world.

       Well my uncle was the assistant to the coroner on his death, and he told me and my best friend and my best friend's girlfriend over dinner one night in the most matter-of-fact way you can possibly imagine that your cousin is into necrophilia and took advantage of Kurt Cobain. He said afterwards the morgue smelled like teen spirit in the worst way.

       One thing I've had such an issue grasping is how much evidence can be on one person and still...  no prosecution. Similar to the John Bennett and Madeline McCain case. We all fucking know but why do civilians have to be the only bastards that care.

       Don't worry bout ranting I have a passion for it as well. Like I've previously stated Kurt's one of my fav famous people. If Courtney did it I want her in prison. I already hated her in general but now I dislike her more. I feel sorry for his daughter tho she got drug into this for no reason

       Not only did Courtney Love kill him, she was CIA. Before she hooked up with Kurt, she ruined the Pogues by Yoko'ing Shane McGowan, and it's generally considered to have been at the direction of the CIA.

       I'm going to watch this now. Does anyone have any counter arguments as to why she didn't do it? Documentaries often are incredibly biased so if anyone has any stuff corroborating the official story I'd like to hear it so I can More fully decide myself.

       its fake as hell. he absolutely committed suicide. people who believe she murdered him don't want to believe that so they grasp at straws to cling to anything that says otherwise. the creator of that documentary exploits the fans to line his own wallet. don't support him.

       Courtney seemed to Kurt's handler. I think it goes deeper then just Courtney, people would have lost boat loads of cash if he stopped making music he was worth more dead then. One thing I find suspicious is Courtney lawyer knew about the writings then did a reversal. Tom has it all on tape. I believe more people were in on it.
