       Either way, if the story maintains itself, we are at war for the credibility of this sub. If it comes out as fake news, we will be the ones that look like fools. Stay vigilant. Remember OUR subreddit is based on skepticism and questioning every narrative that is presented.

       Part of having an open mind is neither accepting nor denying any information, but rather working off of clues and information until they lead to an answer. Pizzagate has not been answered and neither has this Buzzfeed shit been either. It's actually very simple.

       It's pretty thoroughly fucked the exact moment it hit the wire. All public will see this as garbage pretty quick. Imagine it... Those still believing the rags wind up on the fringe, just as swiftly as we tin foils left it. Funny swap, it may happen yet

       I actually gave them the benefit of  the doubt that there was about to be some video released or that the CIA had  the video but now I think that this is most likely bullshit. I was hoping for everyone to start airing out everyone's dirty laundry. Doesn't look like that is going to happen.

       im still on the fence with him, im a canadian so i dont have that much skin in the game so to speak. im starting to look more closely at his picks now, some are a bit concerning but i need to dig a bit more in to them (actually just finished making the research list lmao)
      </p>
      <p>
       noticing he hasnt named picks for Agri or Vet affairs, so far part of me is hoping Gabbard gets picked up for the Vets, i dont support the wars but i feel like she would be a great pick to address the massive problems facing the VA and maybe that would bleed over in to our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       back to the tapes i mean, if it was true, is it really so shocking that Putin could black mail him with it? i mean ffs my position is, could he be that petty? well maybe its not a huge stretch but really is that a huge deal when you have Clinton robbing haiti blind in the wake of an earth quake? or her effort to sand bag an actual progressive from picking up the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       i like to think im a pragmatist/realist and he's comparatively (b/w two shitty shitty choices) the least bad.

       You know I voted for Trump and kinda even like the guy now. And I was, if not hoping this was true exactly, I was ok with it being true. Anything that dismantles any part of the machine is good news to me. But this story is embarrassing in its utter lack of substance.

       I don't think we need to worry about the credibility of r/conspiracy. If anything, the whole point of indulging in conspiracies is to keep shooting until something sticks and turns out to be correct. This isn't r/serious_investigations_in_public_matters

       I don't even know what a video of Trump watching hookers piss on a bed would do.  Didn't he walk away from a video of himself bragging about sexual assault?

       You know I voted for Trump and kinda even like the guy now. And I was, if not hoping this was true exactly, I was ok with it being true. Anything that dismantles any part of the machine is good news to me. But this story is embarrassing in its utter lack of substance.

       I'll keep watching though. I like surprises.
