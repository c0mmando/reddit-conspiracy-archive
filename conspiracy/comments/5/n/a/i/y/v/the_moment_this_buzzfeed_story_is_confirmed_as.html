    <div class="md"><p>im still on the fence with him, im a canadian so i dont have that much skin in the game so to speak. im starting to look more closely at his picks now, some are a bit concerning but i need to dig a bit more in to them (actually just finished making the research list lmao) </p>

<p>noticing he hasnt named picks for Agri or Vet affairs, so far part of me is hoping Gabbard gets picked up for the Vets, i dont support the wars but i feel like she would be a great pick to address the massive problems facing the VA and maybe that would bleed over in to our own.</p>

<p>back to the tapes i mean, if it was true, is it really so shocking that Putin could black mail him with it? i mean ffs my position is, could he be that petty? well maybe its not a huge stretch but really is that a huge deal when you have Clinton robbing haiti blind in the wake of an earth quake? or her effort to sand bag an actual progressive from picking up the nomination.</p>

<p>i like to think im a pragmatist/realist and he&#39;s comparatively (b/w two shitty shitty choices) the least bad.</p>
