<p>I don&#39;t find it notable that there&#39;s more interest and investigation into one of the most opaque political figures in recent American history now that he&#39;s won the election. Another driving factor is Trump&#39;s ongoing disdain for the intelligence community. </p>

<p>As far as the intelligence community, may I remind you what sub you are in.</p>

<p>The CIA is 100% confirmed to be running drugs. Planes deregistered with the FAA have crashed with TONS of cocaine. Planes known to have previously participated in extraordinary renditions.</p>

<p>The CIA is 100% confirmed to be participating in illegal arms deals. Here is an example of one who was caught by private intelligence, but then ignored because he was CIA...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy smokes. The Russian relationship is a distraction and doesn&#39;t exist. Don&#39;t you think it would have been substantiated by now? The Russians didn&#39;t hack Podesta, his password was Runner4567. Trump was in Florida for Xmas 2010, not in Moscow, so the latest Buzzfeed report (never mind the chicken &quot;tendies&quot; an r/the_donald joke in the report) which means that a lot of straight up fake news is being peddled and you are gullible enough to fall for it.</p>

<p>No, I am just saying I have a lot of names of government employees involved in questionable activities and shilling is not what I am investigating. I continue to tie convicted pedophiles to the social circle surrounding Podesta and James Alefantis. Uncovering shills just seems to be a logical consequence.</p>

<p>The Russian relationship is a distraction and doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of President-elect Donald Trump, reportedly met in private with diplomats, politicians and businessmen in Paris before the election, to discuss the civil war in Syria and how to cooperate with Russia.</p>

<p>Some 30 people were said to have attended the event at Ritz Paris, hosted by Centre of Political and Foreign Affairs founder Fabien Baussart and his Syrian-born wife, Randa Kassis, on 11 October.</p>

<p>For the rest, forgive me but I&#39;m not seeing this big picture.  I see a lot of strands but I don&#39;t see how they tie together.  What&#39;s the particular significance of these people and these companies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, none of your articles suggest illegal activity, whereas Uranium One proves the illegal financial relationship between Hillary and the Kremlin, itself.</p>

<p>Also, conflating the two, since Hillary was Secretary of State and her people are required to register as Foreign Agents if they are taking foreign money, while Donald Trump is not even a politician in 2008, is grasping at straws.</p>

<p>Meaning, according to the law, it isn&#39;t treason for DOnald Trump, but is treason for Hillary, Podesta, etc who are interfering in policy on behalf of foreign governments.</p>

<p>The big picture that you are not seeing is how the CIA has inserted itself into the media to spread fake news against a person that is not a CIA sponsored candidate.</p>

<p>Merely by having the names of agents, then running those names against news articles, you begin to see the big picture that the CIA runs the media a la Operation Mockingbird and that operation has only become more sophisticated.</p>

<p>Combine that with their trafficking problem and you have organized crime that is using the media to legitimize itself and you are falling for it, repeatedly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I know a lot of the financial relationships that the Clinton Foundation maintains because of the leaks.</p>

<p>There is no such primary source information for Trump&#39;s dealings.</p>

<p>It is that simple.</p>

<p>The media lies. The leaks prove it.</p>

<p>Until they give us primary source evidence, there is no reason to believe them because they are a propaganda machine designed to tear down any non-CIA candidate.</p>

<p>Ignore what information may or may not be traded and just look at the financial relationships between all of these entities.</p>

<p>The web of slime that is revealed needs no context to simply see how these people are tied together based on money, alone.</p>

<p>Trump is not tied to these people, nor is he tied directly to Sberbank, like Hillary is.</p>

<p>It just isn&#39;t the same.</p>

<p>Now, if you start to add context, like deregistered CIA planes crashing with 3 tons of cocaine, gun runners out of El Paso tied to J &amp; T Packing, who has the same board of directors as the Clinton Foundation, and Operation Mockingbird... then you are looking at a criminal enterprise. A massive one.</p>

<p>Can you tie Trump to that criminal enterprise?</p>

<p>Your agenda is showing.</p>

<p>I don&#39; have to prove it to anyone. It is there for everyone to see.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what Troika Dialog is, then you are way out of your element. You are attempting to discuss things you have no knowledge of.</p>

<p>Uranium One is proof of treason. Even the NYT reported in detail on it before the leaks, which revealed further treason with primary source information.</p>

<p>Gun runner for the CIA was outed in Global Intelligence file leaks, where he is running guns out of a county owned by the CIA who was receiving AK 47 silencers with no serial numbers... they were shipped as &quot;small engine mufflers.&quot; J&amp;T Packing, also known as JIT Packing, opearting out of an empty lot since 1994 ships, you guessed it, automotive parts.</p>

<p>Do you really think the entire board of directors of the Clinton Foundation is really shipping automotive parts out of an empty lot?</p>

<p>Again, you are out of your element. You have done no research and you are operating on the feeling that you just don&#39;t like Trump.</p>

<p>I mean, go for it.</p>

<p>I track all of my research and slowly make it public. FBI Agents. CIA Agents. DHS Agents. The news articles that tie them together...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I have been tracking a lot of conspiracies surrounding the trafficking of people, weapons and drugs. Inevitably, you run into known CIA operatives, at the top.</p>

<p>At no point, in the collection of thousands of news articles, primary sources, contact lists has Trump or his family appeared to be connected.</p>

<p>The &#39;best&#39; there is probably would be considered Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s black book. However, Virginia Roberts was able to describe Epstein&#39;s &quot;egg shaped&quot; penis, but had zero intimate details on Trump in her legal pleading.</p>

<p>Now, I have tied plenty of Republicans to these shenanigans, and the whole political system is riddled with convicted pedophiles, known pedophiles who have not been convicted, and probable pedophiles that post questionable stuff on the Internet.</p>

<p>I was anti-Bush as much as I was anti-Hillary because I am anti-corruption, regardless of political party. Of course, the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund makes it pretty clear that there is a financial relationship between the two cartels. It isn&#39;t the only link, but it is the most obvious one. Their overlapping DoJ personnel is the real eye-opener.</p>

<p>So, if someone can provide me a link, that is great. But, one link isn&#39;t usually enough. As I have traced more and more, it is clear that multiple links exist between a lot of these corrupt entities.</p>

<p>James Alefantis, for example, isn&#39;t just tied to Hillary and Obama. He is tied to convicted child trafficker, Laura Silsby through Maccoby, he is tied to the NCMEC through Jeff Koons, known pornographer, his family is writing letters to get leniency for serial child molestor Christopher Kloman. Lobbyist Richard Harding lives next door to Comet Ping Pong and was noted as having some of the worst images seen &quot;in years&quot; by veteran police officers.</p>

<p>The list for Alefantis, in particular, goes on and on.</p>

<p>I use him as an example of the number and type of links I would hope to see if someone was claiming Trump was in the middle of a large criminal conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is how it made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> to begin with.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and post something I left on another thread:</p>

<p>This exact same article, to the exact same source, was posted 1 hour prior to this one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5n8lq2/read_new_trumprussia_intel_report_here_deep_ties/">HERE</a>. It received a couple dozen votes, with only about 60% being upvotes.</p>

<p>The exact same link was somehow allowed to be linked again in the same sub with a new title (which in itself is baffling, since any time I&#39;ve ever attempted to do that on Reddit, I would be re-directed to the previous thread with that link). Except the second time around, the link received well over 2000 points in 2 hours time in a sub that usually has 1500-2500 users online. It continued to grow by hundreds of votes <strong>per minute</strong> until it reached over 13k, the all time high for this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, every time you guys complain about vote manipulation it&#39;s always because of a misunderstanding about how reddit actually functions.</p>

<p>First off, reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_how_is_a_submission.27s_score_determined.3F">fuzzes</a> votes. The amount of upvotes and downvotes you see on a post aren&#39;t correct, they only properly reflect the ratio of votes. The algorithm was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5gvd6b/scores_on_posts_are_about_to_start_going_up/">changed recently</a> to lessen the mpact of fuzzing, and now popular posts hit a ton more votes.</p>

<p>Which bring me to my second point; the post you&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t even <em>close</em> to the top of all time on r/conspiracy. Did you even think to, I don&#39;t know, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/top/">go and look</a>?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s attempt to use some critical thinking here:</p>

<p>A major news story broke. The news story is a popular subject for discussion on reddit. It has reached the front-page of reddit from many different subs. This sub posted the same story. It was also upvoted.</p>

<p>There is no conspiracy.</p>

<p>You do realize that many reditors sort r/all TOP &gt; HOUR, right? This exposes this sub to all reditors, if they see a story they like they will upvote it.</p>

<p>The reason it is so much higher than anything else in this sub is because nobody gives two shits about anything else posted in this sub.</p>

<p>You lack anything close to the ability of critical thinking if you can&#39;t figure out why a popular subject on reddit gets upvoted. Seriously, I&#39;m hoping for the sake of this subs users that this is just some form of trolling or satire on your part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ve been reading vastly different versions of this sub, my friend.</p>

<p>This sub has gone full trumptards - but that just goes to show that if you feed into someone&#39;s agenda or bias, it&#39;s easy to sway even the most stalwart doubters of the system.</p>

<p>For some reason, the many here who support Trump believes that he magically beat the odds of a rigged system, and isn&#39;t a part of it himself. I mean come on. You&#39;ve got to be more than naïve to believe that&#39;s the case.</p>

<p>And if you point out this dissonance, these people go full retard and scream shill at you, trying to deafen you out. It seems eerily similar to the SJW&#39;s/libtards screaming racism and rape.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming that any of the alligations against Trump are valid - I just pointing out that this sub has it&#39;s fair share of now wilfully blind posters.</p>

<p>Evidence that Trump is a part of the rigged system?</p>

<p>Evidence that the system is rigged?</p>

<p>I&#39;m urging people to not have a cognitive dissonance, when first subscribing to the theory that the system is rigged - and then turn around and believe that Trump isn&#39;t a part of that system, yet he won the election.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an urge to remain critical and never give up your skepticism - nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t <em>really</em> aimed at you, as I said legitimizing <strong>their own</strong> propaganda. But now that you mention it, even though you prpbably don&#39;t realize it, you are parroting their false premise of <em>fake vs. &quot;real&quot;</em> news. We already know the majority of MSM is disinfo, distraction, and many times straight up fabrication. </p>

<p>This creates a false dichotomy. One where they can claim legitimacy over others. And even get Obama to say the same thing. </p>

<p>&quot;Trust us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are the real news.&quot;</p>
