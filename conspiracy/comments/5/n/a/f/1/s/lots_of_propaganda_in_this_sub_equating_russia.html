       That seems to be the latest anti-Trump propaganda talking point - i.e. tying Trump with Russia under the assumption that if you’re associated with Russia, that automatically makes you a
       <em>
        baaad
       </em>
       person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wat?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve lived in the U.S. and U.S. territories all my life, but last time I checked, most things that I heard coming out of Putin’s mouth were actually things I
       <em>
        agreed
       </em>
       with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this whole attempt that
       <em>
        whoever
       </em>
       has been trying to make at vilifying Trump (shills, CTR, etc) by trying to associate him with Russia…doesn’t really seem to work if you really think about it critically.  Hell,
       <em>
        WE
       </em>
       - the United States - have been the ogre bullies of the planet for quite a
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can’t, of course, turn around and think “Russia can do no harm”.  Of course not.  However, it really seems to me that a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of the propaganda invading not only this sub, but the MSM in general in the U.S. is all “blaaahhhh!  anti Russia!!!” spam it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if people just realize that Russia is absolutely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       some evil ogre and not the “bad guy” here and keep their eys
       <em>
        wide open
       </em>
       for any false flag attacks being blamed on Russia, then a lot of this anti-Russia propaganda that many have been trying to scare U.S. citizens with and that people have been trying to put on Trump will...simply fall flat and go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are my thoughts on it anyway.

       Agreed, but honestly im a little past changing minds now, at least ones i can't look in the eye. Anons around the globe aren't my scope. The ones around me are, and they mine. You work together or you don't work. This is a humanistic uprising and most folks still chatter away on the keyboard, if they looked up, they'd see the true calling. Info is paramount, but just a paperweight without someone to throw it.

       Ha.  Yeah.  Me too.  I research and critically look into as much as I can, but there are so many shills, and it’s so difficult to tell who’s who, that often whenever I come across someone that challenges something I say in a manner that seems like they’re just trying to be a blind naysayer, I just as soon shrug my shoulders and not even worry about trying to convince them of anything.  “Fuck’em” is more my response to those types.

       Yeah, as an American, I've never really bought into the whole "Russia=evil" narrative. I've always thought of Putin as a very capable leader. And honestly, I've noticed a trend. American elite have essentially just made Russia their "boogeyman". Something goes wrong, we blame it on Russia. Russia has also become a mirror of sorts. Anything our leaders accuse Russia of doing, you can be sure they're the ones who are doing it, not Russia.

       Think the hate Russian thing is about rich people wanting to make money like they did in Iraq. So they are doing a Saddam thing on Putin and get they're hands on Russian resources like oil in the caspian sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin was put in by President Clinton because they thought he was mediocre corrupt middle ranking ex KGB operative who would not be able to last without U.S. support. To U.S. surprise Putin has done well and stands by on his own. In  past year Putin gave them the finger to these carpet baggers plans for Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now Putin's Saddam reincarnated. More war, working and middle class have their kids lives destroyed or ended fighting this war, CIA bureaucrats get more powers, promotions, and medals and set up private contracting companies, and the rich make more money.

       The whole thing about the Clinton helping Putin into power is indirect at the moment. I have no direct evidence that Clinton/CIA had any involvement with Putin directly. If there is evidence, then neither side will want it out and doubtful it will come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a fact the U.S. helped Yeltsin win the 1996 elections when it looked like the communists were going to win. Communists winning displeased the bankers who wanted to make a buck or two out of theft of Russian assets and thus Bill Clinton interfered and supported Yeltsin. So the U.S. convertly supported the corrupt, incompetent, and ill Yeltsin who won the election, and the oligarchs along with wealthy U.S. investors where allowed to rob Russia blind.

      <p>
       Heaps of articles about U.S. involvement in 1996 Russian election on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Putin rode Yeltsin coattails into power becoming prime minister then acting president in 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ergo what I meant when I said Clinton put Putin in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt allegations will emerge in later years that Cinton/CIA did have direct influence upon Putin gaining power. The wealthy and rich love corrupt dictators, psychopaths who kill common folk when they try to get back what has been stolen from them (especially psychopaths who must rely on U.S. support to maintain power and are therefore obedient to the wealthy American demands). Thus U.S. support of Pinochet, Noriega, Saddam, Doc Cheviliar etc. rather then supporting democracy where questions can be asked. Putin fits this mold perfectly.

       I also think it is possible the US could have also thought like the Russian oligarchs that Putin was an extension of Yeltsin and their plaything.

       Thanks for the explanation regarding your thoughts on why you think Clinton indirectly helped Putin come to power, but doesn’t it seem to be the case that as of late, Putin has not to
       <em>
        any

       extent been playing the role of anybody’s “good US-controlled foreign puppet”?  I mean he’s been extremely critical of the U.S., and even though I know that many U.S.-controlled puppets have also been critical of the U.S., Putin’s actually been making the U.S. look pretty fucking stupid publicly and hasn’t been hiding it much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those don’t seem too much like the actions of someone who’s a U.S.-controlled puppet to me - and if he is…he seems to be a puppet that’s gotten quite out of the control of his handlers…which I think is a good thing since the U.S. and it's

       I agree. If Putin was a U.S. controlled they have lost control. Reason for the anti-Russian propaganda campaign has started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like they lost control of Saddam. When Saddam fought a proxy war on behalf of the U.S. against Iran he was OK. When he defied US and invaded Kuwait the propaganda began to cast him as the butcher he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       If U.S. i s able to remove Putin without wiping out a nuclear exchange, and given the precedent in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan with the U.S. penchant for dealing with warlords (in Iraq they seem to have a 1000 Sadams running around as one Iraqi was reported ascsaying) rather then a leader of a state, I hate to think what the psychopaths they'll have lined up to rule the the various regions of Russia after they've killed Putin.

       I'm not so super sure they can just go in and do with Russia whatever they think they can, however.  A) There's a lot of "Fuck you, USA" sentiment
       <em>
        right here in the USA

       not only from civilians, but in the military as well.  Additionally, B) Russia ain't no push over.  At all.

       Also if we try to go in and fuck with Russia, it's not just Russia we're fucking with.  It's Russia

       China.

       Just a matter of divide and conquer. Its how western nations ruled China 1919 - 1946 by creating warlords who competed against each other for western patronage - something the neoconservatives have recreated in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Syria and will go on creating.

       Okay.  And?  No one's saying Russia and the U.S. are or should be "BFFs".  That's a far cry from what absolutely appears to be the unnecessary vilification that's been going on as of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       The motivation appears to stem from TPTB simply attempting to always have some sort of enemy to scare the people with and have some reason to continue taxing them/us and fund the "world-domination machine" - not for any real, legitimate reason.

       Ha. Are you kidding? The overall drumbeat of this subreddit has been pro-Putin and pro-Russian since before the beginning of 2016 election. Throughout the Obama years it was refreshing to see strong critical points of view expressed on RT, who hired some people I respect. However it only took me looking a little behind the surface to see that channel's true nature as an organ of the Russian State. From the '08 Georgian war to Crimea to Eastern Ukraine, the narrative pushed by Russian media has been out of line with realities on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, Russian obviously isn't inherently evil. Its just they are a nation marked by cultural and civic immaturity. Their own nature and harrowing history has disposed them to embrace strong autocratic rulers an view civil society and democratic engagement with skepticism and derision. Speak with anyone in Russia engaged in arts, literature, opposition politics, or social activism and they'll tell you: the regressive, anti-intellectual, plutocratic, and jingoistic tribalism at the heart of Russia's political life is dumbfounding. Think Trump's heartland circlejerk rallies if they happened in an echo chamber already controlled by his inner circle.

       Wow.  I’m no pro-Russia type, but you need some serious balance.  Badly.  I don’t know if you’re from the U.S. or not, but America doesn’t compare too favorably to almost anyone - Russia included.

       So then if this is true, Russia’s suppression seems to be all out in the open.  The U.S.’ is quite a bit more seeped in, culturally ingrained, complicatedly meshed with the bells, whistles, and superficial trinkets offered by this society,  and much more difficult to get rid of as a result.

       The whole thing about the Clinton helping Putin into power is indirect at the moment. I have no direct evidence that Clinton/CIA had any involvement with Putin directly. If there is evidence, then neither side will want it out and doubtful it will come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a fact the U.S. helped Yeltsin win the 1996 elections when it looked like the communists were going to win. Communists winning displeased the bankers who wanted to make a buck or two out of theft of Russian assets and thus Bill Clinton interfered and supported Yeltsin. So the U.S. convertly supported the corrupt, incompetent, and ill Yeltsin who won the election, and the oligarchs along with wealthy U.S. investors where allowed to rob Russia blind.

       Now Putin rode Yeltsin coattails into power becoming prime minister then acting president in 1999.
