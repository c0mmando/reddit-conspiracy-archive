        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>911 was a cheap magic trick. Only bad magicians use CG. The Israelis planted real explosives in the WTC but used CG to make it appear &quot;hijacked planes&quot; flew into them. Want proof?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, all three major theories are all plausible, yet none of them fully explain what we &quot;saw&quot; on that day. Nano thermite explains the charges, thermo nuclear explains the dustification, and DEWS explain why metallic cars were affected but not other things near their surroundings including organics, such as paper. Also, Thermite does not explain the Molten core which lasted months after the attacks. </p>

<p>Too much bias in this OP, hope people read my comment and understand what I&#39;m saying. Whatever was used that day, was a combination of many technologies, such we will never truly know, imo...</p>

<p>Also, it wasn&#39;t just Israel, they were a part of it, but you need US insiders, and others as well. Sounds to me like a Jesuit hit, for Rome and the security of the Holy Lands...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear explanation explains the cars. It&#39;s the same explanation for why the spaceX rocket exploded. You see the same cars exploding pattern in Tianjin, which was nuke.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/08/25/confirmation-tianjin-was-nuked/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/08/25/confirmation-tianjin-was-nuked/</a></p>

<p>Super Nano thermite has never been manufactured in large quantities. It requires 0 g to be manufactured.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of evidence for DEWs which can cause pain in a target (used for torture). However DEWs which cause destruction such as the one used in Gaza produce a large beam of light and sparks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/08/11/israel-unleashes-death-ray-on-gaza/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/08/11/israel-unleashes-death-ray-on-gaza/</a></p>

<p>Most of the evidence points to Israel and nuclear demolition. There is evidence however of many other intelligence agencies being involved, including</p>

<ul>
<li>traitors in NORAD, FBI and CIA necessary to keep a lid on the real attack method
-traitors in media showing fake footage
-Russians (missile that impacted Pentagon is Russian Granit missile according to 911 insider Dimitri Khalezov)
-French intelligence (allegation by Dimitri Khalezov, note the countries which had zero casualties in 911: Israel and France. Why? To involve inquiries in their respective countries which might reveal evidence)
-Saudi Arabia</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you for the most part, I just think your pinning on Israel is misguided. It goes deeper in my opinion. We all know Khazars are fake crypto-Jews. Some know, those same people have worked with Rome for a very long time. IMO, Israel is not necessarily the fifth column in the US, bit Rome is. They control Israel, via Khazars (mercenaries to Rome). Rome never fell, imo. Tri-Sovereign States. All roads lead to Rome.... There are far less Jews in the US INT community as there are Jesuit trained. Look into it.. Here is a great resource <a href="/r/romerules">/r/romerules</a>..</p>

<p>No. Many have said this, including 911 insider Dimitri Khalezov, who is an FBI suspect for Bali Bombing.</p>

<p>Planes weren&#39;t real. The only real plane was flight 93, which was a drone aircraft with no passengers, which was shot down by National Guard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. My point is that, yes, doses do make a difference, but length of time of consumption can change that. I was responding to someone who said low doses of aspirin are healthy for you. Well they aren&#39;t healthy if you take a low dose every day over the course of your lifetime. The organ damage will accumulate. The same point is trying to be pushed by pro-fluoride people, saying that in low doses it&#39;s not a poison.

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me, &quot;raised fluoride concentrations&quot;. What do you think they&#39;re comparing it to, feeding children pure fluoride ions in solution? At best the nitpick you get is that what the paper actually says is that high fluoride concentrations reduce intelligence compared to low concentrations. I extrapolated from that: if the relationship shows that more fluoride means less intelligence, then clearly no fluoride would be superior to a little fluoride. I&#39;d love for there to be a study done to confirm that beyond a shadow of doubt, but the current evidence is enough to tell me to keep using fluoride-free toothpaste and drink fluoride-free bottled water. And given the reason why the analyzed study used Chinese sources, I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath for such a study to be published in the Latin alphabet anytime soon.</p>

<p>Here is that paper by the way: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22820538/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22820538/</a></p>

<p>They mostly studied Chinese sources, because most research on the effects of fluoride on children have only been done and published in China and in Chinese; American scientists have avoided touching that topic for the most part. They found that increasing fluoride levels decreased iq score, with 95% confidence. Feel free to examine the studies in great depth.</p>

<p>Although acute fluoride poisoning may be neurotoxic to adults, most of the epidemiological information available on associations with children’s neurodevelopment is from China, where fluoride generally occurs in drinking water as a natural contaminant, and the concentration depends on local geological conditions. In many rural communities in China, populations with high exposure to fluoride in local drinking-water sources may reside in close proximity to populations without high exposure (NRC 2006).</p>

<p>But they did specifically state in Lancet that raised fluoride concentrations correlate directly with a statistically significant drop in iq. Here&#39;s the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the full and complete paper for the study if you actually care and aren&#39;t just here to smugly insult people:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/pdf/ehp.1104912.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/pdf/ehp.1104912.pdf</a></p>

<p>It includes tables listing the concentrations of fluoride that were considered high and low in each examined study. The EPA allowed concentration in America is 4.0 mg/L maximum as per here: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/2011_fluoride_questionsanswers.pdf">https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/2011_fluoride_questionsanswers.pdf</a></p>

<p>The Chinese high benchmarks were normally from 1-4 mg/L, within what the EPA would allow, with some extreme outliers in mining areas. Lin et al (1991) however had its high benchmark as 0.88 mg/L, which is just barely higher than the US Department of Health&#39;s recommended optimal water fluoridation of 0.7 mg/L, and it also showed an IQ reduction. The meta-analysis determined an inverse relationship between fluoride concentration and intelligence exists - as fluoride goes up, iq goes down. It mentions in discussion too another study - Ding et al (2011) which indicated negative intelligence effects at low concentrations of fluoride (0.24-2.84 mg/L) which are well within ranges advised and allowed in the US.</p>

<p>As the Lancet already surmised, confounding factors like other chemical involvement were deemed unlikely. Did you read the Lancet article?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When fluoride is added to water they shoot for 0.70 mg/L. The EPA regulates maximum levels though. They call it a Maximum Contaminant Level. The figure of 4.0 mg/L is the maximum acceptable limit. The EPA recommends they shoot for around 2.0 mg/L though. Elevated levels are due to naturally occurring fluoride in the water. </p>

<p>The Chinese studies look at naturally occurring fluoride in well water.</p>

<p>Basically, the amount of fluoride added to water is negligible. All the studies you see analyze naturally occurring fluoride. </p>

<p>For starters I&#39;m not saying that planes were definitely used. But it would 1000% have to be a hologram that could be seen by the naked eye and not just someone via TV.</p>

<p>There is so many people who witnessed the second plane. Amateur video even have like a hundred people screaming  &quot;look another one!!!!!&quot; as they watch a plane hit. Then in the seconds after that they talk about how they simply watched the plane hit. </p>

<p>NYC is the most watched place in the world. Even though we may be on the right track the people behind this were not stupid at all. They would not risk literally one person getting amateur footage of NO plane hitting. There is witnesses in the towers who saw a second plane coming towards them.</p>

<p>It could be a drone/missile. Could be some advanced hologram. But there had to be something that was visible to everyone by the naked eye that looked like a plane. I don&#39;t believe for a second a plane hit the Pentagon or one crashed in PA though. The FBI went around Washington and took everyone&#39;s surveillance video from hotels and stores.

<p>The Active Thermitic Materials paper conducted a DSC test on their red/grey chips to determine if they were thermitic. Essentially a DSC test is where you slowly heat something until it burns and measure the energy output. They took their DSC result and compared it to a sample of <em>known thermite</em> that had been tested by Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in a different paper in 2000. They found that the energy output of their sample compared to the Lawrence Livermore sample was very similar, therefore their sample just <em>also</em> be thermite. </p>

<p>The only problem is they did that critical test <em>incorrectly</em>. </p>

<p>The 2 scientists from Lawrence Livermore (Alex Gash and Tom Tillotson) that tested the actual thermite for the 2000 paper came out and said that you always run a DSC test in an inert atmosphere (something completely devoid of oxygen, they use ultra pure nitrogen). Thermite does not need oxygen to ignite. If you run a DSC test in regular air, any organic material in your sample will ignite and give you an artificially high energy output. </p>

<p>The authors of the Active Thermitic Materials paper ran their DSC test in air, so they did it <em>incorrectly</em>, and the comparison with the Lawrence Livermore sample was <em>also</em> incorrect as that sample had been tested in nitrogen. Since the conclusion that the WTC dust was thermitic was heavily based on the DSC test and energy comparison with the Lawrence Livermore sample, that conclusion was also incorrect. </p>

<p>9/11 Blogger is Stephen Jones site. He&#39;s the principal author of the paper we&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>So basically what you&#39;re saying is you don&#39;t trust a post <em>he made</em> on the site <em>he runs</em>, but you trust his paper anyway? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was the paper &quot;verified&quot; though? The woman who was the editor in chief of the Bentham journal that published the paper resigned in disgust and said she had <em>not seen it</em> prior to it being published in her journal.</p>

<p>If you read Bentham&#39;s editorial standards, that means it was never peer reviewed in the first place. The editor in chief selects the reviewers and ultimately chooses whether or not to publish. If they went around her to get the paper in the journal, that means their own standards were not followed.</p>

<p>No one has ever disputed her version of events, not the authors of the paper in question and not Bentham publishing (this despite her calling her former employers dishonest and tarring the paper as a piece of trash). I&#39;d say that speaks volumes, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe her? The replacement Editor in Chief of <em>the same Bentham journal</em> also inquired with Bentham regarding the peer review process for this particular paper after he became aware of it. The organization <em>refused to share details on the review process with him</em>, the sitting editor in chief. This caused <em>yet another</em> resignation, with him saying he didn&#39;t know if the paper had been reviewed at all. Bentham continued sending him journal submissions and listing him as editor in chief of the journal on their website for MONTHS <em>after</em> his resignation. Sounds to me like that ship was rudderless. </p>

<p>Between the shady circumstances under which it was published and the subsequent revelation that the research was done completely incorrectly, it&#39;s not worth the paper its printed on. Even the group Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth have abandoned the thermite hypothesis for dead. They have stopped printing references to it in their literature for the last 2 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the absurdity of this new line - &quot;Russia did it&quot;. (My answer to sheep/trolls).</p>

<p>Did what exactly? Tell the truth? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say Putin did it. I personally doubt he&#39;d render us such a service, and you don&#39;t, so you have a higher opinion of him than I do, unless you think telling the truth is a bad thing. But let&#39;s put that aside. </p>

<p>So what? How does the messenger count, if the truth can be authenticated through a digital signature? What if Kim Jong II produced authentifiable emails proving endemic crimes? Would the criminals be absolved?</p>

<p>What if Putin gave you the authentifiable video of a recognizable and well-known adult abusing a child? Would that adult be able to complain &quot;Putin stole my pedophilia, be angry at him!&quot;? You seem to make that case.</p>

<p>And finally, that line is absurd because if the messenger were to count, those spewing the Russia line are modern civilisation&#39;s worst liars and war criminals. </p>

Too much fucking sugar in desserts (I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s worse in Brazil, which makes sense given their massive sugar industry). There is also a dearth of affordable places to eat out that are healthy. The US is getting better though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. My point is that, yes, doses do make a difference, but length of time of consumption can change that. I was responding to someone who said low doses of aspirin are healthy for you. Well they aren&#39;t healthy if you take a low dose every day over the course of your lifetime. The organ damage will accumulate. The same point is trying to be pushed by pro-fluoride people, saying that in low doses it&#39;s not a poison. They neglect to show evidence of the effects of low doses being consumed over long periods of time.</p>

<p>The Active Thermitic Materials paper was never peer reviewed in the first place. </p>

<p>Why would anyone bother refuting it? The critical test was done incorrectly. The papers author admitted it. That was the impetus behind the Basile &quot;independent study&quot;. </p>

<p>When he gets off his ass and has an independent lab examine and verify the finding of thermite, and a <em>reputable</em> journal publishes the findings, then you might get some attention. Until then, don&#39;t expect anyone to give a shit. </p>
