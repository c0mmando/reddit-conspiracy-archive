       Project MKUltra – sometimes referred to as the CIA's mind control program – is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects,
       <strong>
        at times illegal
       </strong>
       , designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.[1] Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. Organized through the Scientific Intelligence Division of the CIA, the project coordinated with the Special Operations Division of the U.S. Army's Chemical Corps.[2]

        But he said his brother later seemed to develop mental issues, and, during a visit to Alaska months ago, "he told me about these things that he [was] hearing voices, seeing people following him, the CIA and the government are, you know, writing him secret codes on the website to him and to join a group.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       The operation began in the early 1950s, was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967, and officially halted in 1973.[3] The program engaged in
       <strong>
        many illegal activities
       </strong>
       ,[4][5][6] including the use of
       <strong>
        unwitting
       </strong>
       U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy.[4](p74)[7][8][9] MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[10] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.[11][12]
      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at
       <strong>
        80 institutions, including 44 colleges and universities, as well as hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies.
       </strong>
       [13] The CIA operated through these institutions using front organizations, although sometimes top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the U.S. Congress, and a Gerald Ford commission to investigate CIA activities within the United States.
       <strong>
        Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed in 1973
       </strong>
       ; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order.[16]
In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings later that same year.[4][17] In July 2001, some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project's existence in 1990,
       <strong>
        alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest.
       </strong>
       While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.[80]
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just ONE project they have done. There are many more. Imagine the technology they have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is still going on. This is a direct violation of our rights. This is completely ludicrous. Have we really been conditioned to let these acts go on? This is an abomination. They're going to take our guns away. They are going to create the new world order if we don't come together and fight this peacefully.

       Serious question though, why help Hitler escape?
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientists/engineers/doctors - ones who could be of some practical help - I get that, but not sure how Hitler could have been of any use to them, once the war was over.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know, he was sparsely educated, and I mean, it's not like he had any 'special skills' I'm aware of. Other than being a skilled orator (which would not really help him in hiding).

       I heard MK Ultra was "ended" in the 70's so I was genuinely asking if MK Ultra was a byproduct of Operation Paperclip since from what I understand a lot of the Nazi scientist carried over their work with that, there was even the Braun (?) guy who like made NASA or some shit? Or at least designed the space station? I'm unsure, maybe he was just the first to say a space station was possible...

       MK stands for "Mark." It's typically used to designate different types of Navy equipment or equipment that originated with the Navy. It makes sense if you look at the history of MK Ultra and trace back to Project CHATTER, which was a Navy program.

       This tends to be an American-centric problem due to the education reform and the lack of standards among the teachers.

       We learned about Operation Paperclip in high school (Germany).

       Really nothing is supressed about the Holocaust. It ultimately comes down to whether you had a good teacher or not.

       Japan had a Unit just as bad as Mengele's. Fun fact, everything we know about Frostbite,
       <em>
        they

       discovered. The Japanese basically froze Chinese civilians and American POWs to death.

       You're right our education system in regards to WW2 is totally being whitewashed, for whatever reason in my youth I was fascinated by WW2 (history channel, original call of duty) I simply soaked up information, I knew about D-Day before ever hearing it in school simply because my own birthday was in June and for this reason I know more than the basic baseline WW2 history class but am still amazed by what others tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example Japan's role in "mad science" is really played down or at least not mentioned, I had no idea about that bit on Frostbite you just told me. Good lord. Meanwhile Germany's experimentation on twins, hypothermia etc is much more widely known.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard that in Germany there is strict regulation in forms of media on the Nazi symbol, like movies and games aren't allowed or shown to depict it. This is done to curtail Neo Nazism.

         The law is in place mostly for association / dissemination purposes. They don't want neo-nazi meetups, or greetings, in that regard.

      </ol>

       For art, it would have to be settled by the office handing out film permits, but for the most part, tv shows and film are moving away from historical usage and designing their own allegorical symbols (e.g.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPhHl2DpD4E3t=7s">
        The Force Awakens speech before the Starkiller Base fires up

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's a good law, because it's meant to curtail any form of usage where the symbols would be used for greetings, or associations (in meetings).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's a symbolic (heh) practice, but it is ultimately not all-encompassing. German Nazis fled to Quebec, America (Operation Paperclip), Argentina, Northern Africa, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Brazil, etc. The Mengele archives were used in MKUltra (the two programs are way too close to say they weren't completely related).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       But in terms of plausible deniability on the German Government's part (as many Nazis did join the Stasi), it works for them.

       I know you're argument is going to be that they can be mutually exlusive, but listen to yourselves. If they can control minds they're far more advanced than we give them credit for. They're mistakes aren't going to be easily seen. I doubt he was mind controlled. Brain washed maybe.

       Brain washing is a term I use to refer to someone that has been manipulated into believing something based on false pretenses. They're fully aware of the control op, they just believe it to be true. When I think of MK Ultra I think of 60 years of intelligence and research going into high tech devices and other unexplainable technology that directly effects the victim without their acknowledgement.

       Government brain washing and conspiracy theory brainwashing I'd imagine are very different. Being drugged up and saying you hear voices is probably not what they're doing. I'd think they're way passed that.

       Many projects have combined into one. The target is stalked, mind controlled, made into an assassin, or a mass shooter, or a terrorist, or made a cult leader, etc. It's referred to on the internet as "gangstalking"

       It could be schizophrenia. But experts in mind control say anyone who is diagnosed as schizophrenic could also be the victim of mind control. You can induce symptoms indistinguishable from schizophrenia.

        How far has the study of mememic and information warfare gone? When the Pentagon was setting up the psychic warfare unit, they recruited the worst prison inmates from around the country back in the 70’s. Why would you do this? By finding the scum of the scum, the worst subhuman creatures on the planet, they were testing a new kind of warfare. TAMI (thought amplifier and mind interface) is being used to amplify and multiply these toxic minds onto other people to see if they become violent or self destructive. Interesting weapon indeed! This is truly the definition of a mind virus. To bring it back to the movie “The Matrix”, agent Smith becomes a virus replicating his destructive personae on anyone he comes into contact with.

       Omar Mateen had been under FBI investigation already, but he never claimed any mind control. His apartment was also overrun by reporters, just like that of the San Bernardino shooters... in a display of what looks like mind-blowing incompetence, but is obviously anything but. Furthermore, Mateen's psych profile is at odds with every media narrative we heard. Lots of red flags on him.

       Honestly look at how easy it is for an abusive man to "program" his spouse into not only staying with but supporting and accepting the abuser. I imagine the government knows some much deeper and much more advanced ways to manipulate or otherwise condition someone to do whatever they want. Mk ultra as we knew it is over but I'm sure they're 3 or 4 iterations past that already. Ten or twenty years from now we'll be reading about the programming they did in the 80s and 90s under whatever codename they have for it.

       It was sarcasm. Don't assume to know that MK Ultra or other secret programs have been terminated. We literally know nothing. Does God exist? We simply do not know. I too, choose to believe he does exist, however I cannot say it with absolute certainty, I simply do not know.

       Mind control drugs? Well sure, I guess that's what they were trying to find with MK Ultra, but what they did (do) is dose people with massive amounts of LSD (maybe other psychedelic hallucinogens these days) and basically torture them psychologically in an attempt to break them. This is a program in which the Unabomber, who was also psychologically I'll beforehand, unwittingly enrolled. People, strapped for cash, sign up with no inkling as to what they're in for and are purposefully given the worst trip imaginable (where the people around them really are out to get them).
      </p>
      <p>
       That'll hurt anyone's psychological health, let alone someone who is fragile to begin with. So while it's possible that this was just a mentally unstable individual, it isn't without precedent that the situation described in the OP could happen.

       I never said mind control exists...clearly you didn't read my first comment let alone anything about MK Ultra. "Mind control" drugs is what's what the CIA was
       <em>
        looking
       </em>
       for in MKUltra, thinking they had a good candidate in LSD (I'm assuming you know what LSD is). If you'd bothered to read the first sentence of the MKUltra Wiki you'd have seen,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Project MKUltra – sometimes referred to as the CIA's mind control program – is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects, at times illegal, designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.[1]
        <strong>
         Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through MIND CONTROL
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They were looking for a drug to have influence over someone (like a cult leader does), a concept they called "mind control". They did a lot of experimentation on people by dosing then with LSD and breaking them down psychologically. So it's not beyond the realm of possibility that this shooter was involved in similar trials. Being dosed and psychologically broken by your government would be enough to push anyone with a fragile psyche over the edge.
       <strong>
        This has nothing to do with "mind control" in the sense that you're thinking.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe in this case, the CIA had nothing to do with it. My only point was that they've dosed and psychologically broken a fragile person, who went on to become a terrorist, before (read the Unabomber article), so the precedent is there.

       This needs to be at the top of this sub cuz they're ruining people's lives covertly on an individual basis, they're called targeted individuals and I've been targeted since I was a kid, I'm 22 now and they torture me daily with directed energy weapons (in Iran). Sorry I keep repeating this but I feel it's important for people to know this is happening.

       I've felt synthetic headaches, itches, needle pricks, hot needles, cramps, shocks. Some people get burned hasn't happened to me yet. It happens after very specific activity like while I draw, read, meditate, when people upvote me, when I get facebook notifications, for a while they set it so I get hurt when people talk to me or just look at me.

       This is a little known fact but completely true Patent applications have been made years ago for Voice to Skull technology. Research started in world war 2 when it was found that some people could hear the pulse repitition frequency of the early radar systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The listener needs to know that at least one method of voice to skull transmission, using microwave pulses much like radar, is not particularly new. During World War II, technicians working in the path of energized radar antennas discovered they could hear a buzz, seeming to originate inside their skulls. This buzz was being caused by the train of very short pulses of microwave signal, each pulse causing a single click.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early 1970s, Dr. Joseph Sharp of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research used a computer to control a radar transmitter such that for each time a human voice waveform changed from a peak to a valley, the radar transmitter sent out a single pulse, causing a single click to be heard by the test subject. Because these clicks were timed according to the human voice waveform, the test subject heard a voice, rather than a string of clicks. This has not been pursued, at least publicly, due to concerns about the effect of microwave signals aimed at a person’s skull, but it does work.
      </p>
      <p>
       In actual fact, a suitably modified amateur radio transmitter operating in either the 420 to 450 megahertz band or the 1.3 gigahertz band, with a highly directional antenna, is capable of transmitting voice to skull signals at less cost than the price of an automobile.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to simply driving a target crazy, voice to skull can cause far more severe damage to a targeted person if instead of audible voice, one of several types of SUBLIMINAL voice is transmitted instead. When the subliminal voice is that of a hypnotist, and is aimed at a targeted person’s bed, voice to skull can be used over time to undetectably program the person. Because the power level required is fairly modest, being something like the output of the common heat lamp, the person being programmed could have no idea this was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who is highly susceptible to hypnosis, and about one in five are, could be put through living Hell simply by way of subliminal voice to skull.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is common for psycho-electronic mind control victims to report a very frequent or constant “ringing in the ears”, which is also a symptom of the “Lowery” method of subliminal voice conversion. Lowery’s method is described in U.S. patent 5,159,703 and such a converter can easily be built by someone with reasonable electronic assembly abilities. Source: the7thfire.com

       Effects of Radiation Harassment Technology (V2K) Technology - PERPS (Perpetrator or the harasser) have technology that in a nut shell can do the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       They are a very faint sound, therefore a person interprets them as their own thoughts. Since they are a very faint sound, only those things that are know to a person can be manipulated. Put it simply they won’t be able to teach you Chinese. An example of this is that if a person says a sentence very slowly and close to your ears, then you will only understand it if you know it or parts of it, otherwise your interpretation of what’s being said would be different as compared to what was actually said.
PERPS use other means to make a person dwell on things that where unknown to them. Like after listening to a news article, or even other people saying something similar that PERPS would want a target to direct there thoughts on. Affects related to this are listed below. (VOICE)
They can vibrate certain muscles, affects related to that are mentioned below. (MUSCULAR)
Certain parts in nervous system react to them. Affects related to this are mentioned below. (NERVOUS)
They can cause power surges. (EMP) (EMP = Electromagnetic Pulses)
Give throat irritation, mucus formation. (MUSCULAR)
Watery mouth. (MUSCULAR)
Hyperventilation, sudden shortness of breath. (MUSCULAR)
Vibrate certain muscles in our body. (MUSCULAR)
Give different body aches and pains. Specially back ache. (MUSCULAR)
Tinnitus. (MUSCULAR OR NERVOUS)
Clogged ears. (Like the way it feels when the elevation changes, like in plane or in elevators). (MUSCULAR)
If a person have an existing condition, like a cut, or infection, they can make it really pain. (MUSCULAR)/(NERVOUS)
Nausea, headaches. (NERVOUS)
Listen to a person’s thoughts. Yes that’s what they are capable of. Lots of time, during early manipulation, that’s what a person complains of, that someone knows what they are thinking, or watching them all the time, however, not all is true, some of those thoughts are manipulated by PERPS. (NERVOUS)
Manipulate a person’s thoughts, by putting specific words while a person is thinking. (VOICE)
Manipulate a person’s emotions by making them angry or inducing anxiety or even make a person cry or laugh. (NERVOUS)
They can cause simple sounds to occur again and again. For instance, if a pager is set to simple beep, then they make a person to think that the pager is on, yet when its not. (VOICE)
They can cause surges, yes, the lights that went out recently in NY, is there doing. (EMP)
They can make minor malfunctions in electronic equipment. Causing them to flicker, or even in some cases render the equipment useless. (EMP)
Any sensor driven machine is prone to them. They can cause a light sensor to activate at night, causing the light to go out. (EMP)
They can temper with thermostats. Causing the air conditioner to come on, or the refrigerator to malfunction, or cause the car to over heat. Yep, that’s what they can do. (EMP).

       The truth of how advanced capabilities are of current iterations of this technology would not be believed. Take a look at the cell phone towers in your neighborhood and imagine a world where the ability to engender a mass panic attack on a population or a trigger a lone gunman to attack can be triggered with the click of a mouse.
The technology is being used in subtle ways to shape mass consciousness on a global scale tampering with entire populations with subtle commands to consume conform and be apathetically content. The power grid can serve the exact same purpose using the wiring itself to radiate pulsed RF energy.  Shitty but true. Farraday cage anyone?

       Microwave auditory effect, also known as V2K, tends to be audible messages. Not subliminal voice to skull.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subliminal messages are modulated in ultrasound. Hearing the hum (ringing in the ears) is caused by ultrasound hearing.

      <p>
       False. The subliminal messages are masked by humming. Humming is very loud and vibrational. Very obvious and measureable. The volume, vibration and ultrasound spectrum can be measured at the ear and brain. Instructions:

       Whats it feel like, describe the 'pain' your tortured with, specifically, do you remember the first time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because well i got migraines now, couple months ago it felt like a 'twang' of intense radio static hit the left side, only lasted half a second, less even.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im describing the sound of radiostatic but it was more akin to a thousand nails scratching a chalkboard all at once
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenness of it made me take a mental note, had migraines since on right side
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, just curious if you took a mental note down

       They torture victims differently, my first time was needle pricks and cramps in my hands/feet really bad for months to try and get me institutionalized. They don't hit me with the headaches much, when they have it feels like a strong headache I think on my right side and it feels like someone is pushing a button, it'll go on and off lasting 2-3 seconds each time and like 10 seconds total. My torture is mainly with needle pricks and cramps sorry I can't be so helpful hope you'll find what you're looking for :)

       yes, by "you" people its the deplorables HRC mentioned.  yeah its a possibility but no i don't think it will actually happen. why? Trump surrounded himself with a cabinet made of up ex-generals who could basically counter martial law from the standing potus and have a "non-peaceful" transition of power.

       I'll be honest with you I used to believe these things as well. Then I started asking myself these kinds of questions and I couldn't produce anything tangible. It just keeps taking ever growing leaps of faith to keep this view of the world viable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody would. There is allegedly this ultra powerful orginaztion with virtually infinite resources running the world and they need some guy to shoot up an airport to justify an action on the other side of the planet? It's like a crappy movie plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you actually read the article or just the headline? He was suspended for releasing a video that is part of an ongoing investigation possibly for monetary gain. That's pretty unethical behavior if that happens to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are examples of "false flag" attacks but this isn't one. It's a guy that had mental issues that needed help and didn't get it and this was the result. If you can provide any actual evidence that he was the victim of this faceless organization and how it manipulated him to do this  I'm more than willing to change my position.

       not my views.  i'm consistently proven to be correct in my views (like a week and a half ago when I predicted a series of terror attacks which would benefit the israeli narrative of having to protect themselves from islamic terrorism in the face of scrutiny by the outgoing administration).  And I have plenty of experience which feeds my world views.  I have family members and friends who have been on both sides of covert shenanigans- so i have personal experience which has drawn me to my perspectives.  Spy games are very real.  And public relations will go to great lengths.

       whoa whoa whoa.  I certainly didn't go there.  This could have been pulled off by any number of small private groups or intelligence agencies who would benefit from it.  It also COULD have simply been a lone wolf off his meds (but i personally doubt it).

       again, i think it's worth following up with the entire story behind him releasing the video.  someone likely coerced him to do it.

      <p>
       all the evidence we have right now (and likely forever) is motive and means.  HE was the one alleging a faceless organization.  And luckily, he documented it as best he could, so his allegation could not be denied.  So then the question becomes why his case was closed and why he was allowed to travel with a gun and ammunition as someone who was under scrutiny.

       Sure- there will be civil unrest in Turkey and Iran.  This isn't organic- this is western intelligence agencies causing chaos to urge regime change and upset russian lng pipelines.  You can follow other places where this will occur simply by looking at Russian pipelines.  You will also see a few events happen soon in chechnya- likely orchestrated through the jamestown foundation.  Greece and Italy will be targeted.  Germany and france will be subjected to terror attacks blames on immigrants from Syria and the rest of the middle east.  Somalia and Sudan will have their own unrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       there will be multiple news stories pushing the putin/ trump connection, and other things to discredit trump before his taking office.  this will continue if he does take office- his whitehouse will be inundated with scandalous "news" pushed by the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       we'll be seeing a few economic bubbles pop over the next few years.  digital advertising will be shown to be supported by cheats, and that will be blamed on clickbait farms and "Fake news sites".  Google will aim to filter these sites (in a political manner) while trying not too take TOO much of a hit on their stream of adwords revenue.  But they will be meanwhile attempting to shift advertising off of actual pages and the search engine and onto the "internet of things".
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the push to privatize schools will be pushed towards centralization by blaming small charters and online programs for the failures that are inherent in most current school systems.  The democrats will take the lead in pushing a rebranded nclb initiative.  When the higher education debt bubble pops, it will bring down one of the big banks- which will be sacrificed, and that debt will be consolidated among the others, with the treasury effectively buying off a ton of debt.  You will watch, even prior to that- a media campaign to push a new new deal which will re-instate the draft and an alternative (as military is being more automated) civil service programs, perhaps devoted to a new transportation infrastructure program.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note, you will see automation transportation and manufacturing being disruptive in many economic regards over the next ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insurance and marketing will be working with technology companies developing products and the data tools which analyze your use of them in the "internet of things".  You'll be incentivized to give up your data for better "customer service".  Eventually that data will be used to incentivize your habits themselves- in what is effectively a mass digital socialization program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media will continue to push racial divisions and victim narratives aimed at political identities.  Similarly, our media consumption will be filtered by that ideological identity- we will have less and less access to perspectives we disagree with, and our opinions and fears will be more and more re-enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun control will be pushed slowly.  The guns won't be "taken away", but similar to non-self driving cars, the manufacturers will be targeted with safety regulations.  They will include biometrics and law enforcement will gain digital control of weapons which the public has access to- allowing them to remotely shut off a gun being used by an "active shooter" or a criminal driving a car.

       Yours is much more well-researched, but I think the FBI identified themselves as CIA to this man, groomed him to be another "terrorist" they could use as a political boon, and expected him to either kill himself or die in the carnage.

       Why was Cat Stevens put on the no-fly list but this guy wasn't? He should've been on the No-Fly list as soon as he left the FBI office in Anchorage. That's either nefariousness or gross negligence from the FBI which resulted in 5 civilian deaths. But hey, we need to stop letting people checking guns, because a shooter would never go into an unsecured area of an airport without having flown in first. Oh wait, there's Brussels

       I was a direct victim of Mind Manipulation aka MK-Ultra but something I will tell you is this.  Just about everyone in the populace is under some form of MK-Ultra-ish type of influence.  Given triggers at a young age sometimes directly (like me), or via TV, Video Games etc.  If anyone wants to know more just ask.

       Well, me being a literal victim of it and know first hand how triggers work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the populace in the US for sure is for lack of a better word MK-Ultra'ed.
      </p>
      <p>
       How?
      </p>
      <p>
       An example of a trigger in the U.S. that is easily passed off as being racist but is not is how white populace look at the dark skinned populace (aka black).  The moment the average white person in America heres the voice of a dark skinned male, they instantly think negative.  Rather that person is a doctor, attorney doesn't matter.  They think negative FIRST, and then maybe, just maybe, some positive may come later.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not normal, this is a trigger.  It was an easy one which is the only reason I chose that one first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how do you know it's a trigger that was embedded at an early age?  But looking around and seeing that many people have the carbon copied feelings.  No uniqueness in thought or action, they all just feel the 'exact' same way with no difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is odd to say the least.  But someone who has been through the program directly, I can tell immediately that they have triggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another obvious easy trigger for the dark skinned populace (aka black) is to call them the N*** word. Most are not as triggered these days but obviously that triggered was embedded by years of hatred, fear, slavery etc.  Where as if someone says that word and they are of the opposite race, that immediately well bring some to fight mode which happens in an instant.  Again like they were 'triggered' to do such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can give many more examples that get ever more complex but I think you understand the premise.

       Not an argument at all.  I was a victim of it and still suffer from many trauma's.  Also am triggered as well.  I just recognize what tend to trigger me and either avoid it all together or just be conscious enough of it not to react.

       This is actually a conspiracy that I believe. I read about mk ultra years ago. Hearing the shooter talk about how he was forced to watch isis videos made me think of mk uktra. I read about how the successfully testes mk uktra in the 50s and basically hypontised ppl to carry suitcases with fake explosives into buildings. This was all in unclassified government documents.

       A bunch of acid isn't going to make you rob a bank and it's especially not going to make you shoot a bunch of people.  It's going to make you have to shit and then you'll contemplate life.

       Posting again as the other Mkultra posts drowned after the trump news:

       Because it's unlikely that the public accept the reality. There are victims of these crimes that fight for credibility, supported by psychiatrists and experts that back the testimonies. Still ignored by media and officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The process required for the public to accept or even doubt about these new ways of domestic terrorism by state agents isn't proportional to the truth itself:

       Also, in case you doubt microwave/electromagnetic weapons can and have been used to harass here's the example of US officers victims themselves (Wikileaks cables about the Russian use of microwave weapons against the US embassy):

       You know what's fun?  Not paying attention to this story at all.  I literally know 0% of this story, and I don't care to know.  I already know enough to know it's yet another insult to our country.  If I need to know this particular story, I'll read about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you guys though, that you should try this.  Try aggressively not paying attention to a story.  You'll be happily going about your day.  This is not an ignorance is bliss thing.  I know
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       the story.  I see you guys posting.  But I'm choosing to ignore this particular one, because I already know what it's about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been saying for about a month now, and longer if you count a few posts before that, that Obama is going to try this scorched earth bullshit.

       Well....

       Here we are.

      <p>
       And I don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's absolutely wonderful.   It's ok to downvote.  I'm like super high on not caring about this one story.

       Make some predictions about upcoming events? Do you have anything in writing/print about your previous predictions?

       I don't think anyone would dispute that spy games agent real. Or, that media is used to distort/cover things up. We have evidence that allows us to say these things. What evidence do we have in this instance
