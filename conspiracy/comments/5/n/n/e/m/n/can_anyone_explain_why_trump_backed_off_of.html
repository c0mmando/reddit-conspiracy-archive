       It makes me sick that all of the skeptics and anti govt people have suddenly fell in line behind Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I believe Hillary is a criminal, Bernie would destroy our economy, Jill Stein was literally retarded and Gary Johnson was in way over his head. This isn't about my side vs yours. We should all be on the same side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Didn't see the sticky post until after I posted this. No, I haven't been active here in a while, but that's mainly because of the war from both sides that's been waged (and, it looks like won) here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Also, I would like to say, I am not accusing this sub of being pro trump or anything. This is a larger view, of my personal friends and acquaintances along with what I've seen online.

       Creepy that you looked into my post history, honestly. To answer your question, I'd like the Falcons, Texans, or Chiefs. Mainly because fuck the Cowboys, Packers, Patriots, and Seahawks. Steelers I'd be alright with, two Michigan school alums as focal points of their offense, but fuck Ben Rapelisburger.

       If Hillary gets prosecuted by Trump, or anyone of the matter, while Obama still resides as President, he can pardon Hillary from any wrongdoings thus making her immune to any penalties. By saying he (Trump) will not prosecute, he puts the ball in Obama's court; if Obama pardons Hillary (unconditional pardon) before his term of President is up, that would essentially be an admission of guilt that Hillary broke the law.  It's best to wait a week and see what happens.  We are living in exciting times my friend!

       Actually, I believe the key point is that there's actually no recourse from a Presidential pardon. It's conclusive in most every way including pardoning people for future crimes.

       Saying he wont prosecute sets the stage for the Democrats to shoot themselves in the foot. She can apply for pardon, admitting she is guilty of
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       , or Obama can pardon admitting
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       thinks she is guilty of
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       . By not doing anything, and saying he won't pursue prosecution Trump is backing Obama/Clinton into a corner... They are damned if they do basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post innauguration and intelligence agency can
       <em>
        "discover ner information"
       </em>
       that would change Trumps mind about prosecution, thereby keeping his initial promise, and still being able to claim prosecution is now neccessary.

       You are leaving out the most important part. Presidents don't bring cases, that is the DOJ and AG's job.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Trump is doing is creating plausible deniability that he is not conducting a political witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will change my views on a great many things regarding Trump if Hillary isn't on the way to swinging by her neck within a couple months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say this as well. If Hillary gets pwned we might have a real president here. Imperfect yes, but these snakes never eat their own in any substantive way.

       I am in total agreeance with you here. If nothing happens with Clinton it's time to turn on Trump. I think proper disclosure on the Clinton crime syndicate would be a hugely unifying event, and after having to eat a lot of shit maybe we might see some converted mindsets from the alt-left.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Clinton gets hammered it's definitely a good indication he may be legit.

       If you go in gor woowoo esoteric at all, the planets of our solar system are all direct now, til like Feb 6th. Fairly rare, usually Mercury or one of the close-in ones is retrograde. The astrological theory is that this current "all forward motion" situation could mean some serious shit gets straightened out... ♎

       We do not want Obama to pardon her.  Do you?  It is better for Trump to play nice until he is in office.  Of course, he is not doing a very good job at it, but he is being attacked by all sides.

       Right after the election it wasn't clear if protests were going to engulf the nation or not. I think Trump laid off of Hillary to try and ease the unrest about his presidency from the crazy leftists. New info just came out from one of the intelligence agencies about new emails that prove Hillary committed another crime. Maybe he'll prosecute that. If he won't, I think it's just to ease unrest. It's not important that Hillary is punished, it's important to unite the country behind an upright leader like Trump. He will prove himself on the economy with his numbers, and hopefully get some of the liberal vote in the next election in four years. He doesn't need to piss off the left by putting their nice granny in jail.

       Trump doesn't need to push for prosecution if the DOJ changes its stance or other authorities decide to pursue charges.

       If he is clearly involved in the prosecution, it could appear to some (and would be spun by the media) as purely politically motivated. To me, it seems as though there is more than enough to warrant an investigation, and any Trump involvement would cloud the legitimacy of the investigation, so why be closely involved?

       This. Trump distancing himself is the smartest thing he can do. Trump involvement plays directly into the charge that he's a deranged autocrat. Hillary is dirty enough that once every level of law enforcement isn't in her pocket there will be no need for trump to bring exposure to it anymore

       It is inappropriate to pursue charges against politilical adversaries in the US. He has distanced himself, as he should.

       There is nothing stopping his cabinet from doing so, however.

       I am not a Trump supporter, so I am not saying this to defend him but I don't think that he could do anything about it until he is actually in power. He's still just the president-elect. And if he isn't in bed with the cabal and does plan to prosecute her, it's best to not be open about it and wait til Obama and co are gone. Or there could be other stuff going on behind the scenes like deals being made to grant clemency to some people like Hillary so that the cabal backs off in other ways. But I'm obviously just guessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's tough to pinpoint exactly what's going on or talk with surety when it comes to these kind of things because there are so many layers of info/disinfo between regular people and these high-up power positions/structures.

       It just seems too fishy to me. All the email stuff, all the Russia stuff, all of really everything. There's no way they aren't on the same side. It just seems to me like he is getting set up to be "the fall guy" that distracts from everything our govt and politicians have done the past 8+ years.

       Yes, this post is definitely about Jill Stein. Look bro that's just my opinion of her, I disagree with and think everything she stood for is stupid as shit. She was basically the uber liberal version of Trump - sounds good and says things people wanna hear but has no clue how to do it, and no business being in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress. Didn't mean to hurt your feelings with insulting Jill Stein. Like i said, this is about how the election and impending Trump presidency is (possibly) scripted, to a certain degree.

       Because you don't want a President who goes after people and tries to prosecute them, that's what the Justice department is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump fills the Justice department with people who truly care about the law, then Trump won't have to go after the Clintons, the Justice department will take care of everything, all he'll have to tell them is uphold the Law.

       OK OP,

      <p>
       1) You are telling me that you believe a politician based on what they said? (on r/conspiracy...as a thread.)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) His 'fan base' literally chanted "LOCK HER UP" - does this sound like a good first move?
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I saw a smirk on his face (60minutes) when he said something along the lines of "ask me again in the near future".
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck, I'm kinda glad people have assumed it as is 'backing off'.....I call it is not telegraphing my punches.
