       This guy was a genius in all senses of the word. He was a prodigy. He's someone we can all look up to. He didn't care about money. All he wanted to do was change the world. He was devoid of greed. He hated corporations. He hated the government. He hated authority. He hated suppression of speech and information.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a very young age, he helped to create this platform we use today, with the idea that people would come together and have a voice and be heard. He gave us a voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       He once downloaded millions of documents of research papers from Stanford and after analyzing them, discovered that there were deep connections among corporations, Stanford, and lawmakers to skew certain "favorable" results and help certain corporations to get away with certain harmful practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he was downloading files from a research publishing company via the MIT library, the Secret Service was involved in the investigation and tried to slap him with a felony, and prison for 35 years. I don't think they were scared that he was going to sell these papers to make a profit. I believe they were scared he was going to discover many connections between some corporations and academics, and expose certain industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wanted to make an example of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       His enemies got to him. His enemies are our enemies. They are out to exploit us for a profit. We are their slaves, and it is in their interest to keep us docile.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if Aaron Swartz was alive today?

       Someone once posted here that he found a giant encrypted file that was too large to be sent over the network to avoid detection before it finished, rumored to be child porn or the like connected to high level staff that worked in South East Asia using orphanages there to film/prostitute kids.
