      <p>
       So a couple of years ago I was going through some hardships and my friend (who's name will remain anonymous, we'll just call him Jerry) was there to lend me some company while I was going through this. Me and Jerry would frequently smoke weed together and sit back and talk for hours, usually on weekends when he would come over. One night he asked me to hang out in the downtown area, so I obliged, we proceeded to go to a house where we were going to buy some weed and they invited us inside (typically my dealers were always in pretty nice houses and never had any sort of nefarious looking friends, this time was different) we went inside and there was a group of people partying a little bit and I sat down next to this guy who was being pretty quiet and just looking around the room, I never asked his name and he never asked for mine, but at a certain point he asked me if I had a cigarette, I let him bum one off of me and that started a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We talked about this and that for a while, the fact that I was from a bigger city and his travels around the country, when he dropped a big bomb on me "You know... I feel like I can trust you... So I'm going to let you know... We're everywhere..." I was taken back by this and asked him what he meant by that and he said "Masons... The Freemasons I mean... We're everywhere... In plain site... That's the best place to hide." I looked at him for a moment and said "Why are you telling me this?" he then proceeded to tell me "I don't know man... I feel like something is about to happen and I want someone to know about this..." at first I didn't believe him until I saw the ring on his finger with the masonic symbol and the number 32 engraved on the underside (which he showed me) I asked him what that meant and he said "That 32 right there... Represents my level in the society... I'm a 32nd degree mason, one of the highest levels... And now I feel uneasy..." at this point I started to feel uneasy myself but, against my better judgement, I pushed forward for answers... I asked him "So do you guys like... Actually control the media and stuff?" in a joking way, to try and gauge his response, he responded with "That's something that I wish you hadn't asked... But because I honestly feel like I may not be around much longer, I see no reason to keep it a secret... Yeah... We control it... Everything from Dora the Explorer to Katy Perry and CNN... It's all ours and we use it to keep you blind." I asked him what they were keeping us blind to and he said "The world... What's happening right in front of your eyes... The secret genocide and massacre of the population..." that's when he really went off on a tangent, I felt like I was being pulled down the rabbit hole, he continued with "See I sell drugs... That's my job in the society... I sell drugs to people to keep them... The people... dumbed down and in a state of euphoria... Those overdoses you hear about on the news, those ain't overdoses, those drugs are concentrated by Freemasons, they're more powerful, more potent so that, what seems like a regular dose, is actually 100 times more powerful." he took a deep breath and let out a sigh and continued "Sometimes I feel bad about what I'm doing, shit, maybe that's why they want me gone, because I have a conscious, maybe it's because they can see my soul and know that I don't want to do this no more... I don't know, but they don't like it... Whatever you do... If you see something that looks Masonic... Stay the hell away from it man, don't go near it... They'll know I told you these things and don't think they won't, they have eyes and ears everywhere." he then pointed to a guy sitting in a chair that was glaring at him and said "That man right there is gonna kill me when y'all leave, trust that... No doubt about it man, he don't like what I'm saying and he's 33rd degree... He'll take me out for sure."
      </p>
      <p>
       During that entire exchange I was completely speechless and had no idea what to do with myself, that mans face is burned into my mind, the man glaring at him from across the room had such evil in his eyes and to this day I look around every corner making sure nobody is following me or trying to kill me, maybe my vigilance is what keeps them at bay, constantly surrounding myself with people, making sure there's at least one other person with me at all times, unless I know I'm in a secure place, I don't know... Why they haven't tried to take me yet is beyond me... But I've seen them... Lurking around, keeping their eyes and ears on me at all times, making sure I don't slip up... I pretend that I don't see them, hell I've done a good job at convincing myself that they aren't really there, that it's in my head. But this secret is killing me more than my fear of them is... I never saw that man again... I even went back to that house to buy weed again, secretly looking for him to see if he was alright but I never saw him ever again, I saw the man with the evil eyes again, but never him... Those eyes will haunt me forever... But the words of that mason will forever reverberate in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for reading this, I hope you understand that it is with great risk that I post this, I don't know what will happen next, all I can do is provide the truth... I accepted death a long time ago, that it was an inevitability, that it would happen one day... I don't fear it and I don't believe I should... The stress this has had on me has really put a toll on my mind and this is the only way I can find relief.

       Whether you believe it or not is of no consequence to me. I know what happened, if you don't believe it then that's your choice, I knew I would get criticism when I posted this and I'm okay with it.

       When I came here minutes after pissgate, and was here the following hours, it appeared to me that everyone took 4chan seriously. And the wild claims were, exactly that, wild.. But...alot of people were on board. And to me it's like a pivotal moment in American history, and maybe a defining moment for American politics, and a definite moment of sink or swim for MMS, was ALL attributed to 4chan. 
Let that sink in. In short 4chan was claiming to have done all that, plus make its way and fool the intelligence community enough to have made in to the American daily presidential intelligence briefing. 
And the scary thing is I can't say with certainty that it  wasn't them..but without evidence im hesitant to say Yay or nay. I definitely lean towards nay, but shit, with a nay stance, I'd lose a vaild debate
      </p>
      <p>
       So really, Idk wtf. Time will tell I guess. But currently I think there is a good chunk of the world that is taking 4chan as seriously as a heart attack. Which, really I don't know what that says about everything...ugh...

       Eh, I can't say with certainty that it wasn't a campaign of disinformation against the loyal heroes of 4chan either... but I'm more inclined to be neutral in all things until the evidence compels me to do otherwise.

       I could pick this apart to hell but ill simply point out theres no such thing as a "32nd degree Freemason ring". Fremasons that are initiated to the 33rd degree at the 29th level. 30-33 is one long initian with several steps.

       And im telling you this didnt happen, straight up. Nothing was shared in this post 99% of the regular visitors of this sub dont already believe about the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only difference is "the powers that be" cant simply be dumbed down to Freemasons. Even my 55 year old father who doesnt believe in most modern conspiracies knows theres more than one secret society that has its hand in running the planet.

       Well you can choose to believe that it didn't happen all day long, but the fact of the matter is that it did happen. I've told you before, I honestly don't care if you believe it, these are the facts, take it or leave it.

       Dude, just so you know the Masons have nothing to do with anything and you are crazy for thinking that. They do not worship jahbulon and are all around good people who try to help everybody.

       Is it possible that the hierarchy of the Masons only allows for one 33rd degree? But a 32nd would be a high ranking "general" of sorts, there could be tons of those.

       I wasn't saying is was wrong, cause I can't prove it. But good point also. When did the masons start? Long time ago.. So since then to now, how many 32nds would there have been. My guess is a shit ton

       the 33rd is an honorary degree, and a functional degree. Basically there are two versions. One is given as a thankyou for dedicated service to the fraternity, the other is a designation as a regional officer of what is called the "Scottish Rite." The latter of which there are only 33 people at any given time, who are part of "the supreme council"

       ehhhhh you're right and you're wrong. There's no official 32nd degree ring given to you when you've had your 32nd degree... but you can definitely buy one. There is however a 14th degree ring which is (usually) given to you. That's what I wear. There's no rule saying "wear this ring, wear that ring" its jewelry... to each their own in taste and use.

       All I'm saying is that the liberal and conservative media is just about as reliable as alt-right and extreme left media, they all want a story but they put their own spin on it to make it more sensational so they can get more ratings, more ratings means more money, more money means more resources, more resources means more stories and more stories means more ratings, it's a vicious cycle.

       Sounds like you should leave this subreddit if all you can say is that same cunty response. It gets pretty old seeing people upvote shit comments about how we should ignore the entire post because it turns out the person has a mental illness, yes apparently this cuck in the comment section has the authority to diagnose illnesses through text based internet posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who the fuck sees this comment and thinks "Yea everyone lets upvote this fuckknob"! Why don't you shut the fuck up and keep your armchair psychology remarks out of a subreddit about conspiracies? There is honestly few dumber places to accuse someone of being crazy. The post might not be that good but it never helps to top it off with the "bless your heart" hospital recommendation. Maybe you should get therapy and learn how to not be such a flaming bitch?

       And there is what's wrong with the modern "conspiracy theory" community. All conspiracy, no theory. Logic, rigor and evidence. These three forces will topple tyrants and oppressors of all sorts, but fear, ignorance and willful credulity? Those will eat away at the foundations of any community.

       I'm not saying it's real. I'm saying I appreciate information shared because I can determine its value myself, or perhaps have something come up later that determines it's value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharing information never eats away at a community foundation. It's literally the foundation itself. If we shut people down when they share their own experiences, we end up making it less likely to occur and could end up detouring someone from sharing something vital.

       I don't do drugs anymore, I haven't touched them in about 2 years, but marijuana doesn't cause hallucinations, only an intense feeling of euphoria, the idea of marijuana being a psychedelic drug has been debunked many times over.

       He's talking about a Cipher, which is a little blue book that has our ritual in a pretty basically ciphered text. You could probably figure out some of it, but not all of it, and if you did... without having context it would indeed be really, really boring.

       While that may be true, the chances of someone doing that just for a laugh are pretty slim, it would be reaching pretty far to say that a random guy went out and bought a 32nd degree mason ring at a pawn shop for a few bucks and started a big story about it, then just disappeared for no reason but to have a laugh.

       I'm not so sure that someone would go through the lengths of disappearing completely just to make a joke, if so then that person would not have been mentally stable enough to hold it together throughout the telling of his story.

       If you are, in fact, a 32nd degree mason, and not just making it up to prove your point, then all of this should already be knowledge to you and I don't understand why you would be wasting your time.

       Eh... its raining out and I'm bored. Feel free to ask me any questions about Masonry though, one thing that's actually true about masons is that we, surprisingly enough... love to talk about masonry. (with a couple of exceptions that we're obligated not to discuss)

       If you are actually a mason then I would prefer not to go any further with this. Even though I think you're making this up as a way to try and get under my skin, or you simply think I'm an idiot, or you may actually be a mason, in either case I can't see anything to gain from continuing this discussion, if you're trying to get under my skin it's not working, if you think I'm an idiot... Well that's your opinion of me and if you are a real mason, I don't think I would feel comfortable getting into a discussion with you about it, for obvious reasons.

       It seems odd that, given the chance to ask someone questions about our Fraternity (which you could also do over on
       <a href="/r/freemasonry">
        /r/freemasonry
       </a>
       ), you get scared and don't want to. The whole concern here is that someone who may or may not have been a Mason told you something scary. I'd think you'd want to confirm or refute that...

       Unless you're clinging to your assumption because, disturbing though it might be, you've become comfortable with the feeling.

       I assure you, that while I think you're gullible, I don't equate that with being an idiot. Idiots are incapable of moving past their gullibility, given better information. You have yet to prove that you're in that category.

       oh, well.. no I mean there are bricklayers/masons that build stuff, for sure. But the fraternity of "Freemasonry" is just that, a fraternity. We use the symbols of ancient builders as part of the fabric of our mythology and symbolism. Its the largest and oldest fraternity in the world, and a fun hobby for a few million people.

       Well, it opens up a wide variety of areas of interest, so, as a hobby for some (like me) it opens up a huge segment of history to learn, read about, see how it intertwines with other areas of history and study. Some, love the performance aspect of performing the rituals, its a bit like acting and being on stage. For some, its a group of trusty buds to play poker with, or have a cigar and a scotch while talking about the deeper meanings of the universe. Some love chasing down all the threads of our origins. Some love the symbolism and get super deep into the meanings of the symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
       At its core its basically a philosophy club, with a long history, and a core concept of improving the self.

       Again, you can choose to believe that, but the notion that his story is fake, given all of the information, doesn't add up to me. You can call me naive if you like but you weren't there so there's no way you could understand the intensity of the situation.

       I'm not trying to influence anyone, all I did was share a story and let people come to their own conclusion, if you read through I've stated many times that if someone doesn't believe me then that's their choice, that's pretty much the opposite of trying to influence, if anything I'm trying to influence them to come to their own conclusion about something that I experienced.

       I'm at peace with everything as far as spirituality goes and with myself. Whatever happens from here on out will be worth it, if not for any other reason than the fact that I tried to help. But like I said... the mass skepticism will probably keep me alive.

       I wouldn't worry about them.  It's not spiritually legal for them to kill you.  You have to do something to enable it.  The other guy broke his oath so they probably did / will kill him, as that's the penalty and they know it when they signed up for it.  The first rite I believe is to bear your chest blindfolded and they hold a dagger to it and you swear an oath never to reveal secrets under penalty of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyway, you didn't take that oath, they can't go after you.

       I can prove to you that that they are a criminal gang, a mafia, that are nominally luciferian kabbalists, sabbatean, sorcerors who engage in various forms of occultism, polytheism (paganism) and mystery teachings forming a cultural evolutionary continuity going back to ancient babylon and persia--to zoroastrianism, manicheanism and yazidism

      <p>
       If he said that, literally that, then there are three possibilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You made up this story
       </li>
       <li>
        He bought the ring on ebay or similar and had no idea what it meant.
       </li>
       <li>
        He was actually a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason who didn't know what that meant.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The latter happens pretty often. Being a 32nd degree is something that can, reasonably, happen within your first week in Freemasonry if you work hard to schedule things that way. No, really. It's just a title, like any other, and some jurisdictions give it away like candy. Others take time to convey what it means and what the symbolism behind those degrees mean. If both you and he were telling the truth up to this point in your story, then he clearly had not learned what it meant to be Scottish Rite Mason. Part of being that is a compassion for all mankind, and feeding you this silly story would exhibit exactly the opposite.

       Keep your chin up. Thanks for relaying the info. I can accept your story without the need to believe it or discredit it. I will use the info in my own life as necessary. For the record, I had this happen to me once. It was a bum on the bus in Dallas. He told me lots of things about the Clintons' drug operation (very specific details) including that he was ex-CIA. A few months later, the book "The Clinton Chronicles" came out and verified his info. Really freaked me out.

       Whether you believe it or not is of no consequence to me. I know what happened, if you don't believe it then that's your choice, I knew I would get criticism when I posted this and I'm okay with it.
