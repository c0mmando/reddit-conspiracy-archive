       The something big is when Trump takes office and the US is deliberately crashed. Globalists are doing everything they can to salvage this project they've worked on, and if they can't prevent Trump from taking office, they'll crash the economy and blame him (shouldn't be hard considering they own the fed) and the media will talk about it nonstop.

       Unfortunately I don't share your enthusiasm that Trump is the real deal, that he truly means what he says. I think his campaign was a cleverly orchestrated psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example: on the very same Thanksgiving weekend two things happened. 1) The American public was bombarded with a poster saying "Clinton, the most corrupt candidate ever" (under the pretense Trump is judeophobic, a claim no sensible human/animal/plant can possibly believe) and 2) Comey came out and said, in substance, "Clinton is a criminal but we won't be pursuing her".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, Clinton needs to hang. But if you're going to build a super-hero, you need a super-villain (and one she is indeed). That's storytelling 101.

       I hope I'm wrong.

       I understand what you're saying, but I wouldn't call my position "enthusiastic" towards Trump. I am enthusiastic towards things coming to light, I do believe that will happen. I don't know how controlled Trump and his cabinet are, but I'd venture to say they're the least controlled perhaps since JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of fight the establishment continues to give him gives me some hope. If they were ok with him winning, it would have ended- but it hasn't. I think currently, the establishment is really directionless and puzzled as to what to do next short of "set the whole place on fire" after 1/20. I could certainly be wrong, we will find out.

       The sources that I've been watching has been saying that he's going to get assassinated the day after his inauguration. Another claimer is saying that Obama will put Marshall law in place so he can still be president for a third term. I feel like the first option is more attainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Murphy, you are right. Trump is part of the NWO. He's in a position where you are appointed by the illuminati. He would have never got "elected" if they didn't want him their. Hence, he's part of the game and he's just "playing" along.

       Okay so let me play devil's advocate about you saying that he's part of the NWO... If he was really "chosen" why would they be making such a fuss trying to get him out of the position and to destroy all credibility? I am cautiously optimistic about Trump, yet still hesitant to jump on the Trump Train but I have to admit that the response after the election made me think that he's not an Illuminati puppet... I think he's the Illuminati's biggest threat they've ever dealt with and they know the NWO will not happen (or will be much harder/take longer) if he's in power.

       Well think about it. If you are trying to manipulate a country to follow your ideology, you have to "throw us a bone" once in awhile to keep giving us the illusion. He's like a JFK in our time, even though I believe he was part of it as well. We all see him as our savior, but he's just a false flag. Even if he was good, eight years is not enough to make a dent or get rid of these cultists.
Another opinion I have is to divide and conquer it's people. Have you watched the "news" during the election? All this racism, Muslim problems, phobias, SJW's and on top all these fake terrorists or violent acts are hoaxes to divide. Half the country is still with clinton and the other with trump. We will be killing each other before we destroy the real enemy.

       You're definitely right about the divide and conquer.. We're a lot easier to control when we're fighting each other instead of big brother. And I know that it's possible he's another false flag, but I guess I'm just hoping that maybe there's actually still a chance for us to come back from the destruction already caused by the NWO... I would rather hold onto my last bit of hope and wait to see what happens than jump to conclusions and assume that he's just furthering the illuminati's ultimate goals, as naive as that may be. And I think if he really isn't a puppet, 8 years is enough time for him to put a huge dent in public opinion on the truth about our politicians and the sick shit they're into, which would be better than nothing.

       Trump isn't the real deal. Anyone in the government is working against us. Also, he just became president, the illuminati wouldn't have put him their if he was against the NWO. Plain and simple. Your not wrong btw and I think you know it as well.

       I think you both are kinda right. Trump is a puppet controlled by the same folks who control Clinton. But he was also brought in to crash the economy. The way the majority will embrace fascism is not through racistly scapegoating a minority - as has worked in the past. The majority will embrace it through politically correctness - ie: enter swj's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump - a 'republican' continually labeled as an idiot, racist, sexist, buffoon; will 'be in charge' when the economy crashes. It will be an actual crash as opposed to the recent bubble pops. People then have this idiot, racist, sexist, baffoon, to point at as the reason. The people previously opposed to the republicans have something to point at - to say 'see, I fuckin atodaso'. The republicans supporters will be at a cross road - say 'dang, maybe we were wrong' or they'll dig in and blame a leftist conspiracy. The majority will be hurting so much from the crash that they will choose the first path. Once they make the active choice to switch their 'allegiance' - the propaganda they have previously ardently rejected will begin to effect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       End result - loss of individual and property rights as well as self responsibility in the name of the common good. More control and less checks to it.

      <p>
       The way of the world is balance or completely one sided. This is an attempt to get people to accept and embrace it becoming one sided.

       All the Fed has to do is raise interest rates above 2-3% - that's only a handful of "small" hikes (and they've signaled recently they are interested in increasing the pace of rate hikes). This will cause the US debt payments to increase to a point where the debt is unmanageable. This will cause the US to have to significantly raise taxes, or reduce outlays, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only way to "fix" that situation will be to keep the Fed's books closed (forever most likely), have the Fed buy the shit out of US Treasuries, then have the Fed forgive the debt. Surely they will demand
       <em>
        SOMETHING
       </em>
       for their trouble.

       The FR  (Federal Reserve) was the worst thing that could happen to America, no on planet earth actually. How do you think the financial crisis happened back in 08? I'm pretty sure it goes deeper but that's me just generalizing it. There's a FR in every country and their all one in the same.

       It's because of gradualism that we don't see the "big things" happening in real time. These are implemented over very long periods. People have to be conditioned to accept things first, which is done bit by bit, until they turn around and their individual freedoms are gone, their philosophies have been poisoned, their rights have been abdicated... all in the name of "democracy," "safety," "the public good," and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Restrict just one personal choice, one type of gun, one medical choice or right over your own body, one financial freedom... just one at a time, very slowly, all touted as "for our own good" and after a while, there are no rights left, all surrendered voluntarily.

       I look at the next financial crisis like this: The next one is going to be worse than the last one, but literally the whole economic system is depending on STOPPING the crisis from happening even though it's only coming
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       the economic system is set up like it is. So who knows, perhaps someone will fuck up and trigger it, or perhaps they won't and a few more years will pass, raising the stakes.

       Did anyone here actually read the articles in these links before posting? All i see are refences to the "safety of the world" and the "order" and "peace" of the post ww2 era. To the average sheep who doesnt look at this sub they are witnessing the intentional grasping hold of a phrase and repurposing its colloquial meaning as they did with "fake news" but, to that sheep its just that new term tossed around like "fake news" would be
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       to them. Then those who support trump will see this too, as well as all else were being shown that causes people to still believe trump hasnt sold out,and in the back of their heads think "ER MAH GAWD, KEEP AT IT TRUMP" painting the image hes still the people champion. Cmon...

       people here just see "new world order" and associate it with satanic Illuminati without realizing that its already a very established popular term in politics that carries different connotations. the first article OP linked though is very appropriate to his point. the second and third seem to be articles attempting to define the Trump transition as the new, new world order, which in certain ways does apply but not in the sense of what the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       It is hard for me to comprehend the life we know on Earth is controlled by a couple powerful people at the helm - not surprising to say the least. It really does feel like John Mccaine is implying a little wrinkle was thrown into the plan. He might be one of the most senile republicans, but I don't doubt for a second he has seen/been a part of some messed up shit.

       It's because of gradualism that we don't see the "big things" happening in real time. These are implemented over very long periods. People have to be conditioned to accept things first, which is done bit by bit, until they turn around and their individual freedoms are gone, their philosophies have been poisoned, their rights have been abdicated... all in the name of "democracy," "safety," "the public good," and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Restrict just one personal choice, one type of gun, one medical choice or right over your own body, one financial freedom... just one at a time, very slowly, all touted as "for our own good" and after a while, there are no rights left, all surrendered voluntarily.

       I look at the next financial crisis like this: The next one is going to be worse than the last one, but literally the whole economic system is depending on STOPPING the crisis from happening even though it's only coming
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       the economic system is set up like it is. So who knows, perhaps someone will fuck up and trigger it, or perhaps they won't and a few more years will pass, raising the stakes.
