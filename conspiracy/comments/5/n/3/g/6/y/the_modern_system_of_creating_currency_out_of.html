       As long as people keep looking externally for wealth, the privately-owned Babylonian Money-Magic Slave System will be back again and again and again, in different guises…
      </p>
      <p>
       Law No. 7 of the Great Hammurabi is evidence of the knowledge and previous existence of the corruptive practice of issuing false receipts/currency supposedly against silver or gold held in safe-keeping. Law No. 7 was created to prevent this practice, and its penalty was death.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The severity of the penalty and the placing of the law so high in the code leaves little doubt that it was directed against an evil that was by no means new…” – The Babylonian Woe by David Astle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Babylonian Money Magic Slave System is usually introduced into a population either forcefully by military might, or by trickery and sleight of hand, or both, using facilities such as The Economic Hitmen (EHMs).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing “modern” or “natural” or “required” about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a source of wealth; it is a system of governance of the masses by a private few.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was built to transfer real wealth, real time, real assets, real power, real labour, real freedom… from you to it’s owners, in exchange for worthless paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why it was built. Not to serve you; but to serve them, the private owners of this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without you agreeing collectively to it, they don’t have that power!
      </p>
      <p>
       For from the creation of credit out of nothing and issuing it to you via a “game of confidence”, their wealth, freedom, power and control is produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, there is never enough money in circulation as there is debt, hence scarcity is in-built, scarcity becomes the order of the day under this system, a false sense of scarcity created to generate control and limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They take your real wealth (time and freedom)…
in exchange for fiat currency (papers and computer numbers),…
and don’t give you any real money (gold and silver).
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of system is a System of Governance; it is not a source of wealth.
      </p>

       If we'd hit critical mass of adoption, it would replace fiat. It's better in so many ways. We'd then have a economic renaissance. The parasites that create fiat would be cut off and our energy would come back to us. In short, our money would go farther, just like we have more physical stamina when we aren't carrying tapeworms.

       Currency is really nothing more than a convenient way to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. No modern society can function without currency. If one were to start a country one of the first things you'd do is create a currency for use by your citizens. In that sense it belongs to the people of a given country and should be created by and for the people of a country…interest free.

       Yes.

      <p>
       Except, "real money(gold and silver)".
      </p>
      <p>
       Fiat currency isn't defined by "paper and computer numbers", it's defined by a government forcing it's usage.

       No money is "real".  Money only exists because people believe in it.

       Thing is do we actually know proven reserves of gold? Have you read about the secret gold of the dragon family? Really interesting. Speculates there's maybe thousands times more than proven gold reserves
      </p>
      <p>
       If true that would make all holdings worthless
      </p>
      <p>
       Further more in a SHTF situation of collapse what are we supposed to do with our gold? Show someone a slab and you'll get murdered
      </p>
      <p>
       Even having coins like kruggerand would probaby get you killed. If not they'd at least be too valuable to exchange for shit like 1-2 weeks worth of food
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that for gold to be of use it would imply there's order in society. Probably best to invest in underground bunkers with food and supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shame there's no room for that in European countries. I'm guessing only if you live somewhere remote in America you could get away with building it and not having to inform/ register it with gov
