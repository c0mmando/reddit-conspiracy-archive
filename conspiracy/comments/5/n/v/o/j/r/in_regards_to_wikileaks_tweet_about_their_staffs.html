       They have since tweeted 3 important tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first is requesting information on the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second is a clip of Ron Paul discussing if Donald Trump reforming the CIA will fix the CIA or end Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third is the clip of Chuck Schumer saying if you take on the CIA they have "6 ways to Sunday to get back at you".
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems pretty clear who Wikileaks is either dealing with or worried about.

       "The maintenance of a coup".  The coup in the cia happened on 9/11 with the cog plan activation...obama continued bush's policies and expanded them, along with the CIA's power.  Some believe Trump wants to curtail or disrupt that power and restore the justice system and take away their 'unlimited criminality'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in essence, this is a death-drive of Obama's and his masters to maintain this cloaked 'state of emergency' / covert martial law situation of the COG whereas Trump may want to dismantle it.  It's not clear yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is clear is Obama thinks Trump will... So Obama, Hillary, the 7th floor group (ie: CIA globalist subverts) are trying their level best to divide the country through propaganda, distracting them from Syria, Yemen and Pakistan, Eastern Europe and Turkey (Saud pipeline / ratline issues coordinated by oiligarchs including Clinton Foundation), hoping to de-legitimize Trump's presidency, possibly to murder Trump (and Pence), and ensure that Obama continues an infinite term thereafter..
      </p>
      <p>
       If that happens, they will have maintained COG and we'll be under 'truer' martial law
      </p>

       Absolutely no idea sorry. Its WL so will have to do with leaking, but if they're stating that none of them have illnesses that would cause them to suddenly die, I'd say its big. They're making sure people know this so if anything happens right after the drop info, we'll know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say it's bound to be about either Clinton / Trump / CIA / US Military. Honestly leaning more towards CIA. I know they've released some pretty bad shit about Clinton and the Military before without expressing concern for their safety - eg the email server / podesta emails and the collateral damage video. So for me that narrows it to Trump or the CIA. I doubt they'd be that frightened about Trump as he seems somewhat on their side about certain topics, and i don't know if he has it in him to take them down like that and successfully hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sooo my prediction is theres going to be some really juicy CIA info dropped very soon. Most likely relating to the shit they're doing in the Middle East.

       He's either going to fall in line with the Shadow Government / Bankers / 3 letter agencies etc, or he will get run the fuck over.  This is going to be very interesting.  The drama is going to come from so many sides, it'll be hard to keep up with it all.  His idiotic tweeting alone is hard to keep up with.  The comedy shows are probably shitting themselves with cognitive dissonance from the plethora of content at the expense of the poor American public that will inevitably get fucked over by this administration.

       Seems like anew advertisement to me.  I got pretty turned off by assange selling his book instead of providing proof of life.  I was worried about him- I spent brain calories on it.  I appreciate their work but won't buy into the hype again.  Put up or shut up I say.

       This didn't start yesterday.

      <p>
       Fascism is the merging of the corporation with the state, but that also implies the mafia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Fascism the mafia can't exist because there are no civil rights, the government just finds them out immediately and takes them over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, the mob runs it's own candidates as with Trump and Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illusion being that Trump or Putin care about crime in the country, they only care about who is their friend and how things look.   Otherwise whatever gives them more money and power is what they are going to do, the pattern is unmistakeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's clear to me is that there are a lot of people in the FBI and CIA who don't want to be in the mob but who are being forced to look the other way and threatened with being suicided etc.

       You seriously think Trump is the mob? I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm certainly open to evidence that it may be otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he is, that sets up a really strange dynamic, because I'm pretty much convinced that the huge following that he has gathered up around him are mostly good people who are opposed to organized crime.

       That someone like Trump who works for casino's would have no mob connections is insane, it's immensely stupid that people voted for him thinking he would fight corruption.

       There is no direct evidence that DT is with the mob, but it's a looks like a duck, talks like a duck, hangs out with ducks with construction company ducks and other corrupt politician ducks and puts ducks from goldman sachs in his cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That he isn't a duck is a really silly statement, like for the last 30 years Donald Trump has turned down every offer of help from the mafia(except the russian one, which he owes 500 million to) is about the same as saying he has never tried cocaine or sexually assaulted a woman.

       I thought that too, until Trump became President. Trump makes Jimmy Carter look like a friend to the Agency. If what I've always believed to be true about JFK's death is anywhere close to true, there's no way Trump will be allowed anything but the most horrifying fall from grace in world history. If he ends up serving a full four years, however, then maybe Oswald really did act alone.

       You know, only a minority of people swallowed the spew about 9/11. Most people, (whether they admit it or not), are sure that it was an inside job, a false flag, or at least not what it's advertised to be.

       If they kill Trump, they would also have to shut down the Internet immediately afterward, or at least round up all free-thinkers who are capable of a citizen investigation and reporting their findings on the web, very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       They shut down the Internet in Egypt during the Arab Spring, and it backfired on them. Once cyberspace was closed off from them, they invaded realspace. Protests moved to the street, where they could no longer be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a more realistic scenario: the U.S. financial position has not changed since the election, (of course). The fate of the country's finances is still in private hands. An economic collapse can still be engineered by the CIA / Wall Street. The subsequent suffering can be blamed on convenient scapegoats. And that means ... you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it really is Trump vs. the CIA, I hope and pray that you fellas fighting for the home team stay safe. We could be on the cusp of a very bright future, or a horribly tragic dystopia.

       I wouldn't say most people re 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on what you mean by "not what it was advertised to be." On day two following 9/11, I started considering whether it was possible that there was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent years skeptically looking at both the Truther side and the government story, and I still believe the damage done to the buildings that day was done by jets smashing into buildings including the Pentagon, as planned by jihadists (operating with the help of
       <em>
        elements
       </em>
       of Pakistani intelligence, perhaps).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm open to questions like: did we shoot down United 93? Was there any foreknowledge of the attack among any
       <em>
        elements
       </em>
       in US or Israeli intelligence?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I've always had with the Truther (and most politically controversial movements) is the signal/noise ratio. 95% plus of my hours researching felt wasted. I'd move through a long list of "facts" and just find that one after the other was easily explained or, at best, ambiguous. I'd go to the WTC on at least one Saturday per month for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       to talk to the guys there and over and over again would see them handing out the same debunked bullshit. They'd often end up yelling at me and inevitably at least someone (not the majority, but someone) each day would start screaming about me being a secret Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to be open minded still but given my history with this It's just really hard to allocate a lot of time to further research because when I do look again it's usually the same old story. 10% of stuff that's hard to explain and 90% utter bullshit or subjective interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is that I am a person who thought looking into this was valuable and am a generally very skeptical person who tries to be open minded and I'm absolutely open to a followup investigation but I think the general narrative (not every specific detail) of the official story is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the average person even thinks about 9/11 research and I seriously seriously doubt that "most" people doubt the (general thrust) of the official story.

       Mmh...I wonder who has privileged access to Trump
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       also used to be part of an organization that was directly opposed to the CIA, and likely studied them for years?

       What are the current internet betting odds on Trump not finishing his first term? I might want to place a bet...

       This seriously needs more attention, even if you're vehemently anti-Trump you can still likely concede that the last thing this country needs now is presidential blood spilled. I hesitate to suggest this, but this really ought to propagate to places like voat and the chans. As important as Wikileaks initial tweet was, these follow ups are too telling not to spread alongside it.

       Maybe he's worried his handlers have no further use for him and now view him as a liability?

       Hard to say why the CIA would want to kill him or capture him at all since the taint of Russia has likely hurt their effectiveness going forward.

       I do see where WikiLeaks is coming from, but I feel like they're underplaying the mortality of themselves. Steve Irwin getting stung in the heart was not an underlying health condition, and neither are car accidents, most heart attacks and strokes, fires, drowning, or even just straight up being murdered. However, the CIA does shady shit so it's right on WikiLeaks for putting that first tweet out there.

       The CIA wants a new cold war with Russia, and they are going to force Trump to do what they want, just as they forced Carter to finally fund death squads in Central America during his administration. I expect them to win this battle fast.

       You guys also realize that the CIA is also a big agency as well. People in there are also for and against the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       People disagree with one another all the time, not everyone in the CIA or NSA is out to get you. A lot of them do great things for this country behind the scenes as well for little to no recognition.

      <p>
       They aren't just some homogeneous mass that's out to kill everyone close to the "truth." It's a lot more complicated than that.
