       In OPs defense, majority of what people are posting against Senor Trump are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Conspiracy theories propagated by the MSM, such as the Russian collusion and pissgate, etc.
2) "OMG! Look he's just like HRC" posts regarding his selection of Goldman Sucks affiliates. This is concerning but is not a conspiracy. It's a fact. If someone wants to write a post concerning their theory Trump was a bold faced liar who baited the conspiracy crowd into voting for him, that would be more of a conspiracy. 
I agree that until Trump gets into office and starts dealing with the real shit we won't be able to tell how much lying he was doing.
3) a BUNCH of fucking whiny posts about why people aren't up Trumps ass as much as they are HRCs. These are just shit stirring posts that ARE annoying as fuck.

       As someone who fought hard against Hillary and am now fighting hard against Trump, I think it would be awesome if people would stop taking sides and stop calling people shills for posting facts that don't jibe with their pollyanna narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that people are refusing to look at the intelligence available because they're afraid of what they'll see. Ultimately, it doesn't matter - because what power do we have if he's charged or not charged with treason - but why not be informed? Why shut our eyes to the data that's out there? A lot of Trump fanatics I know won't even read his Twitter feed 'cause they can't handle it, and they're self-censoring - a real loss as they're definitely keeping themselves away from some really meaty conspiracies .

       Sucking up to power never ends well, no matter who's in power.

       No need for non stop attacks and downvotsd evert time Trump is brought up. Just this week he called CNN fake news and is going to investigate the vaccine industry. Also take on the pharmaceutical industry when he repeals and replaces obamacare maybe as soon as the first week in office.  And he's taking the deep state head on!
      </p>

       How can anyone shit on that? He plans to do more positive change in the first than the last two presidents combined. You want hope and change until you actually get it

       If Trump actually does accomplish some of what he wants, then great; I'm on board. And I'm willing to give him some time to try and do it, but I'm not going to jump on board for something that looks too good to be true, because nine times out of ten, it is.

       I think it's too early to say whether Trump will be net positive or negative. I think the left is still attacking the strawman they built up for him during the campaign, and I think many on the right, or more accurately the "conspiracy" side, are giving him a bit too much of a free pass.

       Maybe in this sub, but in general, conspiracy theorists are skeptics at heart. They don't tend to be worshipful about
       <em>

       celebrities, business leaders, or politicians. A lot of us were awake to the deep corruption in society before Trump stuck his name on his first hotel.

       If his supporters admire him, fine. Different people look for different things in leaders. That's democracy. But get off your knees and at least hold him to some standards.

       After Bernie conceded, the only two major subreddits (over 100k subscribers) where you were still allowed to criticize Hillary were
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       and
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">

       <em>
        literally no other big subreddits where you have these discussions
       </em>
       . Reddit deliberately isolated the Trump supporters into two subreddits, and now they have the gall to complain that Trump support in

       is too concentrated.

       Most conspiracy theorists are trump supporters? A poll of you and your buddies isn't very accurate. If you honestly think after watching one insider after another stroll into his cabinet that he's going to do anything contrary to what the deep state intelligence beauracrats (who by the way have no term limits) want him to do you're almost certainly fooling yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I understand if you bought his campaign rhetoric and you still have hope (like those who bought into Obama's hope), but come the 20th and the following months I'm curious how you'll react to trump suddenly turning on Russia as has been the plan all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me I want nothing more than to watch this NATO buildup in the Balkans and the Baltic states come to an immediate halt but I just don't see it. Remind me if it happens and you'll find I have some good things to say about trump but until then...
