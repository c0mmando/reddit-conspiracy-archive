    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Trump, who is not yet in office, has done a wonderful job.</p>

<p>He stroked the ego of Duterte in the Philippines who has been engaged in a war without law against sick people, drug users and anyone else who opposes him.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly threatened China and has used Taiwan as a pawn in his little battle.</p>

<p>Trump has been jacking off Putin in Russia, who is not a friend of anyone not named Putin. And never mind that Trump may well be a puppet of Putins. That remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Trump has threatened trade wars with our most valuable trade partners, including Mexico, China, the EU, Canada, and many others.</p>

<p>Trump has poured gasoline on the Middle East by promising to move the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Trump has appointed, or is trying to appoint, a never-ending stream of Goldman Sachs bankers to his cabinet.</p>

<p>Trump has directly threatened the First Amendment by calling for restrictions on the media. And by calling out individual reporters and news organizations. And denying access just because he can.</p>

<p>Trump has threatened, and is carrying through with, removing the medical insurance of millions.</p>

<p>Trump appointed a climate denier to head the EPA. A man who has promised he would DISMANTLE the EPA.</p>

<p>Same with Education.</p>

<p>And Energy.</p>

<p>And HUD.</p>

<p>Trump has threatened to withdraw the USA from the United Nations.</p>

<p>Trump has threatened NATO.</p>

<p>Is that enough yet?</p>

<p>Trump most definitely HAS done things that affect me. And my family. My son is at the age where a draft would call him first. I will NOT see my son drafted to fight Trump&#39;s Ego Wars in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or anywhere else.</p>

<p>Let me reverse this question. What has TRUMP done that has BENEFITED YOU?</p>

<p>Please share the rewards you are reaping, personally. Not some BS Make America Sick Again Slogan. The real deal, what has he done for you so far?</p>

<p>And don&#39;t give me that &#39;he&#39;s not in office yet&#39; crap. You didn&#39;t afford me that excuse, and I offer none of it to you.</p>

<p>Please educate us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the &#39;he isn&#39;t in office yet&#39; reply.</p>

<p>I know it well. He has threatened all these things. And is appointing people who promise to carry out the threats.</p>

<p>That is certainly cause for concern.</p>

<p>If a man says to you, &quot;I AM coming to kill you and your family in two weeks,&quot; would you simply say &quot;Well, hehe, he hasn&#39;t done it YET. So there is nothing to worry about&quot;?</p>

<p>Or would you be concerned and prepare, take precautions?</p>

<p>The man has made very loud and repeated threats against many people, media, organizations, and nations. Should we disregard his words? That would make him a liar.</p>

<p>How could you support a liar?</p>

<p>And if his words are true, if he means them, then we should all prepare.</p>

<p>Is the man&#39;s word not good enough for you?</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s word is good enough for me.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with Trump? He has been sued for dodgy business practices and fraud more than 4,600 times. He has been made bankrupt six times, and got bailed out by the Chinese banks and the Russian Mob, who he remains deeply indebted to. He is as compromised as a person could be. He is everything the Christian right despises.... a wife cheating, lying, thieving, whore-mongering hypocrite. And y&#39;all love him for it. Wait till you realise how far under the bus he threw you the minute the election was over.</p>
