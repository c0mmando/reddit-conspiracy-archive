<p>You guys posting &quot;The_Donald 2.0&quot; are just as bad as the blatantly pro Trump propaganda posters.</p>

<p>All I see now on this sub is constant bitching about how one side or the other is taking over.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I think those of you spamming that &quot;this is T_D 2.0&quot; came here from the main pages of this rotten site to push your own bullshit onto the normal frequenters of this page.</p>

<p>And to those spamming blatantly Trump biased crap <strong>THAT ISN&#39;T ACTUALLY A CONSPIRACY OR THOUGHT</strong>, you&#39;re giving actual well-reasoned Trump supporters a bad name.</p>

<p>Fleeing this sub isn&#39;t the thing to do.  That will split our discussion into partisan sides.  We need to be above that.</p>

<p>During one of my searches through information warfare documents I came across the strange strategy of making an enemy search down a seemingly endless path of misinformation. </p>

<p>Information warfare works as an internet strategy according to war college documents by having people chase the white rabbit around the endless maze of disinformation so that they can&#39;t even tell what is true anymore.</p>

<p>Pedophiles who have blackmail material on all the other pedophiles in their clique. They fight between themselves but never in such a way as to expose the whole group to danger. So for example they might whack Rockfellers son on his 99th birthday as payback for something, but they wouldn&#39;t expose Rockfeller as a pedophile. Get it?</p>

<p>Bush was the same, Obama is Bush 2.0 with a better face. Is probably a pedo himself, who knows. His daddy was involved in the Franklin Cover-up, we know he&#39;s all kinds of fucked-up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Bushes are definately a pedo. Some evidence Obama was a victim of pedophilia (his poem about sugar daddy or something) and that he is homosexual.

<p>Sound familiar:
<em>The accuser—who used the name Katie Johnson to file a lawsuit in Manhattan Federal Court—alleges the Republican presidential nominee raped her in the summer of 1994, when she was 13, while attending a sex party at the New York City mansion of notorious pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The claim was basically a repeat of her earlier lawsuit, filed in California in May without legal representation, which was dismissed on procedural grounds for failing to make a claim under an applicable statute.</em></p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem like the allegations had much legs... <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/21/trump-rape-accusers-turn-on-each-other.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/21/trump-rape-accusers-turn-on-each-other.html</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal r/conspiracy rules of thumb:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Upvote the dissent. If you see unpopular opinions being quashed by votes, fight against it. Suspend your personal beliefs, upvote anyone who is contributing. If you feel like downvoting something because to you it is obviously wrong, instead upvote it and then present the best rebuttal you can. </p></li>
<li><p>Question everything. No article, source, or belief is above reproach. Beware people with blanket dismissals or blanket approvals. Take them as a red flag and investigate what they are trying to play up/down. Do not sit around arguing, investigate instead to better inform yourself and the sub. </p></li>
<li><p>Downvote pro-articles. This is a judgement call, but in most cases I agree with it. r/conspiracy should be anti-everything, because we should be critical of everything. We should be digging into everything. We are not on your side. We are not soldiers in your war. We are the spotlight to expose ALL corners.</p></li>
<li><p>Downvote anything non-conspiratorial. There are too many posts recently grinding a political axe with no conspiracy involved. We are about uncovering conspiracies, not waging political wars. Many of us do not fall on typical Right/Left sides of these arguments anyway. Bring your microscope, and leave the hatchet at home.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a good case. Do not simply spout popular beliefs for upvotes, this is what echo-chambers do. Cite sources, refrain from personal attacks, most of all question your own beliefs. When we fill our discourse with evidence rather than opinion, this place becomes a great resource for informing others of our discoveries.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did it take you up until now for you to be concerned about Trump? Didn&#39;t you see through his BS when he groveled at the feet of AIPAC during his campaign? He trashes Mexico, which is America&#39;s neighbor, but gives unconditional support to Israel, which is on the other side of the Earth, just because his daughter has converted to Judaism and his grand-kids are part Jewish. He is bought and sold by the Jews. Period. His puppet masters are Israel and Goldman Sachs. So, that&#39;s it in a  nutshell. Now, we just have to wait and see what &quot;fun&quot; is in store for America. Maybe, just maybe, Trump has told the Jews &quot;Look, I&#39;ll give you whatever you want, just let me make America great again!&quot;</p>

<p>Recently, in an unprecedented move, a highly upvoted thread on a current and popular conspiracy was tagged then deleted due to clear political bias.  We are in a situation where we can&#39;t talk about a conspiracy on the conspiracy subreddit.  There&#39;s obviously a moderation problem that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><em>Of course</em> there were a lot of outsiders here.  This conspiracy had a different and wider audience than the usual crowd here.  And <em>of course</em> many were from politics.  This is relevant to their interests.  People came to the conspiracy sub to discuss a conspiracy.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s there for.  It wasn&#39;t a &quot;brigade&quot;</p>

<p>Also, the post was tagged as &quot;unverified allegations&quot; before it was tagged as a &quot;hoax/raid&quot;.  Political bias by mods was clear before the &quot;brigade&quot; excuse was used to shut it down completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have no proof of this occurring?</p>

<p>If there was some &quot;organized attack&quot;, as a regular poster there, I wasn&#39;t aware of it.  I came here independently of my own volition.  Which I kinda thought was a perfectly normal thing to do.  It was relevant to my interests, just as it was relevant to other <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> subscribers interests.  So they likely came here on their own volition to as it was completely reasonable to expect this without there needing to be a &quot;raid&quot; angle to explain it.</p>

<p>To make a comparison - There was a disproportionate amount of T_D posters on the <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> post about the recent kidnapping.  Likewise, it was a perfectly normal thing for them to be there too.  Like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is interested in potential Trump/Russia connections, <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is interested in racism against white people.  The news thread was a natural place to go to discuss that.  The conspiracy thread was a natural place to go to discuss this.  The same situation that happened there is what happened here.  It is unfair to categorize either as &quot;raids&quot; because it&#39;s completely normal and expected thing to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s obvious because of the tactics. When people come in to a community and are openly hostile to the regular users, it&#39;s really obvious. When their short, garbage comments disparaging the community are upvoted to the stratosphere, it&#39;s really obvious. When we see Media Matters talking points scattered all over every thread, it&#39;s really obvious.  </p>

<p>Many of us watched <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> get taken over, and now we are seeing similar tactics coming into play in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  </p>

<p>In fact, the extremely high level of effort is having the opposite effect of making me <em>more</em> certain that powerful interests are trying to undermine Trump. He seems to be attempting an actual power move against the Deep State, and they are responding with increasingly desperate moves and more pervasive propaganda. I admit that I don&#39;t know for sure, and I will remain skeptical with cautious optimism until he takes office and we see his administration in action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s true, I&#39;m curious as to why <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/53h8vk/evidence_of_hillarys_it_guy_paul_combetta_asking/">this post</a> was not removed for the same reason. It&#39;s <em>the most upvoted post this subreddit&#39;s history.</em> If hitting <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in a short amount of time is how you measure brigading, this post has all the hallmarks yet it was not removed because it was a Clinton &quot;bombshell.&quot; Or what about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/53h8vk/evidence_of_hillarys_it_guy_paul_combetta_asking/">this post?</a> Second most upvoted post in history, both have three times as many upvotes as the removed post. </p>

<p>Furthermore, subreddit moderators have the ability to prevent their subreddits from appearing in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. If the moderators define &quot;brigading&quot; as hitting <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and bringing in outsiders, there is a simple check box in the settings that blocks <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> from hitting <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Surely that would be easier than outright censorship? </p>

<p>Subreddit moderators do NOT have the ability to access tangible evidence of a brigade. Moderators are not given access to IP addresses. They do not have access to HTTP referer headers, which would show how people arrived at the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post. Default subreddit mods have been asking for these tools for years and the admins sitll have yet to provide a way of detecting and blocking brigades. </p>

<p>The only conceivable thing even remotely similar to &quot;evidence&quot; they would have been able to access is hearsay which could have been planted as disinfo. </p>

<p>But that is all irrelevant because it was clearly tagged as &quot;4chan hoax and raid.&quot; One (or more) of the 18 anonymous moderators took it upon themselves to analyze the evidence and speak for the entire conspiracy community by dismissing and censoring it.  Based off of a single, unsubstantiated, anonymous /pol/ post that was later proven to be fake itself due to the new timeline. </p>

<p>The reason it went big is because CNN dropped their bombshell, then Buzzfeed dropped doco - and everyone downloaded it and lost their minds. Realized how big it would be on Reddit for discussion, because fuck, what a lot to discuss, popped the link in here and the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread popped up because we rule and it posted here first.

    <div class="md"><p>This concern trolling is getting worse than the politics.</p>

<p>Look, politics will ALWAYS be part of this sub. Elected officials are responsible for a lot of conspiracies. And a lot of people want to know which candidates are better or worse.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the Trump supporters, or the Bernie bros, ok. Just listen to the conspiracy points they&#39;re making, and move on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like things are going to turn into the Garden of Eden if we just get the politics out of here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we first start with not calling eachother libtard/shitlib/sjw and trumpet/trumpkin/trumpling? For a bunch of people who claim to not be racist or generally prejudiced, both sides like to do a lot of lumping people together into groups and then denegrading eachother. Why the division? Can&#39;t we all focus on scrutinizing the coming administration and ensuring that we do our best to expose any wrongdoing, such that no more fuckery goes down on our watch?</p>

<p>Im all for CIVIL AND OBJECTIVE DISCUSSION concerning issues, from which nothing is above examination. Nobody is perfect, and its disingenuous to assume so. Moreover, nobody agrees 100% with any political ideology, can we please stop polarizing the debate into being 100% against or 100% trump.  The world is not fucking black and white, and as soon as we make it so the elite have won. United we stand, divided we fall.</p>
