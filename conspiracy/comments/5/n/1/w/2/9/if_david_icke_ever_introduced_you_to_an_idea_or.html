<p>A good example of how ignorant the average Joe is in physics is that people still believe 2 planes dropped two towers. </p>

<p>And there are so many different flavors of your ilk... are you a satellite denier too? Planets?  Are they real?</p>

<p>Your type always drags other conspiracies in to bolster your weak ass ignorant science less nonsense. It makes one think perhaps there are ulterior motives at work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man. Your camp is the one that just blanket denies crap and just states questions as proof. No answers. No math. No data. No science. </p>

<p>Give me a break. This is laughable. </p>

<p>Pathetic trolls wanting to be edgy. Saying stupid shit to get a rise. </p>

<p>Answer this batman... have you seen the data on the measurements of our physical world. You know the heights of mountains, depths of valley and distances between them?</p>

<p>Have you? </p>

<p>Well when one compiles them all and  looks at all the data it doesn&#39;t add up with euclidian geometry. Spherical geometry however does account for the error. And guess how big that sphere is!?</p>

<p>Almost exactly as big as eratosthenes calculated 2500 years ago with much less data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Archon bit is interesting along with the gnostics, I may have to read into that myself.  I know he talks about the reptilians literally but the way I rationalize it, is that these people from ancient bloodlines may as well not be human, they have no morals, no conscience, psychopaths/sociopaths.  I liked the link he made to his optician friend saying that 4-6% had reptilian eyes and then linking that to the percentages of psycho&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was frowned upon to slaughter the bull without baiting it first as they believe the adrenaline and fear made the meat tast better.  The dogs were called butchers dogges before the term bulldog came along.  Caius mentions them in his 1576 Book &quot;of englishe dogges&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>The Archon bit is interesting along with the gnostics, I may have to read into that myself.  I know he talks about the reptilians literally but the way I rationalize it, is that these people from ancient bloodlines may as well not be human, they have no morals, no conscience, psychopaths/sociopaths.  I liked the link he made to his optician friend saying that 4-6% had reptilian eyes and then linking that to the percentages of psycho&#39;s.</p>
