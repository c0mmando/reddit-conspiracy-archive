       I'm from CT...i'm also one of you guys. Sometimes you get so deep in this kinda stuff that no matter what people say,  you think "that can't be what really happened." I saw the post not too long ago about what conspiracies you believe in and a few people brought up sandy hook. As far as false flags go, sure. Maybe it happened for a reason or maybe it was something super sketchy....but it always peaks my interest when I hear someone say no kids died. I know multiple people who are friends with people who lost their kids.....and the people I know aren't part of a big government coverup...obviously. I'm just looking for articles or website or videos that "prove" that no one died....or just Sandy Hook stuff thats very interesting in general. Just want to see where you guys are coming from.
Thanks!

       Not at all.  I'm sayin that trying to argue someone's first hand account is a moot point that results in anger, hence my downvotes.

       Saying what I said doesn't make me a holocaust denier btw for anyone that can't handle reading the word.

       I didn't say nothing weird happened. I said I want to be convinced that no kids died....or at least make an attempt. So are you going to provide me with information or are you just going to say that i'm wrong because everyone i know is a part of a coverup

       its been literally years since it's happened... iv watched my share of youtube videos and what not... the way people acted was weird. The whole crisis actor thing...thats weird. The neighbor....there are plenty of things that are out of the ordinary. I think its very possible that there was an agenda here.... that i totally believe. I'm just finding it hard to believe that no one died. Just like the marathon bombing....we all know about that. I guess what i'm saying is that I don't understand how whether kids died changes the storyline or agenda or gun grab or whatever. Whether they died or not, the endgame is still the same, no?

       To me it has never mattered (in the investigative sense) if anyone died. What matters are the innumerable inconsistencies and contradictions in the narratives and final State Police report.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one admits there are many sketchy aspects then a new investigation is warranted regardless whether one thinks anyone died.

       Things like this are very difficult to explain away

       We definitely agree on the fact that it doesn't matter if people died or not. Gotta get up early for work but i'm definitely going to read that article (its freakin long!!) and browse the site tomorrow evening. I appreciate the links!!

       It's people like you that give this a bad name. I could use a search engine...you're right...but you claim to have all the answers. You didn't read what I wrote from the beginning.

You just attacked me when what I asked for was some evidence...not because I think everyone's an idiot, but because if you've come across something I haven't. I wanted to read it.

       But on the good side there are a ton of new and curious users to this forum and they come in and see a real solid debate... some back and forth... exchanging of ideas... and thru that process they are helped to form their own opinions about the entire scenario being discussed.

       Just food for thought. I found the timing of the first Jack Reacher (JR) movie and Sandy Hook too coincidental. Sandy Hook (SH) occurred Dec 14. JR was released Dec 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opening of movie shows a sniper taking out certain people. Ok, that's not unique in most of these type of movies. So, no "red flags" go off for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I watched the whole thing and came back to a bar scene where JR is talking to a girl. Her name is Sandy. In her conversation with JR, she mentions she's not a "hooker," and infers JR is "new in town."
      </p>
      <p>
       While all these words appear coincidental in light of the Sandy Hook shooting, I still find it suspect of the timing of this type of movie and the school shooting. One things is certain. This movie was being worked on well over a year before Sandy Hook. That dialogue in the scope of this type of movie still makes me wonder if there's a connection. It's seems pretty convenient of the timing of all of this.

       Misdirection. You're on it. Look at the dollar bill right under JR's hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, something else in JR's dialogue. Girl sits down after JR comes out of his "dream state." She says, "I'm Sandy." JR goes, "So was I. Last week. On a beach." JR was released Dec 21. "Last week" would have been Dec 14, the date of the SH shootings.

       I feel like I am going to regret commenting here, but why would a government go through all the trouble of staging a mass shooting only to leave clues that could expose them in a popular film? It doesn't make any sense

       I'm not suggesting any government staged a mass shooting. I'm just observing the timing of the shootings and that movie. I find it interestingly coincidental, that's all.

       There are too many things that happened on Obama's watch that ended up with evidence being destroyed. This whole thing ended with the school being bulldozed. Bin Laden gets shot.. but then thrown into the sea? Loretta Fuddy authenticates the birth certificate.. then dies in a plane crash where nobody else dies.. just her.

       I'm really glad you posted this. Ignore all the hatred you're getting, sometimes people get so wrapped up in the idea of conspiracies that they'll believe anything. 99% of this sub is about Trump and it's beyond annoying.
