       Here's the study:
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/pdf/ehp.1104912.pdf">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/pdf/ehp.1104912.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       See table 1, scroll down a bit, then see table 1 continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       One study was at 0.8, another one at 1.8, 2, etc, and they compared them to levels at .3, 1, etc. This is as close to the levels in the US that you can get. We have water at 1 ppm, sometimes, 2, rarely up to 4. People with well water can have higher than 4, but let's just compare it to what we normally see.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll notice that they also looked at areas with like 11 ppm, and this is why the propagandist will get away with it. He's technically right, but he lied by omission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to ask, why has nobody called him out? This is not the first time I've seen people make this exact claim either. It's always brought up when this study is cited.

       Suspiciously high activity on that thread, currently first on the front page. Also, the "debunkers" are getting most of the upvotes. Maybe I'm betraying my biases, maybe I'm jumping to conclusions after having one of my (research-backed) beliefs challenged, but it seems a little out of character for r/conspiracy to come to the aid of poor, old, ever-maligned fluoride.

       You're not wrong. Normal level of upvotes on r/Conspiracy is usually around 700-1200 upvotes. If you see threads on here reaching 2000+ on the sub then you know it's being high-jacked to get up there.

       Just because the post isn't #1 or at 15,000 doesn't mean there isn't any strange manipulation with the upvoting of threads in r/Conspiracy. I just said that NORMAL threads only reach around 700-1200 upvotes at the highest with the small amount of people frequenting this sub.

       Most people on this sub aren't real conspiracy theorists. Most of them are run of the mill, plain old, big government loving, socialist redditors, the majority of whom are young children who are obsessed with believing everything they've been told. You need to go to a conspiracy website off of left-wing websites like reddit in order to get people who knows what they're talking about and aren't batshit insane, having eaten up all the propaganda that the MSM liberal world government establishment has sold them.

       I agree. Most seem to constrain their level of "giving a shit" to their personal life. They don't bother to have an informed opinion on the bigger picture and, instead of thinking freely with an objective perspective, justify their ignorance and apathy with bullshit provided by the MSM and the establishment.

       Trying to reach them and endinf in nothing but frustration and family and friends disowning me.  Even one lady I argued with for 2 hours that the FDA is bad and protects big pharma not us stopped tallong to me until one day the FDA swooped down on her network of health blogs and destroyed her business with ridiculous rules, outrageous fines and threats of incarceration.  They broke rules that aren't available to read anywhere reasonable too.
      </p>
      <p>
       She now hates the FDA and tells people what I told her but never once came to say hey... i wish I had listened or sorry etc.

       Her mentality is like most Americans Big Brother loves me and is ONLY interested in protecting me and my family.  If I don't do anything wrong I will never have a problem.

       I'm the "user" in question of this post. I'm studying to become a scientist, check my extensive (yet obviously fake) history to see for yourself. Sorry to be the one to say this but the data do not support the conclusions. Sure, maybe I went off half-cocked
       <strong>
        by jumping straight to the discussion section
       </strong>
       of the
       <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104912/">
        paper in question
       </a>
       to report ~10x from:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The exposed groups had access to drinking water with fluoride concentrations up to 11.5 mg/L (Wang SX et al. 2007); thus, in many cases concentrations were above the levels recommended (0.7–1.2 mg/L; DHHS) or allowed in public drinking water (4.0 mg/L; U.S. EPA) in the United States (U.S. EPA 2011).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Instead of summarizing
       <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ehp.1104912.t001.png">
        this table

       on a 3 inch phone in 10 minutes. That one's on me, I'll admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that still doesn't support the notion that fluoride is neurotoxic in humans at the doses used in US drinking water. Sorry to highjack your comment, at least it's not a 747 or anything.

       It's impossible to know without an experiment. However, I think at the the trace amounts found in drinking water it's unlikely fluoride would be responsible for neurotoxicity. If there were any noticeable effects I believe we would have observed them by now.

       I have a genuine question for you. How do you reconcile the fact that all fluoridated toothpastes have a warning label urging us to contact the ADA/CDC if ingested, with the same (and sometimes dangerously higher) concentration of fluoride is dosed into public water for the majority of states in the US?

       And then how does it make sense to mass dose wirh water and no control over how much people are intaking. Anyone who soaks in a bath daily gets massively more and I know a lot of kids who are encouraged to play in the bathtub every evening after a quick scrub down.

       It's in high doses of processed foods from Wheaties to Coca Cola and Lipton Tea Bags.  My dad drinks 2 gallons of iced tea a data made with those and has had symptoms of toxicity but he won't believe me.  My understanding is the fluoridated water they irrigate with and pesticides they use tainted the leaves. Organic teas are safer.

       Not sure if this really matters but I buy British brands, mostly because I think it tastes better and it's a bit stronger than American.  But I don't think they have floride in their water over there so that might be another consideration.

       Everything is a matter of dose. Too much fluoride, among a plethora of compounds including vitamin A, can be poisonous. Toothpaste contains up to 1500x the amount of fluoride found in drinking water. So if you eat multiple tubes of toothpaste it can be poisonous. That being said, the symptoms you would experience are not symptomatic of a neurotoxin, save maybe a headache. I'm not going to say it's perfectly safe, but I'm saying the study condemning it as a neurotoxin has not been substantiated.

       Please do summarize the table. I'm not a scientist, but almost every row says that the subjects in high-fluoride areas had a lower IQ than those in low-fluoride areas. According to the table, many of the test groups had "safe" levels of fluoride. I don't know how neurotoxicity is defined and I understand that other factors come into play when testing "intelligence", but, to me, that indicates an inverse correlation between fluoride level and mental acuity.

       Maybe after work I can discuss why not every study is comparable to fluoridated drinking water. The problem with most of the studies is that they don't control for other factors. For example, some examined fluorine in well water as a result of naturally occurring fluorine contamination in the ground. But it's not clear whether there could be other chemicals in the water as well that are affecting the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest holes in the studies is that they don't control for wealth. Wealth plays a much greater role in child iq and could very well explain the observations. In a poor neighborhood, they may have poor water quality. The observed iq differences could be due to wealth, poor teachers, or any number of factors other than fluorine. If somebody could demonstrate an iq difference by giving children fluorine in doses comparable to drinking water, I would personally petition my city to remove it from the water.

       Not a terrible point, but the control group is at the low end of 'acceptable' and
       <em>
        higher
       </em>
       levels that were still within the
       <em>
        allowable
       </em>
       levels were definitely lower IQ! You can only bend your truth so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, what makes you trust that 0.8mg/L is even reasonable? Just because we don't know (from this study) if 0.8mg/L is worse than 0mg/L, we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know that 3.6mg/L is worse than 0.8mg/L - and 3.6mg/L is still "acceptable" in the US per OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take a whole lot to extrapolate that information to come to a conclusion that even a dose of 0.8mg/L may not be worth the risk,
       <em>
        especially

       since there are no non-dental health benefits!!

       If we define toxicity of a chemical just by dosage and not its properties, we are being dishonest. Why? Every chemical conceivable has a small enough dosage that won't cause noticeable health effects. That amount differs from chemical to chemical, so what? Some you can swim in and consume and not be negatively affected. Others would kill you even in mall doses, but not as the dosage approaches a single molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deception is supported by the notion that some fluoride is beneficial. Lets assume it's like uranium for a moment, just for a moment damn it. How much uranium is good for you? None. Yet, at small doses, you won't even notice negative health effects. If we had a deception campaign that said uranium is good for your liver, but only at very small doses, sold by convincing medical authorities, we might swallow it just the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we know fluoride causes detectable health maladies at doses higher than we use, it is a reasonable suspicion that smaller doses could cause problems that we chronically overlook over time like arthritis. So, even though professionals say it's safe and you can't link the disease to the chemical, it doesn't mean it's good for you to be investing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further complicate matters, some chemicals are just fine in certain exposure ranges. They won't cause you problems, because your body has the means to deal with the chemical. Some chemicals the body does not excrete as well and some it barely does at all. They accumulate in the body over time. Actually, fluoride is exactly this type of chemical. It accumulates in bones and tissue. Only some of it comes out in urine.

Become aware of it damnit it is begging to be opened kind what you guys do with your brown eye except with less penetration.  Anyway your third eye is mostly shut in this society as is mine. But if you meditate and feel for it. It awakens and man the physical sensation is wild.  You might hear a loud pop or crack and you'll feel a literal vortex I between you eyes.  My vision and hearing became super acute when awakening my third eye.  So please and thank you. Focus on your third eye and not they brown eye that likes to take societies dirty dick on the reg.

       keep speaking truth, most people here are brainwashed. there is a spiritual awakening happening, cia is going to try to mass mind control people soon. i can teach you to protect yourself, i am sure they have been targetting me for a while as i have been taunting the cia online and psychologically, can say someone is actually trying to stop me from writing this right now haha. their techniques are weak once you know the truth to their power. would you like to know more?

       It sort of is, to gain the knowledge you need to want to learn it though, because it will drive you crazy otherwise. I understand if you wish to know but not learn, but I cannot help you with that.

       Ok, then tell me how much the fluoride ppm increases when you boil water to make:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Coffee and Tea
       </li>
       <li>
        Soup and stock
       </li>
       <li>
        BEER and WINE.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Those statistics will tell the real story of dosage size, and I have never ever seen them tested for fluoride.

       fluoride doesnt get removed from heating/boiling water, it only increases its potency

       Unless you boil away half of the water (which you suck at cooking if you do)  that would only double it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To increase it by 10x you'd have to boil away 90% of the water. Of course this is assuming sodium fluoride  doesn't also leave with the steam, which I don't doubt also happens.

       It was just like this over Monsanto! To get enough people awakened about the poison sprayed on the food took some massive effort from many factions! Huge cross sections really started reading and researching on their own and got activated organically...oddly enough it turned into a huge campaign!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if we could continue battling Bayer (fmr Monsanto) keep pounding away on Fluoride and Vaccine (scheds + adverse adjuvants) we can take back our health!
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW - Israel removed Fluoride from their
       <em>
        water treatment
       </em>
       in 2014 and then suddenly returned to poisoning practice in 2015!

       Does anyone else really fucking hate the terms "shill" and "normies"? They are so absurdly overused on this subreddit to describe anyone that shares a different opinion. I've been called a shill myself on this subreddit at least 20+ times by now...
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, as soon as I see the word being used by someone it almost completely discredits the person using it in my eyes. Just makes people look childish, imo, for accusing someone who disagrees with you as being part of some conspiracy to spread disinformation.

       No worries, I've been burned at the stake several times in the past on this subreddit...most recently for daring to suggest that PizzaGate lacked any solid evidence and was quickly turning into a witch hunt with the potential to destroy the lives of innocent people (like the people who worked at the pizza shop).

       Yes, it's either ignorance or an agenda when I weigh all of the "evidence" regarding pizzagate that you weigh but come to a different conclusion than you. There's no other way about it. This is the exact kind of childishness I'm referring to here...people who act like anyone who doesn't come to the same conclusions that THEY come to is either a "sheeple" or part of the conspiracy.

       So do you believe it is right to be mass dosing the population with a neurotoxin when we can't control for exposure? If so why did the government choose fluoride instead of our necessary vitamins and minerals. Or if it's for tooth health please show me a study that shows it being beneficial.

       Essential vitamins (especially lipid soluble) can be more dangerous than fluoride. I'm not advocating either way.

       , the leaked mod logs showing that admins definitely aren't above altering vote algorithms, the troubles with T_D, and especially the new voting algorithm that makes popular default sub posts even more popular.  It's becoming more and more apparent that they are really trying to tailor
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       to look "acceptable" and highly upvoted conspiracy posts don't fit into "acceptable."  It is a fact that we are the biggest alternative community on the site, and because they can't suppress all the popular posts here, they do their hardest to ridicule them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good thing is that all good and reasonable science and common sense shows that fluoridation is dubious, so they mostly resort to namecalling and strawman arguments.  I've been fighting the good fight for years and every day I see more informed people making good arguments.  Reason will eventually topple censorship and ridicule.

       That's definitely part of it. There has been a lot of bullshit articles that  always with a caveat to discredit it, that make it to r/all. Nothing substantial ever sees r/all, but when they see an opportunity to make the sub look bad, they strike hard.

       We're constantly making changes, so it's hard to tell what changes affect what, but overall I'd say we are all quite healthy and happy.   We mostly base our changes on science and other reliable sources, and of course our intuition.  Off the top of my head, some other things we avoid are sugar, television, processed ingredients, additives, food coloring, non-organic food, not enough green vegetables in diet, plastic food and drink containers, very low frequency electromagnetic radiation, most seafood (PCBs and mercury - we supplement with filtered fish oil), brands and advertising in the home, lack of sunlight, and cured meats and cheese.

       I actually have an EMF meter.  The World Health Org has a standard of no more than 2 milligauss continuous radiation.  It's actually pretty easy to avoid.  The main sources of low frequency EMF are high tension power lines, power sources in computers and appliances, large transformers, and power mains in your house.  Most places in people's houses are around or below 2 milligauss.
      </p>
      <p>
       High frequency EM radiation has not been shown to cause cancer, but has shown to heat up brain tissue and cause cognitive changes, so I don't stand next to the microwave when it's on, or hold a phone close to my head - I use earphones or the hands-free in the car.

       I'm being very serious here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you do things based on science, I say that's a bunch of hullabaloo, you're basing what you do on probably blogs or videos
      </p>
      <p>
       Your phone has, at most a 3 watt transmitter at 1400mhz but it couldn't heat anything if it tried. At its frequency and its wattage, the only thing heating your head with any measurable impact is the phone's processor waste heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your microwave runs at 2.54ghz at like 1000W oooh scary,  but you ever notice how the case is always metal or plastic on metal and has that screen? It's basically it's own Faraday cage. Almost nothing leaks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're worried about brain tissue heating up, why aren't you worried about fire, lights and the sun itself since the IR they put off directly heats things. So I hope you never leave your faraday cage home and live in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further more the sun gives off UVA and UVB and UVB is known to cause cancer due to it residing on the line of ionizing radiation.

       UV radiation is tolerated by the body in OK proportions considering we evolved to be exposed to it, and cancer is counteracted by enough vitamin D.

      <p>
       Regarding GHz radiation, have you heard of the inverse-square law?

       Your brain molecules always have been jiggling, not like your brain is at absolute zero. 
Direct heat through IR radiation is no different than any other form, your brain warming up (which it doesn't to any measurable effect) doesn't change the effects of that heat.

       That is absolutely not true, as the concentration and location of the heat makes a significant difference in its effects.  Cook one piece of chicken on a pan and another in the microwave and tell me with a straight face that they are exactly the same.

       I detest people like you that assume scientific superiority because something looks "wrong" without even trying to understanding the details or nuance of what is being said.  You didn't even take the approach of further inquiry into my knowledge or model of things before deciding to act like some kind of authority.

       It looks like you've ran into a few who would criticize you for erring on the side of caution when it comes to things like exposure etc etc.    But good on you - thanks for the interesting read.  Good food for thought

       MHz, GHz and THz are all very high frequency.  That's one million, billion, and trillion cycles per second, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you brought up terahertz, since no one else is talking about it.  But I don't think anyone is talking about it because no common household devices emit THz frequencies.  So there's no long-term exposure hazard.

       No it doesn't pass through very easily but low frequency goes right through you without even noticing you.
      </p>
      <p>
       KHz don't give a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       MHz gets somewhat reflected but not absorbed
      </p>
      <p>
       GHz starts absorbing and turns to heat but sure does like to bounce.
      </p>
      <p>
       THz absorbs at skin level.

      <p>
       PHz shit gets weird it hits every thing and destroying atoms.

       certain things, but aren't fanatics about it.  We still eat cake and pizza, and watch the occasional movie.  But it is all heavily moderated.

       Read that again. Teeth do not require fluoride in any way. From the same study you cited:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The effects of fluoride on dental enamel are well documented
[Dean and Elvolve, 1937; Fejerskov et al., 1977;
Thylstrup and Fejerskov, 1978]. At about 1 ppm fluoride
(53 ÌM) in the water supply, visible signs of fluorosis
begin to become obvious on the enamel surface as opacities,
implying some porosity in the tissue. As dose
increases, these become more obvious until at 10 ppm
(530 ÌM) or so, the porosity is such that the enamel is
physically compromised and large pieces may be fractured
from the tooth especially after eruption. The porosity
appears to derive from incomplete crystal growth such
that the normal close juxtaposition and interlocking of
crystals does not occur."

This is the condition known as dental fluorosis.

       That is discussing the effect of high doses of fluorine and how it may compromise tooth integrity at high doses. I do question why 1ppm would begin to show signs of fluorosis, I'll try to ascertain the reason for the discrepancy later.

       Unlike other hive minded subs this one doesn't follow the normal hive mentality. There is no consensus here, however you will find a lot more open dialog and opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one think vaccines are extremely ineffective and dangerous to humanity in the long term, and big pharma has shown time and time again that they CANNOT BE TRUSTED. Why anyone would decide to just blindly trust governments in collusion with the pharmaceutical industrial complex shows just how delusional the masses have become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines foster us to keep living these toxic malnourished lifestyles. If we put half the effort into eating right, drinking clean pure water, and living healthy the threat of diseases diminishes rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do many people worship and beg for these vaccines when they have no idea where they come from, what's in them, what the long term effects are, etc? A lot of people claim they know these answers, but they don't, and they really can't claim they do because it's literally impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think propaganda on vaccines is so heavy that most people are willing to put 10 times the effort into arguing for vaccination over taking responsibility for their own life and living a healthy lifestyle (which is a far more effective vaccine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting observation is that the same pro-choice neo-liberals who argue time and time again for a woman's choice to kill an infant because "it's her RIGHT ITS HER body", want to strip us all of that same right to force their untested, ineffective, and dangerous vaccines on us and our children.

       I've noticed it's a common debunking technique to say you're wrong because "x claim" then call us "doody heads" or some irrelevant name calling, then when you call them on their claim and ask for a source they'll tell you it falls on you. Except you already gave sources, of which they'll say, it's biased or not official, or outdated, and yet it's perfectly fine for them to make un sourced claims.

       Once communication breaks down and I see what they're doing it, I stop trying to be rational and just troll them with their own methods and watch the algorithms kick in and the paid votes.

       Some definite fuckery going on in that thread. I noticed it right off the bat. Later comments were getting major downvotes to keep the momentum swayed in favor of the commenter you referenced in your OP. Whoever was in charge of that overdid it because it was super obvious.

       For me the thing that seems off about flouride being added to the water is this. I'm no scientist btw, I'm not even terribly book smart, let's air that out. Anyway:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        FDA classifies flouride as a drug
       </li>
       <li>
        It's the only drug added to our water
       </li>
       <li>
        It does not make the water safer, it actually has nothing to do with the water itself
       </li>
       <li>
        It's being done against our will and for many people against their knowledge
       </li>
       <li>
        So you're taking a drug whether you like it or not - but you can never know the exact dose
       </li>
       <li>
        Not enough testing has been done on flouride
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is the reason I filter all of my drinking water. I have kids who could be possibly negatively affected by this drug. Flouride filters are not cheap. This is some straight up bullshit.

       Also, since it is a drug essentially you can't monitor the dosage by just adding it to the water supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are obsessed with getting their gallon of water intake a day or some ridiculous amount. Some others may drink a glass or two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus we are bathing in flouride water too?  I don't buy that it is added to the water supply just for our teeth.

       It's not a "propaganda" comment, it is just a common criticism of a different metadata study where people took it to mean that fluoride caused mental development drops in children, but ignored the fact that all the data was from heavily polluted Chinese children who were exposed to massive industrial pollution level fluoride.

       This has been happening for years on reddit. Fluoride and GMOs have had their shills on this site from the very start. And every time Fluoride is brought up everyone wonders who are all these people coming out to defend it.

       Doesn't matter if it's beneficial or not. It

       a drug, it

       being put into our water supply against our will. No other drugs are being added to our water supply. It does nothing to improve the quality of the water. We have no way of knowing what dose of this drug we are getting. It's actually that simple.

       Seriously? Your best evidence is a 60 year old study? And Fluoride didn't start getting added to the water supply until 6 years into their study.

       Curious if you picked that up from the You are not so smart podcast .   A lot of good gems from there.

       It looks like you've ran into a few who would criticize you for erring on the side of caution when it comes to things like exposure etc etc.    But good on you - thanks for the interesting read.  Good food for thought
