       How is it we have a full moon for 12 days now where I live? Some bullshit. I felt something was off one day and started paying attention. Supposed to be a quarter moon on the 5th, shit was fully lit. The hell is it so bright for? What's really reflecting off if it? Why is it so bright now when before it was a soft glow at best when full? Even with light pollution from the city it overpowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pictures of it shining full and bright the day before and after, directly due west over the horizon. Also have a video of it just as bright and a little fuller over the eastern horizon. Guess the sun shines through the earth as well, I'll upload it when I get home. Our sky is fucked.

       I have noticed hella full moons lately also.. However, it didn't click until I saw your post.. The other night, I saw an oddly placed illuminated spot on my balcony that I've never noticed before, the position of the full moon was lighting up my balcony like I had the light on.. I am curious if anyone else has noticed the massive amount of light reflecting off the moon lately..

       Yup that's what got me to start looking. Lighting just felt... off at night after Christmas. Normally I would chalk it up to Christmas lights, but nobody really does d them this year. But it was still so bright! Then on jan 3rd it dawned on me that it was still really bright out. So on the 4th, I snapped a picture of the moon. On the 6th, it was still in the same spot at night, 2 days later, just as big and bright. It just kept getting bigger and brighter. Then I realized I'm an idiot and just checked my calendar. Quarter moon phase. Ha! Staring with my own 2 eyes at a tangible contradiction. So now I'm asking questions looking for answers.

       Yes! Reminds me more of a fluorescent lightbulb than the moon I know. Its like old 90s orange glow headlights on cars versus ultra bright HID lamps we see today. That's how the light from the moon feels to me now.

       That is just because photos of the moon from the earth are over exposed. Digital cameras automatically average out the black/white ratio to about 18% grey unless you do some manual things to override the exposure. Think about taking a picture in front of a window. The people in the picture appear very dark and the window appears to be blown out white. When you look out the window with your eyes you can clearly see green trees or a blue sky. But in the automatically adjusted photo the window is white.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cameras are really, really bad at capturing light and exposure when compared to the human eye.

       Interesting, glass window white washes. Moon and sun now appear white washed to the naked eye, where as they used to be dull orange/brownish in the night sky. Food for thought about what our atmosphere really is now.

       You seem to misunderstand the point I am trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon appears to have this orange color you allude to when it is low in the horizon. This is due to refraction of the light through the atmosphere. The same principle as a prism splitting light into a rainbow. This (and forced perspective) are also the reason the moon appears to be bigger when it is near the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "white washing" has nothing to do with the median that the light is moving through, its the computer chips inside the camera. It would operate exactly the same way if it was an open window with no glass or if it was a screen door. It's about the difference in light intensity.

       This is a bright white moon sitting just above the horizon of the setting sun. No orange glow here like it is supposed to have. You are correct. That's the contradiction. You just verified what I should be seeing is a brownish/orange glow. This is bright white. It's also appearing smaller, not bigger. Exact opposite of what it is supposed to be. I agree 100% my camera makes it look a little brighter in a digital sense, but it was the same intensity in person. I don't disagree with anything you are saying, hence my search for what's causing this to happen. The moon right now sits much higher in the sky and looks a lot bigger. Feels backwards based on what you are saying, no? I'll take another comparison picture tonight again.

       I'm trying to be informative without being an asshole. But these pictures don't show anything and another one will not help.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your pictures CLEARLY show a moon that is not full in the second and third picture. The exposure is blown out, it is fuzzy and I can still clearly see that there is a percentage missing from the upper part relative to its positioning in the frame. A full moon does not look like an egg on its side. In these pictures it is well past "half moon" but it is still in the waxing phase. You corrected someone below when they said waning, you were right about the nomenclature. In these pictures it is waxing, next week it will be waning.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Being close to the horizon does not guarantee it will be orange, that is just one of the scenarios where you would get this color. The air is cleaner now so its color would be much less pronounced.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even if the moon was orange to the eye when you took this picture it is very likely it would still appear white in photo because it is a bright light source against a very dark background. And digital cameras are garbage for these types of photos unless you adjust for these exposure issues.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The size of the moon doesn't really change in the sky. Even during the "Super Moons" its about the same size. Just how your brain perceives the size changes.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You have likely made up your mind on what you think is happening, and I don't make a living teaching science and optics so this is the last I'll say.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is more likely?  That you are just under informed/confused on the lunar cycles or that the moon is an artificial light sourced that has been broken for weeks and you are the only one in the entire world who has noticed?

       I said it looked this intense in person (also looked white). Jan 6th picture clearly a circle. How can a full circle wax more? Jan 4th cloud drifting over top of the moon, skewed the photo slightly, but still had this odd shape in person. Go look for yourself, im not trying to convince anyone of any conclusion, I'm just crowdsourcing to gather collective data by real people with no publishing middleman to help me draw conclusions. I haven't stated or come to conclusion with scientific method to determine anything artificial yet. I just know it doesn't feel it look right. If there is a scientifically proven reason that someone could point me to for this to be occurring, I'd love to study. But as of right now, lunar science says this moon should have been halfway lit and it is full. So now i go looking for my own answer, whatever it is. Right now x =\= x

       Waning means shrinking or decreasing in illumination, this is the exact opposite of what I'm addressing and presenting with photo evidence with documented geolocation and tonestsmps. It just links to the lunar cycle calendar.

       Yeah, sorry I don't believe those images were taken of the moon on the days represented. I fly 5 days a week, mostly at night. IF there was any change in the moon, not only would I document it immediately, I would also publish my findings immediately, in order to not look like a crazy person. Anyone can inject metadata into photos, it's day one stuff....

       That was my bad waiting, I agree. Check everything you want, this is just a raw iPhone picture. Even took a screenshot of it time stamped in my phone. Check the data on the picture, I don't know how to alter these things.

       Also, the moon on the 4th should have been slightly less than half full, which it clearly isn't. Its about 95% full with a shadow spot on the top of the moon. Why a shadow up top? Nothing has been close to normal this lunar cycle. Was nobody watching?

       Then how do you explain a full moon on the 6th? Quarter moon scheduled for the 12th, I saw with my own eyes and took a photo of a full moon 6 days early. Have you ever seen that before ever? I haven't found anything about what could cause that, much less make it stay full this long. It has been full since the 4th.

       Yeah, the last couple of days, the moon has looked more like a 'light bulb in the ceiling' and
       <em>
        huge

       Yup that's what got me to start looking. Lighting just felt... off at night after Christmas. Normally I would chalk it up to Christmas lights, but nobody really does d them this year. But it was still so bright! Then on jan 3rd it dawned on me that it was still really bright out. So on the 4th, I snapped a picture of the moon. On the 6th, it was still in the same spot at night, 2 days later, just as big and bright. It just kept getting bigger and brighter. Then I realized I'm an idiot and just checked my calendar. Quarter moon phase. Ha! Staring with my own 2 eyes at a tangible contradiction. So now I'm asking questions looking for answers.
