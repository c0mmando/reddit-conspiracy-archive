        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I really mean that... It&#39;s been awesome to have a virtual community where I often feel more normal than I do when I&#39;m out in the real world. I can&#39;t talk about conspiracy theories with most of my friends or family because they&#39;ve been so conditioned to reject anything that contradicts what they&#39;ve been taught, and I end up wasting too much energy trying to get them to question their reality. I don&#39;t have to do that here, and I&#39;m so grateful for that. We have a great community despite the recent influx of shills or whatever other outside influences are at work, and I think that our work and willingness to question everything will ultimately play a huge role in shaping the future of America. </p>

<p>The government doesn&#39;t give me hope, the media doesn&#39;t give me hope, my generation of millenials gives me the opposite of hope... </p>

<p>This subreddit though? IT GIVES ME HOPE. Obviously we don&#39;t all agree on everything, but at least we are willing to question conventional thought and are skeptical of TPTB. We&#39;re part of something special, and it&#39;s been pretty cool to witness what&#39;s going on behind the scenes with all of you tin-foil hat fools ;) </p>

<p>Sorry for the sappy post but I felt like it was needed with all of the negativity that&#39;s taken over this sub. </p>

<p>Also before I get called a troll or a shill because my account is new - this is a throwaway account that I just made but I&#39;ve been following this subreddit for over a year now. </p>

<p>Whenever I see friends talking or posting shit about Syria (Omg we must help these poor trapped children!), I point them to the &quot;right&quot; material. This doesn&#39;t immediatly make them omgilluminaticonfirmed, but it does show them there is more than meets the eye.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about planting that little seed in their brain.</p>
