       I really mean that... It's been awesome to have a virtual community where I often feel more normal than I do when I'm out in the real world. I can't talk about conspiracy theories with most of my friends or family because they've been so conditioned to reject anything that contradicts what they've been taught, and I end up wasting too much energy trying to get them to question their reality. I don't have to do that here, and I'm so grateful for that. We have a great community despite the recent influx of shills or whatever other outside influences are at work, and I think that our work and willingness to question everything will ultimately play a huge role in shaping the future of America.

       The government doesn't give me hope, the media doesn't give me hope, my generation of millenials gives me the opposite of hope...
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit though? IT GIVES ME HOPE. Obviously we don't all agree on everything, but at least we are willing to question conventional thought and are skeptical of TPTB. We're part of something special, and it's been pretty cool to witness what's going on behind the scenes with all of you tin-foil hat fools ;)

      <p>
       Sorry for the sappy post but I felt like it was needed with all of the negativity that's taken over this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also before I get called a troll or a shill because my account is new - this is a throwaway account that I just made but I've been following this subreddit for over a year now.

       Don't try too hard convincing your friends/family. Give them subtle hints whenever possible.

       Whenever I see friends talking or posting shit about Syria (Omg we must help these poor trapped children!), I point them to the "right" material. This doesn't immediatly make them omgilluminaticonfirmed, but it does show them there is more than meets the eye.

       yup, you have to red-pill people a little at a time. Too much at once, and their brains natural response will be to disregard everything you're saying as utter nonsense.

       The hardest part about being
       <em>

       is that you only need to be ignorant to be in the majority. It takes a lot of reading and sifting to cut through the chemtrail and reptile BS to get to the most important things that are crippling humanity right now.
