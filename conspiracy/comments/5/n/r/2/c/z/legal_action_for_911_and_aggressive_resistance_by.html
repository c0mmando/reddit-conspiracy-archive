    <div class="md"><p>I bet there is a way for us to sue them under international laws in a court outside of the US.  That&#39;s the route I would go if I were them.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind SBB that Trump is putting in a whole new set of federal judges, and has made statements in favor of truth for 9/11, so who knows what the future may bring.  I didn&#39;t support trump or anyone once bernie was out of the picture, but I&#39;m getting more an more exicted by trump, esp recently when he gave his companies to his kids as assurance that he was in the game of president 100%.  I believe this is the total opposite of what clinton would have done.  She would have used her power to enrich clinton foundation even more, because that is what she did during haiti and with arms sales in libya to build a ratline in syria</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think alot of the anti-Trump media buzz is being planted by CIA-FBI.
Trump&#39;s nat&#39;l security advisor is former DIA Mike Flynn, who helped cover up the torture/death squads the US was training in Iraq after the invasion.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give Trump a chance, but it don&#39;t look good when he&#39;s already expanding the F-35 program and saying &quot;Yes, Yes, Yes&quot; to the generals.  (Lockheed said they&#39;re hiring 1800 more workers today.)</p>

<p>Sheehan filed his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sheehan_(attorney">highly counterproductive lawsuit</a>#Avirgan_v._Hull) against Iran-Contra figures.</p>

<p>I wonder why you would promote such misleading information.</p>

<p>prosecutor in Iran-Contra affair</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LIAR.</p>

<p>He was not a prosecutor of the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Walsh#Independent_Counsel">Iran-Contra affair</a>.</p>

<p>He filed a separate CIVIL lawsuit against people involved in Iran-Contra.  That is NOT the Iran-Contra affair.</p>

<p>Why would you want to confuse people about the two?</p>

<p>Your subject line is misleading.</p>

<p>Your defense of your subject line shows that you are  INTENTIONALLY misleading.</p>

<p>Why are you trying to conflate Daniel Sheehan with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Walsh#Independent_Counsel">Lawrence Walsh</a>?</p>

<p>Do details matter?  You seem to think not.</p>

<p>Your citation of karma points as proof of anything shows only that you are a master of Reddit, where points are bought and sold.</p>
