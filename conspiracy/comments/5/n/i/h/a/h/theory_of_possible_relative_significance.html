What would you think of wikileaks if they did have irrefutable verifiable proof of something as sinister as pizzagate and they just sit on it?

    <div class="md"><p>Struck a chord eh? I hope you can appreciate the musicality of each note. Are we not communicating on some level, are words even absolutely necessary? Believe me or not I&#39;m truly just shitting them out on the spot. Meaningless? You sure seem to be responding fairly appropriately to something completely meaningless. How would have your sentence&#39;s meaning changed if you removed the word &quot;completely?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I make it a point not to take the Internet seriously, but I appreciate the concern. Yes we are communicating on the level you are saying words at me. Whether or not those words mean anything significant...? And I truly, wholeheartedly believe you are shitting them out. On the spot? Well I can&#39;t comment if you&#39;re in a port-a-potty or not, as I have no idea.</p>

<p>What does this sentence mean? &quot;You seem to be responding fairly appropriately to something completely meaningless&quot; I get that your posts are completely meaningless, but what do you mean by &quot;appropriately&quot; in that context?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory. You try really hard to argue with someone until they have no idea what you&#39;re talking about and give up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ll attempt to answer all your questions. The first question you posed doesn&#39;t seem like a real question but I&#39;ll say maybe they are of relative significance :)</p>

<p>Second question. I&#39;ll attempt to answer it in a relative way to how I perceive you find meaning in words. Replace with &quot;Responding in a manner that is in accord to my words.&quot;</p>

<p>I help you out with that theory. I&#39;m posing questions for my own profit. I&#39;m experimenting for my own profit. If it happens to help someone else out that is an added bonus. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m so wise as to try to talk sense into anyone that seems to be your business. </p>

<p>Would this be a fair assessment on you... You belittle people to make yourself feel so big?</p>
