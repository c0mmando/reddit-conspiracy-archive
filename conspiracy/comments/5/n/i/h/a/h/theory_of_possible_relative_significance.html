       Is it utterly impossible that wikileaks is a sham? That they release just enough info to remain trusted by us skeptics but never anything too damning that would get the general population riled up. What if these folks who've been suicided and or died under suspicious circumstances fell for this possible sham? What would you think of wikileaks if they did have irrefutable verifiable proof of something as sinister as pizzagate and they just sit on it? Hell what if the whole where is assange was just him taking a vacation?

       I suppose the subtextual assumption here would be that wikileaks has published material that isn't that damaging.  That seems like a false basis for making an argument.

       Yeah that's the one I've seen floating around. Could it be that this operation is moving into a new phase? I'm just trying to promote new angles to this phenomenon called reality. Not trying to promote mistrust of everyone you meet.

       It is utterly impossible that wikileaks

       I guess I was thrown off by the word "sham"... we don't really use that here... Disinformation, PsyOp, Limited Hangout, Gatekeeper, Controlled Opposition, Hoax... those are what we usually work with for terminology.

       Don't know how to respond to that. I'm sure its a very deep field of study don't know much about it. You know I'm happy that word threw you off I think it might be a good thing throw your brain through a loop otherwise its just mechanically zipping along.

       Did you truly misunderstand what I said or did it cause you to slow down your thinking process maybe even caused you to work a little harder to comprehend? You said yourself that "sham" is what threw you off, was it a buzz word in your head and your circuitry kicked it into gear?

       I think we just had different definitions of "sham" in our heads... if you had said "limited hangout" I would have known exactly what you meant...
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/">
        /r/conspiracy/

       Interesting. Thanks for educating me. If we were to use the analogy of reading level my tech literacy would probably only be on a 6th or 7th grade reading level.

       Could that be intentional? I'm under the impression that words impart subtle depths in ones psyche regardless of how similar they may appear on the surface. I do see that your creative usage of words is at the mcCliched level.

       Struck a chord eh? I hope you can appreciate the musicality of each note. Are we not communicating on some level, are words even absolutely necessary? Believe me or not I'm truly just shitting them out on the spot. Meaningless? You sure seem to be responding fairly appropriately to something completely meaningless. How would have your sentence's meaning changed if you removed the word "completely?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways to answer your real question, "What [emotionally charged word] purpose could it serve? To discover everything you are lacking.

       I make it a point not to take the Internet seriously, but I appreciate the concern. Yes we are communicating on the level you are saying words at me. Whether or not those words mean anything significant...? And I truly, wholeheartedly believe you are shitting them out. On the spot? Well I can't comment if you're in a port-a-potty or not, as I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this sentence mean? "You seem to be responding fairly appropriately to something completely meaningless" I get that your posts are completely meaningless, but what do you mean by "appropriately" in that context?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my theory. You try really hard to argue with someone until they have no idea what you're talking about and give up.

       Well I'll attempt to answer all your questions. The first question you posed doesn't seem like a real question but I'll say maybe they are of relative significance :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Second question. I'll attempt to answer it in a relative way to how I perceive you find meaning in words. Replace with "Responding in a manner that is in accord to my words."
      </p>
      <p>
       I help you out with that theory. I'm posing questions for my own profit. I'm experimenting for my own profit. If it happens to help someone else out that is an added bonus. I don't think I'm so wise as to try to talk sense into anyone that seems to be your business.

       Would this be a fair assessment on you... You belittle people to make yourself feel so big?
