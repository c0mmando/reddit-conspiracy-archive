A sub that was once filled with like-minded intellects has corrupted. The amount of tension and hatred has also suprised me greatly. Everyone here was majorly anti-Hillary because of known crimes and all of a sudden the sub is anti-Trump because of a buzzfeed article. I see these bizarre occurrences and it is certain that they go beyond trivial things like political preference. This sub is 99% compromised and everyone here is in a state of extreme paranoia and anxiety. Only the ones who have been here for a long time know exactly that what is happening is irregular and the only options now are to either fight back for this sub or go somewhere else for discussion.</p>

<p>This post may not make any sense at all but I just wanted to vent about how I feel on this situation.</p>

<p>EDIT: Downvotes were expected as this post is not very informational and more just typing what comes to my head, all good!</p>

Included that with all the other subs like r/news, worldnews and politics. The front pages was full of this article </p>

<p>They posted the buzzfeed article (lol) then went insane with upvotes. Also upvoting all the CTR-like comments. Thousands of them came in and it was coordinated. </p>
