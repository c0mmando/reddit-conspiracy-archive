        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/djklbd.html">djklbd</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I understand why so many people have been charmed by Donald Trump. For one, he is a very charismatic character. You may disagree, however there&#39;s no denying that the man knows how to disarm people with his straightforward talk and &quot;no bullshit&quot; mannerisms. His status as a self made wealthy figure is the epitome of the American Dream, and he claims to have a vast knowledge of the mechanics of business, which we would desperately need in a president given our country&#39;s disastrous economic situation. His most appealing characteristic however, is his impression of being <strong>outside</strong> of the global elite system of control. His supporters believe that he is truly independent and could not be swayed by political persuasion. This has lured many of us in the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; into lending him out trust for the moment. After all, we were able to stop the Clinton campaign from securing a rigged election, right? We beat the system, didn&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I&#39;m here to tell you that I believe Trump is actually a carefully placed Trojan Horse, A false prophet. I&#39;m actually surprised more of us aren&#39;t immediately skeptical of this guy. We have been burned on the last how many presidents? And we&#39;re just going to put blind faith into this guy, and assume the globalists didn&#39;t have some sort of influence over this guy? You know the social engineers are going to expand and contract their narrative to trick us and lure is into a situation that is beneficial to their success in creating a world government, and it makes perfect sense that they would try to lure the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; and the conservative base toward a false prophet who has the impression of an independent, non corrupt &quot;Everyman&quot; that we can trust. Alex Jones held the fucking torch and led his supporters into pledging allegiance to him. At that point I knew something was off, because Jones used to preach that the two party system was a ruse, a scam to divide the people into two ideologies. He is now obviously controlled opposition, and it&#39;s pretty depressing because he used to be relatively legitimate. </p>

<p>This idea that the media was constantly attacking him only adds credibility to the narrative that he was an &quot;outsider&quot; and that the system didn&#39;t want him to be elected. However, he got TONS of publicity from all of those attacks and that just fueled his fanbase into a growth, because it made him look like a real threat to the system, and that earned the trust of even skeptical supporters. </p>

<p>This was all done by design folks, planned years in advance. Now, since they effectively deemed Trump and his suppprters as the face of &quot;Racist&quot; and &quot;misogynyst&quot; culture (which I&#39;ll admit, I don&#39;t believe the majority of his supporters are racist at all, they are good hardworking people who just want to believe in a political figure who is on their side and he was appealing to them), the liberal side of the spectrum is fueled with hatred against them and the stage is set for some sort of civil unrest or massive social fallout. Again, this is all being done by design, and they are going to try and lure the independent thinkers like us who don&#39;t trust the establishment and the Clintons into throwing our support behind a false prophet authoritarian puppet. You <em>really</em> think he&#39;s going to audit the federal reserve? </p>

<p>Do you <em>really</em> think he&#39;s going to investigate 9/11? Fuck no, I&#39;m sorry to say it but just appears as if this guy was simply playing a predetermined role, of a self made business man who was an outsider that would appeal to our community. <strong>And worst of all, if the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; becomes associated with Trump, it will delegitimize everything we stand for because he is demonized in so many people&#39;s minds. It will discredit our message, whether you believe he&#39;s legit or not.</strong></p>

<p>With that being said, I still believe Trump supporters have our best interests at heart and believe in what we do. They know the fed is out of control, that the monetary system is rigged, that 9/11 was staged to justify foreign wars and warrantless spying, that criminal elements have taken control of our government, and they are fucking our lives up. We need to unite and band together, but I urge you all to remain critically skeptical of Donald Trump, because I believe he may very well be a false prophet that was specifically chosen by the elite and marketed to us the way he was in an attempt to create an undercover &quot;outsider&quot; false prophet, to be used as a catylist for the impending social unrest that awaits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was able to tell as soon as I saw the media talking Trump 24/7. That&#39;s what those fuckers do. Half the time, it doesn&#39;t matter who the hell is rambling on about what on the news. All these different talking heads and pundits and &quot;political scientists&quot; and &quot;political experts&quot; blah blah ect. </p>

<p>The simple fact that the are even <em>talking</em> about the subject , and that they have all these prominent people with these degrees discussing and analyzing it on live tv, it gives it credibility, it makes it seem REAL. Even if it&#39;s all bullshit, you get 2,3 people to debate about it on Fox News and everyone thinks it&#39;s this real legitimate concerning issue with all these variable viewpoints and a left outlook and a right outlook....</p>

<p>And Trump got ALL the attention. Granted it was mainly attacks and a lot of &quot;get a load of this guy!&quot; Shit, but That&#39;s how I knew from the get go he was a puppet because he has all that publicity. And publicity is all it takes, good or bad, for the media to give the impression that a particular candidate is the front runner by giving them non stop coverage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is clear to me now. It&#39;s like I had been watching this thing in slow motion. We need to unite around one ideology. The system is trying to pin everybody against one another, they wanna go out with a bang to ensure we are all fighting one another so we can&#39;t unite to form a legitimate and organized resistance. </p>

<p>I really hope that this community does not divide over the Trump issue, because I believe that could be another angle to this. Keep in mind, trump supporters agree with the majority of us on many issues. I&#39;m just proposing that they remain skeptical as fuck, and hold him accountable if he turns out to be full of shit. You voted for him, you have a duty to keep an eye on him and hold him accountable if he strays away from his campaign promises, which frankly, we are already starting to see and will likely see more of in the future...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well because you are writing about it now. The other half of the puzzle is that the entire political fuck fest we are having doesn&#39;t matter whatsoever. And its not about controlling this or that. The nature of people is very easily keeping all eyes away from what should be seen. But honestly that path is set. 
Anyway, it was clear, at least in my opinion, that Trump never really wanted to be President. But neither was Hillary ever going to be. It has little to do with Republican or Democrat not Socialist or Fascist. You are correct though. 
Imma shut up for the moment. I want to see how the next week plays out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real question here isnt &quot;is Trump a puppet or not?&quot; since the destruction of the MSM, the establishment&#39;s propaganda arm is a clear sign that he isnt a puppet, or atleast isnt just a puppet for any wings of the present establishment.</p>

<p>The real question here is more like &quot;Is this guy got into this mess for the people, or for him and his own wing?&quot;. What u see here is the classic &quot;new side&quot; effect in the establishment. All of them pointing guns to this guy because they feel threatened, but at the same time, he clearly has somebody behind his back (probably in the FBI and the Army). So the other wings couldnt defeat him easily.</p>

<p>Also accounting that Trump probably know how the machine works in and out so he probably has the general idea how to break it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a puppet, that&#39;s what my entire post was about. No the establishment is not threatened by him, because they created him. He is the false prophet they designed and marketed to us, you are unable to see that. You think all this negative media attention on him is organic and real criticism from the establishment.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that: Why would they risk it? Why would they risk doing stuff like it when they could just pill up Bernie Sanders and get Jeb Bush/Ted Cruz on the other seat, avoid destroying their own propaganda arm, and having pretty much absolute control over everything?</p>

<p>Remember the first 2 rules when choosing someone to control: never choose someone that can bite u back, and never choose a loose canon. Trump doing something that they didnt really predicted: getting into tweeter and basically, making himself visible through something the elites never realize that it could be use in that manner. After that, there is no way the MSM can ignore him anymore, because if they choose to do it, people would just going to his tweet and basically nullified all their effort to ignore/slander him, as seen in this election. </p>

<p>The problem now isnt about he is a puppet (because he clearly knows how to bite them back), it is about what will he do after getting there and what side is he REALLY on. I already said that he isnt in any established side, but creating his own army inside the structure and expanding his influence rapidly. This isnt combat ur original point that he isnt for the people tho. But it is in a different way.</p>

<p>That said, the takedown has produced an unforseen oppotunities for the folks in here: a small window to takedown the elites while their propaganda arms are still recovering. You guys have to act fast tho.</p>
