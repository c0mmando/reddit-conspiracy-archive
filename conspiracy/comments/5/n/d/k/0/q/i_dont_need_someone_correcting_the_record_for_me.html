    <div class="md"><p>there was no evidence of vote brigading, only claims. </p>

<p>the 4chan stuff is pretty easily dismissed. none of the posts even mention the same details. one talks about a russian spy, where the actual leak came from a british one. not to mention it was posted after the mother jones article, and the reports from mccain date back to june 2016. not sure how someone from 4chan can time travel. </p>

<p>if I was a mod, I wouldnt pick and choose articles to delete, id apply it across every post evenly. not delete one thats showing trump in a bad light. </p>

<p>of course a post that hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> is gonna blow up, especially if its potentially one of the larger conspiracies of this generation. couple that with the large base that dislikes trump as well, and the users here who have seen it turn in to the_d 2.0 who are tired of any post about trump instantly being downvoted. </p>

<p>show me the evidence of vote brigading and ill concede. so far the only thing ive seen is speculation from users who think it got too many upvotes lol. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t want the truth and you don&#39;t want others to discover the truth for themselves. You want to censor everything that&#39;s not <em>you&#39;re</em> truth. Right now, the very definition of an establishment shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said I have just as much as you.  Neither of us have any direct proof of either -gate being a CIA program.  Sure we both have a long history of CIA shadiness to point to.  Both are hot topics for Dempublicans and those that believe there are two parties that hate either and are on a quest to destroy America with their signature finishing move.  </p>

<p>So anyway.  My point is not to defend either gate.  My point is that we are forced to have the conversation here.  Under a &quot;snarky&quot; headline, because the main thread was deleted.  I care as much  about Trump and Clinton as I do with the flat earth nonsense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you have any examples of Trump supporters being banned for supporting their candidate? Perhaps they were ridiculously off topic? Being abusive? Breaking one of those rules? I&#39;ve been told to change my comments by the mods here. It&#39;s fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with censorship, especially in a sub like this. However, I understand the difficult task that the mods are facing. It&#39;s clear that there&#39;s some suspicious activity underway, and I believe the mods want to protect the integrity of this sub. Was deleting that top post the right response? Probably not. I think tagging the post was more than enough. Ultimately, it should be up to us, the members, to separate the wheat from the chaff, and it makes me happy to see that so many people were calling out the suspicious activity that was unfolding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree, but if you looked through the comments on that thread it was clear there was zero genuine discussion in the top comment threads. It was bizarre. It seems like the leak of potentially fabricated info was coordinated with an effort to artificially disseminate that info on all the related reddit subs. World news, news, politics here. All the comment sections seemed heavily influenced to say the least.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think deleting the thread was the worst thing. I don&#39;t love Trump by any means. I voted for him, but i get why people who really dislike or oppose him would be concerned by the deletion. Moving forward that should not be the course of action.</p>

<p>Well they all read the same way. No legitimate discussion. Even a few common usernames.</p>

<p>It was an obvious brigade. The strange part is that I&#39;m surprised they were dumb enough to think it would work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>isn&#39;t that fucking crazy to consider. I mean these subs were hit hard. I was on one guys account who posted about 30 comments in the first hour of that story hitting the first page here in those 4 subs... He must have had about 200 comments in a day all posting the same things. Sometimes copied and pasted. Its legitimately spooky haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, their operation isnt just reddit. They were shilling 4chan and all of social media last night.</p>

<p>Realistically though, if they are paying people minimum wage, you&#39;d only need a few thousand to basically have complete control of discussion on the internet</p>
