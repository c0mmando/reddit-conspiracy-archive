Putting people down on either side, making sarcastic remarks, being snarky or pedantic is the fucking poison that&#39;s killing us. The internet is our only tool for finding the truth and I&#39;m begging everyone to pick something pick one topic one subject one event and become an expert in it. Wether it&#39;s Syria, Trumps conflicts of interest , the Clinton foundation, the DNC, the RNC whatever the fuck it is Waco, Scalia, campaign finance, MSM you get the idea anything, literally anything. Become an expert on it and build your own understanding of the event. Talk about what you find, share, post, tweet get what you find out there. We are the journalists now, the media has proven they won&#39;t do their job.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t divide yourself from anyone, I know many people here already share that sentiment but it&#39;s a feeling that needs to go mainstream. There&#39;s so much fucking misguided hate and division out there. Apart we&#39;re fucked, but if we really come together we&#39;re gonna fuck them </p>

<p>Edit: feeling*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I like sarcastic and being snarky.  Facts, research and logic have all been stuffed in the backseat, so I don&#39;t have many tools left.  America is giving up on even pretending we aren&#39;t a fascist country now.  I should be able to speak out against those who are using our openness against, to spread division and hate.  I should be able to point out hypocrisy here.  I support the free market of ideas, where any theory can be debated, upvoted or mocked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So rise above bring them back to the front seat. Don&#39;t be weak and give in just because you don&#39;t like what people are saying. You need to start saying things people can&#39;t ignore. And that&#39;s well sourced and supported facts </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man.  The top post here right now has two psyop created words in it.  I can&#39;t see how being reasonable will triumph, when putting &quot;pizzagate&quot; and now &quot;&quot;pissgate&quot; in the title gets you more upvotes then I have received n 6 years.  Have you got an example of your own post that meets those requirements?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a write up on Chuck Grassley a couple months back, I have it archived somewhere I&#39;ll find it for you but in the write up all I did was lay out the data and the facts and leave the conclusions for everyone else to make. With Grassley the data showed a clear correlation to his senatorial activities and campaign funding. As his actions changed so did his funding and ultimately his status and position in government changed as well. If I can&#39;t find it I&#39;ll just write it up for you again </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen, but I like being snarky. </p>

<p>After years of being out down and ridiculed any time I question anything, I&#39;m at a point where I take every opportunity to shove it in people&#39;s faces. </p>

<p>That might not be the best way to go about it, but it makes me feel better, and I think it gets the point across.</p>

<p>I guess all I&#39;m saying is; let&#39;s walk that fine, grey line between mercy and judgement. There are people who are just fools, and their tanking the rest of us. </p>

<p>I dunno how we deal with that, but it must be dealt with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, it&#39;s frustrating to deal with being told you&#39;re wrong by people who haven&#39;t looked into anything for themselves. But if we continue to be hostile we will never bridge the gap. We&#39;re thinking with our emotions and it sucks but we just have to hit them with things that they can&#39;t avoid. True facts. Reality. I&#39;ve done my fair share of snarky remarks but it helps no one. It makes the other side dig in ten times harder and doesn&#39;t effectively communicate my message </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with your plea. The power still does lie with the people. The politics of division and race bating and every other distraction only serves Their victory. Only through world wide unity will we ever stand a chance to make a better world for ourselves.</p>

<p>There IS a banking cabal farming us. War IS for fun and profit, started by puppet governments (which is all of them). We need to do everything and use all the tools in our power to awaken <em>all</em> of our brothers and sisters. The population in general has been lobotomized and we need to reach all of them. </p>

<p>We truly are living in the last era of a &quot;free&quot; society. We need critical thinking. We need citizen fact checkers and investigators. We need educators. People must rise up and demand change, with pitchforks if necessary. </p>

<p>It sure as shit won&#39;t be much of a revolution once they&#39;ve disarmed us, which we all know they&#39;re gunning for (pardon the pun). This all has to happen at light speed because we certainly won&#39;t have any success when They have an autonomous and unmanned military, er I mean, police to stop us.</p>

<p>PS: loooong time lurker, first time Conspiracy poster. It&#39;s a lovely place we have here, for now. </p>
