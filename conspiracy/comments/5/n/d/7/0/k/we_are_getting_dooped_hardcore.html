       Before the election it was widely accepted based on countless pieces of evidences that the nwo was the problem and the establishment was our enemy. What happened to this? So much has been taking place, but guess what the same principalities who are behind the nwo are expert deceivers and liars. I can't believe we allowed ourselves to be tricked by these shows they put on because clearly the agenda has not changed. We allowed these politically correct people to come and erase this platform only to talk about an election which was obviously huge for them,  I mean they captured the entire country's heart and mind and they are still using it because it worked so well. People wake up! The nwo is here,  and we can worry about pedophiles all we want but don't you see! If we really had as much power like we keep saying we do,  somebody would be in trouble but no,  we have little power because we are being lead where they want.

       The real shame here (especially within this subreddit) is that so many people decided to jump aboard the Trump bandwagon out of spite towards Clinton. They woke up to one aspect of the "establishment" only to be lulled to sleep by the other. Just look at Trump's cabinet picks and their histories. You Trump supporters are probably laughing at all the other kool-aid drinkers while sipping away at a different flavor kool-aid.

       Oh my fucking god thank you. I keep my anti-Trump rhetoric to a minimum just so I can browse the subreddits without getting into an argument. I had my eyes opened to Clinton's horrendous deeds, but how does this make Donald Trump a trustworthy leader? I'm more patient than most, so I can wait to see what he actually DOES before I flip out, but mark my words, if I start seeing things, I'll do my absolute best to make it loud and known. Tbh I don't fucking trust ANYBODY who makes it to the presidency.

       At this time I am reserving judgement on Trump's leadership ability. He hasn't taken office yet. While I voted for him and am cautiously optimistic, since he is somewhat of an outsider in DC and isn't reliant on other's for his wealth and success.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, I fully expect and hope that this sub will take apart every move her makes and hold him accountable in every conceivable way. And while I think he might be interesting as a disruption to DC and business as usual, I hold no illusions that he is a white night coming to save us from the evil dragons. He could easily end up being the evilest dragon.

       One thing I know is that if the Bible says something will happen it will happen. It's just always amazing to see how it happens. Nwo has been promised forever,  and of course the only way it could be installed is by trickery and deciet. And of course pure evils such as brainwashing

       Sure if the Bible says it, it'll happen. Except that the Bible says that Tyre would be destroyed and would never stand again. Well it was destroyed, but they rebuilt it across the river from the original location.

       Well this isn't a valid argument if you dig deeper. Ezekiel who is the prophet says that it would be destroyed and it would not survive through it,  and after it would become a place of spreading nets. This directly means that it would be destroyed and replaced with another new city. It would require that something be rebuilt according to the prospect,  which everything that occurred was in alignment.

       Much appreciated reference sir. Well I have not specifically looked for others recording this,  I have not seen evidence against it. I do believe such thing happened. There are much more extreme claims the Bible makes which I'm in agreement to including creation of the universe,  and the flood,  and many more. All backed up by evident science

       There is literally zero evidence for a magical creation or a worldwide flood. Science contradicts both of those things.

       In fact the entire fossil record shows the flood was indeed real. So today basic science tells us that man evolved from animals and animals from something less complex before that, and when looking at the in-between stages we are given an excuse of the amount of time it takes for evolution to occur yet if it took so long there should beass evidence,  and also the laws of thermodynamics state that energy cannot be created or destroyed and also the law of of entropy that says everything goes from orderly to disorderly. These are laws! So in fact evolution goes completely against those to laws and that would cause me to conclude that such idea is false. Now on the other hand creation makes perfect sense according to laws I compared evolution too, of course an all powerful being is the only one to create,  there is no other God in creation and therefor nothing can be created. It was created,  now it is decaying. No contradictions there

       Let me get this straight. Things like humans can't evolve from something else because of the laws of the universe, but an infinitely complex deity can absolutely exist prior to and outside of the universe and then in one moment of infinity decide to create the universe and everything in it because he's God? For science we have to obey physics but for religion, fuck physics? Your God violates causality. That's kind of a big thing.

       It's not religion,  its truth. Just because you don't claim a God,  you are aligned by beliefs. So if it is completely crazy for a God to exist,  than what magic started the universe?

       If the general picture, however, of a Big Bang followed by an expanding universe is correct - what happened before that? Was the universe devoid of all matter and then the matter suddenly somehow created? How did that happen? In many cultures, a customary answer is that a "God" or "Gods" created the universe out of nothing, but if we wish to pursue this question courageously we must, of course, ask the next question - where did God come from? If we decide that this is an unanswerable question, why not save a step and conclude that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question? Or if we say that God always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe always existed? There's no need for a creation, it was always here.

       So my question then would be if it's not logical to conclude a God was already there,  then where in the world did matter come from? Energy must have a source yes? Then it would actually seem logical that a God was already there and not matter just existing if itself.

       That's actually what Carl Sagan is saying in that quote, just from the opposite perspective. He is saying that if you would be quick to say that a God or gods could exist without having to have been created then what's stopping us from saving a step and saying that energy has always been there in one form or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say that a God creating everything (which requires infinite complexity) but requiring no creator him / her / itself is logical but that the universe (that is the energy and matter which makes up the universe) could not possibly have existed because it's too complex is a strong piece of twisted logic and mental gymnastics that I just can't abide.

       You are completely allowed to believe that sir, and I am not saying you can't. But in my mind it's the other way around. This life and physical realm is massively complex,  more complex than we can conceive. They way every thing perfectly works together and the system which it operates does not seem random. It would be quite simple actually to understand that an infinitely knowledgeable creator was responsible for such perfect design. Now for such a massive scale system to happen wouldn't just take an eternity to occur but the fact we don't live in a randomized un structured system proves that random occurrence is merely absurd.

       This world isn't perfect. This universe isn't perfect. Our planet is in the middle of a galactic shooting gallery. Not to mention the physical problems that humans have. Most of our population, myself included have to wear glasses or Contacts just to be able to see. Or the fact that we eat and breathe through the same hole causing a number of our population to choke to death each year. And then there is childhood cancer. How does any of that say perfect to you?

       To accept an idea that just relies completely on Oh well this was all random and everything just happened is no answer at all really. It doesn't explain emotion,  love,  evil,  anything that is in the conscious mind. Actions obviously have consequences,  so that ties in good and evil. Now for the ideological structure if life combined with the structure itself is so vastly perfect that there in now way could this by chance. If we understand that God made this universe,  and understand why we are here,  the Bible has answered every question I could ever have. The only things on this evil planet that gives me pure hope,  pure peace,  and an absolute purpose. Everything else like this earth fades away but not my God. I am not the one without, you are my friend. This discussion is for your sake,  I want peace and fulfillment for specifically you. I am very determined to spell it out for you.

       Also, your last few lines are really cute, man. But here's the thing. I'm not lacking. I don't need your God or anyone's. I don't need an imaginary man in the sky to watch my every move and promise me a reward after death but only if I do the right things. I don't need those things for the same reason I don't need Santa Claus or the Easter bunny. Because I'm an adult and I choose to live in an adult world.

       Exactly man,  this world isn't perfect. Sin corrupts creation. That's why it's important that there is a God,  else who cares I'd there is or isn't right? It's a part of human nature to hate God,  Bible says so, and I'd say that is true in everyone at some point. Everything on this earth is collapsing,  and not only earth but we ourselves are fading away. It's not the principle of does God exist,  it's the principle that we need salvation. The gospel isn't about God watching you and judging you,  it's about him creating you,  giving you a unique soul. But sin is in all of us and we are dammed to hell,  so God sent his son as payment for our sins. He sacrificed himself in our place so we could be one with Him after this life and avoid what we deserve. I do not follow God because I love his commandments,  i follow God because he has loved us and has proven it. His commandments are with promise of not only reward after but in this life too. Gods principles make a better world. What other religion teaches to love above all things? I'm sorry but it's not a question of do you or do you not need God. The answer is you do,  and you will never regret you had him. This world is falling away,  don't put yourself with it.

       If something is not so,  it is not a fallacy that there would be evidence showing that it isn't so. I'm asking that there be evidence that shows that the claims I'm making are false,  I am open to debate these topics and based on lack of evidence against it I have been convinced of it. But to dent something without any evidence that is incorrect is actually a logical fallacy in itself

       No see that is a branch off story of the bigger picture. What im relaying here is that the election is the duping. It is a huge distraction of politics further diving what is left of the American people. The truther movement has become the Donald and Hillary show,  and wiki leaks has been a huge puppet in this as well.

       No no,  the Bible is my source of truth. I wasn't responding directly to the Russian narrative. I was stating that the Bible is my source on the coming new world order which is here,  but it quite established fully

       You are completely allowed to believe that sir, and I am not saying you can't. But in my mind it's the other way around. This life and physical realm is massively complex,  more complex than we can conceive. They way every thing perfectly works together and the system which it operates does not seem random. It would be quite simple actually to understand that an infinitely knowledgeable creator was responsible for such perfect design. Now for such a massive scale system to happen wouldn't just take an eternity to occur but the fact we don't live in a randomized un structured system proves that random occurrence is merely absurd.

       To accept an idea that just relies completely on Oh well this was all random and everything just happened is no answer at all really. It doesn't explain emotion,  love,  evil,  anything that is in the conscious mind. Actions obviously have consequences,  so that ties in good and evil. Now for the ideological structure if life combined with the structure itself is so vastly perfect that there in now way could this by chance. If we understand that God made this universe,  and understand why we are here,  the Bible has answered every question I could ever have. The only things on this evil planet that gives me pure hope,  pure peace,  and an absolute purpose. Everything else like this earth fades away but not my God. I am not the one without, you are my friend. This discussion is for your sake,  I want peace and fulfillment for specifically you. I am very determined to spell it out for you.
