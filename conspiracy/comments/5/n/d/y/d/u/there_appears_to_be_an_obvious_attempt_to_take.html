    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a smarter Reddit would weight votes by participation.  The more you read/participate in a subreddit, the more knowledgeable you are about the subject, ipso facto the more weight to your vote.   Outsiders certainly get A vote, and all outsider votes are tallied and visible for all to see.  So, Total Score = Participant Score + Outsider Score.  We as readers can determine how much of the conversation is coming from Knowledgeable vs Non-knowledgable/Outsider sources/info.</p>

<p>My two cents.</p>

<p>Would you want to have that noisy buzz thread votes being applied to those accounts?</p>

<p>Secondly it creates an opening for the Appeal to Authority/Bandwagon logical fallacies. Using and referring to those scores as a means of trying to add weight to their argument. That would be acceptable to blow ins but not so much to people, like myself, that weigh the value of a post on its merits (don&#39;t shoot the messenger, disregard propaganda/false narratives and don&#39;t participate in the special olympics [internet arguments] ).</p>

If this is in any way true, that she was selling favors to enemies of the united states through the use of a fake charity, I would call that pretty fucking corrupt.  Also, I think if you read some of the accounts of how the CF handled their charity work in Haiti, you might call that corrupt as well.  She is a career politician.  You can try to turn this into an &quot;us vs. them&quot; kind of discussion, but honestly at this point, finding a non corrupt career politician is getting pretty damn difficult.  Here are the CF&#39;s tax filings for 2014/2015 showing they gave less than 5.7 percent of money donated on actual charity.

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. A lot of the gilded comments and comments from suspicious accounts were calling out the moderators. It&#39;s obvious that part of their agenda is to install their own censor-friendly moderators over here. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the last major uncensored subreddit (over 100k subscribers), which is probably why we&#39;re being targeted.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not writing this to claim that moderators should never be criticized. It&#39;s highly suspicious, however, when the charge against them is led by accounts coming in from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">/r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a>. </p>

<p>Right. But those Haarp facilities and Dulce base have more credence. This is ridiculous, false information to support a narrative because you don&#39;t agree with it. What proof do you have that the documents are false? What proof do you have that stuff like Haarp is false?</p>

<p>It&#39;s unconfirmed in terms of the specific allegations, what is confirmed is that Obama and Trump were both briefed on it.</p>

I am anti censorship, and while I understand your argument, it is ignoring the giant pink elephant in the room, and that is that this was a blatant manipulation of our sub, with many calls for moderation change, and it mirrors US foreign policy of formenting strife and installing puppets, on a micro Reddit scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to accept we need Russia to be told the truth about our government. Thus you are praising Vladimir Putin as the most valuable journalistic source in the 21st century. Don&#39;t you know Putin is a statist? That he could have told us the truth about 911 a long time ago? Why do you put so much faith in him? The adoration you manifest for a foreign authoritarian leader is disconcerting.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the Wikileaks emails were authentic</p></li>
<li><p>In the Podesta emails you can witness Podesta getting hacked through a phishing attack</p></li>
<li><p>Podesta&#39;s password was p@ssword</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary&#39;s emails were virtually available for anyone to download</p></li>

<p>Did what exactly? Tell the truth? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say Putin did it. I personally doubt he&#39;d render us such a service, and you don&#39;t, so you have a higher opinion of him than I do, unless you think telling the truth is a bad thing. But let&#39;s put that aside. </p>

<p>So what? How does the messenger count, if the truth can be authenticated through a digital signature? What if Kim Jong II produced authentifiable emails proving endemic crimes? Would the criminals be absolved?</p>

<p>What if Putin gave you the authentifiable video of a recognizable and well-known adult abusing a child? Would that adult be able to complain &quot;Putin stole my pedophilia, be angry at him!&quot;? You seem to make that case.</p>

<p>And finally, that line is absurd because if the messenger were to count, those spewing the Russia line are modern civilisation&#39;s worst liars and war criminals. </p>

<p>I am neither a Trump or Hillary supporter, so I can see concerns coming from people who are not necessarily fans of his. This sub has taken a right-turn as of late, but I think is the result of reddit&#39;s pro-Clinton bias and censorship. This sub was literally the only place people could find some balanced uncensored news. Many of the Trump supporters decided to stay, because they liked the sub overall and appreciated the hands-off moderation policy.</p>

<p>The was the PISSGATE post was SO heavily brigaded was suspicious, I think the mods made a call on that post to protect the sub. I do not think there were nefarious or partisan reasons for removing that particular post. Subsequent, organic postings on the same subject were allowed to stand. </p>

<p>There is no censorship policy in the sub on the Pissgate topic.</p>

<p>Mods should definitely explain that flair though. We should either have no editorial control via the flairs... or all of the frontpage needs it. It needs to be a consistent policy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tag was a quote from the article itself. It&#39;s not like the mods inserted their opinion that it was &quot;unverifiable allegations&quot; and they even put quotes in the flair to make it clear it was a quote from the article. The article also stated that in their opinion, there is reason to seriously doubt the allegations.</p>

<p>Have you never seen the mods add a tag to a post to make the title more accurate so that it doesn&#39;t come off as clickbait? They even make sure to put accurate years in tags when people post super old articles so there&#39;s less people reading only the title and thinking it&#39;s new information or an event that just happened.</p>

<p>I seriously feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills because no one else seems to get this. I don&#39;t understand why people keep posting and getting upset that they&#39;ve never used that specific tag on any other article. They&#39;ve never used it because it&#39;s a quote, not the mods opinion.</p>

<p>At this point it honestly is seeming like some kind of big joke. It&#39;s so blatantly obvious they added a quote from the article as the tag that I&#39;m having a hard time believing everyone who is bringing this up <em>actually believes</em> this is somehow a problem. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that sub does what you think it does. It saw the thread go from #16 to out of the top #100, which is consistent with it suddenly dropping out due to its ratio falling from ~80% to ~60%. From what I can see, the link has remained active for the entire duration.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong though, and mods somehow removed it from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> frontpage and excluded it from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. I may not be aware of those kind of features.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also confused because the automod for undelete states the tag then says this is why the thread was deleted. But if it wasn&#39;t deleted why is it showing up on undelete?</p>

<p>Honestly, the mods need to give an answer for this and this sub isn&#39;t helping by circlejerking over non existent shills and ctr instead of discussing why the thread disappeared </p>

<p>I found both threads via search, and they were in the controversial tab organically (reddit algo, not mod removal, I believe), as I recall. Reddit relegates threads with close to 50 or 60% upvote ratio to that tab. That policy has even sent big threads off sub&#39;s front pages and dropped them from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. The most notable to me was the Trump AMA.</p>

<p>No.. I didn&#39;t just stop reading your comment half way through because I&#39;m not an asshole. Thanks for being insulting though for no reason.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I still don&#39;t get this. What posts have they not been consistent about? You&#39;re not even allowed to use all caps in your titles here because it comes off as clickbait. If a title is actually misleading and they haven&#39;t noticed for some reason, all you have to do is message them. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone did message them and tell them the Buzzfeed post had a misleading title. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Have you sent a mod mail and asked? I just don&#39;t understand why people are freaking out (most of whom aren&#39;t even subscribed here) and acting like it&#39;s something sinister. It&#39;s far more likely they just didn&#39;t want 200 people posting &quot;it says it&#39;s unconfirmed guys!&quot; and not having an actual discussion about the material.</p>

<p>The only reason that tag is even getting so much attention anyway is cause the post was linked in subs whose users routinely come here to call us delusional nutjobs. Now all of a sudden, those same people are concerned that an accurate, verbatim tag was added to a post? Most of the people bitching about it are only bitching about it because it&#39;s another super fun way to make fun of the conspiracy theorists.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How is making sure that the title of a post accurately reflects the article influencing anyone&#39;s <em>opinion</em>? Even the tag itself was fact, not opinion. Making sure everyone sees the facts even if they don&#39;t read the article is a <em>good</em> thing! Yet somehow people are turning it into a bad thing because the post was about Trump, and I guess when it comes to him, who cares about making sure everyone knows the facts, right?</p>

<p>You seriously would rather they not flair anything because they tagged a post with an actual quote from the post itself? It just doesn&#39;t make any sense at all to me that you&#39;d rather have inaccurate, misleading, sensational and even straight up fake titles just because every now and then people use shitty titles and the mods tag it so it&#39;s more accurate.</p>

<p>How is <em>anyone&#39;s</em> opinion being influenced before they read the article when the quote from the tag is right in the beginning of the article? Why would it be <em>better</em> to have people who only read the title make uninformed comments?</p>

<p>Also: I don&#39;t blame them even a little for deleting the post. It had obvious vote manipulation and was heavily brigaded due to the post being linked in subs whose users only come here to make fun of this community and insult us.</p>

<p>I&#39;d feel differently about the removal if there was any actual, <em>genuine</em> discussion about the article in that thread. There wasn&#39;t. It was 90% people who don&#39;t come here, and some who never had before, calling us all donald2.0 and Russian bots. All while trying to get the <em>actual</em> users here to turn against the mods because they tagged a very suspicious and fishy post with accurate and important information. </p>

<p>They would have been saying the same shit if the post was about Hillary or Obama and <em>didn&#39;t</em> have that tag. &quot;Fucking hypocrites, of course they&#39;d use that tag since it&#39;s about Trump!&quot; - &quot;Fucking hypocrites, of course they&#39;d leave out that it&#39;s &quot;unverified allegations&quot; since it&#39;s about Hillary!&quot; Either way, they get to feel superior and insult all of us. Very convenient.</p>

<p>It was also dozens of people being gilded for insulting the mods and this community because we didn&#39;t automatically believe it. They only got more upvotes and more gold for saying it was because it was anti-trump and against our &quot;narrative&quot; instead of the actual reason, which was the article itself and multiple other news outlets stating that the information couldn&#39;t be verified, had a lot of errors and <em>should be viewed with suspicion</em>.</p>

<p>Apparently we&#39;re just a bunch of idiots for realizing that if our government had this information for quite a while before election day, thought that <em>any</em> of it was true and that there was any evidence, no matter how minute, they would absolutely have not waited until after he was elected to bring this shit up.</p>

<p>If various mainstream news outlets wouldn&#39;t report something so damning about <em>Trump</em> of all people, that probably means it&#39;s total horseshit. And because of that, it wouldn&#39;t have ever received that many upvotes here, especially at the speed it was happening, if the people who hate Trump didn&#39;t completely flood this sub just so they could point, laugh and circlejerk over how superior and smart they are for hating him. We&#39;re constantly shit on for believing stuff that they think doesn&#39;t have enough evidence but it&#39;s totally okay for them to believe this shit when even the msm doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s enough evidence?</p>

<p>Really, this whole thing is remarkably fucking stupid. The only reason I&#39;m actually really uneasy about this shit is because it&#39;s disturbing and scary that huge amounts of people are acting completely fucking nuts. I&#39;m actually genuinely upset that my peers are believing everything our government is telling them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m watching more and more people talk about Russia as if they&#39;re our enemy and always have been (1984 much?) I&#39;m watching 20-30 year old liberals completely accept everything our intelligence agencies are saying with literally 0 proof but their word and it&#39;s god damn sad and scary at the same time. </p>

<p>The way all of the highly upvoted/gilded people were acting in that thread just made it even <em>more</em> obvious.</p>

<p>Anyway, didn&#39;t mean for this to be so long. I just don&#39;t see a problem with how it was handled, cause either way the post would&#39;ve been brigaded and if they didn&#39;t add a tag, we still would have been insulted for not believing the allegations either way. I&#39;ve been here for a really long time and I&#39;ve honestly never seen them being blatantly inconsistent with stuff like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the sidebar, plz consider adding a link that a mod updates daily (or somehow &quot;regularly&quot;, maybe weekly) to point to an open thread that has a meta discussion wiki &amp; is meant to allow comments linking to low-traffick posts that hit a good &quot;TIL for weirdos&quot; note, or other chatter. A coffe shop vibe, or fora or commons, is my suggestion.  As sidebar link, if systems are calm, it won&#39;t get to highest levels of the front page. But yesterday after whizfest on buzzfeed, it likely would have had mad.furious traffick.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The infiltration of agenda driven, pro-censorship mods is my larger concern also. It is slightly suspicious to see an older account that has not been active for 3 years suddenly show up as an unannounced moderator. </p>

<p>I wonder how those moderator discussions went. Something tells me that we are not going to get any &quot;transparency&quot; when it comes to that decision making process.</p>

<p>Everyone who has read any leaked moderator discussions among themselves knows how they think of themselves as being in a superior class to the rest of the users and contributors of the sub(s) they moderate. </p>

<p>I would be interested to see who was the driving force behind the most recent moderator addition. There has been a somewhat interesting silence among the current moderators in this particular discussion.</p>
