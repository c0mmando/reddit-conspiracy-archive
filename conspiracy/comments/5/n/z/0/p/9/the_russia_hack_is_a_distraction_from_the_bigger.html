        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I made a similar post late last night, but I really want everyone to think about this and not let the shills distract us from critical thinking.</p>

<p>This sub has been shifted drastically in the last week. The main concern, IMO, of this shift, is the polarization of the &quot;Russian hack&quot; story. There are folks denouncing Trump because of his supposed Russian ties, and there are folks defending Trump&#39;s name and legitimacy by pointing out that the story is bullshit. Let&#39;s remember back a few weeks to when the CIA came out with their report on the Russian hacking. <strong>They didn&#39;t have shit for evidence, and if they did, we know they would have come out with it.</strong> Remember, it was <em>Wikileaks</em> that published the <em>authentic</em> emails illustrating how the DNC chairmen and Hillary&#39;s campaign acts behind the scenes. The public recognized that the DNC and Hillary&#39;s public and private stances differ so much that they wouldn&#39;t rather associate with the Democratic Party. That&#39;s what happened, we all know it. But the media and the CIA have come up with an elaborate narrative, based on no evidence <strong>to start WWIII.</strong></p>

<p>We just saw Israel bomb Syria, with Syria promising to retaliate. We are seeing chaos in Mexico spilling over the border due to a ridiculous rise in gas prices. The US Navy is almost entirely in port and has been for over a week. These are the things we should be focussing on, not whether Trump got some fucking hookers to piss on a bed or anything related to that pile of garbage. Don&#39;t defend it, don&#39;t argue against it, just downvote. Stick to the <em>big picture</em> and never trust CIA propaganda.</p>

<p>Pay attention to false flags and be prepared for the gid/internet to go down in the days before and after Trump&#39;s inauguration. Let&#39;s not let this sub get turned into a clusterfuck of confusion, because that&#39;s exactly what the shills want. </p>

<p>The &quot;Russian hack&quot; was fabricated to distract and delegitimize Trump&#39;s presidency. The FBI wasn&#39;t even allowed access in the hacked servers for Christ&#39;s sake. Stop arguing for or against a topic that&#39;s clearly here to distract.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I think the hacking techniques are not unique enough to point to a specific source. The FBI was not even allowed access to the hacked DNC servers. That makes me think it was an inside job, and Seth Rich comes to mind. I think there is a lot more evidence pointing to it being an inside leak and they don&#39;t want to admit it. They are hiding all of the crucial information because if they make it public, the internet will rip it to shreds because it will be in no way verifiable or identifiable to the Russian government.</p>

That report says yes we have the proof you cannot see it but believe us because we have high confidence in ourselves.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, quite a thing. Contacting the moderators about that. Here my original post:</p>

<p>The CIA in the past had assets in the press to push their agenda, and very successfully carried out desinformation campaigns both overseas (e.g. in Europe) as well an at home. That is, the CIA infiltrated the US press. This can be read in the Church Committee report which appeared after the Watergate scandal 1975, Volume 7 on covert action. <a href="http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/contents.htm">www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/contents.htm</a></p>

<p>Concerning influence campains in the foreign press concerning Chile, they write: &quot;A few statistics convey the magnitude of the CIA&#39;s propaganda campaign mounted during the six-week interim period in the Latin American and European media. According to the CIA, partial re- turns showed that 726 articles, broadcasts, editorials, and similar items directly resulted from Agency activity. The Agency had no way to measure the scope of the multiplier effect-i.e., how much its &quot;induced&quot; news focused media interest on the Chilean issues and. stimulated ad- ditional coverage-but concluded that its contribution was both substantial and significant.&quot;</p>

<p>Concerning domestic press at the same time they say, &quot;Approximately 50 of the [Agency] assets are individual American journalists or employees of U.S. media organizations. Of these, fewer than half are &quot;accredited&quot; by U.S. media organizations ... The remaining individuals are non-accredited freelance contributors and media representatives abroad ... More than a dozen United States news organizations and commercial publishing houses formerly provided cover for CIA agents abroad. A few of these organizations were unaware that they provided this cover.[13]&quot;</p>

<p>This was part of a designated CIA information warfare operation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a></p>

<p>Now given the success, it seems to be highly likely that such methods are still in place, even if more refined. In fact, the Iraq war even provides a more recent example with the Pentagon Military Analyst Program, where &quot;indepentent&quot; experts were supplied with talking points by the DoD: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program</a></p>

<p>How come many won&#39;t consider that western press may still contain propaganda, too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying there&#39;s no evidence. </p>

<p>The evidence has been out there for months. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.</p>

<p>One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC’s servers.</p>

<p>Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach. The infrastructure behind the fake MIS Department domain was also linked to the Berlin intrusion through at least one other element, a shared SSL certificate.&quot; (
<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack</a>
)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence that state-directed Russian hacking is responsible for the DNC breach is, in other words, more than circumstantial.</p>

<p>An important part of the hack was a so-called &#39;spear-phishing&#39; campaign that attempted to emulate legitimate websites to pilfer credentials and even maintain a persistent connection to a secure session:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim&#39;s full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim&#39;s account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.&quot;</p>

<p>The forensic evidence left by the hacks (C&amp;C IP addresses, spoofed certificates, encryption codes) point to Russian sources due to similarities between these intrusions and previous ones in Germany, Georgia, Latvia and other confirmed breaches.</p>

<p>Again, <em>this has been out since July,</em> including evidence that &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; is a smokescreen persona:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ThreatConnect is the first to identify and detail analysis of Guccifer 2.0’s operational infrastructure. In our original hypothesis, we suspected Guccifer 2.0 might be leveraging French infrastructure to communicate with the global media, and we have validated this finding with the help of the media. As more details continue to surface surrounding Guccifer 2.0, we continue to identify heavy traces of Russian activity, from the specific Russian-based VPN service provider, domain registrants, and registrars as well as various discrete events that have circumstantial marks of Russian origins.</p>

<p>As we pointed out in our previous analysis, we conclude Guccifer 2.0 is an apparition created under a hasty Russian D&amp;D campaign, which has clearly evolved into an Active Measures Campaign. Those who are operating under the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter, WordPress and Email communications are likely made up a cadre of non-technical politruk attempting to establish “Guccifer 2.0” as a static fixture on the world stage along the likes of Manning, Assange or Snowden. Their use of Russian VPN services with French infrastructure may shed light on a method Russian intelligence operatives use — domestic services coupled with foreign infrastructure — to help hide their hand and deter any potential attribution to Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>There is plenty of forensic evidence to parse through. Yes, sure, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that DNC networks were compromised by APT28 / APT29 (Cozy Bear and Lazy Bear) <em>and</em> that the leak did originate from another, third (possibly internal?) source. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s a very bold and risky play to deliberately use cyberwarfare capabilities to leak internal documents in lieu of traditional espionage: it compromises quiet ongoing surveillance in favor of a ploy that may or may not work, and could even spectacularly backfire. But it&#39;s also compatible with an emboldened Russian foreign policy. </p>

<p>And certainly it&#39;s also possible that the leak had far more wide-ranging influences that anyone intended, and all the players are caught off guard here and just improvising. (In fact that&#39;s more likely: only in movies does the villain &#39;foresee&#39; events 12 steps in advance).</p>

<p>And the evidence is more than circumstantial. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear left significant fingerprints over the crime scene, from the command and control IP addresses, to the specific code and exploits used, to the Cyrillic settings on leaked documents; again, read the third-party security analyses for yourself. We don&#39;t have to just take someone&#39;s word for it, even though the American intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment here.</p>

Are you a european white nationalist? Are you a russian shill? A troll? I&#39;m seriously curious what your motivations are for playing this game. Because honestly at the end of the day who gives a fuck about Hillary or the emails now? She lost, and there was nothing illegal in them after two FBI investigations so give it a rest. You post like Comey himself.</p>

<p>If Trump had aide from a foreign government in influencing the election as well as working in coordination with Putin for years as the allegations claim that would be treason and he could even be executed, along with other corrupt members of his team Manafort, Carter, Flynn, and Tillerson. People have a right to an investigation through proper channels, regardless of your objections it will happen  so try to keep an open mind as the evidence builds. Try not to shut down your critical thinking skills because you&#39;re too blinded by love for your god emperor or whatever the fuck is going on with you crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ, I think it&#39;s more important to <em>ask for evidence of Russian hacking</em> before you go off assuming it was Putin himself just because the msm and shills all over the internet told you to. Without evidence, I think it is important to have a healthy amount of skepticism of our CIA especially based on their history.</p>

<p>You&#39;re turning this around on me, I&#39;m not the one claiming anything, I&#39;m pointing out the fact that the whole world is focussed on this &quot;Russian hacking&quot; shit without any real facts to base it on. If the CIA comes out with some actual verifiable evidence that the Russians have this grand plan to take over and enslave the US even more than the democrats and the CIA are, then I&#39;d be happy to entertain the topic.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this. If one iota of this &quot;dossier&quot; were true wouldn&#39;t the government be scrambling to hold Congressional hearings and to block Trump from taking the oath of office? Wouldn&#39;t Obama&#39;s CIA and intelligence services be all over the information to verify it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s up with all of these rallying cry posts about persecution and why are they constantly telling the people who come here what they should think and what topics are valid for discussion?  This is a damn conspiracy sub, the Trump dossier is a valid conspiracy, so why not just let the voters decide using their votes?</p>

<p>Why do these need to be posted on almost a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day?  There&#39;s a lot of effort being put into manipulating this sub and the various people who come here.  The more I see people spouting off about the Trump stuff being obvious crap the more I feel there&#39;s a serious coordinated attempt to discredit it by some frightened actors or propagandists.  Hopefully other posters here have noticed this also and are able to keep aware of it.</p>

Perhaps the DNC is trying to Blame Russia as they helped contribute to leaking Seth Rich&#39;s intel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re buying into the Russian boogeyman horror story. Snowden was in Hong Kong before they could even tell it was him who leaked the NSA shit and when he found out they were after him, he get asylum in Russia because that was the safest option. </p>

<p>Russia has been subjected to and forced into the NWO that the US, CIA, NATO, and others have been pushing. Obama has been moving tanks to the Russian border for years. This is bigger than trump. This is about having a reason to destroy one of the last remaining powers that have resisted the new world order and the US global banking system. </p>

<p>The reason Russia is helping Syria is because the Clinton foundation and the CIA want a pipeline from the quatar Saudi Arabia oil rigs to Europe, so Europe is no longer dependent on Russia for oil. That would destroy Russia&#39;s economy and force them into the NWO. Putin is winning though. He&#39;s resisting the NWO because he&#39;s winning Syria. </p>

<p>But all of this new anti Russian propaganda is just to have an excuse to start wwiii and have direct conflict with Russia in a desperate attempt to finish all their hard work. </p>

<p>Think bigger, man. Seth rich could have been the leak, or not. I think it&#39;s probable that someone inside the dnc leaked it, they knew that so they didn&#39;t let the FBI see the servers, and they killed Seth without even being sure it was him in order to send a message to more potential whistleblowers. That&#39;s a much more likely scenario than this flimsy Russia story. </p>

<p>So where have they published the scanned intel documents Steele says he has?</p>

<p>I mean, to be fair, if <em>you</em> don&#39;t have a link to the scanned raw intelligence documents that Steele supposedly has so people can read them for themselves, such as the Podesta emails for example, then <strong>you</strong> got nothing either.</p>
