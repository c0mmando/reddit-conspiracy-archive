       Do you think, perhaps, that Trump is cozying up to the Russians in order to orchestrate some act to bring down China? He has said a lot about the Chinese being the crux of America's problem. Maybe he is working with Russia, or planning to, in order to have them as an ally. Is that plausible?

       Being indebted to the Bank of China isn't a conflict of interest? And if it's true that he did pay bribes to Chinese companies, that's a whole other load of trouble. See also Kushner's taking money from shady Chinese companies.

       It's weird how much you folks contort yourself for this guy. Why? We should always question power, but you guys went from questioning power in the Clintons to being pansies who ignore what's in front of your faces with Trump. It's bizarre.

       Trump is owned by the Chinese and the Russians and the Israelis and who knows who else - just look at who he sucks up to. He probably doesn't see it that way, the same way he's more upset about a-listers not playing his dumb party than he is about the fact that the dragnet is closing in around him.

       It's his business's. The notion that a 70 year old  multibillionaire, who's had it all, ran for POTUS to further enrich his holdings is beyond the pale. It seems, at least to me, rather obvious the man sought a higher place in history. To believe he wants to be included in the history books as a profiteer is wacky. If DJT is getting strong armed he's the best prepared to end it of any politician to run for office. He poured his heart out multiple times a day for over a year and enough heard it to give him a chance.

       I wouldn't say he's "cozying up" but he's certainly more friendly with Russia than previous administrations, his rhetoric in the past along with Putin's indicate that they would be more inclined to work together than the previous regime. His rhetoric towards China has been increasingly hostile as of late. I feel that he lacks the subtlety and sleight of hand that "regular politicians" have, this could be a good or bad thing depending on the situation but we'll have to wait and see.

       I'm not saying it has I'm simply saying that normal politicians are better at lying, deceiving, pushing their long term agendas, and just generally being shady, I wasn't saying it was a good thing.

       Ah, understood. Seems since Eisenhower we've been seeing politicians read from teleprompters. Seldom do they speak off the cuff for fear of the public getting a glimpse of what they really think. That Trump let it all hang out early on really told a lot about his confidence and the wide range of reactions from the populace was pretty amazing.

       I agree about teleprompter politicians since Eisenhower and in that same span we really haven't seen that big of a change in the way the States have governed in regards to a foreign policy of secret interferences and shady dealings from the CIA, and also in the general path of wealth inequality and policies that favor big corporations, I feel that while Trump's rhetoric is very different from politicians before him, I still think ultimately his actions will be more in line with previous presidents, we'll have to see what he actually does to make a judgement since his rhetoric seems to change so often, could be a strategy of keeping his opponents guessing though, again, we'll see.

       Works for me. Can't expect a superman. Will be interesting to see him blend being a messenger of the people and the hard decisions of governing. Safety vs privacy, environment and business, etc. I've heard small biz and the military make the the USA great and he does seem to appreciate both.

       I agree. However, his stance seems to be different from the current administration. It seems that in the Obama administration, Russia was bad and China was more tolerable. Trump seems to have switched the table.
