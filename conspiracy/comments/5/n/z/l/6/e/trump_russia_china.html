<p>Trump is owned by the Chinese and the Russians and the Israelis and who knows who else - just look at who he sucks up to. He probably doesn&#39;t see it that way, the same way he&#39;s more upset about a-listers not playing his dumb party than he is about the fact that the dragnet is closing in around him.</p>

<p>Good luck finding the right kneepad fit. I&#39;d have saved them for a less clownish cabal, myself, but it&#39;s your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s his business&#39;s. The notion that a 70 year old  multibillionaire, who&#39;s had it all, ran for POTUS to further enrich his holdings is beyond the pale. It seems, at least to me, rather obvious the man sought a higher place in history. To believe he wants to be included in the history books as a profiteer is wacky. If DJT is getting strong armed he&#39;s the best prepared to end it of any politician to run for office. He poured his heart out multiple times a day for over a year and enough heard it to give him a chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about teleprompter politicians since Eisenhower and in that same span we really haven&#39;t seen that big of a change in the way the States have governed in regards to a foreign policy of secret interferences and shady dealings from the CIA, and also in the general path of wealth inequality and policies that favor big corporations, I feel that while Trump&#39;s rhetoric is very different from politicians before him, I still think ultimately his actions will be more in line with previous presidents, we&#39;ll have to see what he actually does to make a judgement since his rhetoric seems to change so often, could be a strategy of keeping his opponents guessing though, again, we&#39;ll see. </p>
