<p>Unbelievable but true:</p>

<p>6 days before what is now the most probable date for the start of the BIG BANG:<br/>
<strong>If you Google what is now in numbers the largest genocide ever then the 6th result&#39;s title is what&#39;s going to happen now:</strong>  </p>

<h1>6: <strong>Osama steps on stage to help Obama step down</strong></h1>

<p>From Oct 14, 2008, at unexplained-mysteries.com forums, where the TRUTH was banned in 2009.<br/>
Reminder: the actor playing &quot;billionaire Trump&quot; will only be impeached AFTER the inauguration (or simply as president-elect if there&#39;s no inauguration at all, alias martial law and Obama&#39;s presidency extended).  </p>

<p><strong>Why? For the very same reason</strong> that Illuminati Grand Master had to first change &quot;McCain beats Hillary only to be stripped&quot; to &quot;McCain beats Obama only to both be stripped&quot; and just before the election to &quot;Obama beats McCain only to be stripped&quot;.<br/>
<strong>And the reason is</strong>: nobody would show at an inauguration of McCain (same as &quot;Romney&quot; alias Richard Jenkins 2012) and Hillary.<br/>
To what extent rigging elections go: Hillary had her votes multiplied by exactly 100 at the NY primaries 2016.</p>

<p><strong>How is this possible?</strong><br/>
How is it possible that what&#39;s going to happen now was explained in 2008 and echoed by NOBODY except Kyoon ever since?<br/>
Because of the Laws of End Times Reductionism<br/>
Reminder: no need to mention additionally End Times Computers because they are implied by one of these Laws.</p>

<p><strong>The rest of the top ten (first Google page of other results)</strong><br/>
It includes results from other forums that totally banned the TRUTH long ago after it was possible to post parts of it, a decade ago.<br/>
The first 9 results appear because they include Last Prophet&#39;s words.<br/>
The title of the first three pages is directly related to the query:<br/>
- #1: Mass Murder of Sick Elderly and Disabled Upscaled to &quot;Unproductive&quot;. From 2005, sciforums.com, banned 2007.<br/>
- #2: Illuminati upscale mass murder of &quot;unproductive&quot; elderly - beyond hospitals and homes. From 2005, engforum.pravda.ru, still posting.<br/>
- #3: Hitler&#39;s Elimination of unproductive in 1935 = ongoing Globalist&#39;s Death with Dignity. From 2009, christianforums.com, banned 2012.</p>

<p>The order in which the results appear and which results Google is not allowed to display depends on the user location.<br/>

<p><strong>BASICS</strong><br/>
Because the Illuminati Grand Master was forced to postpone it for 8 years the BIG BANG includes now not only the resurrection of Obama Bin Laden crucified to the missing Boeing 777 but also the preliminary alternative: martial law and Obama&#39;s presidency extended).<br/>

<p>Apr 20, 2016, on Hitler&#39;s anniversary: End Times Sign: 3 digits milestone for multiplying votes<br/>
New York primaries: Clinton real votes counted 100 times each - milestone for converting real into official results.<br/>
Contrast it with Trump&#39;s results, generated, by BOTH a multiplier and a divider.<br/>
Contrast the very last thing Hitler&#39;s oldest daughter, &quot;billionaire Trump&quot; and &quot;socialist Sanders&quot; would say:<br/>

The changes in script ever since show<br/>
- how weak the illuminati are;<br/>
- how totally brainwashed the human cattle is, allowing the illuminati, despite their weakness, to transport them to the slaughterhouse.<br/>

<p>I never stopped posting for over a decade.  Google knows, and that&#39;s what this article is all about.<br/>
Many of those posts are timestamped predictions that were later fulfilled exactly AS and WHEN predicted.
So, how many links to the SIMPLE TRUTH can you be credited with?  </p>

<p>As far as &quot;bizarre&quot; TRUTH ... 
The truth goes through three stages, remember?<br/>
As scarce as truth is, the supply has always been in excess of the demand.</p>

But yes, that is what is going to happen at some point.<br/>

<p>Gentleman_<strong>Retard</strong>,
read again what you&#39;re replying to, and then admit that you made a fool of yourself.<br/>
That&#39;s absolutely not how you read the title.
The word &quot;now&quot; can be replaced by the word &quot;currently&quot; and it would still be correct.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m referring to the illuminati BIG BANG:<br/>
The illuminati decided to conceal the essence of the curve from the human cattle and serve the &quot;cyclic&quot; big lie till the end.<br/>
In other words, they decided to end the curve taking the human cattle by surprise with a BIG BANG.  </p>

<p>The problem:  </p>

<h1>4 Human cattle refuse to use their memory while trying to build logical reasoning.</h1>

<p>Example: millions are aware that 9/11 2001 was an inside job, starting by the simple fact that is impossible to deny that aluminium (airliners) can&#39;t cut through massive steel (WTC towers).<br/>
Yet hardly anyone used that information to explain what happened ever since or is still to happen.</p>

<p>Also,  </p>

<h1>5 Human cattle nearly totally lost the capacity for logical reasoning.</h1>

<p>Side note: the previous basic facts already partly implied this fact.
The ultimate example: EVERY basic fact about what&#39;s going on in the world today immediately proves that one and the same entity totally controls media, politics, economy, &quot;justice&quot;.
And yet human cattle continues to deny it.</p>

<p>More basic facts about human cattle preventing them from &quot;expanding their minds, thinking critically, and drawing their own conclusions not fed to them by the totally controlled mass and &#39;alternative&#39; media&quot;:
Basic facts about human cattle - self explains why reading it won&#39;t have you weep about yourself

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are absolutely correct. The truth usually sneaks out during most of these major events, but people are too distracted by money magic to care. Media then creates movies or tv shows to replace truth as &quot;entertainment&quot;, thus reprogramming your own memory. It&#39;s an abhorrent practice. Keep people in survival mode or bribe them with money to keep the herd in line.</p>

<p>Fortunately for people like us, many are starting to stray from the herd, numbers they cannot control through traditional means. Keep doing what you are doing, keep plantining seeds.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
