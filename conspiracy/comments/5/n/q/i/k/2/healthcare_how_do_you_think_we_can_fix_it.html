        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ItsaWykydtron.html">ItsaWykydtron</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How do we fix this? </p>

<p>I used to buy into the libertarian ideas about free market healthcare. Charity and volunteers to cover people at the bottom. The more I shape my views I don&#39;t think that is the correct way forward. It doesn&#39;t help that the poor live such unhealthy lifestyles.</p>

<p>As much as I don&#39;t like government meddling in my life, in the modern age I think healthcare is an area needed to protect its citizens. </p>

<p>Profits should not be a part of health. That doesn&#39;t mean providers can&#39;t make a fair living given their training and cost of education. But why can&#39;t insurance companies operate as non profits and have salary caps? Big pharma needs regulation. How can we figure out the true cost of healthcare in such a corrupt system?</p>

<p>Whether you prefer single payer or true free-market, we need a paradigm shift before either one really works at an optimal level.</p>

<p>Â The ACA screwed over people like me to provide coverage to more preexisting conditions and more low income people. I have no insurance through work and buy it privately. I make 40k a year and qualify for no subsidies. I used to have something with ok coverage for $160, then I had to change to almost no coverage for $160. This year I have virtually no coverage before a $6000 deductible for $266/mo. </p>

<p>I would go without coverage but I do have a house and a family I need to protect. I feel like I&#39;m being held hostage.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe we live in reality. This is a post scarcity world. But until we get some form of MIC disclosure we are stuck in the old world. In this world we have people making comments like this one from here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t agree. It&#39;s just not feasible.</p>

<p>To provide health insurance to each citizen with the deductible paid in full upfront, that&#39;s about $20,000 annually. There&#39;s approximately 300 million citizens. </p>

<p>That&#39;s 6 TRILLION dollars annually. Even if you argue about my $20,000 price tag, if you chop it in half that&#39;s still 3 trillion.</p>

<p>3 trillion is the size of the entire US Federal tax receipts. Taxes would need to triple... </p>

<p>Except reality exists. If you triple the US Federal tax, our receipts will not increase 3 fold. Our economy will collapse from the mass exodus of all the individuals and businesses with money leaving our country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you see as the way forward? How do we transition to something beneficial for all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest problem is big phama. They are pumping out drugs to manage symptoms usually based on crooked research with unknown long term effects.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see more proper research done into alternative medicine and then this inplimented into out healthcare system as it will be a damn site cheaper than treating illness with expensive designer copyrighted drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a comment on the poor people living unhealthy lifestyles. If a government was responsible for the cost of your healthcare, they would fix the FDA or whatever to make sure it&#39;s harder to kill yourself with fast food and salt etc.  I think a state by state public healthcare program would be the best way forward. Yes, it&#39;s expensive. But the &#39;free-market&#39; alternative is criminal enterprise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the system we have should not be called healthcare. It should be labeled pharmaceutical medicine, because that&#39;s essentially what it is. </p>

<p>I resent being forced to purchase it because personally, I would almost never use it. Instead, I would utilize alternative means such as herbal remedies, naturopath doctors, chiropractic, etc. </p>

<p>I would like an insurance policy that only covers emergency injuries: stitches, broken bones, whatever. My daughter recently had to have an X-ray and despite the thousands we pay in <em>forced premiums</em>, our policy covered zero dollars because we hadn&#39;t met her individual deductible. So, because of Obamacare, we have higher insurance expenses than ever, yet it really doesn&#39;t cover anything because we are not chronic pill-takers. </p>

<p>The way forward imo, is to first repeal this ridiculous mandate. It&#39;s extortion, not healthcare, not insurance. It&#39;s unconstitutional. </p>

<p>Beyond that, I wouldn&#39;t mind a single payer system, as long as I can choose my coverage in an al a carte fashion, much like auto insurance. </p>

<p>We can leave Medicare and Medicaid alone - those programs are in place to assist people who need them. I have no problem with contributing as I always have, but the waste and corruption needs to be cut from those programs &amp; they should be forced to run efficiently, rather than being the bloated bureaucracies they have grown into. Perhaps that&#39;s the solution for all of this, though. No publicly funded healthcare program should be allowed to become a pork-filled money maker. There are plenty of profit making opportunities within the medical industry, but covering poor people should never fall into that business model. </p>

<p>are suffering from food addiction </p>

<p>oh yes, i totally agree, but the cause of addiction is the question (imo). are the ingredients (chemicals) in the food, the cause or some other reason? it&#39;s easy for me to ask this question, i don&#39;t have any (major) addiction. i admit i <em>need</em> my (ONE) coffee in the morning.</p>

<p>i think it&#39;s a bit too easy for us to assume a &#39;program&#39; will help people. there are so many reasons why people have food issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m certainly over generalizing and I agree it is the question. </p>

<p>My wife goes to AA. I used to be fat and was a heavy drinker for over 10 years. So I have a little first hand experience.  Most overweight people I know have similar behavior traits to alcoholics. Not saying that&#39;s the case for everyone. But even if you watch the biggest loser on tv most food addicts have emotional issues.</p>

<p>In my case I learned bad behavior from my sick mother as a child and it took me forever as an adult to realize my patterns and change them... possibly because of the chemicals in the food. </p>

<p>I believe self healing and forgiveness can change lives. 12 steps are very effective for this, but the individual has to want it. I&#39;ve never worked the steps, but I&#39;m watching my wife. It&#39;s impressive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that as well. It&#39;s very hard to view health care outside of the matrix. I like your idea of only providing protection from serious illness or injury. I had never thought of that type of compromise. </p>
