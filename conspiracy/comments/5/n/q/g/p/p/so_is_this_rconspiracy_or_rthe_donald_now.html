       have been running around pointing finger at each other, making it difficult to keep an unbiased view of other geopolitical events discussed on this subreddit in particular.

       I agree. Sometimes it gets under my skin that I check the front page every morning and it's mostly political stuff that's been discussed over and over. Then again, no where on reddit can you discuss these things so I'll keep sifting.

       As I said, there is plently of threads discussing the brigaid attempt, but I'll sum up what I watched personally. 
* Activity in the sub was unusually high at roughly 7:30pm (approximately 500 more visitors than the average 1500 for that time of night)
* The thread was posted at roughly 8pm.
* By 8:30pm the thread had gained 250(is) post Karma, and for this sub that is unheard of in 30 minutes. This was
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       appearing on r/all or before being linked to in the r/politics discussion. 
* By 9:30pm the sub had about 3500 viewers. Shortly after this the thread reached the front page of r/all.
* Over the next hour the population of the sub climbed by 50-100 every 5 minutes, to a peak population of roughly 7500. True, many of the visitors came
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the thread reached a high position on r/all or after the r/politics link but many had not. 
* Due to the relatively low average population of this sub at 8:00pm the early population climb and upvoting of the thread is the evidence cited as the brigaiding. There were threads posted in r/news and r/politics also which presumably would have been the main discussion threads for this topic, so the ridiculously fast climb of the thread and population count in r/conspiracy points to a raid or brigaide situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it wasn't and the entire event happened organically, but the mod team here acted correctly and removed the thread in case it was an organized attempt. I support their decision on this not because of any political leaning, but because maintaining the credibility of the discussion on this sub is more important that having high karma posts. There now appears to be a concerted effort to discredit the mod team because of their actions and I think that's unfortunate.

       I disagree. The sub will upvote what they feel it legitimate information, and downvote what they feel is not. The specific discussion you are linking is accused of shilling because a month old thread suddenly became active in a very unusual way. That's likely the cause of the shilling accusations. It has nothing to do with accusations based on opposing opinions.

       Yeah because a huge story got released and people wanted to talk about a conspiracy...so they went to the conspiracy sub.

       Then they should have removed a lot of the wikileaks threads over the campaign because of the obvious the_donald and hillary for prison "brigades". I personally dont think they should but by your criteria all those threads should have been deleted for brigading.

       your name is literally "dontkillmehillary" i know very well why you are defending the mods and its not because of neutral politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can prove the "they only removed it because of brigading" is a lie and an excuse because right away the thread got hit with a "unverfied allegations" tag, a tag that has been never ever used in this sub, a sub that revolves around unverified allegations. That tag has got nothing to do with the "brigading" lie and proves the mods singled it out just because they didnt like the content.

       Lol, my name is "dontkillmehillary" because I think Hillary Clinton is lying bloodthirsty cunt who I think has been fucking the system since the 1980's and also leaves a blood trail wherever she goes. It has no bearing on my opinion of the mods. If you really

       want to know my political opinions I think Sanders would have handed Trumps ass to him across the board, but the lying cheating robbing cunt bullshitted her way to the nomination with her cabal of underhanded minions.

        That tag has got nothing to do with the "brigading" lie and proves the mods singled it out just because they didnt like the content.

       That's your opinion, and apparently not one the mods agree with. Start another sub to compete with this one, and if your theories are correct then you should be able to pick up a good chunk of this subs user base. I'll even sub to it also!

       There are already subs out there and are doing well because the mods have been exposed. I still don't see why your reaction to this is "get out" because i proved mods that you like are biased.

       My reaction isn't get out at all. You're complaining that the sub is oppressively pro-Trump and I'm suggesting you make one that isn't.

       What are the other subs doing well? (genuine question) I would love to subscribe to them because honestly the constant political battles here distract from what I originally enjoyed this sub for. If you could point to them I would really appreciate it (for real).

       Right, but this sub typically rejects politics.  It's a small chapter in a much bigger book.  In general political spam dumbs this sub down.  I have no problem saying I voted for Trump (I cut the risk in half) but when I come to this sub I am damn well setting that political stuff to the side because it's so damn blinding.  I honestly am okay with political stuff being removed from this sub because this sub is built on rejecting our government, you know?  It's like coming into a sports thread and posting math questions...Some sports guys know math, but maybe that guy should take the discussion to the math forum.  That's all.  Either way, I'm glad everyone is here.  I think it's impossible not to click around here and not have your world view changed.  We are on a pretty wild journey together right now

       Ok, but most conspiracies revolve around government. Plus the biggest threads here would be purged. It may be what you want but not what the majority of the sub wants.

       Well that's my point, the last 6 months there has been mass efforts to divide this sub with politics.  I think our goal should be to get them to move beyond politics.  Politics is their gateway drug and what lead them to r/conspiracy, but now we need to show them that these false idols cannot divide us.  We are capable of much more together and these politicians are shaping our reality because we let them.  As the saying goes "it starts with you"

       is exactly what shilling is. It's spam, it discredits the sub, insults its user base,  and frankly is a violation of rules 10 and 12 of the sub.

       Me too!  I like the Argentina connection to that theory.  We were always told Hitler went to Argentina...The closest you can get to Antarctica.  I watched an Admiral Bryd video as well and he seemed to be telling half the story while alluding that we may need to start thinking bigger about the place.  I wonder if warmer water below the ice/soil carved out underground tunnels...Do you think that would be possible?  Or are you kind of thinking that the Earth is hollow in a very real sense?  I lean towards the tunnels/caves being carved out over millions of years

       Obviously, don't worry though, this sub has no bearing on what will actually happen to him if it's all true, they can spam their shit here all they like but it won't change anything.

       I don't know, shill, why don't you find actual dirt on Trump and start a thread here. You'll find that people are willing to accept things when they have actual evidence, and not puppet CNN journalists telling us how reality is supposed to be.

       Posting the same "complaint" about the sub again and again is spam, and we remove spam. We also lock out persistent complainers when it has become clear they have no intention of contributing in a constructive way.

       this person has only posted this one as far as I can see ... and it's been downvoted to invisibility ... seems like removing the post is simply silencing people's right to an opinion.
