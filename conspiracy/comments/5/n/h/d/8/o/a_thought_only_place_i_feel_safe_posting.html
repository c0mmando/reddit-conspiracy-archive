    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, it isn&#39;t so simple. &quot;Jew&quot; was a word like terrorist or witch or communist - it was used more as a way to imprison &quot;unwanted&quot; people, usually poor or antifacist, and use them for slave labor and human experiments. These things happen because people always think it&#39;s the &quot;other&quot; evil person in society and that&#39;s the only way people will support it. You have to have a negative label that can be put on whoever. See I checked your DNA and your Jew, send him to the camps boys ! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prison labor is atrocious. Watched some docus following prisoners and they all dole out the same spiel that &quot;x is really turning his life around, building desks at the wood shop for extra commissary/$10 a day&#39; and I&#39;m like wait, what? A lot of these guys take up work because it gets them out of their concrete zoo cage for a few hours or will help build a good record and they&#39;re basically being used like slaves while getting compensated a few dollars they can&#39;t even spend or some chocolate and ramen. </p>

<p>Then there was that thing about Whole Foods using prison labor to process their food products without paying them. They &#39;promised: to end the program but they could just as easily run it in a different state without getting found out until much later. Shit&#39;s sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much do they pay in rent? Monthly grocery bill? The people that are rightfully in prison, people that refuse to follow the rules of society, belong there. If not, what&#39;s the alternative? It&#39;s a tough moral argument. My point is they are housed, fed, and provided utilities free of charge. Why should they be compensated? And if they should then shouldn&#39;t they also be billed for housing, food, and utilities so the citizens who are acting responsibly don&#39;t have to provide for them via taxes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I normally keep my mouth shut but this is an area I&#39;m actually very closely familiar with. Not all prisons in the US are carbon copy slave labor camps. My relative had been in Max security since 2007 and will be there the rest of his life. Not only is he paid decent wages to work skill based jobs but he has a hobby that pulls in thousands of dollars a month. This provides him with enough money to sustain a relationship with a woman in a foreign country and allows him to take college credits. He is on a softball team, learned how to play the guitar, trained service dogs, and watches popular new release movies and TV. All free from the pressures of society. While some prisons treat there inmates poorly, my relative (a violent crime offender) is treated incredibly well. You may say it&#39;s for his best interest, and that he is being &quot;rehabilitated&quot; but no one is looking to medicate him for the mental illness that got him there in the first place. It&#39;s a touchy subject, but there are two sides to every story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re an Ashkenazi Jew, then you&#39;re likely Khazar - i.e. anglo with lineage from the Khazars.  The Khazar Ahskenazi Jew lineage is a pretty maddeningly manipulating one where elite Khazars have pretty much used their influence to manipulate anyone that&#39;s <em>not</em> an elite Khazar.</p>

<p>During WWII, elite (banking/money) Ashkenazi Khazars made sure and actually funded Hitler&#39;s rise to power so that he could imprison fellow Jews (among many other people prisoned, but the elite Khazars were only worried about making sure that Ashkenazi Khazars were imprisoned) and, by covertly aiding and abetting Hitler&#39;s war machine, Hitler grew in power and was able to - yes - have the concentration camps and kill many people - Khazars and non-Khazars.  The elite Khazars used their manipulation of money to eventually help win WWII, but after the war, they could then really drive home a heavily guilt-laden narrative to the rest of the world designed to paint themselves as perpetual victims.  They used The Balfour Declaration to eventually secure a portion of Palestine, call is &quot;Israel&quot;, and establish that as a Khazar stronghold.</p>

<p>This is a brief (super brief, of course) history of Khazar influence over recent history.  It&#39;s very different than what Ashkenazis are told and indoctrinated with as they&#39;re growing up, so it&#39;s no surprise that you may not be aware of this information.  However, as far as <em>you&#39;re</em> personally concerned, I&#39;d say just focus and concentrate on being a good person.  Don&#39;t worry about being a &quot;Jew&quot; or &quot;white&quot; or &quot;black&quot; or whatever you are.  Be a good <em>person</em>.  Don&#39;t worry about where you come from.  Worry about <em>who you are</em> and what you&#39;re doing for yourself and others.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be racist.  Don&#39;t be an asshole.  Be cool, be nice, be respectful.  Treat everyone with respect and honor and I feel you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make good points. I think that the average ashkenazi Jew is clueless regarding the facts of their own religion as well as the facts surrounding the founding of Israel and Israel&#39;s current policies and agendas. </p>

<p>Israel/Zionism keeps the average Jew clueless and afraid by trumping up charges of anti-semitism and inducing a constant state of existential anxiety in the average Jew to keep them voting to support Israel and Zionism. The constant barrage of fear keeps Jews feeling that they need a &quot;homeland&quot; to which to flee, so that they will support that &quot;homeland&quot; no matter how odious its policies and behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, interesting. Well an interesting video about the Zionist agenda is <a href="https://youtu.be/SW1hCKHQ9bg">https://youtu.be/SW1hCKHQ9bg</a>. It&#39;s called &quot;Banned in Britian: A Zionist Conspiracy.&quot; It is very informative. Deals with WW1 and WW2 as well as the quest for Israel/Palestine at that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you suggesting it didn&#39;t happen or that it wasn&#39;t 6 million Jews? Either way I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong. But seriously, you&#39;ve come to your conclusion based on &quot;feelings&quot; while visiting a place? &quot;It just didn&#39;t feel like 6 million people died here.&quot; How does this prove anything? It&#39;s like walking into houses and going &quot;well this one doesn&#39;t feel haunted,&quot; &quot;Oh boy this house must be haunted, don&#39;t you feel it?&quot; </p>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong about your visit/experience, but last I checked feelings don&#39;t prove anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, thank you for this. I know how you feel. But ultimately waking up is liberating. That anguish will first transform into anger, and then it will disappear. You are much wiser now than you were a few months ago.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, I recommend you watch the David Cole (Stein) documentary on Auschwitz. He went there, and spoke to the curator, and internationally acclaimed specialist of the Holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My Dad said he left the religion becuse they didn&#39;t answer his questions about their book. Well. It was shortly after his family went to Germany that he left as a kid. I have a feeling he didn&#39;t question the book but the holocaust and they threw him out. I&#39;m not angry. I&#39;m sad that it&#39;s that easy to fool people and that there are people who would do this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  found this book  to be particularly eye opening. Reading this book led me to research Zionism  and the real history of Israel much deeper. I thought it was well written, sourced and just a really good read.</p>

<p>I do  not think anyone can read this book and look at our world in the same way ever again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting situation here that seems to beg a question: What happens to an ashkenazi Jew who gets redpilled? They won&#39;t be accepted into the woke alt-right circles because many on that side would say that their &quot;blood&quot; makes them inherently untrustworthy, but they&#39;ll be rejected by the Jewish circles they are used to moving in and called self-hating Jews. </p>

<p>It kinda seems like they have nowhere to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 3 or 4 hundred years from now the history books will say 6 billion people died in the Holocaust and some student will say to there teacher &quot;Mr. Soandso there were only 7 billion people on the planet at that time.&quot; And his teacher well tell him he&#39;s sounding kind of antisemitic </p>
