    <div class="md"><p>I view this sub as having a vague libertarian Right bias, personally; although the moderators do well in keeping things non-partisan.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know how to view myself politically, these days.  I support (or at least used to) most of progressivism&#39;s basic goals, in terms of gender equality, racial equality, and such; but at this point I also consider most individual Leftists I observe to be inexcusably verminous in terms of their behaviour.  I&#39;ve grown deeply sick of the hypocrisy, hearing about the ironically named &quot;anti-fascist&quot; violence, the self-righteousness, their abuse of the downvoting system here on Reddit, and the usual devious Marxist assumption that their beliefs are simply obvious, inevitable truths, to the point where anyone who rejects them deserves to be subjected to relentless belittlement, condescension, and general malice.</p>

<p>The Left are tyrants, as far as I am concerned.  Devious, cowardly, hypocritical, utterly contemptible tyrants.  I don&#39;t like the sort of authoritarian violence that fascists advocate, either; but at least the average fascist I&#39;ve seen is honest and direct about their desire to use violence.  The Left claim openly to be pacifists, but will then rationalise the use of violence against anyone they disagree with, after the fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a non-partisan sub because the majority of users here regard politics with some disdain, and see the division of the entrenched elite into artificial camps are a smokescreen.</p>

<p>That said, the mass media&#39;s slavish support for Hillary Clinton - probably the most compromised presidential candidate in US history - was bound to cause a strong counter-reaction on this sub. The blatant electoral corruption by Hillary Clinton and the DNC against Bernie Sanders simply confirmed our assessment of her. </p>

<p>This had the unintended effect of attracting thousands of new users who were/are Trump supporters looking for validation where most of reddit was hostile to them. These new users will take time to assimilate, and some may migrate away if the Trump presidency starts showing signs of corruption, because that would be reflected on the front page. My hope would be that new users who came because of Trump will stay and be critical of him if shows signs of becoming part of the deep state himself.</p>

If we can eliminate their influence, the entire &quot;blame the other idiots&quot; strategy wont work. This is our version of divide and conquer.
