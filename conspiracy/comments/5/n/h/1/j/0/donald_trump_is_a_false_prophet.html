       I understand why so many people have been charmed by Donald Trump. For one, he is a very charismatic character. You may disagree, however there's no denying that the man knows how to disarm people with his straightforward talk and "no bullshit" mannerisms. His status as a self made wealthy figure is the epitome of the American Dream, and he claims to have a vast knowledge of the mechanics of business, which we would desperately need in a president given our country's disastrous economic situation. His most appealing characteristic however, is his impression of being
       <strong>
        outside
       </strong>
       of the global elite system of control. His supporters believe that he is truly independent and could not be swayed by political persuasion. This has lured many of us in the "conspiracy community" into lending him out trust for the moment. After all, we were able to stop the Clinton campaign from securing a rigged election, right? We beat the system, didn't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm here to tell you that I believe Trump is actually a carefully placed Trojan Horse, A false prophet. I'm actually surprised more of us aren't immediately skeptical of this guy. We have been burned on the last how many presidents? And we're just going to put blind faith into this guy, and assume the globalists didn't have some sort of influence over this guy? You know the social engineers are going to expand and contract their narrative to trick us and lure is into a situation that is beneficial to their success in creating a world government, and it makes perfect sense that they would try to lure the "conspiracy community" and the conservative base toward a false prophet who has the impression of an independent, non corrupt "Everyman" that we can trust. Alex Jones held the fucking torch and led his supporters into pledging allegiance to him. At that point I knew something was off, because Jones used to preach that the two party system was a ruse, a scam to divide the people into two ideologies. He is now obviously controlled opposition, and it's pretty depressing because he used to be relatively legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea that the media was constantly attacking him only adds credibility to the narrative that he was an "outsider" and that the system didn't want him to be elected. However, he got TONS of publicity from all of those attacks and that just fueled his fanbase into a growth, because it made him look like a real threat to the system, and that earned the trust of even skeptical supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was all done by design folks, planned years in advance. Now, since they effectively deemed Trump and his suppprters as the face of "Racist" and "misogynyst" culture (which I'll admit, I don't believe the majority of his supporters are racist at all, they are good hardworking people who just want to believe in a political figure who is on their side and he was appealing to them), the liberal side of the spectrum is fueled with hatred against them and the stage is set for some sort of civil unrest or massive social fallout. Again, this is all being done by design, and they are going to try and lure the independent thinkers like us who don't trust the establishment and the Clintons into throwing our support behind a false prophet authoritarian puppet. You
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think he's going to audit the federal reserve?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think he's going to investigate 9/11? Fuck no, I'm sorry to say it but just appears as if this guy was simply playing a predetermined role, of a self made business man who was an outsider that would appeal to our community.
       <strong>
        And worst of all, if the "conspiracy community" becomes associated with Trump, it will delegitimize everything we stand for because he is demonized in so many people's minds. It will discredit our message, whether you believe he's legit or not.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I still believe Trump supporters have our best interests at heart and believe in what we do. They know the fed is out of control, that the monetary system is rigged, that 9/11 was staged to justify foreign wars and warrantless spying, that criminal elements have taken control of our government, and they are fucking our lives up. We need to unite and band together, but I urge you all to remain critically skeptical of Donald Trump, because I believe he may very well be a false prophet that was specifically chosen by the elite and marketed to us the way he was in an attempt to create an undercover "outsider" false prophet, to be used as a catylist for the impending social unrest that awaits.

Most of us here are non partisan. We shouldn't be forced to be synonymous with Donald Trump, it could discredit our cause.

       That's why we shouldn't jump to any conclusions either for or against him until we see what he does in office. I can see why he's embraced by some conspiracy theorists. He's openly talked about conspiracy theories and he's talked about draining the swamp. Not to mention the fact that the media, DNC, CIA, and his own party, the GOP, have tried to sabotage his presidency before it even begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, anybody who's been into conspiracies long enough knows that everything is usually a carefully scripted play. Once you add in Trump's appointments and his stance on Israel, it should make us pause for concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think either side could be equally right, and I'm already dreading all of the posts saying, "You see? I told you so! You're all sheep." I'm taking a very neutral approach until I see what happens in the first few months, but deep down I'm praying that things finally change for the better

       I envy your ability to remain neutral. I feel very invested in this at this point and just want it to work, for the benefit of us all. But it seems like people are determined for it not to work out, I don't know.  It seems like people on both sides are starting to lose their grasp on reality. And not just regular people but in the government as well.

       Oh, I completely agree with you. Even if I'm neutral on Trump at the moment, I still hate people trying to sacrifice the guy before he's even stepped into the Oval Office. To me it all seems like a pathetic effort to cover up corruption. And it makes me sick that people are more worried about their corruption being exposed than they are about the state of our nation.

       When the 'trump prophecy' made its appearance, I knew something was up. Think about it, in the eyes of the government, who is the scariest demographic when it comes to revolt? White conservative Christians. What better way to convince them he is on their side than a fake prophecy?

       I hate this concept, why does every leader have to be instantly praised/compared or thought of as a prophet? As someone who is a christian, and has come to understand the definition of a prophet, the only "not-false prophet" is Jesus, and I have never thought of any person as Jesus, not Trump, not Bill Clinton, not Ozzy Osborne, not Dwayne Wade, and certainly not Obama. And for muslims, the only prophet is Mohammad and Jews don't believe their prophet will ever come, and they are the only three groups I have come to understand believe in prophets, so what group of people are you exactly speaking towards? In all seriousness, the tendency of humans to instantly think of any leader in any way relating to a divine prophet is one of the biggest pitfalls of humanity, it results in destructive herd mentality.

       (Sacrilege!) I wish people would just think of people as people and not divine entities for once, I think people believing that certain leaders are undeniably pure because of divine status makes people so blind and easily herded.

       I would most likely bet that all traces of 9/11 were destroyed or carried out of the federal government by this past chain administration, it could be possible Trump is in the same boat, he knows the prior administrative chain was behind it, but there is no proof to back up substantiated claims. I think for the present, there will be no expose of past incidents, especially because an incredible amount of work needs to be put forth in matters of the present and not the past, if his motives for MAGA are to be believed. One thing is for certain, this should be a very interesting period of time.

       Do you have any constructive input to offer regarding trump? Because, yes, I truly believe they are trying to fool us into supporting him...This is a very real concern and I'd like the conspiracy community to be aware of this.

       Chaos my friend, is the best answer to this question. Chaos is not the part of any well construed plan formulated for the white-house. On the streets? In other countries? In religious places of worship? Yes, the Clinton lineage wants chaos there, but not in the white-house or the seat of power of their ilk. Trump is a wild card, but with all of the chaos he is creating, I can definitely say he is not working for them. I can also say he is definitely not a prophet or the ultimate focal point for this battle to uncover and reclaim the government, but he is creating chaos, which gives the nation time for me people to become self-aware. So I am definitely for the movement of the Trump Train, especially if it means colliding and steamrolling every known enemy entity while we can formulate from the shadows. It is far better for the nation right now that our true enemies fight among themselves.

       Wait is that a mainstream christian belief? I was sure that they called him the messiah and that there were prophets in the old testament prophesying the coming of the messiah. I'm currently reading the bible cover to cover but not terribly far into it.

       Mainstream Christian belief is that Jesus replaced the bearings of the old testament and is the only Prophet, or human with divine interpretation from God, his father. Besides the sect of fundamentalist Christian's, the old testament is more or less of little practical concern and is obsolete and not based on evidence, more or less a book of stories. Take it with a grain of salt is my best advice because on one hand, if you believe everything in the entire bible is the word of God, then from the old testament you have to believe the world is 7,000 years old among many other things proven not factual.

       I mean, I agree for the most part but Truth Seekers are already demonized and delegitimized in most people's minds. That's why they call us Conspiratards, Truthers or whatever else...
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assertion that the true conspiracy theorists here are non-partisan and don't trust either side is dead-on, though. It does feel like there's a very targeted attack to have us defend Trump to the point where we become synonymous or called shills because we don't believe the bullshit in the media.

       Relax, And does everybody have to bring up the bible shit here? Can we kind of take a step back and collect ourselves here? I wanted to highlight to notion that I believe the Trump supporters and the conspiracy community share many similar beliefs and should unite their ideals. They are going to try and divide us over him, you can already see it happening on this forum. Don't fall for it.

       I agree.  Not even sworn in yet.  Very few will support him if he doesn't deliver on campaign promises.  There are always people that put blind faith into politicians.  That wont change.  But we have to give him a chance and until he fails us, I believe we should support him.

       Lol Trump has proven me wrong time and time again. The whole shadow government is against Trump. He's destroying the mainstream media. You seriously expect me that this is all for show? That kind of skepticism is unhealthy. I'm going to see what Trump does in the first 100 days, but for now I'm going to be unapologetically optimistic as fuck.

       To me trump is a phenomenon in American politics that is a little unique. I think this warrants close scrutiny or at least not turning a blind eye. If he is some catalyst for the globalist agenda we did a piss poor job outing him. I can't predict the future though so maybe he will deliver all his campaign promises. I don't lean that way though.

       I would have to agree with Hubris_elite, because if things with Trump go south into the enemies plans, then it will be more important than ever to follow politics because action will be needed more than ever. Trump was the first politician I ever really "followed" as-well although I dug more into his past than I did his current political race until now as hes President-elect, but if he serves the Illuminati times will become increasingly dangerous for anyone who stands out, so I will be watching more intently than ever for at least my own personal safety.

       Cool copy pasta. I've seen this all over my conspiracy outlets lately. His not a false prophet, or a prophet nor is he any kind of savior. He's a guy. A guy who got lucky. A guy who MIGHT be able to bring some shit to light.

       In some ways I can see why people support Trump. However, I have no idea how folks believe he's an 'anti-establishment' figure. 
I think he's a glorified con-artist. And a not very convincing one at that.
Fwiw, I think the vast majority of politicians are con-artists as well.
Donald just seems so extra transparent to me.

       People who
       <strong>
        want
       </strong>
       to be a leader almost always have hidden agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great leader should view the ultimate position of power as an honorable burden and would woefully accept an appointment to such a place in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Trump really wants to be a servant of the people?  Has he done anything in his life to indicate he is not a self-serving elitist?  I would argue Trump is easily defined as the opposite of this in every fiber of his being, along with his entire cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a lot more decent people to choose political careers as an honorable burden, rather than a career/business/social opportunity, if we are ever going to begin diluting the corruption entrenched in global politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need large scale organizing in every state to start recruiting, creating, and voting for third party candidates (neither the Democratic or Republican party are the answer at this point) if we stand any chance of breaking the shackles of crony capitalism.  Think about this over the next four years as the ruling elite (including and especially Trump) continue to wage war, destroy the environment, marginalize the poor, and enslave the common person with debt.

       That's ridiculous. You're a conspiracy theorist, you're supposed to be skeptical of everything, especially a government tool like Trump. I am ok with giving him a chance to prove that he's truly an outsider, however I will NOT give him the benefit of the doubt, because he has not earned my trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't put so much trust and faith into a political figure, especially as a conspiracy theorist, who is supposed to embrace the idea of skepticism toward the state and smaller government, not shady authoritarian figures...

       I'm still under the impression that it is better to remain cautious of our newly elected president than to lend ANY of our support to him. We have been burned on the last how many presidents? It's a fucking cycle, and it's embarrassing. Every 4 years, we vote out the guy who fucked everything up and we put a new guy in. Garbage out, garbage in. And people still always seem to think, "hey, this time this guy is gonna be for real! He's gonna actually make things better for us I know it!"....

       Wow I know we have a lot of rt wing Christians that may think that but if you study the Word of God and understand you will realize this is Satans time period. So anyone in office especially the President will be bushing the agenda of the NWO/Illuminate it is what it is. So no Trump is not a "prophet" he's just trying to make America great. He knows that he's a pawn he knows he's going to have to buckle on somethings but he will do all he can.
