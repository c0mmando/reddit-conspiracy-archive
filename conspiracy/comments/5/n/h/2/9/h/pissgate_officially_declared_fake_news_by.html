<p>Some gems</p>

<p>&quot;President-elect Donald Trump was not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week&#39;s intelligence briefing, according to a senior intelligence official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted &quot;disinformation.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>So this means BuzzFeed, CNN, NYT, and multiple other outlets published unsourced claims that were supposed to be examples of &quot;disinformation&quot; in intelligence meetings. Quite a big blow to media credibility.</p>

<p>Edit: And some more from James Clapper</p>

<p>&quot;We also discussed the private security company document, which was widely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the IC became aware of it. I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 2: MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd, who was highly critical of Trump this cycle, drilling BuzzFeed Editor Chief and telling him &quot;You are publishing fake news&quot; at a little past 1/3 of the way in. Terrible interview in regards to BuzzFeed&#39;s credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You totally editoralized this headline tho my friend. They didn&#39;t day the intel was fake or fake news. Appearently the only information here is that the officials didn&#39;t leave the 2 page paper copy of the summary of the allegations, but only briefed orally. You left this out of your &quot;gems&quot; information. The article itself says what buzzfeed said from go, that this is unverified information. NBC did not contradict Buzzfeed here, only I suppose officials who said they gave Trump team a brief. But way to hyper editorialize your headline so as to make it seem like the whole story is bunkiss.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that the story originated online as the 35 page document as disinformation. From there Trump, Obama, and company all were briefed on real information and disinformation as mentioned in the article. Someone in the meeting probably ended up leaking the story, which the article hints at being &quot;NeverTrumpers/antiTrump Republicans&quot; (maybe McCain)? From there CNN was drawing straws and published the 2 page story, followed by BuzzFeed sending the whole thing, all of which wasn&#39;t presented at the meeting, but was probably provided by McCain or some other NeverTrumper. From there, the MI6 thing is probably a farse. MI6 knows how to correctly spell &quot;Alfa Group&quot; and wouldn&#39;t put stuff like &quot;Mrs Obama (whom he hates)&quot; in an official report. It&#39;s way too sketch for my opinion, and is probably meant to discredit Trump or in general destabilize trust in media/cause misinformation everywhere. Leaning towards the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they named the former MI6 guy who was responsible for it, and supposedly he&#39;s fled his home in fear of his safety. According to reports, the guy runs a consulting firm now, and this brief was drafted on his part as a civilian, and not in any official capacity for the U.K. government. If you haven&#39;t seen the article I&#39;m talking about, I could probably find a link</p>

<p>It&#39;s only tabloids reporting this at the moment which strengthens my position in my opinion. How would a guy running a consulting firm get this info, and why would a senior intelligence official claim it was an example of disinformation? If he was scared for his life, why would he give his name to the press? If he was retired he wouldn&#39;t have a security clearance, so how is he trusted with this information? Why was NBC discrediting the dossier on their talk news shows tonight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they specifically are. By claiming the summary was an example of disinformation provided by the IC for Trump, that means the story CNN originally ran is false factually and completely unreal.

This is fake news 101: put out a false story, biased orgs like CNN bite it, sites like reddit eat it up and talk about it for a day or two, make gigantic 10k+ comment threads on compromised subreddits like politics. </p>

<p>Then later its debunked, but the news of that doesn&#39;t get traction, so now a % of people are going to carry on believing it&#39;s real.

    <div class="md"><p>What the likes of Facebook are implementing is a removal of the profit factor in fake news. It&#39;s not &quot;internet regulation&quot; because it&#39;s private corporations deciding what&#39;s allowed on their platform, in the same way a newspaper decides which Letters to the Editor they publish.</p>

<p>Most of the fake news spammed during the election cycle had a profit motive. It was all clickbait designed to register clicks / ad impressions with Google&#39;s/Facebook&#39;s ad platforms, and they got paid every time someone clicked on a link which said &quot;EXPOSED: Hillary part of satanist pizzeria cult&quot;.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s happening is sites are removing the profit motive from fake news. You&#39;re still free to post that Obama is a secret Kenyan atheist Muslim, but no matter how many times someone clicks on your link Google and Facebook won&#39;t pay you a cent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s being called &quot;censorship&quot;...by people who think private companies are obligated to carry your speech even when it&#39;s fake news (&quot;Obama is a Kenyan&quot;, &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot;, &quot;Here&#39;s proof the Earth is hollow&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It IS censorship. By allowing this BuzzFeed story to trend even though it fits every category for fake news, leads to me believing FB is bias. I really don&#39;t think you understand. By popularizing the term &quot;fake news&quot;, as seen by both sides of the establishment aisle, it gives the Trump admin leverage to continue to undermine the press. During Obama&#39;s term the Smith-Mundt Act was repealed, Counter Foreign Propaganda Act, and the most recent NDAA was passed. Here&#39;s a good thread I made about the actions taken over the last year, and there is no doubt in my mind Trump will continue to attack freedom of the press and internet freedoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think it&#39;s censorship because Facebook didn&#39;t censor Buzzfeed&#39;s story? It&#39;s you who doesn&#39;t understand what Facebook/Google have proposed. </p>

<p>They&#39;re going to <strong>stop paying</strong> websites who publish clickbait fake news through their ad platforms. Every time someone clicks on a YouTube video or FB link about pizzagate or Obama being a secret Kenyan, the author gets paid a set amount. That&#39;s how ad networks work. These news articles/videos only exist because of the ad revenue generated through FB/Google&#39;s ad platforms and what you&#39;re going to see is their numbers will hugely diminish once their FB/Google funding is cut.</p>

<p>Why the hell should Facebook/Google be forced to fund other websites, especially if they only exist to make money by exploting clickbait fake news? It&#39;s the free market in action; private entity doesn&#39;t like its platform being spammed by partisan shills, announces it will no longer pay random unverifiable blogs 0.1 cents a click or whatever the going rate is.</p>

<p>This is no different to a newspaper or reputable website refusing to give money to a site which claims vaccines are being used by the CIA to control our children by making them autistic.</p>

<p>So, make your mind up. Do you believe in the free market - in which case Facebook/Google are free to ban disinformation peddlers from receiving ad revenue from them - or do you believe private entities should be forced to fund pro-Trump anti-everybody else &quot;journalism&quot; which is actually just a front to make money for the website owner?</p>

<p>This is not entirely true. I have worked at an ad agency and ad revenues for site like these are not massive. Besides the clickbait right-wing sites that have millions of followers, the smaller sites pushing stories you claim are &quot;fake&quot; are not netting a lot of profit.</p>

<p>The problem with your argument is Facebook has outsourced the fact checking to Snopes which has it&#39;s own problems of receiving third party funds and it&#39;s current husband-wife combo splitting due to the dude spending 90k on prostitutes. Facebook can continue to do this, and I defend their right to do it but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t believe they have a hidden agenda. Just like Twitter banning only bots of the Republican party during the election, many believed they had an agenda and switched to ga.ia (sp?) which is exactly the free market at work. </p>

<p>You are claiming that unsourced claims from anonymous sources about golden showers is okay for FB to allow trend with zero evidence (besides a document claimed fake by MSNBC and the senior intell officer NBC cites). There is nothing stopping FB from doing this in my book, but it&#39;s only furthering the distrust in media which I believe will lead to worse QOL for Americans.</p>

<p>This is false. The videos were never found to be false and actually led to defunding, in both the PP and ACORN cases. There was illegal recording involved (violating state laws) which led to a settlement being reached with O&#39;Keefe in the ACORN videos, but the veracity of the videos has yet to be successfully challenged even with the unedited footage released. I would urge you to look into it further.</p>

<p>For PP: </p>

<p>After O&#39;Keefe&#39;s four audio recordings were publicized in 2008, Planned Parenthood of Ohio issued a public response, saying the worker&#39;s words were &quot;a violation of any policy, and it&#39;s very upsetting.&quot; The CEO said, &quot;Planned Parenthood has a long history of social justice.&quot;[39] Other offices noted the wide variety of services the organization offers to low income communities.[40] African-American leaders called for withdrawal of public financing of the organization.</p>

<p>For ACORN:</p>

<p>After the videos were released through the fall of 2009, the U.S. Congress quickly voted to freeze federal funding to ACORN.[47] The Census Bureau and the IRS terminated their contract relationships with ACORN.[48] By December 2009, an external investigation of ACORN was published that cleared it of any illegality, while noting that its poor management practices contributed to unprofessional actions by some low-level employees.[49][50][51][52] In March 2010, ACORN announced it would dissolve due to loss of funding from government and especially private sources. </p>

<p>According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted &quot;disinformation.&quot;</p>

<p>The briefers also had available to them unvetted &quot;disinformation&quot; about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump.</p>

Appearently the only information here is that the officials didn&#39;t leave the 2 page paper copy of the summary of the allegations, but only briefed orally. You left this out of your &quot;gems&quot; information. The article itself says what buzzfeed said from go, that this is unverified information. NBC did not contradict Buzzfeed here, only I suppose officials who said they gave Trump team a brief.

<p>&quot;According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted &quot;disinformation.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>In the body. CNN published the 2 pages summary which was an example of disinformation which was meant to be compared to real info intelligence had found. BuzzFeed then digs up the story from back in June when this happened and publishes the story created by &quot;anti-Trump Republicans&quot;)&quot;It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats). This is implying that the document is a hoax. Unless you want to argue CNN&#39;s summary is a completely different document, but good luck with that since they&#39;ve both confirmed they are regarding the same &quot;story.&quot; Correct me where you think I&#39;m reading this wrong.</p>

<p>So a sourced man by the name of Steve Pieczenik has parading around the pizzagate theory since it started to hit the news. He has made many tweets like this <a href="https://twitter.com/StevePieczenik/status/805594630645489664">https://twitter.com/StevePieczenik/status/805594630645489664</a> and others claiming pedophilia blackmail is common in our government. The media has not picked up on the story at all and has immediately discounted it to fake news. The difference in these two allegations, pissgate and pizzagate, is that Steve has worked at the highest levels of our government, worked under Kissenger, and ISNT an anonymous source. And that&#39;s just one of the credible people claiming this happens. Why wasn&#39;t this guy, a former LA FBI Chief, given the respect of the media when he talked about crazy things he believed he knew were happening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open if anyone wants to disprove what I&#39;ve claimed. I&#39;m stating there is no circumstantial or solid evidence for this case. Pizzagate was derived from DKIM verifiable emails that built upon a theory that had been around since the 80s; you can&#39;t base the claim off of an infographic when there&#39;s hours of reading and evidence based off research on the topic. I&#39;m not saying pizzagate is legitimate, but no one has stepped up and shown any proof on pissgate&#39;s behalf. If someone found an IG page that had Russians connected with the hotel laughing about Michelle Obama being pissed on back in June, then sure there&#39;s merit. But the fact that everyone is veering away from the story, specifically NBC, MSNBC, and the IC, leads me to believe this is a nonstory.</p>

<p>Far more troubling are the treasonous actions the document alleges.

<p>Global warming, like evolution and the science which shows tobacco causes cancer, is fact. If someone can&#39;t accept that then they are objectively stupid.</p>

<p>Now, Donald Trump being an agent of the Kremlin, brought to power by Russian disinformation and the useful idiots in the alt-right media with the assistance of fascist elements in the FBI - that&#39;s an interesting theory worth investigating, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to argue global warming with you, but if you think the science behind global warming isn&#39;t totally politicized and anti-scientific in so many ways, including arbitrary models being used to make predictions, not a single one which has turned out to be true; the complete refusal for the warmest to have any public debate on the issue; the issue of &quot;consensus,&quot; not a scientific construct, as the main argument for its veracity (look up Cook study, which is totally flawed), the billions and billions of dollars behind climate research and blackballing/character assassination and refusal to fund of any researchers whose work challenges the &quot;consensus;&quot; the IPCC&#39;s corruption (see Climategate), then you&#39;re objectively close minded and ignorant. </p>

<p>Climate science and global warming research is NOT equivalent to the theory of evolution and the science that shows tobacco causes cancer--it could not be farther from it. </p>

<p>The case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Skuratov">Yury Skuratov</a> is one example of this happening:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 1999, then FSB Chief Vladimir Putin and Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin held a televised press conference in which they discussed a video that had aired nationwide March 17 on the state-controlled Russia TV channel which showed a naked man very similar to Skuratov, in bed with two young women.[2] This video was released after he began looking into charges of corruption by President Boris Yeltsin and his associates and the video itself is said to serve as kompromat.[3]</p>

<p>Now that you know such a thing has happened, do you find it more plausible that both Trump and the Obamas might have been subject to surveillance while in Moscow?</p>

<p>It is completely unlikely that any security detail would allow a POTUS to stay in such an unsecured environment that there was potential for it to be rigged up with cameras for surveillance.

<p>Yes, we&#39;ve established that surveillance was unlikely to succeed when going against the USSS. But that doesn&#39;t make it any less likely that intelligence agencies <em>attempt</em> to perform surveillance, does it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they could have captured video of him sleeping, they could have poisoned or assassinated him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m trying to debate this in good faith, but this argument makes no sense at all. Don&#39;t you think people might notice if the president was assassinated during a trip to Russia? Sorry, but this line of reasoning is not logical.</p>

<p>Do you remember the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/15/world/the-bugged-embassy-case-what-went-wrong.html?pagewanted=all">Russians bugging the US embassy</a>? By your reasoning, they would not have bugged the building - they would have blown it up instead.</p>

<p>So it makes no sense to say that &quot;Obama was not recorded, because they would have poisoned him instead&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the likelihood of successfully surveilling Obama has no bearing whatsoever on whether they attempted to record Trump, which is the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Trump himself has said that he warns his bodyguards about hidden cameras in foreign hotels, and specifically mentioned Russia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you’re gonna probably have cameras. I’m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even Trump agrees that high-profile foreign visitors, and their security details, would be subject to attempted surveillance in Russia.</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear that there is a consensus here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As it turned out later, no matter how the media tried to present this document as something official,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BBC, Guardian and NY Times all very clearly stated that this was not official evidence, but a document created by a private firm hired to do opposition research. I&#39;m sure there were people who believed it was an official document, but to say that &quot;the media tried to present it as something official&quot; is false, unless you narrow that down by stating which media sources claimed this was an official IC document.</p>

<p>What it says is that Trump had prostitutes piss on each other in the bed that the Obama&#39;s slept in.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, it doesn&#39;t matter if that was <em>really</em> the bed they slept on, or if someone just told him it was, or if he just likes watersports in general. The damming piece of that puzzle is that he watched prostitutes urinating on each other.</p>

<p>And the stuff about russian watersports is easily the least important accusation there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake news (NBC) declaring Fake news (pissgate) to be Fake.</p>

<p>We live in a world where the fact is fake and the fake is fact.</p>

<p>Because-</p>

<p>Every one is a shill and disinfo agent, unless they agree with the same koolaid propaganda you also happen to be slurping. Then they are awake, obvi!</p>

<p>Which Means-</p>

<p>Kids can&#39;t use logic anymore because there aren&#39;t facts anymore. Facts, postulates- and the like -these are the lego building blocks, the elements, from which a thoughtful conclusion can be built up.</p>

<p>When the kids are stripped of the ability to construct thoughts, they are left to work things out only with emotions. Really this is what most people prefer anyway.</p>

<p>Those facts which build thoughts are memes, the original memes, the concept of the smallest coherent unit of an idea, as the gene is to the genome. R. Dawkins style, dogs.</p>

<p>Our current internet era memes are just the smallest coherent feeling in the expression of an emotion.</p>

<p>Emotional memes have replaced thoughtful memes in modern communication. The vagueness of symbol has devoured the distinctiveness of the word. Kek the image, the heiroglyph, has replaced Webster, the dictionary of distinct language.</p>

<p>Sure, communication always had this duality of the interplay of vagueness and clarity, the definite and the open to interpretation, the intellectual and the emotional. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that now the scales have been tipped and our language has been and continues to ever more be reformed towards the emotional, the ephemeral, the symbolic, the intuitive. The wave instead of the particle. The words of English, written and spoken, are becoming more like pictures, as we use pictures (Pepe and other such fuckers) more like words.</p>

<p>Control the language people use and you control the thoughts of those people, literally. As you read these words, I am controlling the informational content that is flowing through your mind ;) Language has the same effect on the control of emotions. Reform language to be more vague and emotional and less rational and viola, the people&#39;s minds are now more emotional too.</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t waking up, no, people are just being stirred up.</p>

<p>MSM have said they can&#39;t verify the claims. They knew about the claims during elections already, but didn&#39;t report them because there was no way of verifying it. Now they reported because the intelligence agencies came forward with it. How can you not report about that? </p>

<p>And yes, even now, NYTimes never claimed that it was true. They were reporting what intelligence agencies said.</p>

<p>&quot;We also discussed the private security company document, which was widely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the IC became aware of it. I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Can you guys not read what&#39;s in the OP? This DID not come from the IC according to the DNI. Unless you have some special information, then this is a completely baseless accusation to make by BuzzFeed. I don&#39;t even like Trump, but this is obviously promoting the &quot;fake news&quot; poison. Trump already called CNN &quot;fake news&quot; which is not going to be good for the people in the long run when Trump starts dismantling the freedom of the press.</p>
