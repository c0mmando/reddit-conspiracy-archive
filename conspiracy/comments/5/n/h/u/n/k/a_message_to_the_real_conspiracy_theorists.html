        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">739</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/lovelycoconuts91.html">lovelycoconuts91</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, if you clicked this, I appreciate it. I just want to share something with you if you give me like...3-5 minutes of your time. </p>

<p>Contrary to some of the members in this sub, I&#39;m actually confidently optimistic about the future of humanity. I am fully aware that humanity is in a very precarious situation. However, there is no doubt that we are in the process of a mass global awakening. I think it is important for us to embrace this awakening, and lend some faith to it, because it is a very real, evolutionary progression that we are in the midst of. </p>

<p>People may think things look bleak, but you have to consider looking at our situation in a different context. Yes, the election in the U.S., disease, famine, Pizzagate, and the global tensions seem so disastrous right now, however I believe we are seeing the breach of a new human Renaissance. The mainstream media is dying, people&#39;s trust in the state and the parental establishment is dwindling. They are trying to pin us against each other and blame one another for our problems based on sex, race, orientation, religion, ect. But We are finally starting to see who our REAL oppressors are, the handful of elite wealthy families that convene and plot to establish a global government. </p>

<p>My main concern however is that my fellow conspiracy theorists are going to look to Donald Trump for help. As conspiracy theorists, we are supposed to constantly question ANY elected officials, especially newly elected presidents. I&#39;m seeing a lot of blind faith being put into him, for what? I believe that he ultimately has a role in the nearing <strong>social collapse</strong> that the establishment has been setting the stage for.</p>

<p>So, all the liberals and SJW&#39;s hate trump and his supporters. They think he and they are racist and they are very hostile toward them.<strong>(which I disagree with, trump supporters are just normal hard working blue collar people, they truly believe that he is a political outsider who is not bought and paid for by the elite. We need to unite together, and not be divided over Trump, which is what they are trying to do)</strong></p>

<p>When Trump gets into office, his &quot;character&quot; that he was ordered to play by the globalists, will be an anti-establishment type president. The system wants to give the impression that the current US president is actually an outsider, to gain the trust of the Conservative based folks who are skeptical of the government. The Trump supporters are charmed and drawn in by this character, and they are immediately hated by the other side (SJW, Black lives matter, liberal base folks in the country), because he was labeled racist and sexist by the media, which has become a big deal thanks to the media who constantly discusses racial and sexual issues 24/7 on television. <strong>THIS WAS ALL ORCHESTRATED AND PLANNED</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s brilliant. So they effectively pinned the two political parties against one another and set the stage for a violent civil war. AND, they added fuel to the fire for the racial tensions that they are trying to heat up. Remember, the globalists are orchestrating the financial collapse, and they are also engineering the social collapse by creating tensions between the people, divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Donald Trump plays a critical role in this. Do not be swayed by his fucking smooth talk and his &quot;against the system&quot; appeal, it&#39;s all fake bullshit. We are conspiracy theorists, we don&#39;t trust the government AT ALL. Why the fuck should we trust this guy? Remain skeptical my brothers, stick together. I love you all! </p>

<p>Peace. </p>

<p>EDIT: <strong>Trump supporters, we have many things in common. We need to unite on this forum. We simply ask that you remain skeptical of DT during his presidency, and that you don&#39;t develop and irrational emotional attachment to him or the political spectrum. If he betrays you and turns out to be a puppet, will you be surprised? Will you hold him accountable? Remember, as conspiracy theorists, we largely reject the two party system. Remain vigilant, remain skeptical, and rejoice for this is the dawn of the new human awakening.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Assange said it best when he said &quot;Trump will surely try to create his own oligarchy but at least it will take time to get rid of the old establishment&quot;. </p>

<p>While I agree with a lot the OP says (and of course we should remain very skeptical of Trump), there is actually a chance that the Churn will decimate the old establishment while the new one is created. </p>

<p>Bottom line, your assessment of warring factions within the system is probable and if true, it gives us conspiracists space and time to work within the lines. </p>

<p>Good luck to all of us.</p>

<p>People like Hillary Clinton are what we like to call &quot;untouchables&quot;.</p>

<p>Government is essentially organized crime. You ever seen a mafia movie? </p>

<p>In mafia movies, if a mob guy is &quot;made&quot;, that means he is untouchable, he can&#39;t be put in jail and he can&#39;t be killed without permission from the higher ups.</p>

<p>This is someone who is so important and so powerful, that She was able to be considered as a presidential candidate. The elite are going to protect this woman, no doubt. These people don&#39;t go to jail, the FBI is not going to prosecute her, I can assure you they know their place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t all need to be liars. Just put the right hyper-partisans in the right places and let them go off. Take the Question leaking story for example. Why would CNN give that info to a Democratic operative? For the specific purpose of knowing that it was going to HRC and that the info could leak.</p>

<p>Here are a few things to watch for with &quot;outside4r&quot; Donald Trump.</p>

<p>His peace strategy with Russia is a ruse. In fact, good relations with Russia has a valuable purpose: to triangulate Russia from China, bring down China, then go after Russia later. And now look at his China policy. :P</p>

<p>His CNN incident. He just met with the people at AT&amp;T which has been a major supporter of Republicans in recent years. They want to buy CNN. The power structure tightens.</p>

<p>I do agree with OP for the most part of what he&#39;s saying. And anything IS possible, especially by the elite. But the vibe feels real, and that&#39;s why I think this movement is so big.</p>

<p>At the same time though I think it&#39;s possible that this was the perfect plan. I live in fucking Canada and I get people wanting to fight me for wearing Trump shit. I feel like if OP is right, they&#39;re trying to make different problems so they can have every kind of person to be and enemy of a specific different kind of person. Ex. Whites against blacks. Conservatives against liberals. CNN vs FOX. &quot;AMERICANS&quot; vs Muslims. Gays vs Straight. Etc. And they&#39;re pushing all these things so everyone can get involved. </p>

<p>Of course this is just my opinion. But although I don&#39;t fully agree I can&#39;t disregard OP either.</p>

<p>You know what makes PIzzagate real for me? It&#39;s not the mounds and mounds of damning circumstantial evidence that has built up over the past 2-3 months. It&#39;s the way the media handled the situation by freaking the fuck out and pushing the &quot;fake news&quot; rhetoric and over compensating for these leaks. They made it blatantly obvious that they were doing a coverup. Deleting articles, scrubbing archives, changing their logos,&#39;deleting Instagram photos, making accounts private, Wikipedia&#39;s &quot;debunking&quot;, snopes&#39; &quot;debunking&quot;...it was just so obvious to anyone who was watching that they were freaking the fuck out.</p>

<p>And it turns out we were right all along. All of the naysayers called us insane and said we were wasting time (obviously mainly shills). Alefantis is being investigated by the FBI after threatening somebody in an incident related to Pizzagate. We&#39;re going to be seeing a lot more Pizzagate on this sub in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ridiculous, ain&#39;t it? I wonder if OP is was a BernieBro... that would explain a lot. We need to give this time. The TPTB is not an all-powerful conspiracy, despite what many in this sub think. Many will tell you that it centers around Israel, but even Israel is battleground for different cabals of power with different goals, as are the global elite. The conspiracy is rather small, and once they are exposed there downfall will be short and swift.</p>

<p>The oddest part of this thread is an almost condescending view of the military. Does everyone really think they would stand for martial law or fight a civil war against the people? I for one am hopeful that the military can wrest control back from the intelligence community and make intelligence subservient to the military and not vice versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fervent Trump supporter. I agree completely with what you say. If he starts screwing us over, deporting US citizens, and take away gay marriage then by God I know tons if Trump supporters who were ready to go full revolution mode if Clinton took office and will do the same if Trump turns out to be a liar. Which to me personally he is not. He&#39;s playing a game, I personally believe he does want to help. Because he&#39;s apart of the alliance. Assange is apart of it too.</p>

<p>Disclosure is coming. Humans are going to undergo a mass awakening, a mass &quot;evolution&quot; so to speak. Becoming awake is destructive, it is dangerous, and tptb do not want this to happen because in the wake of its destruction something new will appear. And while he might not be the best option. Hell I could think of hundreds of other people who could do this shit better. (He really needs to shut the fuck up sometimes) but this is a crazy world as it is...imagine if all of a sudden so many billions of people were awakened. There&#39;s no telling what could happen. It&#39;d be like the French revolution on a global fucking scale. It&#39;s obvious that tptb do not want him, and honestly he&#39;s probably gonna go the way of JFK.  But the aftermath is what is important. Member that. Because we need people to guide others who won&#39;t be able to take the &quot;red pill&quot; as easily as others. We need leaders who are people, not political. Do not divide people. Just be cause I&#39;m a Trump supporter doesn&#39;t mean i hate Clinton supporters. We want the same thing (I hope) and that&#39;s just the betterment of the human race as a whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, honest question... The last civil war in America was basically about slavery. (I think that is something most people can agree to. I know the emancipation proclamation only applied to border states and that sharecropping, Jim Crow, and modern racism filled the vacuum. And it set a precedent for the consolidation of power, but it started because of slavery right?)</p>

<p>So my thought is that no one side&#39;s way of life is threatened enough to start a civil war. I mean at fort Sumter, each side wanted the other to fire the first shot. (Mostly because America wasn&#39;t as powerful and outside influences could sway the tide of war easily one way or the other as I understand it.)</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is I don&#39;t see two sides battling it out. I see a WWE match. I see two sides being paid by the same coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no.</p>

<p>consolidation of power began with alexander hamilton and the federalists. it began with budding northern industrialists and capitalists. that&#39;s not political, it&#39;s just an historical fact.</p>

<p>the civil war was about &quot;slavery,&quot; but not in the sense we use it today--as a moral fight. it was used purely in the economic sense. </p>

<p>chattel slavery is an (ancient) economic system, particularly suited to agrarian enterprises. the north also depended on slave labor, but the newly minted type of wage slavery (it was called this at the time, even by lincoln, who had no problem with it). we are all still wage slaves =) (the north won in more sense than one).</p>

<p>the civil war, as is true of every war, was about money. </p>

<p>for examp,e, the missiouri compromise wasn&#39;t about slavery being immoral, it was about small white farmers trying to keep the plantation system out of the new terriories because, just like how mom and pop&#39;s can&#39;t compete with walmart, small time farmers couldn&#39;t compete with plantations. the plantation system created and maintained poor &quot;white trash&quot; in the south, because it pushed them out to the marginal, worthless land.</p>

<p>the missouri territory wasn&#39;t a gaven for slaves (they were sent back) or freed blacks (the were froze out). missouri is still pretty unfriendly towards blacks tbh. </p>

<p>another example, though they were democrats (the party of the south) and despite being sympathetic to the south because they equated northern aggression with britain&#39;s tyranny over ireland, they fought for the north largely because they feared freed blacks competing for the only shit jobs the irish could get. irish immivrants didn&#39;t even know what a black person was, let alone giving them enough thought to hate them because they were black.</p>

<p>the economic battle btwn the north and the south had been being waged since the founding with federalists, whigs, and republicans cripling the south with tariffs that forced the south to trade with north, as opposed to the more lucrative great britain. one of the final blows was the renegging on the transcontinetal railroad running from the south westward, taking the more logical route that bypassed the rockies--it was why the gasden purchase was made in the first place, but it would have made the south the economic equal of the north.</p>

<p>there is no way for the states to fight the federal govt now. we don&#39;t have denatured uranium amunition, fighter jets, tanks, etc. the only wat we xan fight them is to ignore them and stop funding them. however, most state govts are as corrupt, if not more so, than the federal govt. </p>

<p>I certainly haven&#39;t done my research as well as you on this topic, though everything you said sounds right in line with the little I have done, but this last statement is the truth we all need to understand and agree upon.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the demise of Mab in the movie Merlin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mab: What do you plan to do-- Use your puny swords and axes on me?
Merlin: No, Mab, we&#39;re just going to forget you.
Mab: Merlin?
Merlin: What are you doing?
Mab: You can&#39;t fight us or frighten us.
Merlin: You&#39;re just... Not important enough anymore. We forget you, Queen Mab. Go join your sister in the lake... And be forgotten.
Mab: Look at me. Look at me!</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely my brother, they are trying to pin us against each other on a global scale...</p>

<p>Really think about this question I&#39;m about to ask: Do you really think racism is a big issue in this country right now, or is the media blowing it out of proportion to give the <em>impression</em> that it&#39;s a problem in this country? Seems like we&#39;ve been seeing more mainstream media coverage on black shootings and racial hate crimes than ever. They are cooking this up, a bit pot of soup. A dash of some white privilege, a touch of police brutality against minorities, a sprinkling of transgender and feminism radicals, and a few bakers dozen SJW&#39;s to spice up the batch. </p>

<p>They are engineering this massive social unrest that awaits us, and it&#39;s happening incrementally and slowly over time. Just like the frog in the boiling water metaphor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>pre jim crow, antebellum observation: the difference btwn a southern racist and a northern racist is that the southern has no problem living next door to a black man, but he&#39;ll be damned if he&#39;s equal to one, and a northern racist has no problem bei g equal to a black man, but he&#39;ll be damned if he&#39;ll live next to one.</p>

<p>jim crow changed all that, but people forget jim crow was at heart fou ded on economic fear dressed up in racism, just as the irush immigrant&#39;s oppoistion to emancipation.</p>

<p>the best tool to divide is to make everyone desperate, scroungi g for whatever crumbs the can get. that&#39;s why terms like &quot;white trash&quot; and &quot;nigger&quot; were used in the south, the southern elites couldn&#39;t risk a bacon&#39;s rebellion that included slaves and poor whites, or another free state of jones in missippi.</p>

<p>people here hate marxism, but marxism is a descriptive analytical tool for examiningand understanding economic class structures and struggles.  marx was right in his analysis, regardless of whether you agree with his solution.</p>

<p>But its also tough when racism is normalized in your industry. You&#39;d never expect the liberal media, but that&#39;s where some of the worst institutional racism lies. We only have diverse TV and movies because demographics are changing. POC&#39;s, LGBTQ, and women are featured a lot more, often not in the interest of equality, but of profits. We&#39;re talking about the same industry that created the horror trope &quot;the black guy dies first&quot; here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No troll friend.I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that before the six million figure the figure on the plaques outside the concentration camps was four million? They changed it in I think 1990? It is not strange to question the number who died when they themselves changed their number by two million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>6 million is an estimate, could be more, could be less. Towards the end of the war they got sloppier about keeping records. </p>

<p>Its impossible to account for the precise number, the same way that the precise number of Americans or Indians isn&#39;t known. Just an estimate based on population density for given regions. Sure, if you&#39;re a citizen of the US born in a hospital, then you have a social security card. But there are plenty of undocumented people born and living here, some even non-aliens (terrestrial, don&#39;t get excited).</p>

<p>So that 6 million figure is based partly upon records the Nazi&#39;s kept, and partly on math. If you can fit X number of people on a train and gas X number of people per day, per camp. Figure out how many people the all the camps could kill per day, and multiply that by their days in operation: boom, you have your high estimate. Your low estimate is just whatever they happened to actually put on paper. Travel orders to the ghettos and trains, passports confiscated, the sheer number of shoes and personal items found after the war, things like that.</p>

<p>Also, to be clear are you saying the holocaust wasn&#39;t real, or that it was exaggerated?</p>

<p>You also didn&#39;t answer the big picture question: why is it hard to believe that humans are capable of such atrocities? Because they&#39;re white non-jewish Germans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again like i just said the four million figure isn&#39;t &quot;my low estimate&quot;, that is literally the plaque they had outside the concentration camps until 25 years ago.It is true that Jews in Nazi Germany were treated like garbage but the gas chambers are all a fabrication, mass shooting were a fabrication and the photos of masses of jews starving to death were taken by liberating USSR troops after months of bombing railroads and roads that were supplying camps with supplies.They were starving to death because the supply lines were destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anecdotal, but if you live in a metropolitan area, a suburb, on a coast, etc... then I really do believe that you rarely-to-never encounter boldfaced racism.</p>

<p>I managed a liquor store in Evansville, IN for 5 years.  Let me tell you man.  Racism is alive and it is well.</p>

<p>Rural people don&#39;t have the exposure to other cultures.  It&#39;s easy to believe racist ass bullshit, if you never meet a black person, or theres only 2 in your entire high school.</p>

<p>Additionally, the problem of systematic discrimination in schools, law enforcement, housing, gerrymandering, eeeeverything, contributes continuously to the disenfranchisement of minorities, and they have every right to be upset.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m all about peace.  I don&#39;t want to spark a race war, I just want gradual, peaceful change to improve the lives of those who are disenfranchised for any reason.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd that Trump supporters could look past the flagrant racism and absolutely abhorrent sexism and still vote for Trump, but like they always say &quot;Good leader does not mean good person&quot;, and in that regard I guess we shall see.</p>

<p>Anyone but shillary... but I&#39;m not so sure we really got someone outside of the cabal/illuminati/general caucus of rich assclowns... seems absurd that we consider a &quot;Billionaire&quot; to be an &quot;outsider&quot;... something about amassing billions of capitalist coupons makes you decidedly an insider, in this man&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p>Regardless, I wouldn&#39;t downplay the racial tension in America, though much of it probably is staged / incited by false flags, the statistics don&#39;t lie, and the statistics show (at least in the case of BLM) that our legal system is disproportionately slanted against people of color. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t fair. I grew up in a rural area and I became racist after moving to a big city and being around black people all the time (mostly public transit and walking through the bad neighborhoods where drugs were sold on the street). It took a while to unlearn this and realize that just like there are types of white people, there are types of black people (and types of asian people, etc.). Some are violent and need to be locked up, but I feel NO differently towards my black coworkers than my white coworkers. To the extent there is any racism left in me, it&#39;s that I think the black population has a larger percentage of the type of people I&#39;d like to avoid. But to be fair, as a white person, there&#39;s more white people I&#39;d rather avoid than say, Japanese people. It&#39;s basic statistics. It&#39;s not me judging you by the color of your skin, it&#39;s survival (walking at night, alone, in the city, I&#39;m not going to be PC if it means risking my life, sorry). If we met under different, safer, circumstances, I&#39;d get to know you, no matter your race.</p>

<p>Apartheid in Afrikkaans quite literally means &quot;separateness&quot;.  And interestingly, it was the support of the Soviet Union (evil empire) to the terrorist ANC which played a significant role in ending that nationalist government...</p>

<p>Rhodesian imperialism and the concept of colonial empire building really relies on the tool of division.  In south africa it was obvious- whether Dutch or British.  It&#39;s also a great example of exploitation colonialism, where the empire brutally plundered the resources of the natives.  We could also get into the whole Debeers cartel and the role Bernays&#39; PR played in that economic system, but I&#39;ll leave that alone. </p>

<p>In places like India- they took advantage of a caste system.  In Rwanda they created the arbitrary divisions between two racially identical &quot;peoples&quot; to create separate and ethnicities (Hutu and Tutsi) and assign social hierarchy.</p>

<p>In the current 1st world systems, we have many such divisions being pushed by the official narrative.  Rich/ Poor, Black/ White, Nationalist/ Globalist, Liberal/ Conservative... and so on.  These are fake.  But in the near future, that division will become more real as out access to technologies and enhancements are determined by our place in society.  It&#39;s something to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as an american who lived and worked in the haag and geneva, the level and grotesquery of racism in europe shocked and disgusted me.</p>

<p>the racism found in europe is of a kind not seen here since the 1930s. all you have to look at are 6 ft tall, blue eyed, blond haired dutch running around in black face to celebrate christmas and the grotesque, littke black sambo dipictions of schwarte pete on everything from lollipops to tea sets.</p>

<p>the treatment of the roma is so ethi g you haven&#39;t seen here since jim crow. the only p,ace in ameri an that comes close is chicago, which sociologists created its own level of segregation.</p>

<p>america has deep sins, but unlike europe, the most of us readily acknowledge tbem and want to make amends. in france, one xan never become french without  a french surname. allergerians who have lived 4 generatio s france are still not considered french. in sweden, italians who&#39;ve been there for over 500 years are still &quot;oosvensk,&quot; unswedish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop bashing our traditions as being racist! Do some research and see that Sinterklaas and Santa Claus have the same roots: a pagan tradition called Wild Hunt, which possibly originated 2000 years ago. A time in which the Germanic people themselves were hunted down to be sold as slaves.</p>

<p>Part of the myth was an Army of Darkness that followed the god Odin. Odin evolved into a saint (Nicolas) after the Christening of the pagans and the Army of Darkness became Zwarte Pieten/Black Petes.</p>

<p>The clothes they wear are very similar to the clothes the Pope&#39;s guard and 16th century Spanish armed forces.</p>

<p>They are armed and allowed to punish and kidnap children: in what racist tradition is the &#39;slave&#39; allowed to punish and kidnap children from their &#39;masters&#39;? They are respected and loved, not mocked or looked down on in any way.</p>

<p>Furthermore: the Netherlands has no history of blackface and until late last century most people there would have never even met a single black person. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not black people they represent, they represent an evolved Army of Darkness, a group of armed guards and helpers to bring presents to the good children and punish the bad ones.</p>

<p>It looks bad, I know, but judging it as an outsider for being racist without even doing research makes you sound pretty bigoted and culturally insensitive!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you think I&#39;m a shill? Because I&#39;m simply skeptical of our newly elected president? Let me ask you, did you blindly put faith into each president you have supported? We should approach this with caution, after all, we are conspiracy theorists and we believe that the two party system is a joke, that the elections are nothing more than a Broadway play, carefully scripted.</p>

<p>And even if I was shilling, what would be my motive? To try to convince people that Trump isn&#39;t really a puppet who is gonna carry out the global agenda? to try and sway people away from supporting him?</p>

<p>He has done nothing for me, to give him the benefit of the doubt on this responsibility,
which happens to be the highest office in the world as US president..</p>

<p>He has ties to Jeffery Epstein, his cabinet members are all billionaires looking out for each other. Conspiracy theorists do not trust authority figures, especially presidents, and they don&#39;t care for corporations and wealthy elitists like Trump, so why would you consider supporting one?! he&#39;s a shady corporate big wig just like the rest. Why the hell would a conspiracy theorist put all their faith blindly into a crooked wealthy billionaire? We know it&#39;s the wealthy elite that are manipulating humanity for their own selfish desires, and now we are gonna put our trust into one of them? </p>

<p>Wealthy billionaires like Trump have probably never had to do a hard days work once in their lives, since they were born into money like trump was. They know nothing of OUR struggle, OUR plight as the lower class. This is a cautious, and rational approach to dealing with trump. We&#39;re going to remain skeptical of authority like conspiracy theorists always do...</p>

<p>And just like Ron Paul as well. If you are a danger to the establishment and you are running for office, all they have to do is give you a media blackout and sell the impression that you&#39;re &quot;unelectable&quot;. The media essentially tells you who the frontrunner is each election, my providing massive coverage to the selected puppet candidates (in this case, Hillary and Trump). </p>

<p>Both sanders and Ron Paul as well as rand Paul got the media blackout treatment, and they had to drop out. Keep in mind, these candidates were funded entirely by grassroots supporters, and were polling very well, but without media coverage they leave you in the dust. That&#39;s all they have to do if you&#39;re a threat and running for president...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my man, it&#39;s all smoke and mirrors. Humanity has largely outgrown racism, the average person understands that we are all equal, but we are programmed to hate and see ourselves as different groups by the establishment from a young age, and that confuses many people. But real actual proud homegrown skinhead cross burning nazi racism is very rare these days. </p>

<p>But good luck trying to tell that to the black lives matter folks and the sjw&#39;s. They truly believe racism is rampant, because the media covered black shootings, police brutality, transgender bathrooms and feminism hostility non stop the past few years. The liberals truly believe that there is a serious and legitimate racial problem in America...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta tip my tinfoil hat to the elites if this really is part of their plan. Trump is so divisive that liberals are now supporting Obama&#39;s propaganda policies. And in just few weeks it will be the Trump administration that will be using those laws!<br/>
 Here&#39;s my prediction. Trump will be abusing his powers to their fullest extent while other politicians pretend to be shocked. After he has taken away as much rights he can, &#39;the establishment&#39; will swoop in and save the day. Of course none of those rights will be returned but hey, that Trump guy sure was a meanie, aren&#39;t we all so glad he&#39;s gone!<br/>
 Donald is a scapegoat, an &#39;outsider&#39; who will do the establishment&#39;s dirty work. I hope I&#39;m wrong though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you site some examples that show how they tried to steal the election from him? I realize the media attacked and criticized him a lot and branded him &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;sexist&quot;, but it was publicity and made him an icon, thrusting him into the spotlight at the republican front runner. <strong>The media  had to do this, to convince the skeptical conservatives and people who don&#39;t trust the government that he is a legit outsider</strong>. &quot;If he was attacked by the media, the establishment must be afraid of him, right!?&quot; </p>

<p>If they were really afraid of him, they wouldn&#39;t have given him all of that free publicity, they would have given him a blackout to give the impression that he was unelectable, much like they did to <strong>Ron Paul</strong>. Ron Paul was a <strong>true</strong> outsider anti establishment, and that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t win. The media essentially tells you who the front runner is in these elections, and that convinces people that they are the most electable because they received the most media attention and coverage. </p>

<p>You have understand, this whole situation had a predetermined outcome. They needed to really sell this performance because 2016 was a crucial election year, tensions were high are people are tired of the bullshit. Clinton took and dive, and even though DT Said he would prosecute her, he never will, it was all phoney promises, the FBI won&#39;t touch her, people like her don&#39;t go to jail...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a good head on your shoulders. Key phrases that I totally agree with what you said. The world is a stage, and devide and conquer. You remind me of a YouTuber I watch and you should check him out. He gives his opinion on the fake news that&#39;s being reported and exposes the elite. When I say the elite, I&#39;m talking about the freemasons and the illuminati cultists.
I&#39;ve been reading comments on r/conspiracy and it seems a lot of people support this &quot;elected&quot; false flag of a president. These psychos are put into power by the illuminati and are specifically chosen to push their agenda. Essentially, they are &quot;throwing us a bone&quot; to keep the illusion going. Even if trump is a honest man, do you think the elite would just let it happen? Expect for him to get assassinated and be replaced by one of their own. In addition, why would the elite risk that? </p>

<p>I doubt he&#39;ll be assassinated. Too obvious. He&#39;s a divisive figure, and that has its uses. I reckon they&#39;ll let him sit out the presidency, talk a lot of shit, but not make any meaningful changes. And if he insists on causing too much of a fuss, well, it would be a shame if something should happen to one of his kids, like that daughter he seems to love so much. Just a thought.</p>

I think it&#39;s more organic than you make it out to be. Yes we&#39;ve had one script for both parties for at least 16 years.<br/>
There are differences between the John McCain establishment republicans and Trump. Trump seems to believe in a free press. He speaks highly of wikileaks, and he took questions yesterday from a press mob, unlike the scripted press events of Bush and Obama.<br/>
It was planned that Clinton would win. They had no plan B. That doesn&#39;t make Trump any less dangerous.</p>

<p>Then, you do a little flip-flop. Now, suddenly HRC is glowing at the credible media and pushing toward war with the old &quot;communist&quot; enemy and you bring in an &quot;outsider&quot; to sya the opposite.</p>

<p>Which leaves one huge question. What about Russia?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills are trying to Give the impression on this sub that this is a &quot;pro trump conservative&quot; hangout, where we question the government and Have accepted Trump as our savior and he is affiliated with the &quot;conspiracy community&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. time and again I see dozens of posts and comments of people expressing a skepticism about trump. And besides, most conspiracy theorists are non partisan and don&#39;t trust the government, why would be put blind faith into a Trojan horse like Trump? </p>

<p>The fact remains that most conspiracy theorists are still skeptical of DT, and rightfully so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fabrication. Drumpf isn&#39;t a German name and doesn&#39;t exactly sound German. There is no mention of this name in any record or history book created before Trump announced his run. And after that, there is only one obscure and unproven mention in one about a possible ancestor who lived around 1600 AD and could maybe have carried that name. </p>

<p>Drumpf is made up name to make Trump&#39;s name sound more like a Führer&#39;s. </p>

<p>And John Oliver is not a credible source. At least do due diligence and quote the book that he may have used as a source, and mention that there is no historical record anywhere in the German speaking world backing the claim that book makes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the election started, my SO and I thought there was no way Trump wasn&#39;t working for Clinton. I think they&#39;re two sides of the same coin. The positive here is that there is so much hatred toward Trump that people are paying closer attention, questioning more, and pushing back. I hope that we all continue to do that. We&#39;ve given our government far too much power. It&#39;s time to reclaim our privacy and our liberties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right -- they want to play us off against each other.</p>

<p>For a while with the whole russia hysteria I thought they were actually trying to prevent Trump from becoming president because they were afraid of him exposing them.  Now, I think they&#39;re just using this to stir up the left and right against each other, since it will make little difference for them.</p>

<p>(Of course it&#39;s far more complicated than that.)</p>

<p>We need to focus on redpilling people, and exposing corruption and censorship, and remember that our enemy is not the half of the country that was on &quot;the other side&quot; of the election, regardless of which side one was on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, and I am watching closely.</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s possible also we are witnessing a changing of the guard inside the Deep State, to a faction that doesn&#39;t hate us quite as much and doesn&#39;t like having to fuck kids to reach the top. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that there are nationalists battling globalists. We aren&#39;t like in the 1960s when the information was more tightly guarded....I know several ex-military guys who are fully aware that 9/11 was some kind of in-house shit show involving the Saudis, Pakistan and Israel. I&#39;m sure there are many many more like them. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m dubious of Trump but also cautiously hopeful. The NUMBER ONE thing for me is to expose the global pedophile ring and its key international and domestic leaders. If they kill them all after that, it&#39;s fine with me as long as I don&#39;t have to pull the trigger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think the elite were still shaken by trump. I don&#39;t think they expected it one bit. I don&#39;t think that he is with the previous elite in power 100% because of how much constant conflict there is. The Russian narrative and especially that story from the other day. They clearly are aiming to undermine trumps presidency and fuck up his term as much as they can. </p>

<p>Now trump clearly isn&#39;t trustworthy either. If he was, he would be sticking to <em>what was in the emails</em> rather than defending the bullshit Russian narrative. There are a lot of different possibilities of what the truth actually is. I wouldn&#39;t go around claiming anything as 100% true, especially because trump hasn&#39;t even been sworn in yet. Depending on his actions, it will be easier to judge his real position. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, most of the real, prominent &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; (david icke, alex jones, jimstone(freelance.com), david wilcock, thesaker.is), who have been exposing the establishment for many decades are either fully supportive, very optimistic, or at worst cautiously cynical about Trump. I haven&#39;t come across any prominent conspiracy theorist that outright came out and conclusively and confidently said that &#39;Trump is just another puppet, believe me&quot;</p>

<p>I just find it kind of funny how no-name-nobody-anonymous-conspiracy theorists who have barely contributed anything substantial label themselves as &#39;the real conspiracy theorists&#39; and assume that all the most prominent and important &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; are utterly wrong about Trump. Nevermind that Trump has been the arrowhead of a movement exposing the corruption of the US establishment at an unprecedented level even before he has been even inaugurated. To compare him to Obama (who never even pretended to fight against the establishment before and the 8 years after he was elected), or even worse, Bush and Clinton is utterly ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This smells like concern trolling to me. What are your sources or evidence for Donald Trump being involved with the global mafia referred often to as the NWO or the Illuminati? </p>

<p>If you have any evidence other than vague rhetoric about how &quot;If you are really a conspiracy theorists you know that everything is scripted and it&#39;s all really a conspiracy&quot;. </p>

<p>In the case of Obama his connections to these people were blatantly obvious and exposed the disingenuous nature of his rhetoric. His certain emergence as a &quot;champion of the people&quot; and the positive nature in which the mainstream media highlighted his campaign were clear signs as well. </p>

<p>In this case we see a candidate that has been a public figure for a long time and had usually been portrayed mostly positively by the mainstream media. Now he is getting the same treatment as Gaddafi got in the same media. Literally everything is being thrown at him! </p>

<p>It is the same formula of demonization that they use over and over against their enemies. </p>

<p>Keep in mind as well that Trump got elected with the main premise that he meant to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; &quot;lock her up&quot; and end the globalisation. </p>

<p>Why on earth would the people in favour of globalisation want to stall their plans with a civil war!? Why when with Hillary as president they would have had a clear mandate to move forward with those policies? It&#39;s all part of a bigger plot right?</p>

<p>There is an inherent problem with this way of thinking that is common amongst conspiracy theorists and is encouraged by those who feed disinformation. The notion that the powers we face are somehow omnipotent, it&#39;s simply not true. If they were we would not be having this conversation. </p>

<p>If overt fascism was an option for these people we would already be there. You don&#39;t think they allow people to resist their plans of domination cause they want to be fair!?</p>

<p>No. It is because human kind has many times throughout it&#39;s history pushed back against tyranny and have put in place measures that are meant to prevent it. That is why there is a constant struggle and I truly believe that without the USA in the mix  (I&#39;m European) and their stubbornness to keep the 2nd amendment in place we would have seen a hostile tyrannical global takeover a while back. All such plans would have failed in the phase of an armed populace rising up. As soon as they would have exposed their hand and revealed themselves for all as the sadistic control freaks they are the people would have rebelled.</p>

<p>They have now painted themselves in a corner where they must keep on their mask of good intentions while simultaneously screwing everyone over and taking over the world. </p>

<p>Despite what can somewhat inappropriately be called a glorious attempt to such psychotic ends, it seems that these plans were somewhat overly optimistic. </p>

<p>I also am wary of the sales pitch tone in this post &quot;Thanks for clicking this, if you just give me 3-5 minutes I&#39;ll show you how to make 50$ an hour working at home!&quot; And the buzzwords: &quot;PEACE, LOVE, BROTHERS&quot;</p>

<p>Keep in mind, there may be an honest person posting this, I am definitely aware that some people have a tendency to look at things this way. I&#39;m simply commenting that this mindset is propagated by disinformation that is meant to make us feel powerless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>skepticism is fine, cynicism is not and there is often a fine line between the two. like i said, i disagree with attitudes akin to the statement &quot;well he&#39;s going to become president so of course he&#39;s compromised&quot;; if you follow that logic, then you&#39;re suggesting that we will never get a president who isn&#39;t compromised</p>

<p>i&#39;m more optimistic than that. i&#39;m not blind to peoples&#39; faults, but i am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. especially when all it meaningfully changes is my own opinion; either way i&#39;m still just going to be browsing the internet, might as well be less depressed about it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the two relevant quotes I found regarding Trump and Epstein: </p>

<p>Trump said this about him: &quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/</a> (see? sourcing is good)</p>

<p>Nr. 2: Trump has distanced himself from the financier, who pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute.
He banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida for allegedly propositioning an underage girl. </p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3564767/Donald-Trump-furiously-denies-woman-s-claims-raped-tycoon-billionaire-pedophile-Jeffrey-Epstein-s-sex-parties">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3564767/Donald-Trump-furiously-denies-woman-s-claims-raped-tycoon-billionaire-pedophile-Jeffrey-Epstein-s-sex-parties</a></p>

<p>So in one interview it seems he may have met him a few times. A lot of sick people can be charismatic as well and it seems he refers to that but also makes a point about how he likes girls young. In the second it seems clear that he made a point to distance himself from him and banned him from one of his properties for coming on to a young girl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really irks me when people try and use Trump kicking Epstein out of the Mar a Lago as proof of him being a good guy. That was in  1999, and not even months later all the tabloids were writing about seeing him back in again!</p>

<p>For Christ&#39;s sake Donald Trump went to a dinner hosted by Epstein in 2003, and visited his island onboard the Lolita Express that year as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a source for that last statement?</p>

<p>The article you posted makes no mention of the fact that Trump and Epstein met on numerous occation, only that Epstein continued to visit the Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m sure everyone agrees that we went the full details of what went on at that island and what has been rotting in the political circle of both the democrats and the republicans. We want to expose the music industry and Hollywood as well. Anyone involved with this kind of filth should face the consequences. I&#39;m sure some distinction will be made between those who &quot;only&quot; had orgies with teenage prostitutes and those who torture, molest and murder infants but we want all the dirt to surface. If Trump has been involved in these things a thorough investigation would reveal as much.</p>

<p>Hence we will see, obviously I am not a 100% certain Trump is going to be a good president. I still worry that the outcome will show that this was in fact setup to go this way for reasons beyond me. I am hopeful that it isn&#39;t and that this is a genuine backlash against these people and institutions.</p>

<p>We will see but surely this is a better alternative than Hillary Clinton, one of the most disgusting human beings ever to incarnate on this planet. Trump would need a LOT of work to catch up to her record
of war crimes, lying and prostituting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That quote above is from 2002. Epstein wasn&#39;t convicted until 2008. Of course Trump is going to say generic &quot;good&quot; things about people he associates with. Billionaires are a club. They know each other. Epstein turning out to be a pedo doesn&#39;t automatically implicate everyone he knows as pedos. It raises questions, sure, but it isn&#39;t proof of wrong doing. Not even for Bill Clinton although there are a lot more questions about his particular relationship given that he visited the island dozens of times and is on record leaving his security detail behind on several occasions. </p>

<p>Just because Trump is a former associate of a pedo in and of itself means nothing. It&#39;s an association fallacy to declare otherwise. That said, if more proof surfaces it&#39;s worth due consideration. </p>

<p>As it is, there is not enough to say &quot;game over&quot;. </p>

<p>My main concern however is that my fellow conspiracy theorists are going to look to Donald Trump for help. As conspiracy theorists, we are supposed to constantly question ANY elected officials, especially newly elected presidents. I&#39;m seeing a lot of blind faith being put into Drumpf, for what? I believe that he ultimately has a role in the nearing social collapse that the establishment has been setting the stage for.</p>

<p>So, all the liberals and SJW&#39;s hate trump and his supporters. They think he and they are racist and they are very hostile toward them.(which I disagree with, trump supporters are just normal hard working blue collar people, they truly believe that he is a political outsider who is not bought and paid for by the elite. We need to unite together, and not be divided over Trump, which is what they are trying to do)</p>

<p>When Trump gets into office, his &quot;character&quot; that he was ordered to play by the globalists, will be an anti-establishment type president. The system wants to give the impression that the current US president is actually an outsider, to gain the trust of the Conservative based folks who are skeptical of the government. The Trump supporters are charmed and drawn in by this character, and they are immediately hated by the other side (SJW, Black lives matter, liberal base folks in the country), because he was labeled racist and sexist by the media, which has become a big deal thanks to the media who constantly discusses racial and sexual issues 24/7 on television. THIS WAS ALL ORCHESTRATED AND PLANNED</p>

<p>It&#39;s brilliant. So they effectively pinned the two political parties against one another and set the stage for a violent civil war. AND, they added fuel to the fire for the racial tensions that they are trying to heat up. Remember, the globalists are orchestrating the financial collapse, and they are also engineering the social collapse by creating tensions between the people, divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Donald Trump plays a critical role in this. Do not be swayed by his fucking smooth talk and his &quot;against the system&quot; appeal, it&#39;s all fake bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve spent wayy more time than I&#39;m proud of reading about pg and remain unconvinced. I&#39;ll quote from one of my other posts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See, Pizzagate asks me to believe that people with knowledge of these crimes, over several decades, who undoubtedly number in the hundreds if not thousands, would keep it to themselves.</p>

<p>I know you are saying that whistleblowers always receive blowback and sometimes meet violent ends, but the idea that so many people could be involved in such immoral activity and remain mum jumps the shark for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are isolated cases of this conduct, just like there&#39;s undoubtedly other types of criminality in government,  and there may exist criminal conspiracies to protect it, but the allegations of a mass conspiracy are vague and the evidence is circumstantial.</p>

<p>My only beef is with the censoring of conspiracies on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, each user should be able to evaluate the value of the evidence on their own. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s plausible that Trump is a truly independent candidate without a debt to the ruling elite, but it&#39;s equally if not more plausible that he&#39;s been compromised on the way to the top or from the very beginning since, you know, he was born as a member of the ruling elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s fine to be skeptical of him and that we absolutely should because there is a very real chance that what you&#39;re saying is true. It could also be true that the backlash we are seeing through the media and every celebrity that thinks their political opinions matter is because he represents a very real threat to the border-less globalist oligarchy that the elite want. I think there are certainly those on this subreddit that put way too much unearned faith into Trump, but I also think that there is nothing wrong with being a little bit hopeful while trying to stay objective and skeptical about the current political situation. Also, I really wish this whole Jon Oliver &#39;Hahaha his name is now Drumpf, wow, we really showed him&#39; thing would stop. It really detracts from a good and logical premise like yours when people resort to petty name calling thinking it somehow gives them more validity against him.</p>

<p>Funny that you use the word fact, and then you instantly contradict yourself and say that you did not say that when it is not a fact at all. The only fact as you claimed it and it&#39;s not true. Hard facts the darndest things. They get in the way of great propaganda don&#39;t they? And by the way, I know how to read. But words could be manipulated into lies like you just proved.

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely think he downplayed it, though. I&#39;m a white guy, but I&#39;ve heard disgusting levels of racism over the past 18 months compared to the years before. Older family members let things slip that they wouldn&#39;t have before, random white customers where I work make passing dog-whistle-ish comments occasionally, and many lower class whites I know have been much more open with racial sentiment on social media. I&#39;m absolutely positive that minorities are experiencing worse than I&#39;ve described. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t live in a small town in Alabama, I live in a fairly well off part of a major metropolitan area with over a million residents. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s worse elsewhere. </p>

<p>Ah yes, that desperate deflection.</p>

<p>We base the fact that there isn&#39;t any racial issues besides imaginary ones on the fact that objective, verifiable evidence (which is why every &quot;martyr&quot; of BLM has ended up being justifiably shot contrary to their &quot;hands up&quot; original narratives) show that the racism claims people like you make are <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>Which is why the only response you ignorant people can come up with is &quot;b-b-but you&#39;re not a minority!&quot;, while mysteriously declaring all those minorities who also point out your bullshit to be &quot;Uncle Toms/Race Traitors&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>mass global awakening
establishment is collapsing
all planned</p>

<p>Are you suggesting, anonymous internet friend with ambiguous motivations, that the masons behind the Discordian movement which began most of the modern day conspiracy theories in the 60s and 70s were not controlled opposition? Do you seriously believe in the power of the individual or the collective? Can you elaborate as to why, given the massive historical record which shows that the mass of human beings have always been chattel and playthings of those with the ambition to corral and exploit them?</p>

<p>The last generation that had this &#39;mass awakening&#39; threw away all their possessions, got into vans or hitchhiked across the country, smoked dope, refused the draft and partied an entire decade away. Then they became the largest consumerists and free market capitalists the world has ever seen, deforesting the land and enslaving billions of the worlds poor in the modern day coal mine of sweatshop and slave labor factories, for profit and the elevation of China to it&#39;s modern day status as pre-eminent paper dragon.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t this generation simply abandon the physical world for the virtual one, entomb themselves into mechanical fantasies and choose to no longer participate in a world that sees them as a profit liability?</p>

<p>I think you are grossly mistaken or willfully misleading when you discuss this topic. I just got back from a 2 week trip in China, their mainland is the future of the world. Large cities housing tens of millions of people, fast reliable public transport, pollution for the sake of progress, glittering buildings of glass and stone built on a foundation of belief and personal sacrifice. They work harder, are obedient, and worship at the altar of wealth and power. Whoever you believe was in &#39;control&#39; of the Anglo-American establishment and was pulling the strings of various public puppets has long ago shipped themselves to Asia. The west is a freak-show, a collapsing disaster of post-soviet socialism and post-american capitalism. Decay breeds desperation and futile anger, that is what you are observing, not some great master plan, the masters have left.</p>

<p>Jesus, this nails it.  I know this is what they&#39;re doing, I just hope that they come up with a solution to it.

    <div class="md"><p>several points:</p>

<p>i guarantee i am farther left than you and that my reflexive skepticism would likely brand me as a loon by you, esp since your focus is on pizzagate, not WW3.</p>

<p>turmp is an idiot, but he&#39;s a useful idiot for conspiracists, because at the very least he is conspiracist adjacent and is willing to use the bully pulpit without shame to advance conpiracy theories.</p>

<p>as long as trump pushes back against a land war with a nuclear power, i couldn&#39;t give 2 fucks about anything else, because nothing is as unrecoverable as global thermo nuclear war. </p>

<p>trump is a not a smooth talker. he&#39;s a lout and a bafoon. he&#39;s funny precisely because he&#39; s a walking talking meme and a classic troll of the kind that /b/ used to be way back when.</p>

<p>obama was a smooth talker. he lulled his way into simultaneously bombing 7 countries, signing away habeus corpus in the 2014 NDAA and freedom of the press and speech on dec 23 in this year&#39;s NDAA, being the least transparent president in history, the president who deported the most people ever, using night raids to do so, the president who prosecuted more whistleblowers than any other president, even when the alien and sedition act was still a thing and during the communist witch hunts of the 40s and 50s, he brushed off torture by calling the victims &quot;folks.&quot;</p>

<p>trump is being attacked from all sides of the govt and MSM in a way i&#39;ve only seen done in my 44 years against leftist &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and reporters like gary webb who exposed tbe CIA&#39;s drugs for guns campaign to fund the afghans in the 90s and which literally caused the crack epidemic. tbey are trying to build a case for teason against him, punishable by death, and use that as a pretext to start a war. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t think of him as a friend, i think of him as the frog above an already boiling pot of water. most of the frogs are already dead having been comfy in the pot as the temperature climbed. trump is squirming and kicking and squealing and being an alarou d, gauche and uncooperative frog. </p>

<p>conspiracists jumped out of the pot a long time ago and have been trying to get the rest of the frogs to jump out to no avail. but trump&#39;s antics have caught the rest of the frogs&#39; attention. some of those frogs are going to at least wake up to the fact they&#39;re a frog in boiling pot of water because of it. </p>

<p>pizzagate, even if proved beyond a doubt, won&#39;t because it will be seen as just a macabre and horrifying story that doesn&#39;t effect them, that has nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>the pitting of us hoi poli against each other has been the go to tactic since before the athenians coined the term. what&#39;s happening now is not new. if you want to combat it here, respo d to every post attributing this or that to one side of the aisle or another, by saying it is a false dicotomy to enable and entrench the oligarchy&#39;s mission. most of the time, it is as simple as pointing out that accusations of &quot;marxist captilalists&quot; bei g the root of all evil, as an oxymoron.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t see trust here, so much as giddy schadenfruede at things like CNN being called &quot;fake news&quot; at a press conference by POETUS. </p>

<p>Donald Trump plays a critical role in this.

</blockquote>

<p>I think many people trust him specifically because he has never been part of the government. Never been part of the political elite (Podesta). So you kind of answered your own question there. </p>

<p>Nothing you or anyone else says will stop me from supporting Trump! I have been a conspiracy theorist long before I knew anything about Trump. Been on this board for 8 years under different names. Ban me and Ill come back under a new name and participate in conspiracies! Ill support our president too which is a great fucking change. </p>

<p>I am also hopeful about our future and I think TPTB are not. I think Trump and Farage and Le Pen are all playing a huge role in TPTB, NWO whatever you want to call its demise. </p>

<p>I fully support President Trump and no amount of fear mongering will stop me! You can ban me but Ill be back under a new name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it could be more than one conspiracy at play by opposing factions. And by factions, not the usual Republican vs. Democrat but the ones pulling strings behind the scenes and crossing lines of either party.</p>

<p>There seems to be things indicating gov&#39;t agencies at odds with each other in what they&#39;ve been doing lately. Seems like two, or even three groups are calling shots about things.</p>

<p>Now the question is whether one faction would be more trustworthy or presenting a more ethical agenda. So on that front, it still pays to pay attention as to what is going on and being skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are giving the establishment way too much credit.  This portrayal of the elite as masterminds who always is in control of every situation by orchestrating it themselves is ridiculous and false.  It only increases the fear and victim complexes of the people and takes away any hope they might have.  The truth is that they have been fighting Trump from when they realized that they underestimated him and his connection with a huge portion of the American public who is sick and tired of the political elite in Washington.  This was not planned, it is the expected backlash of the people against the establishment.  I say at least give Trump a chance and stop trying as hard as the establishment to destroy him.   As a conspiracy subscriber for years, I for one am very pleased that someone like Trump has been able to snatch the presidency against all odds.  This is an exciting time and everyone should be hopeful for the future.  </p>

There are too many people on this Earth and technological advancement is not able to keep up with the pace of reproduction. I&#39;m rather convinced that most people in first world countries are safe since corporations do need a workforce and also consumers to fuel profits, but starting up hatred and division is a good way of heating up the pot before introducing nuclear warheads in third world countries. I&#39;d say that is where the plan is to cull, people who are not consumers and are not of any worth to the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with these sentiments for the most part. But is there really any denying that Trump&#39;s election was <strong>not</strong> part of the plan for TPTB? Sure they played both sides, but only to inflate and demonize Trump into a landslide win for Clinton cabal. All sides may have tons of power, but they are still DIFFERENT factions competing for control over the same institutions. As citizens, we have to wake up to the fake that we are in the middle of a war among the elites, it is not just them vs. us, it&#39;s many of them against each other vs us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is evidence in the leaked emails that the Clinton team helped push Trump to the top of the GOP ticket. He was great for MSM&#39;s ratings, and looked like an easy target to beat in the general- so they worked to help him win the primary. Insofar as that, he <em>was</em> technically part of the &quot;plan.&quot; But it&#39;s pretty clear they&#39;re regretting that now. I think it&#39;s clear they also had contingencies in place if she lost, and we&#39;ll see how those play out once he&#39;s sworn in. Perhaps, if there is a scheme, and he really <em>was</em> the intended president for TPTB, I&#39;m guessing the end game is near. They&#39;re really trying to destabilize the US to the point of collapse, and who knows what comes after that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the people who voted cared that he pissed off liberals. We believe in the things he said because those are the things we want to happen to prevent the loss of American culture (and I don&#39;t mean white culture). Many who voted for Trump realize the media is hyping racial tensions but we&#39;re just not falling for it anymore. Trump was cartoonly vilified and won. If he&#39;s in on it, then the elite-controlled-media cartoonly villified him and leaked documents on themselves to redpill massive numbers of people, esentially exposing themselves, in order to install Trump who would now have the chore of trying to keep his &quot;anti-establishment&quot; appearance while secretly continuing down the track of increasing racial tensions among people who no longer believe the fake news they were being fed. They have completely damaged their media control mechanism. And at the same time made many more people aware and skeptical of them all. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty stupid plan if you have complete control of literally everything already. Why not just install Hillary and continue down the path of racial division in the msm while importing refugees until shit collapses? You can&#39;t even get an office-full of people to get along, so I just don&#39;t imagine that dozens of the most egotistical billionaires in the world are going to get along well enough to orchestrate this thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is this pinned? I thought r/conspiracy was supposed to be non-partisan, and it was Trump supporters who were taking over. Yeah, this sub is compromised.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very clear that the elites/globalists were trying desperately to get Hillary to win. Now, the reason they&#39;re all panicking is because they know shit like pizzagate and 9/11 is about to come out.</p>

<p>Trump is the ONLY candidate to ever even slightly mention 9/11 truth. He&#39;s pointed out that we went into Iraq based on a complete lie, and he supported releasing the 28 pages:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60V1TKHuq_0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60V1TKHuq_0</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s also the only candidate to even mention the JFK assassination, when he talked about Ted Cruz&#39;s father&#39;s connection to Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>As for pizzagate, He also tweeted this back in 2012. HE KNOWS. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Lpp4R3.png">https://i.sli.mg/Lpp4R3.png</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re saying Trump is still part of the same old bullshit republican/democrat charade. He&#39;s not. If you want an example of the old &quot;fake&quot; elections, where it doesn&#39;t matter who wins because both sides are really on the same team, look at Obama/Romney in 2012, Obama/McCain in 2008, or Bush/Kerry in 2004. The elite&#39;s weren&#39;t going into full panic mode after any of those because it didn&#39;t matter who won.</p>

<p>&quot;We are conspiracy theorists, we don&#39;t trust the government AT ALL.&quot; 
LOL! Do you actually calls yourself a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;? I don&#39;t. That term was polarized in the 60s by the CIA to demonize anyone critical of them. And Trump is not &quot;the government&quot;. Yes, he&#39;s the president-elect, but the ENTIRE SYSTEM is against him. He is a representation of the people standing up to the elites, just as with populist leaders in other countries. Is Marine Le Pen just bullshitting everyone in France? Or Nigel Farage in the UK?</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m not a REAL conspiracy theorist cause I support the only guy who&#39;s run for president in recent history to actually talk about conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words...</p>

<p>&quot;Hello fellow &quot;cool kids&quot;, we are soooo radical eh?&quot;</p>

<p>What a terrible barbed wire olive branch attempt, Drumpf ? Why are CTR still trying to make this a thing ?</p>

<p>As someone who wanted Sanders and eventually came around to Trump, he wasn&#39;t my first choice. However, I&#39;ll give him the benefit of the doubt and see how he does in the next four years. We know we were going to get screwed over with Clinton hence why so few voted for her. Trump to his credit did shit down the TPP, did criticize the Pharmaceutical companies, called out the Federal Reserve, and has been making an effort to being productivity back for the middle class.</p>

<p>Could he be a patsy, of course. His love affair with Netanyahu is very troubling considering the genocide that is being ignored in Palestine, and his backing of a cabinet lined with billionaires does make me feel a little uneasy. However, I&#39;ll pass my judgment on him as a president after that takes place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump post got removed because the sub got brigaded by CTR shills or intelligence community members. That was the whole point. There were suddenly like 7000 new members online at once in the sub and they were all upvoting anti-trump comments and shit. In case you don&#39;t know, whether or not you believe the intelligence community uses internet shills, it&#39;s a <strong>fact</strong> that organizations like Correct The Record exist and engage in exactly that sort of behavior. Thus the removal was an obvious necessity and for you to try to spin it as something else just reveals how full of shit you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Lots of posts from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and there simply are never that many people on this sub at once. It&#39;s also the common sense answer when you understand what CTR is. What they do. How they pay their employees (Literally by the number of responses their comments elicit, and all of that information is public on their website). And what they&#39;ve done to other subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>So fuck off man. Stop shilling because of your BS political bias. The post got removed because it was brigaded and even if it hypothetically <strong>were</strong> true that the brigading was coming from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, <strong>which it factually was not</strong>, then it&#39;s still <strong>brigading</strong>, so you can continue to fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no leg to stand on here. Story was already discredited and proven to be fake news. It was a CNN / DNC / Clinton scam that got released and then the sub got brigaded by people trying to disseminate propaganda.

<p>The choice to remove it was the proper choice. This sub has been one of the most lightly moderated subs on reddit for years.

About bilderberg, bohemian grove, trilateral commission, skull and bones or freemasonry. About what&#39;s really happening in our world today, then you would understand why it&#39;s absolutely beyond the realms of debate that Trump is the outsider &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; candidate. But even presuming your ignorance, the fact that you can watch the MSM and intelligence agencies intentionally attempt to smear him, along with all of the pushback and resistance he received from the Republican Party during his campaign, and still try to paint him as part of the problem, only betrays your deep seeded ideological bias. Maybe you want the world to burn. Maybe you&#39;re a shill. Maybe you just don&#39;t want to admit that you backed the wrong horses. Maybe you don&#39;t want to accept that life isn&#39;t always pretty, and you&#39;d rather cling to the globalist vision for a perfect existence, without addressing the reality of the harm their vision will bring to the world.

    <div class="md"><p>It was proven to be a totally meaningless piece of paper that just came from a guy, who wasn&#39;t even Mi6 at the time that he wrote it, who was working for the Hillary campaign and compiling any sort of negative stories he could on Trump. Buzzfeed has disowned it as having any sort of credibility. CNN has disowned it as having any sort of credibility. Every MSM outlet has disowned it. There&#39;s not a single person (other than Correct the Record shills) who actually think that document is real.</p>

<p>The 4chan story is pretty convincing and it has <strong>a lot</strong> more substance than any other explanation.</p>

<p>So yes, when you present a document purporting that the President of the United States is a Russian Spy and gets piss showers from hookers in order to spite Obama, and your document is not proven to have any sort of credibility or substance, it&#39;s called &quot;disproven&quot; because of a little thing known as <em>burden of proof</em>. As in I could write a document tomorrow that states <a href="/u/spartan1117">/u/spartan1117</a> gets piss showers from hookers, but if I cannot prove it, then my claim is &quot;Disproven&quot; and the very same logic applies here. That much is irrefutable. <strong>None of this is any issue up for debate</strong>.</p>

<p>What world do you live in where you think the majority of visitors and conspiracy theorists on the sub are going to support a president elect?

<p>Most people aren&#39;t blindly thrusting their support behind this guy, it would be stupid to do so. I was skeptical of Clinton just as much as trump, and it would seem as if many others are on this sub as well. </p>

<p>Fuck the two party system, if you still actually think these elections are real and that we &quot;beat the system!&quot; And got one of our own guys in office whose on our side, than you plain and simple just fell for the bait...</p>

<p>I think most people know that the jury is still out on Trump. But since he&#39;s the best threat to the establishment  -- or even threat fascimile to the establishment -- we&#39;ve had in a long time, many of us are going to take an &#39;already, but not yet&#39; approach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not the only one seeing this Trump thing as a giant trick. Here&#39;s some highlights of a really long article on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, the press showered Donald Trump with generous positive coverage. Republicans received more than double the coverage of Democrats. Donald Trump received more coverage than any other candidate, and more than one-third of all coverage of Republican candidates. Coverage of Donald Trump was positive by a 2-to-1 ratio, despite popular myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>. . . </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike during the primaries or at any other time, an unprecedented convergence of coverage took place. Nearly all major sources opposed Hillary Clinton, including deeper anti-government places like ZeroHedge, InfoWars and Russia Today. They were all singing the Republican line together, generously promoting the face of the “alt right,” Breitbart.com.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>. . . </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some say the surprise and shock by the stunning upset proved how remarkably ignorant the establishment was. Some say they did not foresee these novel forces that would give the White House to a genuine outsider. So the narrative goes.</p>

<p>But events since the election indicate otherwise:</p>

<p>This entire election was likely the well-planned result of a bipartisan establishment set-up. While it was possible that it could have failed, as happened in 2012 (see above), it wound up succeeding. Now, stock market elites and masterminds of the plan begin to reap the rewards. Hope and change remains elusive. <a href="http://www.weblinenews.com/gaming-elections">Source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree with a ton of the stuff you said. I supported Trump and it scares me how people are putting blind faith into him. I&#39;m actually nowhere near as optimistic about the future of humanity as you are though. I mean I could go on forever about some of my reasons but I just think about how every year people get more used to this fast paced life that seems to get faster. The elite have made sure they have taken the firmest hold on media, banking, politics etc. People may be starting to &quot;wake up&quot; but that doesn&#39;t help much when those people only care about Kim Kardashian and Snapchat and would never actually do anything to risk their cozy lifestyle. In the long run(like 500 years from now) I&#39;d give humans like a 25% chance of not almost wiping ourselves out completely. For starters we could never sustain this massive population growth and it really troubles me that there has not been controlled population yet. Imagine a planet with 10 billion people. Nature will be forced to reset itself.</p>

<p>On a smaller note..I disagree that your standard conservative is weary of the government in the same sense that many of us on here use. Conservative policy is the whole &quot;we want small government not some big brother!&quot; but if you are the type of conservative that can get behind a McCain, Romney or Bush then you&#39;re not really weary of the government and you have no idea what&#39;s actually going on lol. Maybe I&#39;m just thinking about your standard consercatve Grandmom and Grandpop who swear they don&#39;t trust the government but if you told them Bush may have had anything to do with 9/11 they won&#39;t talk to you for like 2 weeks haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mods: We need an answer as to why this post was stickied as an announcement. Seriously WTF? Why was this so important to be said in an announcement from an account that is only 27 days old????</p>

<p>Also I need to refute the points made by this person:
1) &quot;My main concern however is that my fellow conspiracy theorists are going to look to Donald Trump for help&quot;</p>

<p>Why is it a concern that we look to the most anti-establishment president ever elected for hope. The MSM and all of the elites are doing everything in their power to stop him.</p>

<p>2) &quot;As conspiracy theorists, we are supposed to constantly question ANY elected officials, especially newly elected presidents.&quot;</p>

<p>No we&#39;re not. That&#39;s not what conspiracy theorists do. We research conspiracies, not elected officials. There are elected officials all over the place that people in this sub genuinely admire.</p>

<p>3) &quot;I&#39;m seeing a lot of blind faith being put into Drumpf, for what?&quot;</p>

<p>Because its obvious that none of the elites wanted him in power and that shows by the amount of flak he got not only from the DNC, which was to be expected as his opponent, but from the RNC as well.</p>

<p>4) &quot;I believe that he ultimately has a role in the nearing social collapse that the establishment has been setting the stage for.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the scariest part of this post because it shows what these shills are trying to do: blame Trump for the upcoming collapse that will ensue from people hearing about the truth: pizza gate.</p>

<p>5)&quot;So, all the liberals and SJW&#39;s hate trump and his supporters. They think he and they are racist and they are very hostile toward them.(which I disagree with, trump supporters are just normal hard working blue collar people, they truly believe that he is a political outsider who is not bought and paid for by the elite).&quot;</p>

<p>This is Grade A manipulation. They are trying to get you to think that they are sympathetic to Trump supporters to get at least a couple true non-shill Trump supporters on their side so when we look at these shill&#39;s post history and see that a couple of them are legitimate people it will create a snowball effect and cause more actual Trump supporters to look at things their way until they blend the lines and we won&#39;t be able to distinguish between Trump supporters and shills.</p>

<p>6) &quot;When Trump gets into office, his &quot;character&quot; that he was ordered to play by the globalists, will be an anti-establishment type president.&quot;</p>

<p>Lol Ok I know that we are conspiracy theorists here and we don&#39;t have definitive proof for ANY conspiracy (thats why its called a conspiracy) we just have evidence. But the evidence for Trump being a globalist is literally just: &quot;See! Look how rich he is, he must be an elitist!&quot;</p>

<p>7) &quot;The system wants to give the impression that the current US president is actually an outsider, to gain the trust of the Conservative based folks who are skeptical of the government.&quot;</p>

<p>So what you are saying is the same people who are trying to get him impeached through this Russian hacking bullshit are actually the same ones that want him to get in office. Where do you get this stuff?</p>

<p>8) &quot;The Trump supporters are charmed and drawn in by this character&quot;</p>

<p>Ok, fair enough.</p>

<p>&quot;and they are immediately hated by the other side (SJW, Black lives matter, liberal base folks in the country), because he was labeled racist and sexist by the media, which has become a big deal thanks to the media who constantly discusses racial and sexual issues 24/7 on television. &quot;</p>

<p>Right that makes sense, not sure how that helps Trump though</p>

<p>&quot;THIS WAS ALL ORCHESTRATED AND PLANNED&quot;
What? Lol How was Trump suppose to come off? You&#39;re saying if he actually wanted to take down the establishment he wouldn&#39;t try to be charming?? Also, the hate coming from liberals is supposed prove that this was orchestrated because that hate is what will take down our society? This makes no sense and is failing in basic common sense. The elitists don&#39;t just &#39;Want to watch the world burn&#39; well maybe some do. To me these people are in a quest for power. They want to have their pizza and eat it too.</p>

<p>9) &quot;It&#39;s brilliant. So they effectively pinned the two political parties against one another and set the stage for a violent civil war. &quot;</p>

<p>First off the &#39;It&#39;s Brilliant line&#39; is just another sympathetic phrase which cannot be overlooked. These small phrases control the tone of the next sentence you read. Also, there is more proof that both major political parties are teaming up against Trump. If there is going to be a civil war it won&#39;t be Democrat vs Republican. It will be Trump supporters vs The establishment</p>

<p>10) &quot;AND, they added fuel to the fire for the racial tensions that they are trying to heat up. Remember, the globalists are orchestrating the financial collapse, and they are also engineering the social collapse by creating tensions between the people, divide and conquer.&quot;</p>

<p>First of all, all this bullshit that Trump is a racist was a tool used by the MSM to make sure Trump didn&#39;t win the primaries. Obviously didn&#39;t work. But let me get this straight, you are trying to say that the elitists purposely painted Trump as a racist so he would seem like more of an outsider so when their plan ultimately succeeded they could use more of their pre-planned Russian scheme to smear him even more, knowing that his supporters would read it and not believe it more than the people they were trying to set us up against?</p>

<p>11) &quot;Donald Trump plays a critical role in this. Do not be swayed by his fucking smooth talk and his &quot;against the system&quot; appeal, it&#39;s all fake bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p>You know what, actually, I guess you&#39;re right /s</p>

<p>12) &quot;We are conspiracy theorists, we don&#39;t trust the government AT ALL.&quot;</p>

<p>Once again, not trusting a government does not define a conspiracy theorist. A conspiracy theorist is somebody who researches conspiracies. You can&#39;t force us to hate the government when its all of a sudden inconvenient for you.</p>

<p>13) &quot;Why the fuck should we trust this guy?&quot;</p>

<p>Because imo there is more reason to trust him than not and one post are r/conspiracy, which is somehow stickied) is going to convince me that Trump is a globalist when all of the research I&#39;ve done points otherwise and you don&#39;t have one piece of evidence to back that up. Everything you&#39;re saying is speculation</p>

<p>14) &quot;Remain skeptical my brothers, stick together.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll remain skeptical of the posts in this sub that is for sure. I don&#39;t need to stick with anybody, and neither does any true conspiracy theorist. The point of being one is to be a freethinking individual. Not hive mind groupthink.</p>

<p>15) &quot;I love you all! Peace.&quot;
I don&#39;t buy it for a second.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to expand on this because I share your sentiment. </p>

<p>We are in the most amazing time period in human history yet. I truly believe the internet has gone a long way to creating a way for humanity to access all the information we have up to this point (which is honestly amazing when you think about it) and this is really helping to connect our global consciousness and our raise our global awareness as one. </p>

<p>Combine that with our technological advances and what we will see coming with automation and Healthcare and we are legitimately in a make it or break it time period. The next 100-150 years (two generations) will decide if we are going to be ruled as slaves by a rich elite who can actually live forever like God&#39;s, or we rise up into a new phase of humanity and look forward towards the future. </p>

<p>It&#39;s scary to think of the former, but with the unity of humanity and truth stemming from light and love being shared all over the globe, I lean towards the latter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m replying on mobile, so if you want to see if I am bullshitting currently, you&#39;ll have to find what I am about to mention yourself. BUT, Trump is mentioned in the same depositions that got billionaire pedophile Jeffery Epstein charged with sex crimes. </p>

<p>The same witnesses who alleged Epstein raped them, alleged that Donald J. Trump was (literally) next in line to forcably fornicate with them. The court docs are out there, and I can certainly link to them when I am back home, but it is IMPERATIVE that people understand the connection to underage sex crimes, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and international syndacates of crime are statistically likely (I believe &gt; 70%, possibly higher) as correlated by the 2001 study done by UPenn researchers Estes and Weiner.</p>

<p>This means if Trump was involved in illegal activity with a man connected to a HIGH-LEVEL prostitution ring (including underage), he has statistically involved himself with prime blackmail material with international crime syndacates. That is, if he isn&#39;t involved in the trades themsleves. </p>

<p>Most importantly, the allegations of Trump&#39;s involvement predates his presidential run, which I would say rules out the likelihood that his mentioning is some sort of smear campaign.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t take my word for it. Find the Epstein docs yourself, look into the Estes/Weiner report on Sex Crimes, or challenge me if you think I&#39;m wrong. But do your own research. In either case, I would say you are bettered by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The same witnesse<strong>s</strong> who alleged Epstein raped them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false. One woman claimed that Epsein + Trump raped her together. This claim was <em>years</em> after the original bevy of lawsuits and claims against Epstein. This woman was not connected or named in any of the pre-existing allegations or facts surrounding the case. She only came forward this past April with her claims and lawsuit, right when it was obvious Trump was going to be the Republican nominee for President. Many commented that the case would strung along and never tried until after the election. Sure enough, right after the election, the case was dropped. Indeed, the press conference right before the election was also cancelled. Why? So the plaintiff did not perjure herself or lie on national TV. </p>

<p>This is r/conspiracy for pete&#39;s sake. Does this really look to you like a legit claim and lawsuit? The intent was almost surely to lord this over the Trump team&#39;s heads so as to discourage them from pressing the Epstein-Clinton connections. And sure enough, Epstein was hardly mentioned during the election. Trump did not want to bring attention to this pending lawsuit, fictitious or factual, for obvious reasons. And more damning, the main stream media hardly mentioned this lawsuit until the very end of the election, when things were desperate. Don&#39;t you think they would have hounded Trump with it from the moment it came out in April? They hounded him for much less shocking and salacious things. Why did they not? The same reason the Trump&#39;s team didn&#39;t bring up Epstein: they had their own Epstein problem. </p>

<p><strong>It was card to neutralize the other&#39;s. The Epstein card</strong>. And the Dems had to invent their own, since Trump&#39;s was so well documented and proven (in a court of law no less). </p>

<p>i take extreme umbrage of your feeding the bullshit meme that those of us on the left are ignorant, tit-for-tat, infants.</p>

<p>you aren&#39;t working to shatter the false dichotomy of right and left, but to reinforce and exacerbate it.</p>

<p>here&#39;s who i was before two weeks ago: <a href="/u/anarchsmurf">/u/anarchsmurf</a> and /u/ f l x e r</p>

<p>if you&#39;re serious be transparent, who were you before 27 days ago? who did you you vote for? i saw in one of your replies you love john oli er, so it sure as shit wasn&#39;t bernie or jill.</p>

<p>those who base their entire argument on no true scotsman, genetic, appeals to emotion, have to live and die by their own sword. so i throw your fallaciousness back at you.</p>

<p>I replied this to one of your other comments, but copy it over here as the other comment responds to a deleted one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fabrication. Drumpf isn&#39;t a German name and doesn&#39;t exactly sound German, more like a bastardization. There is no mention of this name in any record or history book created before Trump announced his run. And after that, there is only one obscure and unproven mention in one book about a possible ancestor who lived around 1600 AD and could maybe have carried that name. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drumpf is most likely a made up name and used by Oliver to make Trump&#39;s name sound more like a Führer&#39;s. </p>

<p>And John Oliver is not a credible source. At least do due diligence and quote the book that he may have used as a source, and mention that there is no historical record anywhere in the German speaking world backing up the claim that book makes.</p>

<p>We should remain skeptical of our new president, as we would with any other new president. As conspiracy theorists, we question everything, especially our government. We need to recognize that the Elite are setting the stage for violence in this country and trump plays an integral role in it as the &quot;false prophet&quot; of the conservatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate users who can concede a point, so thank you for that!</p>

<p>The problem I had with it, is that the name bastardization is an easy to spot and easy to debunk conspiracy of the mainstream media, shills and leftist hardliners. Not exactly something I expect to see perpetuated by an open minded, skeptical user on r/conspiracy. It made you look like you have an agenda, or at least naive wrt mainstream anti-Trump propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, agreed. I&#39;ve seen my share of politics and conspiracies and for now Trump pushes all the right buttons to get me cheering for him. He&#39;s not my Messiah, but based on what I&#39;ve seen so far I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s pushing the Western world in the direction I want. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t follow him blindly however. It&#39;s trust, but verify.</p>

I will say that there is a coordinated effort from a group or groups to basically turn the conspiracy groups into puppets. Very much like they did with 9/11 and all the different people playing the conspiracy community for money from suckers, though the motivation isnt only money this time.</p>

<p>If you guys keep focusing on &quot;SJW, liberal tears, Clintons and racism isn&#39;t happening&quot; trains of thought you will be playing into their plans and ignoring the issues that are going on.</p>

<p>For example where are the threads about the dossier and its summery? Why is there still pizzagate threads but something that is a bombshell of a conspiracy with actual fact and evidence to go through and follow up on and discuss is missing from here?</p>

As conspiracy theorists, we are supposed to be examples of critical thinking and questioning of the federal government, and we chose to assume that the new president is no different than any other assumed globalist puppet&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I think the situation is a bit more layered than most believe it to be. Ideological differences aside, there are those that do not think the corruption is a critical problem, and may even think the government has their best interests in mind. Then there are those that think that DJT is going to &#39;Drain the Swamp&#39; and end, or at least start to end/expose the blatant corruption in the US. </p>

<p>The powers that be are a lot more embedded in civilization than just those exposed in the Wikileaks like the CF and etc. These people are those like the Rothschilds, etc - people descended from the Khazars that follow the Talmud, are Satanists, and pose as Jews to hide behind the guise of antisemitism (99% of Jewish people have no idea of any of this, and the generalizations people make is what causes problems as well as makes people write off this knowledge). This is where the Pizzagate and human trafficking stuff comes into play and why it does not seem as far fetched as without context. These people who are actually in charge are the ones that cannot be criticized.</p>

<p>Even if DJT&#39;s winning was orchestrated by the powers that be, I think we are much better off than with HRC winning, hence the enthusiasm shown on this forum (not to mention his antics are pretty entertaining/satisfying like his telling off of CNN during his first press conference). The middle class was dwindling, our rights were gradually being stripped, I think this slide into a NWO was too direct for the US&#39; citizens to stand, and this win will not only at least provide a window of relief from the direct takeover during the last 16 years, but also stand as an indicator that people are starting to become aware that there is more to the equation than they are told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh.  I&#39;ve been on here for seven or eight years.  I have used tons of different names, and have posted a lot on different topics. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is a &quot;real conspiracy theorist.&quot;  I don&#39;t think there is a dogma.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re in a confusing time, even for conspiracy people, who typically look for underlying patterns.  Personally, the underlying patterns I thought were there didn&#39;t predict this too well. </p>

<p>The real test of a theory is its predictive ability.  I have learned this by watching countless conspiracy media people fuck up and get it wrong.  You are credible if your worldview makes sense of events before they happen.  You have a good handle on the major power players if you can sketch out their motivations before the big event or media push. </p>

<p>Coming in after the fact and explaining &quot;what is going on&quot; is easy.  I could paint 5 equally viable scenarios about what&#39;s &quot;really&quot; going on now.  But I have no reason to trust OPs any more than the 4 others, some of which have Trump being legit, some of which have him being a con, and some of which have us all deceived and living in a completely constructed false reality. </p>

<p>I think the key thing for all of us is to stay open minded and debate.  Don&#39;t demand unity.  Don&#39;t demand dogmatic allegiance.  Demand reasoned, rational debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an alternative view, the powerful elite dont really have the same power and arent really in control. Trump was a useful idiot pushed by the mainstream media (US propaganda department), a heel made to crush legitimate republican party players that would minimize competition, and it did. After fixing the democratic nomination against an outsider, Hillary Clinton would face off against someone unqualified and so hated that the people would forget all about her lies, deception, corporate ties, crimes, and constant controversy surrounding her entire career. The media has always had a stranglehold over public opinion, assuring all the 60+ viewers and voters Trump didnt pose any threat and all the polls and predictions said Hilary with a land slide. She banked on her platform of NOT being him, and the fact a majority voters are women (with HER). Former american presidents and several prominent republicans endorsed her, the news endorsed her and slandered Trump, and in the end only a land slide would work.</p>

<p>Now you have a confused celebrity billionaire desperately scrambling to find people who supported him from the beginning when his campaign was a joke. Draining the swamp but unfortunately the business of politics is made up of gators. Having no monetary influence or political aspirations, Trump&#39;s position is simple one of a populist looking to tickle his ego and be remembered in history as making everyone happy and fixing a country he does not understand. Every US president is handed the torch of the former&#39;s several on going international conflicts. Since he isnt a politician, and may see war as an unproductive waste of money, if he attempts to change the status quo and attempt a non interventionist policy, i guarantee you we will see the first assassination attempt of our lifetime. CIA has a habit of outsourcing to the mafia, perhaps El Chapos people or maybe a Syrian radical will do the job- placing the ultra right maniac Pence as head puppet and leader of the free world. When i hear leftists cry and shake about a celebrity troll who is left leaning in many degrees, I think they would literally THROW themselves to save Trump if they knew the dangerous potential of Pence as president. Pence is a politician, can be bought and sold like all politicians and wants ultimate politician power like all politicians. I only hope Trumps delusions of grandeur are sincere and his swamp he created will be of people that take his directions if he disagrees. If he pulls us out of all wars, reduces regulations and taxes- you&#39;ll see the economy increase within a couple years. His ego IMO is too big to take orders from anyone and nothing can influence him only manipulate him. Hes going to rely on his mixed team of shit heads to make the best decision they think is possible; which we can only hope is in our best interest and not the standard corporate/banker interest. Trump is a loud mouth wealthy joe blow american bullshitter over promising business man wit no principles but just opinions; and leader of the free world, but hes not a politician. At this point i just can be optimistic rather than pessimistic because its a wild card and all the black propaganda and demonization of trump post election on the news is the system panicking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.&quot; Matt. 19:24</p>

<p>The uncanny, unpredictable, and altogether stupefying way Trump won couldn&#39;t possibly have been foreseen or believed by anyone, not even by his most faithful and ardent supporters who never expected it in their wildest dreams. A good showing for a lot of hard work at best, some hefty points made with enough support that something just might get done about them, but not a win. It was simply too much to hope for with far too much going against it every single step of the way. Why it&#39;s hardly believable even now.</p>

<p>And the rallies where tens of thousands gathered in overflowing stadiums time and time again, all over the country, to see and hear what that man like Trump had to say... who could ever have possibly expected a reaction like that for a man like Trump? Yet it happened all the same, as if they were drawn by some irresistible force, or faith, or forlorn hopes, I don&#39; know or even have a clue, do any of you? </p>

<p>Or did you notice how clean, nicely dressed, and courteously all these vey ordinary people, many with their children in tow, behaved and comported themselves at those rallies like it was Sunday go-to-meeting-time and all standing tall and singing the national anthem before getting down to what they were all there for? When was the last time anything like that ever happened in American politics, or rallies for any candidates that actually outshone and outnumbered either of the two major parties own national conventions, for pity sake?</p>

<p>Now the Republican party had absolutely nothing going for it going into this past election. No hopes for the future and no plans that could possibly have redeemed them in the eyes of the general public. Why even a man like Trump could brush all their hopefuls off and out of the running like he would some bit of lint or so much dust off the cuff of his sleeve. He had them all cold and threw just how inconsequential they and all their lackluster ideas were in their very faces and the ordinary delegates were completely blown away by it but it hardly mattered to the party officials who believed they were going down for the count on this one and they might as well let him take the wrap and responsibility for it.</p>

<p>The surprise on election night was complete and just as shocking and unexpected on both sides. Laughingly, joyfully like some unexpected gift from on high on Trump&#39;s side and like some stern rebuff and reprimand for too many sins to count coming from the same place for Clinton &amp; Co. It was quite simply divine and divine retribution writ large and too plainly to call it anything else.</p>

<p>Despite what I&#39;ve written and the tone of it, I&#39;m not a particularly religious fellow but I can&#39;t help but see and feel something highly unusual and providential in all this. Trump has touched on all kinds of subjects that are regular fare here but very few other places and certainly not anywhere even close to the government let alone the guy who&#39;s ultimately going to be in charge of it. He&#39;s questioned the official story of 9/11, challenged the Fed, wants the vaccine controversy thoroughly and honestly investigated, gone after the automakers, and just challenged big Pharma and given them all good swift kick in the pants. </p>

<p>More and more people, even Bernie Sanders, are finding points of agreement with him. To believe this was all somehow all pre-planned ad a gigantic conspiracy is to dream of an ability to control too many improbabilities and bring them to fruition that goes beyond any human limits to do. True enough the Clintons are nothing if not a diabolical bunch but you cannot say that about Trump. Mean, cantankerous, occasionally histrionic, with good dash of flim-flam, but those are entirely natural human flaws that we&#39;re all prone to without ever being considered to be bad people rather than simply ordinary ones having a bad moment or a bad time with something and losing our cool over it. Is there anyone here that thinks Trump hasn&#39;t had and is still having one hell of rough and bumpy ride into office or isn&#39;t actually worried that some lunatic or paid killer might do what some of his clearly sick and deranged opponents have had the utter gall and temerity to suggest that someone should do to him as if that was some kind of a joke?</p>

<p>Trump more than deserves the benefit of the doubt. He&#39;s stormed the ramparts and taken the castle and fought a good fight every inch of the way. He&#39;s got his fair share of shortcomings and stereotypes he has insufficient dealings with to know better when he offhandedly generalizes but so do we all and plenty that should have been offended chose not to be because he was nothing if not as warm, courteous, receptive, and thankful towards them as anyone else when they attended any of his rallies to find out what he was all about. So I&#39;d say on any of those points that are of concern to us here that Trump is likewise concerned we should solidly back him up on and get others to as well. It&#39;s an ideal time to get them out in the open and more openly talked about. The mass media that failed to it&#39;s job and that has become a part of those conspiracies against the ordinary people has been outed and shown themselves for what they are. They no longer dictate what everyone presumably thinks and must now find out and be honest about it if they are to save themselves. There are signs of that now with the changing of the guard. When the Atlantic comes out for Trump and dresses down Buzz-feed just as severely as he did over the bogus report they published without being able to verify anything in it you know the game is up and has radically changed from what it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this post is you contradict yourself. You tell everyone that Donald Trump is an actor playing a part ( which is likely true ) but in the same breath you just say to Trump supporters that they should remain skeptical. </p>

<p>You cant have it both ways im afraid. Either Donald Trump is part of the machine or hes not. This is the question. Evidence indicates that he was part of the machine but broke free from it, his ego got the better of him and now hes gone rogue.</p>

<p>This is the conspiracy we need to prove under a Trump presidency. Who does he stand for and what agenda is he playing to or is he literally just playing his own game.</p>

<p>We are praying that Trump is playing his own game and that his ego is what is driving him forward because that ego he has will want him to go down in history as the greatest president ever , the peoples president and that is only good for America.</p>

<p>Hopefully over the next coming months and years this sub will examine the evidence and we will answer this question and the only question.</p>

<p>What agenda does Donald Trump follow? his own? or someone elses?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I picture the wealthy owners of our society as an old robber baron fat man stuffing his face with fancy food, as he watches two teams of peasants fight each other to death. </p>

<p>While the teams are fighting, little minions of the fat man will go around the room pick-pocketing those who are too busy fighting among each other to notice. If some peasants stop fighting, the minions will go around poking and instigating peasants to get them angry again. If some peasants start realizing what is going on, some minions go in and sabotage those peasants, so that order is restored. </p>

<p>We are at the stage of the game when more and more peasants are looking over to the fat man, and are witnessing his ongoing cushy comfortable feast as his minions go around taking more and more away from the peasants. </p>

<p>More and more peasants are getting angry about it, and the obvious conclusion is that both sides of peasants need to stop throwing punches at each other over dumb shit, need to call out and guard against the minions of the fat man, and need to finally turn against the fat man to gut him of his ill-attained power. </p>

<p>The final question becomes... what now? (after the fat man is gone). After the two sides discovered and eliminated the fat guy, who calls the shots now? Does each side pick a representative to defend the causes and ideals of each side? The real work to repair everything should begin at that point, but leave it to humans to fall back on their usual old ways. </p>

<p>Instead of collaboration across racial and ideological lines, around the shared goal of increasing life satisfaction/happiness for all, we will likely fall back on left vs right sentiments and a new long round of more bickering will begin.</p>

If that faith is shattered, then more will see the light.  If Trump honors his commitments towards freedom, then those who doubted and mocked this anti-globalization movement will begin to wake up too.  Its a win/win If you are optimistic, but there is no reason to mock the man personally with recycled John Oliver insults (which Mr.Oliver was proven to be associated with the Democratic propaganda agenda thx to wikileaks)</p>

<p>The only source for it is a book published after Trump announced his run, naming an unproved ancestor of him, who allegedly lived in 1608. This then got repeated ad infinitum by John Oliver as an insult to make Trump seem more Führer-like.</p>

<p>When in reality, these people are not smart, just wealthy. Wealth brings power. They are opportunists and are not always in control. Instead competing factions take advantage of different crises and also instigate their own subversion.</p>

<p>Cuba was an example. The elites couldn&#39;t control that, and it&#39;s one of their many failures.</p>

<p>All you&#39;ve lot have done, is get the George W Bush Republicans more power with Trump. It&#39;s the same fucking wing of the elites that were in power during 9/11 that are back into it. With more power.</p>

<p>Step outside yoru evangelical Christians North American Republican voting world view for half a second and see what the competing factions (plural) of elites are actually doing. What? You didn&#39;t know that the competing factions of the elites go to war with each other?</p>

<p>The Moral Majority Religious Republicanity is the bigegst propaganda tool on earth and it&#39;s designed to get you idiots to vote Republican blindly every time. Worked well for the architects of 9/11 inside job. Now you&#39;ve got them re-elected with a new Russian/American puppet.</p>

<p>This faction of elites just rolls with it and adapts to the circumstances.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a useful idiot, and his compromise is not political, his compromises is his multi-million dollar business that exploding during the Obama years with the influx of racist Republicans. Alex Jones has a product to flog (many in fact), so of course he was looking for the right Republican to save the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad someone sees it similar to me. Seeing conspiracy theorists put so much blind faith in Trump concerns me a bit - trust me, I too believed he was actually a crusader against the Globalists. 
But it actually makes sense. If I was an elite who wanted to cause more disorder on a nation, naturally, I would set up the election with two terrible choices to give The People a bleak outlook on the future - this reduces the chance of them standing up and making real change. 
Then I would rig it to where the less competent candidate with a bad impression on The People would win, causing even more disorder. 
It&#39;s clever, and I can&#39;t believe people haven&#39;t woke up to this shit.
I feel sorry for both sides, especially the Left. The causes they&#39;re fighting for, and the lengths they&#39;re going to fight for them, and the Alt-Right seems to be the counter movement to their movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no.</p>

<p>consolidation of power began with alexander hamilton and the federalists. it began with budding northern industrialists and capitalists. that&#39;s not political, it&#39;s just an historical fact.</p>

<p>the civil war was about &quot;slavery,&quot; but not in the sense we use it today--as a moral fight. it was used purely in the economic sense. </p>

<p>chattel slavery is an (ancient) economic system, particularly suited to agrarian enterprises. the north also depended on slave labor, but the newly minted type of wage slavery (it was called this at the time, even by lincoln, who had no problem with it). we are all still wage slaves =) (the north won in more sense than one).</p>

<p>the civil war, as is true of every war, was about money. </p>

<p>for examp,e, the missiouri compromise wasn&#39;t about slavery being immoral, it was about small white farmers trying to keep the plantation system out of the new terriories because, just like how mom and pop&#39;s can&#39;t compete with walmart, small time farmers couldn&#39;t compete with plantations. the plantation system created and maintained poor &quot;white trash&quot; in the south, because it pushed them out to the marginal, worthless land.</p>

<p>the missouri territory wasn&#39;t a gaven for slaves (they were sent back) or freed blacks (the were froze out). missouri is still pretty unfriendly towards blacks tbh. </p>

<p>another example, though they were democrats (the party of the south) and despite being sympathetic to the south because they equated northern aggression with britain&#39;s tyranny over ireland, they fought for the north largely because they feared freed blacks competing for the only shit jobs the irish could get. irish immivrants didn&#39;t even know what a black person was, let alone giving them enough thought to hate them because they were black.</p>

<p>the economic battle btwn the north and the south had been being waged since the founding with federalists, whigs, and republicans cripling the south with tariffs that forced the south to trade with north, as opposed to the more lucrative great britain. one of the final blows was the renegging on the transcontinetal railroad running from the south westward, taking the more logical route that bypassed the rockies--it was why the gasden purchase was made in the first place, but it would have made the south the economic equal of the north.</p>

<p>there is no way for the states to fight the federal govt now. we don&#39;t have denatured uranium amunition, fighter jets, tanks, etc. the only wat we xan fight them is to ignore them and stop funding them. however, most state govts are as corrupt, if not more so, than the federal govt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ridiculous, ain&#39;t it? I wonder if OP is was a BernieBro... that would explain a lot. We need to give this time. The TPTB is not an all-powerful conspiracy, despite what many in this sub think. Many will tell you that it centers around Israel, but even Israel is battleground for different cabals of power with different goals, as are the global elite. The conspiracy is rather small, and once they are exposed there downfall will be short and swift.</p>

<p>The oddest part of this thread is an almost condescending view of the military. Does everyone really think they would stand for martial law or fight a civil war against the people? I for one am hopeful that the military can wrest control back from the intelligence community and make intelligence subservient to the military and not vice versa.</p>

<p>But its also tough when racism is normalized in your industry. You&#39;d never expect the liberal media, but that&#39;s where some of the worst institutional racism lies. We only have diverse TV and movies because demographics are changing. POC&#39;s, LGBTQ, and women are featured a lot more, often not in the interest of equality, but of profits.

    <div class="md"><p>It was proven to be a totally meaningless piece of paper that just came from a guy, who wasn&#39;t even Mi6 at the time that he wrote it, who was working for the Hillary campaign and compiling any sort of negative stories he could on Trump. Buzzfeed has disowned it as having any sort of credibility. CNN has disowned it as having any sort of credibility. Every MSM outlet has disowned it. There&#39;s not a single person (other than Correct the Record shills) who actually think that document is real.</p>

<p>The 4chan story is pretty convincing and it has <strong>a lot</strong> more substance than any other explanation.</p>

<p>So yes, when you present a document purporting that the President of the United States is a Russian Spy and gets piss showers from hookers in order to spite Obama, and your document is not proven to have any sort of credibility or substance, it&#39;s called &quot;disproven&quot; because of a little thing known as <em>burden of proof</em>. As in I could write a document tomorrow that states <a href="/u/spartan1117">/u/spartan1117</a> gets piss showers from hookers, but if I cannot prove it, then my claim is &quot;Disproven&quot; and the very same logic applies here.

    <div class="md"><p>Again like i just said the four million figure isn&#39;t &quot;my low estimate&quot;, that is literally the plaque they had outside the concentration camps until 25 years ago.It is true that Jews in Nazi Germany were treated like garbage but the gas chambers are all a fabrication, mass shooting were a fabrication and the photos of masses of jews starving to death were taken by liberating USSR troops after months of bombing railroads and roads that were supplying camps with supplies.They were starving to death because the supply lines were destroyed.</p>

<p>Official red cross documents from the mid 70s claim 282,000 Jews died in the camps - <a href="http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/images/arols2.gif">http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/images/arols2.gif</a></p>

<p>1933 World almanac claims ~9.5 million Jews living in Europe
1948 World almanac claims 9.372 million jews living in Europe

<p>With all conspiracies i urge you to ask yourself who benefits.Who benefitted the most from World War 2? The answer is the Zionist Jews.Without WW2, without Hitler the state of Israel would not exist.</p>
