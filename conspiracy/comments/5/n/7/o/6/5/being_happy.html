<p>Yes the world may be a terrible place and were all fucked, but I&#39;ll be damned if that makes me unhappy. Cuddling on the couch with my wife is enough to make me forget about all the ugliness in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ya, being with your wife is great but keep in mind, the source of happiness is inside of you. If you depend on your creations (money, religion, family, ect..) you will end up being disappointed. Nothing can make you as happy as what exists in your mind and if you get it right, you can learn to be at peace even in the harshest prisons of the world (god forbid). Your mind is what creates your outer world including your marriage, ect... That is the source of all things. Government has kept quite a few secrets from the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting it right is a huge answer. Honestly, your best bet is to read a very popular book called &quot;Conversations with God&quot;. It is literally an instruction manual on happiness, defeating the elite, setting up a new social system for humans, understanding the mysteries of life, and much more. It&#39;s an 8 book set and was on the NYT best seller list for 2 years. There are youtube videos of people with every problem in the world giving testimony on how wonderful they now feel. Lol. The instruction manuals inside are full of extremely easy but highly effective mind tricks that pretty much upgrade the whole world into a better place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>religion is a set of symbols and interpretations that are institutionalized. many people believe that these symbols tell a more or less literal tale, but anyone else&#39;s beliefs shouldn&#39;t prevent you from seeing what you can learn from a symbol system with good discernment. my -- thoroughly unsolicited, and for that i apologize-- advice: follow your instinct and don&#39;t spend more time contemplating the mere existence of god-- but don&#39;t discount religious or religious-interpretive texts either, as what we see in a symbol is always just a reflection of us, which is what makes them so ripe for intellectual and emotional exploration. happiness only becomes possible through harmony with the self and its reflections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. It says that religion is mans way of defining God and man has always defined God as himself. Currently, we define God as possessive, jealous, and extremely demanding so we are again thinking that God is just like us. I read about his personality and he is more open minded than anyone you have met in your life as far as sex, riches, and partying goes. He condones these things as they are healthy for the mind so ya, its totally different than the Bible. Of course, he doesn&#39;t like discraceful actions, but he never judges or punishes anyone because life is misunderstood. We aren&#39;t simply dumb humans that can&#39;t get anything right and so Jesus had to be sacrificed so we avoid hell. This book says there is no hell, no devil, no punishment, no judgement, or anything. All there exists is the game and if humans want a better world, they have to aim for a better world and then they will have the support of this God as this desire spreads. Until then, we have free will and God himself will not impinge on our free will even if we want bad things for ourselves.</p>

<p>That being said, the world needs their eyes opened and a huge reality check. The wolves have been in power long enough to get sloppy and the sheep are catching on.

Alphabet soup agencies, CTR and whoever else can try and influence us through the media as much as they&#39;d like, but word of mouth and face to face communication to encourage critical thinking amongst our family and coworkers cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>I hear you man. A lot of people who have fully bought into the commercialized/narcissistic/fervently religious bullshit that gets spewed at us through every avenue of possible can be hard to connect with. The vast majority of people are too ignorant to research information, analyze both sides and draw conclusions for themselves. Even with the truth literally right in front of their faces, some people willingly choose to stay in the dark to the fact that they&#39;re getting fucked by the people that should be looking out for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it totally changed me, I remember I used to want to be a veterinarian, go to a four year college, all that, straight A&#39;s. But once I found out about how we&#39;re all just in the rat race building up the rothschilds empire, and we&#39;re just existing, I got really depressed and didn&#39;t care about my grades because I didn&#39;t believe in the school system (indoctrination). It&#39;s hard knowing the truth when everyone around you doesn&#39;t, and they&#39;re enjoying their lives because they&#39;re happy little sheep, who don&#39;t question a DAMN thing, they work then die, that&#39;s all. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned to live with it I guess, but I&#39;ll never be the same enthusiastic happy go-getter like I used to be. I don&#39;t live in the dream world anymore, this is reality and we&#39;re being played.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ya, being with your wife is great but keep in mind, the source of happiness is inside of you. If you depend on your creations (money, religion, family, ect..) you will end up being disappointed. Nothing can make you as happy as what exists in your mind and if you get it right, you can learn to be at peace even in the harshest prisons of the world (god forbid). Your mind is what creates your outer world including your marriage, ect... That is the source of all things. Government has kept quite a few secrets from the people. </p>
