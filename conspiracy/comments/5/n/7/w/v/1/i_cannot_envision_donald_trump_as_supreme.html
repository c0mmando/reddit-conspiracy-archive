    <div class="md"><p>I hope that over the next four years every national and international blunder and cringe-addled tweet cuts to the bone and makes people realize that one of our greatest hinderances lies with the two party system and a media beholden to incentives to push narratives that never put we the people first. </p>

<p>So many people are ready to storm the Inauguration but sit back quietly and idly while the First Past The Post setup is the thing that got us in this mire to begin with. How many people declined to vote out of apathy or chose to vote not because they liked the candidate but just didn&#39;t want the other in the White House? Where were the riots and college age youth crying when it came out that Sanders had to agree to step down in order to even throw his hat in? Or that the media purposefully downplayed the third party candidates, only giving them air time to shittalk them while giving Trump and Clinton unlimited free coverage? </p>

<p>Sadly I think most will just find fault ends with Trump and play into the next round of circus bullshit, this time voting someone even worse in because &quot;Hey the system is totally fine, just elect anybody who isn&#39;t Drumpf!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the election has shown the strength of the electoral process. Despite a massive coordinated effort of mainstream media and political cabals working to defeat a single candidate, the electorate made their own, separate choice.  </p>

<p>Many here would argue that Trump is actually the &quot;elites&quot; chosen wolf in sheeps clothing, but I think that is giving too much credit to a body of individuals who have consistently demonstrated their total lack of understanding the current populations wishes and desires. The elites have also shown, over and over, an ineptitude to grasp the power and effectiveness of open digital dialogue and communication. Their reaction to Trumps election appears to be censorship and misinformation. Unfortunately for them, it&#39;s obvious and mostly ineffective once one is aware of it.</p>

<p>As someone else here had mentioned before, the message he presented was the best for the US, and if he follows through on his promises the next 4-8 years will be a good time for the nation.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s lying and completely in it for himself and his rich buddies it will show through really fast, and thanks to the climate being generated by the alt-left, pitchforks torches and muskets will likely be the order of the day and I&#39;ll be right there supporting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting point of view. However Donald Trump has proven to be in over his head on numerous occasions.
He talks the talk but he does not have execution power to bring his plans into fruition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think one of the things he brings to the table is the ability to drive others. You don&#39;t get to where he is financially, and politically, without that skill. So he doesn&#39;t need the execution power so long as those he manages do. It&#39;s a basic concept in business mamagement that effective employees make the manager <em>appear</em> effective even if they are total retards.</p>

<p>We should be looking at the people he appoints and assessing their skills for the jobs they are assigned. To get a sneak peak on how the administration is going to run you can just look at how his appointments run their own personal careers. Trumps job is just to drive them hard enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Trump isn&#39;t the knight in shining armor we thought we needed, in fact, he&#39;s not even close to the liberal PC elite that&#39;s turned our country into selfish, my personal feelings are important, consumers.</p>

<p>I choose to hold out that he will do better than a clinton, bush or reagan. Any man who is close to Nigel Farage (the mind behind brexit, looking to dissolve the EU) deserves a chance in my book.</p>

<p>I want everyone to close their eyes and invisage a future under Hillary... nuff said. (Given they were the choices)</p>
