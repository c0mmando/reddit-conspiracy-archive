        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So recently, Theresa Mays&#39; Tory government have decided to adopt the <a href="http://archive.is/sTgkW">International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRAs) definition of Anti-Semitism.</a> <a href="http://archive.is/cDS1P">Another article.</a></p>

<p>You can find a copy of what the IHRA defines anti-semitism as <a href="https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/sites/default/files/press_release_document_antisemitism.pdf">here.</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you some excerpts from this press release, of what the IHRA defines as antisemitism:</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such
or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, <strong>the myth about a
world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other
societal institutions.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a
single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the
Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices
during World War II (the Holocaust).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews
worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.</p></li>
<li><p>Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by <strong>claiming that the existence
of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other
democratic nation.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing
Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>So asking the JQ, questioning or denying the Holocaust, questioning the Jewish influence in the media and banking, are all now definitions of Antisemitism that the UK has adopted. Doing any of these things can land you prison time and fines.  For &quot;hate crimes&quot; as ridiculous as this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kamil Malmon, of Polish origin, was found guilty at Willesden Magistrates Court of racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage after he wrote “F*** da juda” in pencil on the wall of Pinner Synagogue in June. Malmon was given a 26 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months, and ordered to pay costs of £735.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cst.org.uk/antisemitism/prosecutions">More examples</a>. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Oh and let&#39;s not forget about Theresa May&#39;s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/snoopers-charter-theresa-may-online-privacy-investigatory-powers-act-a7426461.html">Snoopers Charter</a>, which she snuck into law under our noses a few weeks ago, (after massive uproar last year when it was first announced and repealed). </p>

<p>These new spying laws make it mandatory for our ISP to track and document every single website we&#39;ve visited for a year, and allow the government full access to this information.</p>

<p>This means that if you are a UK citizen and you visit /pol/ or even &#39;questionable&#39; subreddits, Theresa May&#39;s government can track you down and put you in prison. If you search google for merchant memes, watch Holocaust denying youtube videos, or ask for proof of the Holocaust, or ask why there are so many Jews in the media online, this will be saved and can be used against you to put you in prison for &quot;hate-crimes&quot;.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have a VPN already as a UK citizen, I highly suggest you get one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That &#39;quote&#39; does not make sense regardless of who said it, so it&#39;s not a good example. At all.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s a better example-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subjugated races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, that&#39;s a nice quote saying pretty much that if you want to rule over or conquer a nation, its citizens should not be allowed to have access to arms. That quote is by Hitler. Is it any less wrong because of who said it? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The origin of a quote puts the philosophy into context.</p>

<p>If your&#39;e quoting Hitler, his philosophy is associated with a set of beliefs that imply certain biases and values.</p>

<p>Pointing out where somebody is getting their philosophy signals to that there may be a fundamental difference in the premise we use to interpret the argument.</p>

<p>Like, you might believe that there&#39;s an evil cabal of Jews out to get people who are insufficiently Jewish, which would mean that your opinion of these libel laws would depend on the assumption that they were intended to be leveraged by such a group.</p>

<p>A person who didn&#39;t get their philosophy from hitler is less likely to consider that.</p>

<p><strong><em>YESSS!!!!</em></strong></p>

<p>But then again, <strong>NO</strong>. </p>

<p>From the Jewish magazine <strong><em>FORWARD</em></strong> (May, 2012)</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://forward.com/culture/155742/jews-are-a-race-genes-reveal/">Jews Are a ‘Race,’ Genes Reveal</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his new book, “Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People,” Harry Ostrer, a medical geneticist and professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, claims that <strong>Jews are different, and the differences are not just skin deep.</strong> Jews exhibit, he writes, <strong>a distinctive genetic signature.</strong> Considering that the Nazis tried to exterminate Jews based on their supposed racial distinctiveness, such a conclusion might be a cause for concern. <strong>But Ostrer sees it as central to Jewish identity.</strong></p>

<p>“Who is a Jew?” has been a poignant question for Jews throughout our history. It evokes a complex tapestry of Jewish identity made up of different strains of religious beliefs, cultural practices and blood ties to ancient Palestine and modern Israel. But the question, with its echoes of genetic determinism, also has a dark side.</p>

<p><strong>Geneticists have long been aware that certain diseases, from breast cancer to Tay-Sachs, disproportionately affect Jews.</strong> Ostrer, who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center, goes further, maintaining that <strong>Jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a “race.”</strong></p>

<p>For most of the 3,000-year history of the Jewish people, the notion of what came to be known as “Jewish exceptionalism” was hardly controversial. <strong>Because of our history of inmarriage and cultural isolation, imposed or self-selected, Jews were considered by gentiles (and usually referred to themselves) as a “race.”</strong> Scholars from Josephus to Disraeli proudly proclaimed their membership in “the tribe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much more at the link.</p>

<p>So YES, Jews are, by and large, a &quot;RACE&quot; (or, as the highly esteemed Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson put it, Jews are a &quot;<strong><a href="http://www.mailstar.net/shahak2.html">SPECIES</a></strong>&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>{quote} <strong>The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person</strong> stems from the common expression: &quot;<strong>Let us differentiate</strong>.&quot; Thus, we do not have a case of profound change in which a person is <strong>merely</strong> on a superior level. <strong>Rather, we have a case of &quot;let us differentiate&quot; between totally different species.</strong> This is what needs to be said about the body: t<strong>he body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of [members] of all nations of the world</strong> ... The Old Rabbi [a pseudonym for one of the holy Lubovitch rabbis] explained that the passage in Chapter 49 of Hatanya [the basic book of Chabad]: &quot;And you have chosen us&quot; [the Jews] means specifically that the Jewish body was chosen [by God], because a choice is thus made between outwardly similar things. <strong>The Jewish body &quot;looks as if it were in substance similar to bodies of non-Jews,&quot;</strong> but the meaning ... is that the bodies only seem to be similar in material substance, outward look and superficial quality. T<strong>he difference of the inner quality,</strong></p>

<p>{p. 60} {quote continued} <strong>however, is so great that the bodies should be considered as completely different species.</strong> This is the reason why the Talmud states that <strong>there is an halachic difference in attitude about the bodies of non-Jews [as opposed to the bodies of Jews] &quot; &quot;their bodies are in vain.&quot;</strong> . . . An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. <strong>Two contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>So, who wrote this shit???</li>
</ul>

<p>Was it some CrAzY fringe lunatic Jew that no one cares about or pays attention to?</p>

<p>Nah, Schneerson was one of the most highly esteemed and respected Jewish figures of the 20th Century - honored by US Presidents and Congress - THE KEY orchestrator of the MASSIVE movement known as &quot;Chabad&quot; or &quot;Chabad-Lubavitch&quot;, which has achieved a pervasive presence worldwide - particularly targeting university and college campuses.</p>

<p>Read more here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson</a></p>

<p>Are Jews IN FACE a different &quot;species&quot; than the rest of humanity?</p>

<p>Well, Schneerson says so, and who am I to argue with the wisdom of such a profound and influential luminary as he?</p>

<p>However, IF Schneerson&#39;s observations are true (and genetic testing would seem to aggree), it seems we have a bit of a conundrum here - because the interests of JEWS are not necessarily compatible with those of the &quot;inferior&quot; Goyim (non-Jews)/</p>

<ul>
<li>How could they be?</li>
</ul>

<p>This Jewish belief, that Jews and non-Jews are irreconcilably &quot;differentiated&quot; is NOT new, it has formed the cohesive infrastructure OF JUDAISM for hundreds, nay, THOUSANDS of years. Indeed, it is this core tenet that has enabled Jews to maintain their identity as a separate and distinct &quot;people&quot;, even while living in the midst of (but largely separated from) their Gentile neighbors - century after century - while managing to AVOID fully assimilating into ANY of the cultures of their &quot;inferior&quot; gentile host nations.</p>

<p>Interacting with the (inferior) Gentiles is inevitable - but ASSIMILATING into the Gentile is the GREATEST sin/fear facing Jews today - or at any time, for that matter.</p>

<p>Google: <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=assimilation+greatest+threat&amp;amp;oq=assimilation+greatest+threat&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.17871j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Assimilation greatest threat</a></strong></p>

<p>Now, it seems certain that not ALL JEWS would agree with the observations and pronouncements of the likes of the esteemed Rabbi Schneerson - but the fact that few make any effort to openly rebuke and condemn his racist (speciest) pronouncements should tell us SOMETHING, should it not?</p>

<p>And the political activities of Jews - ON THE WHOLE - would seem decidedly supportive of Schneerson&#39;s declarations, would they not?</p>

<p>And why wouldn&#39;t Jews, on the whole, tend to support these seemingly wild-eyed theories? After all, they HAVE been shown to be profitable, no? </p>

<p>Pound-for-pound, are Jews not the single most financially successful group on the planet? Do they not wield far more muscle in the realms of politics, entertainment, and news media than any other single group on the planet?</p>

<p>A very impressive achievement, to be sure (golf clap), and I suppose it is laudable - or at least WOULD BE laudable, were it not for the fact that their &quot;successes&quot; inevitably come with a cost - a miserably tortuous burden that must be carried by the &quot;other species&quot; of humanity.</p>

<p>Finally, if History is a notable teacher (and it is), there is an awkward twist to this whole scenario, and, short of some miracle on a Messianic scale, history WILL repeat (AGAIN), as the meteoric RISE of Jewish power will be followed by a catastrophic <strong>CRASH</strong>.</p>

<p>But if history is any indicator, they&#39;ll just blame the Goyim, and restart the process - oblivious to any lessons that may have been learned - <em>&quot;It&#39;s like Deja Vu all over again!&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong><em>/You may now release the Hounds!</em></strong></p>
