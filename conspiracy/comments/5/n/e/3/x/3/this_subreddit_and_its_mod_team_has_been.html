       No i love this sub. This is the inly reason I'm even on reddit. But i love it because of the users not the sub itself. If it is really compromised i just want us all to have a plan is all

       Here's a plan: Don't throw shit at the people in your neighborhood if you want to continue to enjoy living in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look - r/conspiracy blows up 3-4 times a year, every time something really catylizing hits the news. None of this changes this community - which is fairly chill on the regular. Jumping ship is not the way. Just wait out the storm.

       Friend,
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that things blow up around here sometimes, but instead of sticking together, you just threw shit. Saying what you did insulted the entire community. And our mods? Man. Those guys put up with massive amounts of shit from us. I think it's fair to assume they've been overrun &amp; overwhelmed. Can we not turn on them?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have pitchforks that are so shiny. Let's not dirty them on the wrong people. :)

       Dude, reddit is fucked. Completely done for as far as the first amendment goes.. that's proven by the downvote system.. as for this sub it's the best place on reddit for now... not for long.. that's all I'm saying. If i was throwing shit I'd be telling everyone to fuck off and suck my balls and how fucked up everyone here is.

       Well shit.. i think it should be on another platform. I just don't know what. Someone else was talking about another conspiracy sub called  r/conspiracynews and supposedly if you post information without a source or childishly call someone a "nutter" or something like that you get an immediate ban. But free discussion is still there. I guess trying to cut down on shills/trolls. I don't know about limiting speech though. Inevitably it WILL be compromised no matter what you call. We have to literally meet at the docks at night lol.

       The frontpage is a T_D wasteland right now.  It's all posts about how the sub is being brigaded and pro-Trump posts that aren't conspiracy related.  Last night just finally exposed this sub for what it is to all of Reddit.

       I think there's a lot of drama going on behind the scenes.  Suddenly I'm seeing comments not being moderated and lots of (((triple parenthesis))) being thrown around.  I've been seeing anti-semitism staying up even after reporting it (I'm talking about things like "Oh, you're such a good goy!" - flagrantly anti-semitic shit).

       They are removing conspiracy discussions citing "lack of evidence" when other posts with little evidence are allowed to stay up. They are just making up excuses to remove posts that don't fit there agenda. This subreddit should be a bastion of free speech, not just another mouthpiece for the establishment propaganda.

       I think that they are pushing a pro-Trump agenda, as they remove posts about a very big conspiracy theory surrounding him, but leave other posts up. This is a subreddit for
       <strong>
        theories
       </strong>
       . Every theory deserves to be discussed, not just removed because the mods think it is unrealistic.

       Then we need to tell the mods to make sure they don't add any new mods on board. Bc that's what will be the shills next step is to become a mod. 
I personally think the mods are legit here and maybe we had bots in here yesterday? 
We def don't need any new mods bc if we get a shill as a mod.. this sub will be fucked

       I don't have to. They have an agenda. You'd have to be blind or actively ignoring it to see it. I continue to lol at how willingly blind some people are to this subreddit's transparent right-wing agenda, but will then call anyone who disagrees an astroturfer.

       I think the opposite is true. So we have a difference of opinions and hopefully we can keep discussing this civilly.

      <p>
       The anons have actually provided more proof the leak was fakery than the CIA has provided as true. The onus is on Buzzfeed (lol if you believe them anyhow), John Kerry, and the "intelligence" community to provide verification of the leak. They haven't. The government is accountable to
       <em>
        the people
       </em>
       . The failed document released last week basically said "trust us, we are totally sure it's Russians... oh and RT news sucks".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're contradicting yourself. You want proof of brigaiding, but don't ask for proof of authenticity from your own government. wtf?

       You really need to question your stance when the NYT (a massively anti-Trump news source) is

      <p>
       What evidence have
       <em>
        government agencies
       </em>
       provided to support the story? Furthermore, what evidence have they provided of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       collusion between Trump and Wikileaks, which is something that's been claimed for months? These are agencies accountable to
       <strong>
        you

       the citizen. Why are you so concerned about Reddit mods and not your own government?

       From the NYT -
       <em>
        "Of particular interest was the use of unsubstantiated information from anonymous sources, a practice that fueled some of the so-called fake news â€” false rumors passed off as legitimate journalism"
       </em>

       Right now the sub is pumped full of pro-trump upvoting, you don't see any of it as politically motivated?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't artificially pushed, it had people from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       , who believed it was a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're now being that guy saying "nah, censorship is fine. Just because plenty of other theories are left out there about Clinton, Obama, and the first trump one is heavily upvoted then removed, it's fine. Nothing going on."

       If you keep saying it, it doesn't make it true. The arguments you, and others, make about this sub being pro-Trump are blatently false. I think what you all are defining as "Pro-Trump" is what everyone else calles open discussion. This sub isn't an echo chanber of r/politics or r/The_Donald even though there is five or six threads started daily saying it's pro trump replica of T_D.  If you truly feel otherwise, start another sub. It's that simple. The beauty of pages like Reddit is that you can this, and if others share your feeling they will follow. Personally I like the range of opinions and political viewpoints I see here, even though many of them I totally disagree with. It also why Imchose to post and discuss topics here and not the circle jerk many subs here have become.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the artificial pushing, I watched it get pushed real-time. The mods appear to have come to the same conclusion as me and acted accordingly. I think they made the right call.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me now ask you a question; If you were a mod on this community and you and other mods saw what you (and they) think was brigaiding and an artificial attempt to push a thread, what course of action would you take in order to keep the sub as fair and balanced as possible and attempt to prevent the same thing happening again?

       It was a fucking HUGE story. Once it made it near the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       it just got even bigger. Eventually it made it to the front page of

        /r/all

       and just exploded. It happens with any obscure subreddit that makes the front page. Instead of the regulars who visit the subreddit, it gets bombarded with the entirety of reddit.

       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       <a href="/r/dataisbeautiful">

       Every day, pro-Trump non-conspiracy articles get 60-100 upvotes within minutes, forcing them onto the frontpage.  Typically they have no comments or just a few that heap praise on the poster for sharing without discussing the contents of the article.

       Too bad a Trump supporting mod who stated he would recuse himself from modding things related to Trump deleted it.
Lurking for months does not make you an expert.
It should have been left on the front page.  I have never seen any bs pro Trump posts removed for brigading from The D.  Wonder why?

       They removed an anti-trump post that (if true) could be one of the biggest conspiracies in recent years, citing lack of evidence. However they leave many other posts up that have very little evidence (something which they should do, as this is a sub for discussing theories).

       Well shit.. i think it should be on another platform. I just don't know what. Someone else was talking about another conspiracy sub called  r/conspiracynews and supposedly if you post information without a source or childishly call someone a "nutter" or something like that you get an immediate ban. But free discussion is still there. I guess trying to cut down on shills/trolls. I don't know about limiting speech though. Inevitably it WILL be compromised no matter what you call. We have to literally meet at the docks at night lol.
