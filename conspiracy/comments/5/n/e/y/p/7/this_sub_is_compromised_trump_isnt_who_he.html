       This is exactly what I'm talking about. Anyone speaking the TRUTH is labeled a shill. This sub isn't yours. If you shit talk clinton, your a russian puppet, but if you dare speak about trump your CTR. Which is it huh?

       War cry for the weak minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying he IS a shill, I'm not saying he ISN'T a shill, but you need to know what the shills say to know what the message they're pushing is.  If you don't know the message, you can not counter it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you see him as such, prove him wrong, or show others WHY he's a shill so they can learn.  If you have knowledge they do not, share it with them and help make this a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop the shills where they stand with words, and prove their ideas as false.  Labeling someone a shill is something a shill would do.  It creates confusion and causes unnecessary drama.  I'm not saying you are doing that, but know that the shills ARE.  They sling mud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't sling mud, sling the truth.

       Well, there
       <em>
        was

       a shill raid here yesterday. It was disturbing and unlike anything I've ever seen on this subreddit.

       As for Trump, very few people genuinely like him. The vast majority of people here are very skeptical of him. I'm sure as soon as we have some factual conspiracy information on him, it'll be on our front page every day. But for now there isn't much, probably because he isn't even President yet. Do you have any dirt on Trump you'd like to share with us? We welcome it as long as there is evidence.

       I don't think that anybody is saying it's not possible that Trump isn't who he says he was. I just think that people get kind of upset when people suddenly start posting on this sub Reddit who have never even commented here before about how terrible Trump is an about how he's a Russian agent with literally no proof. Improve made up on 4chan isn't really convincing. And let's say that it does get proven, that Trump was working with Russia. Why does that really matter? It shouldn't matter how or why most of those leaks came about, what should matter is the content it revealed.

       This is not true. Something really is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past 2 hrs, I had 2 PM's on my main account letting me know they were banned, my main account got banned for simply asking a question, and when I switched to this account so I could watch how this thing unfolds and spread awareness, another user responded to one of my comments via PM telling me he had been unfairly banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's 4 bans in the past 2 hrs. For no reason. With no warning. Please explain if you feel people are wrongly concerned?

       According to the screenshots, it says the reason you were "temporarily muted" was for "trolling." To be completely fair, I didn't see the offending post in question. I have no way of knowing if you were unfairly targeted by moderators or if you truly did troll.

       It was a shill raid. For anyone who was paying attention to votes/comments as the story broke, it was obvious. I've never seen it happen so suddenly on such a large scale. It was happening across multiple sub-reddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, you are absolutely right. Trump can almost do no wrong on this sub, but I don't think that means the sub is "compromised".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this long-term smear campaign against Trump has had the opposite effect of what was intended. Instead of turning against Trump, people are digging their heels in and just blindly defending him, largely due to the amount of lies about him that have been presented as truths in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump should not be immune to criticism. People like him didn't get where they are by being nice or playing by the rules. Frankly, I would be shocked to find out he isn't involved in multiple conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to drop their political bias in here. If you support the Democrats or the Republicans then you're missing the point entirely. If there is a grand overreaching conspiracy, then the 2 party system is part of that. If you like a particular politician then fine, support them, but don't support their corrupt political party blindly, and don't assume everyone on the other side is bad either.

       Their reverse psychology is working on some. We the people need to come to our own conclusions based on evidence. I agree, this sub isn't compromised, but there are accounts that come here to mislead people. The real members of this sub know what's shit and what's not, and we don't need to waste time talking about stuff we know doesn't matter

       Even if I did look through his post history the decision to use a throw away would have had been made before I even decided to because the comment made by the throw away would have to exist before someone could look through the account.

       I understand the various reasons people would use a throwaway but the comment by redspacepanda seemed pretty benign. I know some people regularly delete and then use new accounts so maybe that's what happened.

       How has he not been what he promised? It's comments like that that get you classified as ridiculous out of the box. He isn't even sworn in yet. And yet you say it like it's an obvious  forgone conclusion.

      <p>
       Like sure, let's hold his feet to the fire. But let the man do the job for a minute before we talk about what he hasn't done. Is that an unreasonable request?
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't tell me about what he said or she said. Politicians lie for a living. Talk is cheap. When he does something, or doesn't, let's talk about that.

       Better questions are when are the Zionist Jew politicians going to stop shouting for unconstitutional disarmament if peaceful citizens, and when will they stop putting on these absolutely unbelievable asinine fake shootings?

       Complains Trump isn't doing what he promised.... 8 days before he takes office. GTFO. Should we start complaining about the 46th President now just to get warmed up or what?
