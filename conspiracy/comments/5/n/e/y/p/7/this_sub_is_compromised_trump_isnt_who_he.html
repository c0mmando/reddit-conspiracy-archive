<p>I&#39;m not saying he IS a shill, I&#39;m not saying he ISN&#39;T a shill, but you need to know what the shills say to know what the message they&#39;re pushing is.  If you don&#39;t know the message, you can not counter it.  </p>

<p>If you see him as such, prove him wrong, or show others WHY he&#39;s a shill so they can learn.  If you have knowledge they do not, share it with them and help make this a better place.</p>

<p>Stop the shills where they stand with words, and prove their ideas as false.  Labeling someone a shill is something a shill would do.  It creates confusion and causes unnecessary drama.  I&#39;m not saying you are doing that, but know that the shills ARE.  They sling mud.</p>

<p>As for Trump, very few people genuinely like him. The vast majority of people here are very skeptical of him. I&#39;m sure as soon as we have some factual conspiracy information on him, it&#39;ll be on our front page every day. But for now there isn&#39;t much, probably because he isn&#39;t even President yet. Do you have any dirt on Trump you&#39;d like to share with us? We welcome it as long as there is evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but you saw in the screenshots, they said if I switched accounts I would be issued a site-wide ban so I&#39;d rather you not believe me than me lose my account over proving it..</p>

<p>Another person just PM&#39;d me.. he got banned for posting a picture of a tomato and saying it was trumps ass. I thought the reason they banned me was ridiculous, THAT is just plain stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a shill raid. For anyone who was paying attention to votes/comments as the story broke, it was obvious. I&#39;ve never seen it happen so suddenly on such a large scale. It was happening across multiple sub-reddits.</p>

<p>That being said, you are absolutely right. Trump can almost do no wrong on this sub, but I don&#39;t think that means the sub is &quot;compromised&quot;.</p>

<p>I think this long-term smear campaign against Trump has had the opposite effect of what was intended. Instead of turning against Trump, people are digging their heels in and just blindly defending him, largely due to the amount of lies about him that have been presented as truths in the media.</p>

<p>Trump should not be immune to criticism. People like him didn&#39;t get where they are by being nice or playing by the rules. Frankly, I would be shocked to find out he isn&#39;t involved in multiple conspiracies.</p>

<p>People need to drop their political bias in here. If you support the Democrats or the Republicans then you&#39;re missing the point entirely. If there is a grand overreaching conspiracy, then the 2 party system is part of that. If you like a particular politician then fine, support them, but don&#39;t support their corrupt political party blindly, and don&#39;t assume everyone on the other side is bad either.</p>

<p>First of all I&#39;m not the original commentor I was just responding to what you said.</p>

<p>Even if I did look through his post history the decision to use a throw away would have had been made before I even decided to because the comment made by the throw away would have to exist before someone could look through the account. </p>

<p>I understand the various reasons people would use a throwaway but the comment by redspacepanda seemed pretty benign. I know some people regularly delete and then use new accounts so maybe that&#39;s what happened.</p>

<p>Like sure, let&#39;s hold his feet to the fire. But let the man do the job for a minute before we talk about what he hasn&#39;t done. Is that an unreasonable request?</p>

<p>And don&#39;t tell me about what he said or she said. Politicians lie for a living. Talk is cheap. When he does something, or doesn&#39;t, let&#39;s talk about that.</p>
