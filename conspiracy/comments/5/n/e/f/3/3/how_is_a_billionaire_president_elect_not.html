       You and me both, want the answer to that. It's fucking ridiculous that he can claim nationally that he's smart for avoiding releasing his tax returns, then still not. Baffling the kind of shit people with money can get away with even after they admit to it.

       I think his exemption from paying ended several years ago for that billion dollar loss in the 90's. But being exempt from paying doesn't mean he didn't have to file, he was just able to write off what he would have owed.

       Was gonna pose this question myself. Please upvote this. Trumps response that "only journalists care about his tax return" is complete and utter bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also blatantly ignored the question as to whether him or anyone in his campaign had any contact with Russia during the campaign. His entire press conference seemed completely scripted to me. This man is starting to scare the hell out of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whata even scarier is Mike Pence is next man up. Something is definitely going down on or before January 20th. The polticial stage has never been so strange.

       Because it doesn't fit this subreddit's clear and apparent right-wing agenda. They're literally deleting anything relating to the
       <em>
        conspiracy theory
       </em>
       that Trump is a russian puppet. Why? Because apparently this subreddit is
       <a href="/r/Confirmedwithevidence">

       and we've all just been reading it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It requires Olympic level mental gymnastics to think him not releasing his taxes and the russian puppet allegations are false, while at the same time being perfectly content to accept a politician is a pedophile because they're a liberal.

       I don't really see it as a conspiracy at all.
Why. The government knows what he paid, they know the loopholes he has taken. Releasing them doesn't prove anything. You already know he avoided paying taxes at every turn.
It's not like he is the only one that knows what's in them and turning them over would expose a crime of his to the  government.

       Look, I don't think anyone should be above scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, we are being told that Russia 'hacked' the election. Completely false. Never happened. Not even Podesta was hacked by the Russians, his password was Runner4567.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think selling our uranium to Russia was clearly treason and should be prosecuted and that this is a distraction from the real relationship between the US and Russia that goes back a long, long time. Remember, we had double agents at the top of their government in the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, we are told this weird story that can be proven false, based on Trump's known whereabouts, which are quite public, in general, and I am supposed to get on board with "Trump is in bed with the Russian" when the CIA and the Clinton Cartel are demonstrably the ones guilty of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we see are DARVO tactics. When the Clinton Cartel makes an accusation, like the one against Assange through Todd and Claire, they are 1) knowingly lying 2) accusing people of what they themselves are likely guilty of 3) diverting attention from the real problem of organized crime within our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We" aren't able to prevent conflicts of interest and the Clinton example makes it clear that the standard is applied very, very selectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the news and the CIA stop lying, then I think there is room to move forward. Entertaining their BS is not appropriate at this time, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government sanctioned gun running. Drug trafficking. Brownstone operations. Until we clear these issues up, the rest is a moot point.

       And what does any of that have to do with ensuring Trump is accountable and conflict of interest free? Clinton is gone. She won't be in government at all and bringing her up anytime someone wants Trump be a transparent isn't helping your argument.

       I mean, maybe. I have no opinion other than, Trump already gave is reason and it is not a "conspiracy."

       Anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand what the definition of conspiracy is.

       Trump is also not a career politician, so holding him to that standard seems weird.

      <p>
       Honestly, his explanation seems reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I want total transparency in government? Yes, but I don't see a big movement to ask for transparency into Troika Dialog or Uranium One, CIA gun running within the US... or their "Domestic Operations Department," which all seem like much bigger issues than Trump's taxes which... I maintain... aren't going to reveal the big picture.

       FBI Anon already said he wasn't totally clean, but that his crimes pale in comparison to the Clinton Foundation. Thus far, FBI Anon hasn't really been wrong. Give it a few more months to see if Bill Clinton dies, but the source is so far reliable.

       It might not be a huge conspiracy the likes of previous things, but the reason he gave for not releasing them is bullshit making me wonder why he really doesn't want to. And you say you want transparency, but don't care that the incoming president cant even be as transparent as the previous ones were up to this point.

       There is nothing that benefits him from releasing them now.

       Why would he do that when the people already elected him. The only ones concerned are the MSM and a loud minority of Democrats.

       I mean, it isn't a conspiracy. Do you know what a criminal conspiracy is?

       From the Prison Blood scandal, pardons, to Uranium One... those are actual proven criminal conspiracies.

       Trump not releasing his tax returns and explaining why doesn't really seem like much of a conspiracy. I mean, you can disagree with the ethics of it... but... by definition, it is one person who doesn't want people to see his tax returns, meaning not a conspiracy.

       To be clear, I am not arguing against the idea of him releasing his tax returns, I think that is a good faith gesture that he could provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only wonder if they are so complicated that they will be impenetrable to average people, which would require them to be interpreted for consumption. And then who is to say what can be manipulated by the interpretations? Let's face it, there can be a balloon in front of everyone here, and there will be fierce arguments over whether it is red or blue. Now, take something as sophisticated as a billionaire's tax return, and I am not sure how useful that information would be to us in ending any pointless debates. It would just create thousands of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, there is absolutely no requirement for a candidate to release their returns. I forget which campaign they started doing this as a way to discredit candidates, but iirc that was a small conspiracy in itself. Might have been during the Bush/Gore election? The premise is there doesn't even need to be anything bad there, you just hold up the request, wait for the candidate to balk, and then say they are hiding something by not providing them. There is no actual information exchanged, but it creates a perception of dishonesty and corruption.

       It's more than just a gesture. The guy could be in the red for all we know. I mean his campaign was largely based on his skills as a businessman, I personally want to see how much of that claim was true.

       It would literally be a gesture though, there is not requirement for it. But, people would have it perceived that there is, and he is failing to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said awhile back we will get to see them once the IRS is done with them. I think that is BS and he is just buying time to get far enough away from the idea that it falls out of public consciousness. But, I don't really care about his tax returns either way. Just acknowledging the disingenuousness of saying he is waiting on the IRS.

       It's a conspiracy that you think "tax releases" matter.  Presidents have been showing gross tax returns for years, but as long as they are filed correctly, no one bats an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax releases used to prove you weren't on the take.  Now it's just to prove you filed correctly and on time.

       As far as it goes it's not legally required to do so. He is a business man so think of it this way. He's going to invest his personal money to win the election. He does this for personal and public reasons. Since he is not obligated to release them he didn't during the election l, Why? Because doing so would have put him under scrutiny like Hillary was under. It was a strategic move. His goal was the win the election and he played to game to do so. He worked the electoral college like a game of chess. Not releasing his taxes is important because he owns most of his business personally not incorporated so revealing his tax records would show all his business financials to the world. Do you think apple would give mircosoft all of the financial information? He does this to protect his competitiveness in business. Say he lost he still has a multi-billion empire to run. Alot of his business is based on his promoting prestige and luxury. His tax returns might show he makes less than he does but his whole brand is built on his name and persona. Why doesnt he release them now? For the same reason he didn't release them on the campaign, he doesn't have to. And he still has that empire to protect.

       And what does any of that have to do with ensuring Trump is accountable and conflict of interest free? Clinton is gone. She won't be in government at all and bringing her up anytime someone wants Trump be a transparent isn't helping your argument.
