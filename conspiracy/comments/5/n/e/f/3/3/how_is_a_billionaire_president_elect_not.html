    <div class="md"><p>Was gonna pose this question myself. Please upvote this. Trumps response that &quot;only journalists care about his tax return&quot; is complete and utter bunk.</p>

<p>Also blatantly ignored the question as to whether him or anyone in his campaign had any contact with Russia during the campaign. His entire press conference seemed completely scripted to me. This man is starting to scare the hell out of me.</p>

<p>Whata even scarier is Mike Pence is next man up. Something is definitely going down on or before January 20th. The polticial stage has never been so strange. </p>

Why. The government knows what he paid, they know the loopholes he has taken. Releasing them doesn&#39;t prove anything. You already know he avoided paying taxes at every turn.
It&#39;s not like he is the only one that knows what&#39;s in them and turning them over would expose a crime of his to the  government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I don&#39;t think anyone should be above scrutiny.</p>

<p>However, we are being told that Russia &#39;hacked&#39; the election. Completely false. Never happened. Not even Podesta was hacked by the Russians, his password was Runner4567.</p>

<p>I think selling our uranium to Russia was clearly treason and should be prosecuted and that this is a distraction from the real relationship between the US and Russia that goes back a long, long time. Remember, we had double agents at the top of their government in the 80s.</p>

<p>But then, we are told this weird story that can be proven false, based on Trump&#39;s known whereabouts, which are quite public, in general, and I am supposed to get on board with &quot;Trump is in bed with the Russian&quot; when the CIA and the Clinton Cartel are demonstrably the ones guilty of this.</p>

<p>What we see are DARVO tactics. When the Clinton Cartel makes an accusation, like the one against Assange through Todd and Claire, they are 1) knowingly lying 2) accusing people of what they themselves are likely guilty of 3) diverting attention from the real problem of organized crime within our government.</p>

<p>&quot;We&quot; aren&#39;t able to prevent conflicts of interest and the Clinton example makes it clear that the standard is applied very, very selectively.</p>

<p>When the news and the CIA stop lying, then I think there is room to move forward. Entertaining their BS is not appropriate at this time, however.</p>

<p>Government sanctioned gun running. Drug trafficking. Brownstone operations. Until we clear these issues up, the rest is a moot point.</p>

<p>Anyone who says otherwise doesn&#39;t understand what the definition of conspiracy is.</p>

<p>Trump is also not a career politician, so holding him to that standard seems weird.</p>

<p>Honestly, his explanation seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Do I want total transparency in government? Yes, but I don&#39;t see a big movement to ask for transparency into Troika Dialog or Uranium One, CIA gun running within the US... or their &quot;Domestic Operations Department,&quot; which all seem like much bigger issues than Trump&#39;s taxes which... I maintain... aren&#39;t going to reveal the big picture.</p>

<p>FBI Anon already said he wasn&#39;t totally clean, but that his crimes pale in comparison to the Clinton Foundation. Thus far, FBI Anon hasn&#39;t really been wrong. Give it a few more months to see if Bill Clinton dies, but the source is so far reliable.</p>

<p>Do I want transparency? Yes.</p>

<p>Do I think Trump&#39;s taxes belong in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>FUCK NO IT&#39;S NOT A CONSPIRACY IT&#39;S ONE DUDE WHO DOESN&#39;T WANT TO SHOW HIS TAXES UNTIL AFTER THE IRS IS DONE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, I am not arguing against the idea of him releasing his tax returns, I think that is a good faith gesture that he could provide. </p>

<p>I only wonder if they are so complicated that they will be impenetrable to average people, which would require them to be interpreted for consumption. And then who is to say what can be manipulated by the interpretations? Let&#39;s face it, there can be a balloon in front of everyone here, and there will be fierce arguments over whether it is red or blue. Now, take something as sophisticated as a billionaire&#39;s tax return, and I am not sure how useful that information would be to us in ending any pointless debates. It would just create thousands of them.</p>

<p>All that said, there is absolutely no requirement for a candidate to release their returns. I forget which campaign they started doing this as a way to discredit candidates, but iirc that was a small conspiracy in itself. Might have been during the Bush/Gore election? The premise is there doesn&#39;t even need to be anything bad there, you just hold up the request, wait for the candidate to balk, and then say they are hiding something by not providing them. There is no actual information exchanged, but it creates a perception of dishonesty and corruption.</p>

<p>He said awhile back we will get to see them once the IRS is done with them.

He does this for personal and public reasons. Since he is not obligated to release them he didn&#39;t during the election l, Why? Because doing so would have put him under scrutiny like Hillary was under. It was a strategic move. His goal was the win the election and he played to game to do so. He worked the electoral college like a game of chess. Not releasing his taxes is important because he owns most of his business personally not incorporated so revealing his tax records would show all his business financials to the world. Do you think apple would give mircosoft all of the financial information? He does this to protect his competitiveness in business. Say he lost he still has a multi-billion empire to run. Alot of his business is based on his promoting prestige and luxury. His tax returns might show he makes less than he does but his whole brand is built on his name and persona. Why doesnt he release them now? For the same reason he didn&#39;t release them on the campaign, he doesn&#39;t have to. And he still has that empire to protect.  </p>
