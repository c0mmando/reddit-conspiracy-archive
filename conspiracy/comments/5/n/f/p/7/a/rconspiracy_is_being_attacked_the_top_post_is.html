       Look at my edit, the argument of Pizzagate does not in any way surround the "pedofile code". This has been going on since the 80's. Pizzagate is just a window into the world of these evil people

       I'm one of the biggest skeptics I know. I have tried to prove myself wrong. I've tried proving to myself there's no way our government is being run by satantic child molesters. Everytime I did research I only came upon more information that showed it to be true. Research the things in my edit if you want to look for yourself.

       If it's made up by 4chan, where is the archive of the creation?

       The majority of people left /pol/ partly because the board has been fully archived for quite some time.

       </a>
       so hard if we weren't considered a threat. There wouldn't be this much effort to silence Pizzagate if it didn't have any merit. TPTB are scared and fighting back, but no amount of shills will stop the truth from coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills, when Pizzagate is finally proven true, you will have to live with the guilt that you actively helped these pedophiles cover up their monstrous crimes. There's still time to redeem yourselves and jump off the sinking ship before that day of justice arrives.

       The top post is ABSOLUTELY not about how it's ridiculous we don't take pissgate as seriously as pizzagate

        You are crazy conspiracy theorist for pizzagate, but pissgate is totally cool

       Do you not detect the sarcasm? Without even reading the body of the post anyone with a high school reading comprehension level and a rudimentary understanding of both stories can see that OP was remarking on how hypocritical the people who believe pissgate are
