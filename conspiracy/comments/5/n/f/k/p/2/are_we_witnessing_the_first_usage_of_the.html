        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently signed into law (somewhat deceptively as well): <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-24/obama-signs-countering-disinformation-and-propaganda-act-law">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-24/obama-signs-countering-disinformation-and-propaganda-act-law</a></p>

<p>Do you think we&#39;re witnessing this law in action for the first time through the scarce factual reports of Russia meddling in our election, along with the recent and undocumented, unverified Buzzfeed and intelligence dossier claiming Russia supposedly used blackmail on Trump for the past 5 years?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen multiple people argue that the intel communities have known about these document claims since August... but they haven&#39;t been able to either verify or discredit the claims, or even provide further documentation and better research for said claims (as the report is very lacking)? It&#39;s just been sitting on the back burner? Why are we only hearing about these claims now, 10 days before Trump&#39;s inauguration? Assisting and colluding with a foreign government is fucking treason, and yet we&#39;re to believe that intel has had these sources for months without mentioning this level of severity to the people nor made progress in getting to the bottom of this? (Not just Russia&#39;s involvement, but Trump being a puppet for Putin)</p>

<p>Or has this dossier recently (within 2-3 months) been given to them? In which case I can see the plausibility in 4chan&#39;s argument since an anon literally spent months creating a pro-Hillary Twitter account to gain credibility with Rick Wilson, then on Oct. 31st/Nov. 1 claimed that he &quot;leaked&quot; the fanfic to him and it was going to be published. The timing of Wilson&#39;s tweets align with the anon&#39;s claims as Wilson kept promising an October surprise. Some speculate parts of this dossier were anon&#39;s, along with additional Russian spy narratives added. </p>

<p>Again, this is all conjecture. However, I&#39;m starting to wonder if this is the first attempt at using the abilities this law grants them. I haven&#39;t seen anyone considering this law, which surprised me a shitload. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, as their reports on Russian affairs haven&#39;t provided distinct proof. Not considering the fact the FBI was denied direct access to the DNC servers, which they wouldn&#39;t need if CrowdStrike&#39;s analysis could be completely trusted. But can we completely trust their report? There&#39;s holes all through it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably. With all the fuss around the Russians tampering with the US elections something smells really fishy and that something is the Russians themselves. All of this sounds like a Clancy&#39;s novel. It&#39;s surreal, given the current position Putin is in, and all the other powers that could carry this alleged attack.</p>

<p>There is rumors that Putin popularity among the Russia&#39;s elite is in serious low, and the government and military basically run themselves without any Putin authority. I don&#39;t think Putin is in a position to request such elaborate attack.</p>

<p>If the alleged tampering is real, others powers might as well carried the attack, like the Chinese (Huge tensions in South China Sea), the North Koreans (They love the US) and Iran(They really want them nukes). All these powers have their secret cyber warfare divisions, and could use the tampering to distract the US from theirs activities. </p>

<p>The target is really suspicious - The Russians could do it, but they can&#39;t take the heat as they used to. All that&#39;s left to question is who would benefit from a US Russia cyber war (Both parties have too much on their plate for a full on armed conflict)?</p>

<p>One of the things governments do when preparing for war is a larger censorship and espionage on its citizens to detect possible spies. The timing of this censorship act, and the British espionage act couldn&#39;t be more precise. All these facts led me to believe that some conflict will arise within this decade and if I were to gamble: A &quot;Russian&quot; operative will assassinate Trump on its inauguration just as a symbol to declare war (a la Franz Ferdinand).    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input man. I&#39;m definitely not as well versed in foreign affairs as you appear to be, so I can&#39;t directly comment on anything you&#39;ve just stated</p>

<p>Interesting perspective on Russia&#39;s internal affairs though. Haven&#39;t heard the angle that Putin is in no position within his country to levy such a cyber attack on the US to actually impact our elections for their benefit. </p>
