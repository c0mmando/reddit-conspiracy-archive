       I imagine it's the best thing we could equate it to with the experiences we have today. Much like the belief that God rode down on a chariot of fire which is flat out ridiculous. But how else would someone describe a spaceship 2000 years ago with only whats around them as reference?

       ..or maybe it's a clever ruse for covering up inter dimensional beings (your god example) warring and not "space ships". May seem ridiculous to you, but how else would you explain it in the year 2017 with only what's materialistic around you?

       I personally do not subscribe to any religion. My "ridiculous" comment was pointing to someone flying in the air, in a chariot that is on fire. Thats fucking dumb. Also, the interdimensional being idea is highly probable and a lot more believable for me vs an all knowing invisible sky wizard who only shows up 2000 years ago.

       Well, personally I'm not religious either, but I believe in some form of intelligent creation. Whether it was on Creator or maybe a Group, idk.

       Ah, but this is the religion telling us that. See, I believe humans have been around for hundreds of thousand if not millions of years, along side these spirit beings, if you will..
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that's why I say what I say. I don't base it on religious ideas, but only use that as somewhat of a codex, to where to continue looking. I'm a big fan of Graham Hancock's work.

       Robert Oppenheimer the main architect of the US nuclear bomb program made a couple of curious quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
       After detonating the first atomic bomb Oppenheimer remarked "Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Oppenheimer's quote is a mirror of a quote from the epic Hindu tale Bhagavad-Gita where goddesses Shiva and Kristna argue with the devil Kali over the fate of universe
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Some months later Oppenheimer gave another interview about the bomb and said: "It was the first nuclear explosion in Modern Times." So the man who built the first nuclear bomb believes in the ancient Hindu legends of nuclear war in India.

       The rabbit hole is deeper than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Oppenheimer wasn't just a nobody before he invented the bomb. He came from a wealthy banking family that has financial history going back to the 1500s. They were the bankers of kings and war financiers. There is still an Oppenheimer bank on Wall Street and the City if London called the Oppenheimer funds and the Oppenheimer trusts. This family was a world controller for 100s of years and still is. The Oppenheimer family is of the same pedigree as the Rothschilds. They are the blue bloods. Maybe it would be a little too absurd for a man with the name Rothschild to present the bomb to the world so "they" had one of the lesser known Oppenheimer boys do it. They are all part of the same Atlantian bloodline.

       They are just ancient humans from a lost civilization that has been erased from this history books. They use ancient occult knowledge and advanced technology to rule over lesser breeds of humans. I study what is called a merged mythology that connects parallel myths together as one story. In the merged mythology there was a "Golden age" in which humans lived in highly advanced civilizations. The elites who portend to be our rulers are a remnant population of the lost Golden age.

       One thing though, why is the sphere earth lie so accepted in these conspiracy circles yet there is belief in this population from the Golden Age?  Why is it so acceptable to believe all the BS we are fed about Astronomy/Space?  Space is the ultimate distractor,
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are getting everyone to look at the sky and ponder about our insignificance in the universe from our tiny spacerock  hurtling through the galaxy while controlling everyones lives like puppets.

       I agree that space is a huge distraction. It serves the world controllers agenda perfectly to make humans feel insignificant. I don't believe the Earth is actually flat though. The elites are basically just trolling us with space to distract us from other things.

       One interesting point about the word "universe" itself is that it actually supports the Golden age theory. The word universe = uni (one) + verse (musical note). The Universe literally means One Note or One musical tone. If you watch the documentary I liked above it talks about how there was a "sound of creation" that conceived the world into being. They are hiding the truth in plain sight and thinking we are too stupid to notice what is going on.

       The actual shape of the earth is an open discussion still, we will never know until the authorities become free of their shackles and start working for humanity rather their overlords.  Yes space is such vast subject for idiots to get lost in, we haven't even fully discovered all bounties of the oceans and here we are pondering about and wasting resources on irrelevant space crap.

       Oppenheimer was almost a non event. He was a brilliant theoretical physicist but was "dangerous" in the lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was forced to have a tutor at Cambridge to work with him on the practical side so he didn't kill himself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       His tutor was well respected and liked and a hard arse who had served in ww1 and took no shit from anyone. Especially a snivelling rich little jew from New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oppenheimer then decided to off the tutor with the old poison apple technique.
      </p>
      <p>
       He fortunately let a classmate know about the poisoned apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Word got back to Cambridge and only through his super connections was he allowed to stay on. He did leave at the end of that year as he prob got the shit kicked out of him.

       Years ago when decent programming was still on the history channel I saw the second interview you mention and I can still remember the pause "..In modern times"  gave me. I sat there despite my youth being like: "Uh what? The implication there is that a nuclear exchange occurred in the past... What?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't given it much thought lately but would this go in line with a "fall from grace" or "lost apex" kind of theory? Where we (Humanity) were at a much higher level/intellect and after some sort of event we "crashed" or "lost" our greatness, perhaps even consciousness itself was "lost".
      </p>
      <p>
       Those among us who survived this event lived in "darkness" or "complete loss"  until a small portion "regained"/became conscious" first and thought themselves divine they then hoarded this knowledge selfishly among their small families, thus becoming the "elites" we know today, still hoarding knowledge from us the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno if that last paragraph made sense but I regret nothing.

       You may find this interesting. There is evidence of a nuclear war occurring in the early 1800s. It was kind of a battle between lost hidden technologies.

       When we dig up the ancient indus valley sites, we will find tablets that translate into "THE KING AND HIS COURT MOLEST CHILDREN IN NAN PARLORS, #NANGATE". That's why they dropped the nukes then, it's why they'll drop the nukes now.

       And this is why it's hard anymore to visit this sub.  It always turns around to this.  Not disputing it's true but 75% or more of threads posted are revolving around pizzagate, trump, clinton, the fbi, the cia, and on and on and on.  It's nice to have a little break without having the thread hijacked by fucking pizzagate

       This seems to derive somehow from, or seems to be connected in some way to, one of Frank Zappa's pet theories about the origin in of the universe, The Big Note:

       Frankly it's a dumb theory, and this is coming from a huge Zappa fan. Maybe the person cited by OP has never heard of the theory but there's a striking similarity.

       This is a great theory and one of the first ones that really got me interested.  Many areas of glassed sand and petrified wood that could NOT be attributes to lightning or natural fires.

       Large piles of skeletons/bodies killed while going about their day, that are MORE radioactive (today!) then the bodies that were recovered from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

       Examples of radiation poisoning in many religious texts, speaking of hair and nails falling out and needing to wash in water, and eve mentions of how special robes had to be worn by the priest cast to carry/examine the Ark of the Covenant, or the person who got to close without the robe (perhaps anti-radiation lead lined protective outfit?) Would incur radiation poisoning.

       Very very cool stuff!  Beat thing is many of these details can ONLY be attributed to radiation!

       I prefer to believe that Donald Trump went back in his time machine, with a bomb that he accessed while president, in order to set off this nuclear blast; which set into motion the specific chain of events required to gain him the presidency.
