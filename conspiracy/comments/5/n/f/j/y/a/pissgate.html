       Anyone else find it hard to believe pissgate solely because the MSM is pushing it as truth? Come the fuck on people, to go through months of blatant fake news to people here all of a second deciding they believe them again? I call bs this is clearly coordinated

       my answer is evident the question is where are you not seeing the MSM pushing this story as fact? When in the past year has the MSM not used any attempt to smear trump? Fuck that orange billionaire sideways but I can smell when bullshit is being pushed

       Unverified doesn't mean shit, they are still pushing it as if it was verified. If it wasn't verified (and they weren't doing it to mislead people) they wouldn't be taking it so seriously.

       There was an unsubstantiated "dossier" of Trump published by Buzzfeed which claims to demostrate Trump's alliance and corrupt dealings with the Russians. Part of that was a report of him renting a hotel room in Russia that Obama had previously stayed in, getting some hookers in there and having a piss party, which was in some way supposed to defile Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       After this was published, a user on 4chan took credit for putting this dossier together and submitting it to someone who eventually got it into the hands of John McCain, who then took it directly to the FBI for evaluation.
      </p>

       Nobody knows its provenance though.

       <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/bbc-correspondent-ex-british-intelligence-officer-not-the-only-source-for-russias-trump-dossier/">
        BBC Radio has discovered that there are SEVERAL Trump sex tapes
       </a>
       , recorded on different dates and in several Russian cities including Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly more disturbing, there are also audio recordings that may not be sexual but, rather, are of Trump and his team colluding with Russian officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       These materials have been confirmed by American and British Intel Services, as well as the intel services of several other European nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is growing longer legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub should be investigating with every effort, not trying to pretend it does not exist. This is, if true, the biggest conspiracy and scandal in American political history.

       Okay but where's tangible evidence besides the word of "Intel communities" ? The same Intel communities that tell us 911 isn't fishy at all? Quick reminder this is r/conspiracy

       Indeed, it is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and the whole purpose of the sub is to investigate this exact sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/bbc-correspondent-ex-british-intelligence-officer-not-the-only-source-for-russias-trump-dossier/">
        BBC added to the fire today
       </a>
       by disclosing that multiple sources and multiple governments, the USA, the Brits, and several EU Intel Services all have knowledge of 'multiple sex videos' involving Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, personally, I have no problem with that. I don't give a damn if Trump is pissing on someone or getting pissed on himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the rest that is troubling: The audio recordings that purport to show Trump or his people colluding with Russian officials. Profit for Trump, influence for Russia. THIS is the concerning part.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are right, the evidence is lacking but the fire is burning hot. Every media organization in the world, and governments, are looking into this. It is the prize of the century.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is all false, that would be great. If any of it is true, that is disaster for the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is supposed to investigate such things. Let's get to it, let's unleash the power of our hundreds of thousands and find out the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is all false, we need to figure out who should be tried. If it is true . . . a government will fall. Either way, we will all be better off.

       In order to understand what I'm saying you have to be coming from a mindset that doesn't trust the media telling you vague organizations such as nations' intelligence agencies have evidence; why would anyone who doesn't accept their enemies narrative do just that? Especially when it comes down to their word and not tangible evidence

       Okay. I ask this:
      </p>
      <p>
       We are hunting conspiracies, right? On this Sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am combing through media and government sources to provide insight so that I can challenge those sources. Thus, my efforts to expose this conspiracy and to research it further, to dig deeper and hopefully find some answers. Or even just more questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we cannot use the media, or the intelligence agencies, as a way to find what we should oppose and investigate . . . what is left?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we stand on our lawns and shout down the street to find our theories? Should we read the classified adds of our local newspaper?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am using THEIR very words against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have better sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you DO, please share the damn sources. I don't want to waste my time and we could all use your sources to better call out this evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, tell us what to use if not the government's claims or the medias lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Share.

       Many posters on conspiracy said they/we would investigate any Trump conspiracies that came up. Here we have one. A potentially BIG one. We can investigate this just as easily as any other conspiracy. But if the official position of the mod team is that this isn't real, the purpose of this sub has shifted dramatically.

       My rule of thumb is if it is true, or it matters, we don't hear about it from the news. Or we hear about it manipulated in such a way as to be of the least benefit to us.
