    <div class="md"><p>There was an unsubstantiated &quot;dossier&quot; of Trump published by Buzzfeed which claims to demostrate Trump&#39;s alliance and corrupt dealings with the Russians. Part of that was a report of him renting a hotel room in Russia that Obama had previously stayed in, getting some hookers in there and having a piss party, which was in some way supposed to defile Obama.</p>

<p>After this was published, a user on 4chan took credit for putting this dossier together and submitting it to someone who eventually got it into the hands of John McCain, who then took it directly to the FBI for evaluation.</p>

<p>Nobody knows its provenance though.</p>

<p>Possibly more disturbing, there are also audio recordings that may not be sexual but, rather, are of Trump and his team colluding with Russian officials.</p>

<p>These materials have been confirmed by American and British Intel Services, as well as the intel services of several other European nations.</p>

<p>This is growing longer legs.</p>

<p>This sub should be investigating with every effort, not trying to pretend it does not exist. This is, if true, the biggest conspiracy and scandal in American political history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, it is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the whole purpose of the sub is to investigate this exact sort of thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/bbc-correspondent-ex-british-intelligence-officer-not-the-only-source-for-russias-trump-dossier/">BBC added to the fire today</a> by disclosing that multiple sources and multiple governments, the USA, the Brits, and several EU Intel Services all have knowledge of &#39;multiple sex videos&#39; involving Trump.</p>

<p>And, personally, I have no problem with that. I don&#39;t give a damn if Trump is pissing on someone or getting pissed on himself.</p>

<p>It is the rest that is troubling: The audio recordings that purport to show Trump or his people colluding with Russian officials. Profit for Trump, influence for Russia. THIS is the concerning part.</p>

<p>And you are right, the evidence is lacking but the fire is burning hot. Every media organization in the world, and governments, are looking into this. It is the prize of the century.</p>

<p>If it is all false, that would be great. If any of it is true, that is disaster for the USA.</p>

<p>This sub is supposed to investigate such things. Let&#39;s get to it, let&#39;s unleash the power of our hundreds of thousands and find out the truth.</p>

<p>If this is all false, we need to figure out who should be tried. If it is true . . . a government will fall. Either way, we will all be better off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I ask this:</p>

<p>We are hunting conspiracies, right? On this Sub?</p>

<p>I am combing through media and government sources to provide insight so that I can challenge those sources. Thus, my efforts to expose this conspiracy and to research it further, to dig deeper and hopefully find some answers. Or even just more questions.</p>

<p>If we cannot use the media, or the intelligence agencies, as a way to find what we should oppose and investigate . . . what is left?</p>

<p>Should we stand on our lawns and shout down the street to find our theories? Should we read the classified adds of our local newspaper?</p>

<p>I am using THEIR very words against them.</p>

<p>Do you have better sources?</p>

<p>If you DO, please share the damn sources. I don&#39;t want to waste my time and we could all use your sources to better call out this evil.</p>

<p>Please, tell us what to use if not the government&#39;s claims or the medias lies.</p>
