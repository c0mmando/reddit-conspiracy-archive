       <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/bbc-correspondent-ex-british-intelligence-officer-not-the-only-source-for-russias-trump-dossier/">
        BBC Radio has discovered that there are SEVERAL Trump sex tapes
       </a>
       , recorded on different dates and in several Russian cities including Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly more disturbing, there are also audio recordings that may not be sexual but, rather, are of Trump and his team colluding with Russian officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       These materials have been confirmed by American and British Intel Services, as well as the intel services of several other European nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is growing longer legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub should be investigating with every effort, not trying to pretend it does not exist. This is, if true, the biggest conspiracy and scandal in American political history.

       Yes, this is just unverified Intel at this point. However there are plenty of things between Trump and Russia that should make you think. For example, why did he lie about knowing Putin?

       Yes but they don't say anything, there is nothing in the emails, until you have something that doesn't require a made up code it's nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't said this is definitely true, I literally just said that in my last response to you. Even Trump is saying they were behind the hacks now, Russia and Trump do have suspicious connections, but somehow emails that require a code invented by the investigators is better?

       Yeah, I know what DKIM authentication is. But that doesn't verify the codes people are making out of the emails, it's totally irrelevant to our argument actually because I never questioned their authenticity.

       Check a bit better, i was a Bernie fan until you sabotaged him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you claiming the codes have been planted or the codes are some other Super Secret Talk? How do you explain Clinton and Podesta having so many pedophile friends? Do you have a pedo friend? I personaly met only one person who was charged for pedophilia when he was a kid, what are the chances of someone surrounding himself with people who have been accused or convinced of pedophilia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fyi FBI confirmed Clinton and her aids are a part of a Shadow Government, they even had a nickname for themselves "7th floor group".

       She could very well be a pedophile but pizzagate doesn't have evidence in its favor.

       And yes I know that, but again, that doesn't make pizza gatetrue or whatever you're arguing for. I don't like Clinton either, vile woman.

       How did you come to that conclusion? Your version doesnt mske sense, why would he make a picture of himself and the chlid and tag that he loves eating chicken (no pun intended)? Isnt instagram famous for snapping and tagging FOOD and not snapping a pic of your "grandkid" and tagging your dinner.

       Here's there plan:
* Take false information about Trump and spread it like it's the truth.
* Call it Pissgate (ironically similar to Pizzagate)
* Announce that
       <del>
        Pizz
       </del>
       Pissgate is false.
* So when/if Pizzagate breaks into the mainstream it can easily be dismissed and they'll point to Pissgate as an example of false information. Everyone in the mainstream will be like, "oh yeah I remember believing in pissgate and finding out it was false, I won't do that again. Pizzagate? Yeah right, probably started on 4chan (which if I'm not mistaken it was?)
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole pissgate was just an attempt to discredit 4chan, and to get the masses to dismiss any potential real conspiracies that would break into the mainstream.
