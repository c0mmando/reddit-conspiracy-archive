       I don't think anyone is trying to make a credible argument at this point. It's all about toying with the brainless and brainwashed masses who will believe anything the media tells them too. I'm afraid we're in deeper trouble than I could have imagined.

      <p>
       New account, little karma: clearly a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Account a few months old, or 1-2 years old, good amount of karma: clearly created by CTR for the elections. Clearly a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Account that's 3-9 years old, tons of karma: Of course they would buy old accounts with lots of karma. Clearly a shill.

       Agrees 100% with whatever Trump says: Clear-eyed, logical, intelligence free-thinker with zero biases whatsoever.

       I never accused you of being any of those things. I'm just saying that this is a conspiracy sub, who are you trying to reach by literally calling every conspiracy bullshit? I'm just saying. .. besides the last administration proved what happens when the media allows them to go unchecked. .. so if anything I'm all for looking into all claims. Regardless of political party. ... and most people here feel the same way. . See the research is the fun part to most people here. It's the shills on both sides that get off on discrediting every idea that doesn't fit their agenda. ...

       Firstly, good job for not calling me a shill. However, I've lost track of the # of times I've been called a shill. Every single time, how about that? Every time I say anything that isn't sucking off Trump and Putin's nob. So if you're not calling me a shill, great, but I've literally been called that in this very thread. This very thread that is talking about shills in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and elsewhere trying to sow disinformation. It gets a little boring.

       I agree that these are the words that you are saying. You may even believe it. But let's be real - look at the front page. Go to top of this week or this month, and look at what gets to the top of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti Clinton posts or Pizzagate - numerous posts about it, tons of posts like "don't let them silence you!" "spread this information to every corner!" "these sick fucks think they're getting away with it! Let's prove them wrong!" "I got so angry thinking about this that my tummy's rumbly! Those poor kids!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, Anti-Trump post gets to the top 5 of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , and people start coming in to comment - "We're being brigaded!" "Shills streaming in everywhere!" "Why are there 7000 people here? CTR bots, botting bots botsbots shills, shills shills shillshilslshisllshislhlishishlhsishshil!" "Don't let them control the narrative!"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is as partisan as
       <a href="/r/politics">

       Firstly, good job for not calling me a shill. However, I've lost track of the # of times I've been called a shill. Every single time, how about that? Every time I say anything that isn't sucking off Trump and Putin's nob. So if you're not calling me a shill, great, but I've literally been called that in this very thread. This very thread that is talking about shills in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and elsewhere trying to sow disinformation. It gets a little boring.

        so if anything I'm all for looking into all claims. Regardless of political party. ... and most people here feel the same way. . See the research is the fun part to most people here.

       I agree that these are the words that you are saying. You may even believe it. But let's be real - look at the front page. Go to top of this week or this month, and look at what gets to the top of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti Clinton posts or Pizzagate - numerous posts about it, tons of posts like "don't let them silence you!" "spread this information to every corner!" "these sick fucks think they're getting away with it! Let's prove them wrong!" "I got so angry thinking about this that my tummy's rumbly! Those poor kids!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, Anti-Trump post gets to the top 5 of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , and people start coming in to comment - "We're being brigaded!" "Shills streaming in everywhere!" "Why are there 7000 people here? CTR bots, botting bots botsbots shills, shills shills shillshilslshisllshislhlishishlhsishshil!" "Don't let them control the narrative!"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is as partisan as
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is, but in the other direction. You can tell me with a straight face that you're all nonbiased truth-seekers, but c'mon. C'mon.
