<p>I agree that these are the words that you are saying. You may even believe it. But let&#39;s be real - look at the front page. Go to top of this week or this month, and look at what gets to the top of this sub. </p>

<p>Anti Clinton posts or Pizzagate - numerous posts about it, tons of posts like &quot;don&#39;t let them silence you!&quot; &quot;spread this information to every corner!&quot; &quot;these sick fucks think they&#39;re getting away with it! Let&#39;s prove them wrong!&quot; &quot;I got so angry thinking about this that my tummy&#39;s rumbly! Those poor kids!&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, Anti-Trump post gets to the top 5 of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and people start coming in to comment - &quot;We&#39;re being brigaded!&quot; &quot;Shills streaming in everywhere!&quot; &quot;Why are there 7000 people here?
