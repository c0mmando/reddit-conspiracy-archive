       We need to stop being an offshoot of the_donald. There is a clear bias in this sub that is supposed to be a bastion of critical thinking, skepticism, and doubting the narrative. I know Kek's own president, the man in the meme, shares a few of our collective beliefs but he is a plutocrat not to be trusted unless he earns that trust. I get the excitement of seeing someone vanquish the wicked witch of the west and I understand that we in this dark world where we look for whatever light we can find but you cannot truly believe in your heart of hearts that the light we seek is Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I say this but it doesn't mean we can't work with the centipedes, they have some great investigators, but we aren't them. We need to look upon Donald with the same ultra critical lens that we use for a Clinton or a Bush because if we don't we disparage the work of all that doubt the narrative and attempt to bring the truth to light. Taking a side isn't seeking truth it is pushing a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not a political sub, we are not republicans or democrats. We are a sub against all of these rats whether they wear blue or red and we need to remember that as both sides fight for control of the narrative.

       It's worth criticism, but also worth consideration. The fact that they are associated with Goldman Sachs is not enough to assume they are evil, for me. The odds are indeed higher, but I can use the same level of speculation to say that the bank has multiple factions, and Trump is working with white-hat Goldman Sachs insiders to help take them down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not researched these individuals, so it's likely they are typical banker scum. However, until I hear about something
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       have done I won't subscribe to guilt by association.

       What do you drink or smoke or take every day to believe this? I just don't understand it. What in Trump's past or present convinces you? I know I ask this of everyone, but I keep getting shunted off - no one can answer it and I just want to understand.

       The alignment isn't left or right anymore, it's above or below the high income line.  Political parties and philosophies are just lip service.  Almost none of them really believe what they promise.

       If he would have added one union leader or small business owner I would have less doubt about his intent.  But he said “I want people that made a fortune!”.  Who in that cabinet is going to represent the middle class?

       Short of some questionable cabinet picks I don't think he needs to be attacked just yet but I believe we need to keep a close eye on him. The fact that the propaganda engine is redlining working against him is a good sign but I believe that a man in that position needs to earn trust through his actions, not just words.

       Agreed.  I do not like him much, but my gut tells me to give him some time to shake things up.  I hope for the country's sake he does well.  I wonder if Ron Reagan had a bumpy start going from actor to president.  Anyone old enough to remember and can comment?

       We are increasingly pro-trump because people ask us to look ourselves in the mirror and check our own biases? I have to respectfully disagree that requesting non-partisanship is what creates partisanship. I think there is pro-trump sentiment because we want so bad for there to be a hero in this story and this guy is spitting the establishment's face.

       I think this is very important. I'm a Trump supporter, but I'm not so wrapped up in him that I think he is perfect. If Trump does something shady, he deserves to be scrutinized. I really do think he is of much higher moral and ethical character than many powerful and elite people, but he still deserves a level of scrutiny to prove it to doubters.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would behoove all Trump supporters to take Trump accusations seriously and to engage with those who have theories. No need for name calling etc. Simply debunking the accusations is the most effective way to uphold his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a True Trump supporter, you don't want to do what 'never Trumpers' do and fight legitimate allegation with name calling and childish remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I will probably get downvoted or hated on for this comment, but we need to hold all notable people accountable for their actions. Trump's good name will stay clean and more people will support him if us Trump supporters engage the accusers respectfully and debunk the theories or accusations against him.

       Thanks for taking the time to address it. It's great to be a Trump supporter, but Trump's success in the election was due to our (US citizens) blind faith in gov officials for the past 30 years. We started letting them get away with stuff that we should not have let them get away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want Trump to succeed, but we don't want to follow him blindly like sheep. We want to be vocal with him when we think he is not representing the average citizens of this country. By doing this his success as president, our future and our well being is much better off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really feel that this sub should be a-political in the sense that we question everyone and everything. We don't just turn a blind eye bc we like them.

       im not rly a trump supporter but i sure do feel good hillary lost, and i have to admit a majority of the stuff trump is doing is good. the partisan aspect of it is turning me off, since i have a lot of leftist friends and family that i wish would wake up but overall right now i think the conspiracy crowd isnt scrutinizing trump as much because he isnt really a career politician and seems to really be on our side. lets see what happens in office. there are already a few things that look worrying, but nobody is perfect.

       He did us all a great service taking down the Bush and Clinton canals.  I'll always acknowledge and respect that.

       But it smells an awful lot like a new cabal put him in.  Foreign or domestic, either way, first thing I want to know about any politician is who owns them.

       This is the trivial shit that bothers me about this: I've been waiting almost 25 years for the Clintons to get their comeuppance, and I couldn't even fucking enjoy it because they got pushed out by something worse. Worse than the Clinton cabal! A year ago, I couldn't even envision that would be possible. It's like, "Here's your champagne." "Yay!" "Wait, hold on, let me shit in it. Wait a sec, that's not right, let me swirl it up for ya. Here you go, enjoy." "Uggggggh."

       You know I don't doubt scripts are used to some degree, but I don't think that is always the case on the pro-trump stuff. There are just a lot of very active users on t_d, and when there is crossover to here (because let's face it, almost everything to do with trump is conspiracy related no matter what side of the ball you are on) the swarm of centipedes comes over and does what it does. And, that voting pattern was trained in through the election season, because posts there were so heavily brigaded the only way to fight it was massive participation. Users became accustomed to voting on every little thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree I can't wait for it to get mostly back to normal. It already kind of is heading that way. But there is going to be no getting rid of the pro-trump folks altogether. But look at it this way, when trump inevitably starts doing things of the kind that warrant attention from here, and the election fervor has died down, you will have an audience of avid users to speak to.

       I think this underestimates the ability that some pro-Trump supporters might have to critical analyze their candidate while still being generally supportive of him.

       Everybody has got a political position, the key in this sub is to not let that run you, to keep an open mind, and to have greater allegiance to Truth than to a candidate.

       doesn't allow critical thinking on Donald Trump himself. Sure some get away with criticising proxy info but anything else gets banned, users get banned. People there think it is a free thinking sub, but the sub is propoganda. You visit and if you don't go in thinking critically then you just fall into the group think which is memes and little substance all the way down.

       I was just thinking this same thing the past few days. This sub is a home for critical thought, not political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must always be critical of all politicians regardless of party lines. If we let our political biases cloud our vision, we could miss a real conspiracy, even if it is right before our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am super glad Hillary did not win. We all know what terrible bullet the world just dodged there. But we need to stay on our toes and stay focused.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest issues with our culture and society today is that we have a tendency for knee jerk reactions when we (not this sub, but Americans as a whole) hear criticism of politicians that align with us politically. You mildly criticize a party or politician and everyone jumps on you, comes back with 'but the other side did this...'. We need the ability to criticize our own party and politicians too. If we cannot hold people accountable, regardless of party lines, we will end up continuing down the bad path we have found ourselves on. It's a shame and it hurts our politician system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any group can concur this issue, it's us. We got this. :)

       As a non-US reader of this sub, ( I don't even bother with the rest of reddit anymore) the American's obsession with their own political theatre is getting pointless. 
Trump is no messiah and even if he was the Deep State only allows their manufactured and groomed messiahs to steer the US corporate empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       They attempted this retarded piss thing because they don't have an insurance file of Trump jerking off in a coffin or fucking a child to hang over him if he steps out of lockstep with the globalist agenda.
They resent that mightily.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must remember what might make Trump dangerous for the nation is not the same as what makes Trump dangerous to the elite un-elected rulers of the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picking sides in a rigged game is futile.
Whether Trump exists or not the Deep State rulers of the American Empire rarely change and they must be held to account for all of the suffering they cause.

       Fuck trump and the witch woman.  This sub is and will be a ghost train of ups and downs. Featuring horrible people. The people here care about truth and seeing the lighthouse through the fog. We debate we argue we call each other cunts.  But we have a goal and it's says truth in huge spray painted letters behind the posts. We don't know each other we don't hate each other,  we are who we are  could be our dad's fault outr mothers. a aunt who cares why we feel this way. But we just care.

        There is a clear bias in this sub that is supposed to be a bastion of critical thinking, skepticism, and doubting the narrative

      <p>
       Skepticism and doubting the narrative in and of themselves are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       necessarily critical thinking.  Real critical thinking involves going toward whatever the truth is - and sometimes the narrative
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       true.  Skepticism for skepticism's sake is just as ignorant as being a blind, unthinking believer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never doubt just to doubt - as many so called "skeptics" think it cool to do for whatever reason.  Go toward the truth regardless of the source.  That means that although it's true that TPTB have been generally shown to work
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the people, if they say something that just so happens to be true and valid, don't reject it just because it's coming from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be a critical thinker.  Reject what is incorrect regardless of what the source is and accept what is valid regardless of what the source is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go toward truth.  Discard the rest.

       I'm paraphrasing a point made by Howard Zinn here but...
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all biased. What we choose to say reflects bias. What we choose to omit reflects bias. How we choose to say it reflects bias. To be true with ourselves we must acknowledge our biases just as we acknowledge the biases of others. To live without bias is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I agree with Mr. Zinn that it is impossible to truly live up to I disagree with the notion that seeking it is futile.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to strive to be as close to unbiased as possible. Call it fighting our nature but it should be done particularly by folks like us that seek the truth amid the lies.

      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't see it. I see a fair amount of people who support him who say "let's wait to see what happens" when users say he's full of shit.
      </p>

       What I have not seen is a single postage by someone trying to rally support for Trump. That is what T_D is, and this place isn't close to that.

       I respect what you are saying but I disagree. Countless threads aren't even conspiracy related but simply pro-Trump. "Trump shuts down CNN" is an example. Is it satisfying to see a propaganda network get cock blocked, of course it is! Is it a conspiracy? No, it's just Trump going HAM.

       Then the people looking to criticize trump will say something like "come on, you know he's one of them! We have to hold him accountable!" People respond with "but he's not even in office yet?"

       The issue is that those whose worldview is red and blue refuse to see points of the other side as valid. It would be great to see people join hands but so long as they are party affiliated they will only see their side as being capable of fixing the issues that ail is.

       The problem is that there are two plausible scenarios playing out:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Trump is a liar and a con man.  A billionaire playing as a populist with no intention of anything except rewarding the rich.  The opposition to him is just more kabuki theatre.  The powers the be are as entrenched as they ever were. Trump is there to further enact the overall agenda of control, tyranny, and potentially internal conflict in the US.  Order out of chaos by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Trump legitimately terrifies the powers that be because he actually got elected outside of their system of money, power, and personal connection.  He is not a pawn.  He is actually a chaotic force outside their control.  The deep state in the US, which represents money, military production and strategy, intelligence, and state craft are all trying to vomit him out using the media to do so at any cost.  Trump's election represents a legitimate overthrow of the established order and the reaction we see is an attempt to subvert or mitigate his mandate.  Why?  Because they are afraid he might not go along with their program, for good or ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have enough evidence to say which is true, but I don't think that arguing for one or the other necessarily makes anyone a shill.  A skeptical, thinking person could reasonably land on either.
