       I want to start off by saying that I considered It's Always Sunny to be my favorite show for years and do continue to watch it. The difference now is my mindset towards it and (finally) noticing the underlying creepiness throughout. It's definitely difficult to determine whether a comedy takes any controversial subject past the point of humor- and I feel that this show overall has. There's obvious episodes that bring up CSA even in the titles, such as "Charlie Got Molested", "Dennis Looks Like A Registered Sex Offender", &amp; "Frank Reynolds' Little Beauties". In Frank's episode, he sings a song about how he doesn't 'diddle' kids, similar to basically the entire 'soundtrack' during the episode "The Nightman Cometh". I would recommend watching that episode for yourself to see first-hand how much pedophilia is joked about and made light of. Frank's character (Danny Devito) even sings, "you have to pay the toll to get into the boy's hole" repeatedly. Overall, that episode is about a play they wrote involving a love story (very obviously) about a young boy and grown woman. Just because Dennis (a grown man) plays the part of the young boy doesn't make the idea of it any less disturbing. (Watch that episode and realize the reality of it- if a young boy would've actually been cast. It loses any of its 'humor' then.) When it comes to more recent seasons, I'll discuss the 2 newest episodes I've watched (Episodes 1 &amp; 2 of Season 12). Dennis' character throughout the show is known for being very sexually promiscuous. Fine, normal, and humorous when it relates to women his age, but not when they constantly refer to girls under 18. In episode 1 of season 12, Dennis comes onto a girl who the gang says 'looks only 12'; she turns out to be legal but where is the humor in any of it? It was yet again another unnecessary comment about children in a perverted way. It's Always Sunny has all of the ability and talent to be a hilarious show MINUS all of the pedophile undertones, so WHY are they even added to episodes? In season 12, episode 2 (the current newest) Dennis befriends another young girl and spends the day with only her. He goes from flirting with a woman his age to ditching her, intrigued by this young girl's personality. Dennis, a normally apathetic and indifferent character, suddenly seems to 'care for' this stranger. Another episode I'd recommend watching to truly see the underlying creepiness for yourself. Overall, I know It's Always Sunny would be more enjoyable to watch from a blissfully ignorant point of view. It feels that most viewers see these 'jokes' as somehow funny, as I actually used to. Now I'm able to see the deeper reality that TV shows like It's Always Sunny in Pedophilia are creating a world where child sexual abuse is laughed at, joked about, and made light of.

       I haven't watched the new episodes but I have seen all the other ones. Could be predictive programming. TV and movies do it all the time. Could be trying to normalize pedophilia. Have it appear to the masses in film or television so they become soft to it then it just becomes normal.

       That's the conspiracy part of me. The other is that they are doing a comedy show and there is nothing wrong with what they are doing. They are just pushing the envelope and trying to be funny. It's a hilarious show though, one of my favorites.

       It's probably my favorite comedy show, there's very little jokes, throughout the show, that didn't land for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the pedo undertone: it's always been there. As is the racial undertone, the politically correct undertone, etc... It's kinda the point of the show, to critique -darker- aspects of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the latest episode, it (pedo, pizzagte etc) did cross my mind when Dennis was having his moments with the young girl, but I honestly don't think there's anything there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, it's Hollywood, and it would strike me as odd the creators (Mac and dennis I think? By their real names offc) weren't aware of the outcries of pedophelia surrounding Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'dd probably share your view of being more sceptical, if it wasn't just so goddamn funny. The creepyness you're describing, especially around Dennis throughout the show, is specifically what makes him such a great character.

       Yes you can, it's called comedy. South Park did it. Family Guy did it. Plenty of standup comedians did it (Louis CK comes to mind immediatly). And Always Sunny did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has nothing to do with morals. This has to do with the nature of comedy, and how it is used to both critique aswell as coop with society.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is being unravelled with pizzgate is disturbing to say the least. Child exploitation (sexual or non sexual) is disturbing to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comedy takes the edge off, even if it's a sensitive subject. Who are you to determine which subjects are off-limits and which ones aren't?
      </p>
      <p>
       To a black slave from the 1700's, the claim that racism is nowhere near as bad as CSA seems utterly cold, heartless and devoid of morals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being: either you believe you can make jokes about everything, or you believe you can make jokes about nothing. The middle-ground is reserved for social justice warriors.

       Are there any slaves from the 1700s still around today, in 2017? Now compare that to the countless victims of CSA (myself included) who dont find pedophilia funny but instead triggering and disgusting. We have to live in a society that accepts it being made light of by people like YOU. That's where the line is drawn. Children being raped is never humorous. All of these comedies would be funnier if they just simply excluded their pedophile 'jokes' which are unnecessary to begin with.

       Well, I'm sorry for everything you've been through, but I feel like you're attacking me for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never made fun of pedophelia, or atleast not in my posts as I recall. I merely made comments about other people (comedians, show producers) making jokes about pedophelia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't know why you're defending the horror of pedophelia, I agree with you. For some reason, you're trying to argue me into believing pedophelia is a bad thing, which I'm already well aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't be asked getting strawmanned so I'll leave it at that. Sorry for everything you've been true, but noone here is making fun of you (or sexual abuse) for that matter.

       Molesting kids isn't just another 'inappropriate behavior' like cursing or crude humor, which comedies usually go for. Pedophilia is the most disgusting thing in the world with so many victims (I was a victim of CSA myself). Taboos are things like BDSM, tattoos, piercings, etc. Not hurting kids.

       Actually, incest and pedophilia are considered taboos, anthropologically speaking. It is predominantly considered wrong in all cultures around the world. It's an ingrained taboo within humanity.

       I've watched that show more times than I can count so I don't need to be convinced of its humor but the issue is, it would be funnier if they just excluded the gross, triggering 'jokes' about pedophilia. I'm a victim of CSA and this show has become wayyyy too triggering for me to watch which is sad considering it was my favorite for years.

       Funny, I just watched "The Nightman Cometh" a few nights ago and had to take a step back in light of all the pizza gate conspiracy going on it feels almost wrong. Unfortunately the show might make the topic seem more comical so, as the viewer, after some time don't find CSA as bad or maybe not as serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as you as a person are aware I don't think it has to ruin the show, I mean there are many more hidden meanings in shows we love but fuck it, I'll enjoy it at face value till the last of my shitty time on this corrupt earth.

       Honestly wasn't looking to offend. Sorry to hear that. I'm not making excuses for the show, it's just a lot of shows shine light on dark subjects so if you can't look pass it them just don't support it by not watching.

       Agreed! It'd just be cooler for shows to just not include jokes about child rape than for victims to have to basically shut themselves off from TV if they don't want to be triggered.

       We're not though. You're asking/saying if there is a link between Always Sunny and pedophelia.  Most of the replies seem to agree that, YES, pedophelia has been part of Always Sunny since the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so does South Park, family guy, Louis CK, Bob Sagget, Robbin Williams, ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember so many TV-Shows and stand-up acts hitting on the subject. Are they ALL trying to normalize pedophelia? Because I still believe it's pretty fucking bad, mkay, so it's clearly not working on me.

       And almost all, if not ALL, of TV is used to brainwash citizens into whatever mindset the elite wants. By joking continuously about CSA, it has obviously worked on all of you idiots who are supporting 'humor' about child rape.

       Molesting children isn't some kind of societal 'taboo', it's called Pedophilia and it's a serious fucking issue involving countless victims. Things that are 'taboo' would be BDSM, tattoos, piercings, etc.

       Well I wouldn't have known that season 12 started already if it weren't for this post so I just went and watched those two episodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, yes, It's Always Sunny HAS always had a pedo subtext with Dennis which is increasingly less subtextual and more overt. Same as with Mac's homosexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say the entire show is subversive... I understand the point you're making about normalizing child sexual abuse. But fwiw the other characters never show any acceptance of it as well as Dennis himself emphatically denies it. Is it black humor? Undoubtedly. Is it intended to normalize pedophilia? I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that there is also plenty of subtext regarding Dennis being a rapist. Do you think the writers/creators/actors (the main cast) wants to normalize rape? This goes back to that old argument about whether rape jokes are appropriate. Where do you draw the line of comedy?
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless of where you draw the line, the assertion that they are specifically out to normalize child abuse on the basis that they joke about it is only logically consistent if you also claim they want to normalize rape, racism, ageism, theft, physical violence, emotional violence, etc. - that is, all the other negative things they "make light" of.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Remember, the point of It's Always Sunny is that they're actually all terrible people. You're supposed to laugh at them, and then ask whether or not that's appropriate to laugh at. And Dennis, specifically, is a psychopath.

       If he's a psychopath, then how did he have any feelings towards the young girl in season 12 episode 2? Other non PC shit can be funny, yes, but pedophilia draws the line of where humor ends and it becomes something disgusting and unnecessary.

       I would have to watch the whole show again with the knowledge I have now to make a good assessment, but I always took the pedo-jokes to be like, an implied explanation for why they are all such dysfunctional weirdos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, Charlie is obviously fucked up because of the molestation he constantly alludes to. And Dennis's interaction with young women kind of comes about as he evolves into more and more of a psychopath who is out of touch with normal human morals.
      </p>

       That's just my take on it though.

       The show is suppose to be outrageous. The entire premise is around a group of complete lunatic pieces of shit, that all exhibit narcissistic and sociopathic behavior.
      </p>

       Pedophilia is nothing to take lightly, but the entire nature of the show is that it is politically incorrect, and there is nothing they won't joke about.

       The show is filled with rape-y undertones, jokes about murder, incest, racism and sexism. But it doesn't mean they are promoting any of that.

       Ok, so let's do a thought experiment. Imagine there was a prime-time TV show focused around the Christian church and their members doing Christian things, like doing prayer, talking about God, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an issue with this because you're an atheist, and feel like the show was pushing a Christian agenda. But your friends are all like " yeah they talk about god and church and stuff, but that doesn't mean they're promoting it"
      </p>
      <p>
       So... Yeah.

       The difference is that sunny is a satire. Everything they do is tongue in cheek. If said Christian TV show was also done as a parody and it was funny I would watch it.

       I'm not saying it isn't satire, I'm saying that  systematically repeating pedophilia themes is a form of promotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are saying it isn't intentionally done to promote a pedo view. Well that is just you and me guessing what the writers really meant with all the pedo jokes. But I can tell you what the result is. A lot of people joking about kids getting sexually abused.

       I would agree if it were to a point where the subject was coming up in every episode. The amount of times pedo topics or jokes have been made in the show is very small in comparison to the entire series, and the amount of times it has come up is congruent with the theme of the show, and doesn't seem unusual that they would cover such topics.

       I don't know enough about the show to make a judgement on the frequency or duration of pedo themes, so I trust your judgement that you're correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I would like to point out that fitting the theme isn't a good defence. If you ever opened an old copy of Hustler, you might remember the "Chester the molester" cartoons in each magazine. Was the content in theme with the cartoon character? You bet. It was actually used as evidence against him when he went to court for molesting his daughter. That cartoon was also considered tongue in cheek.

       Youtube decided to list these in recommended today, I don't know why but since it's so closely related to the OP:

       Videos describe theories about Charlie and Dennis. Most of the stuff listed in this thread is mentioned. (How the show touches these sensitive subjects)
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe there's very little foul play from the creators. Taboo subjects have been part of Always Sunny since the start, there's numerous other shows with a similar approach. At no point during a single episode have I had the feeling they're approving (or even condoning) child abuse, nor murder, racism or anything else concidered controversial.

       We're not though. You're asking/saying if there is a link between Always Sunny and pedophelia.  Most of the replies seem to agree that, YES, pedophelia has been part of Always Sunny since the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so does South Park, family guy, Louis CK, Bob Sagget, Robbin Williams, ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember so many TV-Shows and stand-up acts hitting on the subject. Are they ALL trying to normalize pedophelia? Because I still believe it's pretty fucking bad, mkay, so it's clearly not working on me.

       And almost all, if not ALL, of TV is used to brainwash citizens into whatever mindset the elite wants. By joking continuously about CSA, it has obviously worked on all of you idiots who are supporting 'humor' about child rape.
