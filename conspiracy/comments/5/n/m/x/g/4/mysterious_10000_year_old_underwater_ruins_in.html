       Yep im currently reading it. I was reading it the other day while under the infleunce of an edible and listening to some fantasy/adventure background music and man if that didnt leave and imprint in my mind. I was peaking around the same time the music was and I had just gotten to the first section of images and I started visualizing the catastrophic events unfold. I felt such a strong connection to what the book was saying. It read like a fictional story yet it is the story of our past. Amazing book this is.

       The commonly accepted theory, even among many conspiracy, or fringe theorists, is something akin to this: that it was an entirely natural disaster from the stars that caused the destruction of Atlantis and that it had nothing to do with Atlantis itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is almost certainly part of the narrative that the elite have managed to weave into the world of fringe history/conspiracy theory and almost certainly have done things like threaten, influence, force, or coerce scientists to fake chronological dating of any such crater sites and to come up with the story that such a thing happened at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that they would be able to do this, and they have done it in literally every other part of science and history so they essentially certainly did for this as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they do this? Because the elite of today are aware of Atlantis and the elite of Atlantis that today's elite stem from almost certainly caused the destruction of Atlantis themselves, and the elite of today are certainly aware of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to delegitimize Atlantis's destruction to those who are onto this and cover their tracks than to do everything they can to convince people that it was simply a natural disaster that destroyed Atlantis and caused the flood?
      </p>
      <p>
       This way they can effectively distance themselves from Atlantis and hide their true history even from those who have realized Atlantis was real and that humanity was far more advanced in the past then now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can hide their true history from those who are looking in the right place then a crucial piece of knowledge is missing that is needed in order to truly defeat them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity needs to be able to connect the elite of today with Atlantis to truly understand why humanity, and the world, is the way it is today. They need this connection to understand why everything is so negative around the globe and how it became that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only by knowing why and how the world is so negative today can we as a planet overcome this negativity and return to the pure positivity that was the norm in Atlantis up until the elite gained power and destroyed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that all starts with us, those who are looking in the right place, not believing the narrative of this world's "natural" history and by being skeptical not only of the governments and economic system of the elite's system, but also the science and history as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have used "science" and "history" to keep humanity in the circumstance and state it is currently in, and has made humanity believe their lies and simultaneously believe things like Atlantis, aliens, faster than light travel, no disease, and unity as humanity are impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "science" and "history" of reality have been fabricated and almost everyone on the planet believe these things are true, including the vast majority of this sub, especially the scientific history of the world and the history of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it is essentially certainly not the case that a comet destroyed the civilization and its colonies that existed around 10,000 bc. That would be a lie that has been fed into our camp to stop us from connecting all of the dots and finally defeating them, the elite who oppress us all.

       Well I understand this. But in order for regular people to start getting into the ideas of Atlantis and what TRULY cause the fall, which I am not sure of except for the ideas circulating that it was the greed and disconnection from source and also the intervention of other entities in Atlantis that caused its fall, also the natural rising and falling of humanities consciousness correlating with the precession of the equinox considering Atlantis fell right around that time when we were on the "falling asleep" phase you could say.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to give them the scientific facts first. A comet DID impact 12,800 years ago and again 11,600 years ago. Which in turn wiped out the civilization that existed at that time. You can't deny a massive flood happened when the marks are there all around the world. Also, the evidence isn't based off of craters because most fragments impacted over the north american ice sheet, the evidence is based off of the geological effects an event of that magnitude has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways do you mind pointing me to the "truth" of Atlantis because I'm certainly interested as you can see, and I mean that in the least dickheadish way possible. I put truth in quotations because it's so hard to believe anything nowadays unless I can experience it or see it (spiritually or physically). Its one thing to just say the elites are doing this and its another thing to provide the evidence behind it, I don't doubt that the elites are hiding this information but don't forget that much of the evidence that is coming up now is very recent. The scientific establishment didn't deny this because their superiors told them to, they denied it because we didn't have physical evidence based in science to support what we were saying but now we do and the paradigm is shifting as it should. We are now on the "awakening curve" of the precession of the equinox and the elites know this as well which is why their efforts to maintain control are becoming so obvious to a lot more people now (anecdotally speaking).
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything a lot of the scientists who are working on uncovering a lot of this recently emerging evidence support the idea that Atlantis existed. Maybe the academics simply acted as gatekeepers without knowing they were doing so because their view of reality was already set in stone and not because the elite told them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't deny an impact happened at these two intervals though, thats taking two steps back when we could be taking 10 steps forward and linking both of the ideas together with the proper evidence.

      <p>
       My reply was too long for 1 post so I'm going to post 2 replies, please reply to the second one,
       <em>
        not this one.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So first off, I read your entire comment and I'm so great full that you're approaching this in an interested and civil way. Absolute kudos to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's what we know. There are craters all along the north American plate. There are also craters in brazil and elsewhere of a similar size and nature. Of course comets have hit the earth and caused craters. That would be silly the think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'd like you to read all of my posts about Atlantis. So much of the truth of Atlantis can be discovered simply by making connections between different things and using logic. I've done just those things, and in conjunction to show you what it would have been like.
      </p>
      <p>
       You absolutely have a point that not every scientist would have been told by their superiors etc. And you are on to something that they had their view of reality set in stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite have influence that goes far beyond threats and coercion. Their very system is based around negativity and this negativity has conditioned humanity in so many different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of these ways is not being able to make connections between seemingly unrelated things, and not being able to use actual logic. Scientists are no exception to this negative conditioning, and I don't want to sound rude by any means, but you're being far too generous to the scientists of the world and their methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike have long since held the subject of Atlantis not only at more than an arm's length, but also with great contempt and scorn. So many laugh and have laughed at those who are actually serious about Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have openly shunned those who
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       brought forward evidence and those who are able to make connections and use logic like how I did in my posts. Everything points to Atlantis being incredibly real and incredibly advanced, but essentially every single scientist in the mainstream scientific community is conditoned like most of humanity and they are not able to make connections and use logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, saying that the variety of different ancient civilizations around the world that built pyramids, had advanced knowledge of astronomy, and had incredible architectural skills all somehow developed these things on their own independent of each other is absolutely ridiculous if you even apply a small amount of logic to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the scientific, archeaological, and historical communities are all guilty of this and anyone who poses that that isn't the case is both
       <em>
        openly
       </em>
       and privately shunned, not just secretly shunned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now clearly there is indeed a lack of evidence of Atlantis but there absolutely is evidence. The Bimini Road,
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        ruins off the Andros islands
       </a>
       , the city the OP is talking about, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet the scientific, archaeological, and historical communities still shun this evidence and do not connect it to everything else. They are negatively skeptical and needlessly so, and they still, to this day, actively shun anyone who poses that this evidence is evidence of Atlantis, like Dr. Greg Little, who is the man who discovered those ruins off the coast of the Andros islands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you go around trying to find every single piece of evidence that the elite and scientists are falsifying scientific information then you'll go on a wild goose chase because they are much more adept at hiding these things than you or any normal person are at finding them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have all the power and authority in the world and they restrict access to their information. To believe for one second that the elite would allow mainstream scientists to release everything about their findings without consequences, or more likely their real findings would be completely foolhardy.
      </p>
      <p>
       To pretend that the mainstream scientific community isn't controlled and conditioned by the elite and the negativity of their system is insanity that gets us nowhere. But they still have a duty as supposed "truth keepers" to show us their real findings. As you can see, however, this is a catch 22 because they can't do so without repurcussions so no progress is ever made.
      </p>
      <p>
       But many scientists are bought into their privilege as being holders of the "truth" and so don't ever even feel the need or desire to help humanity understand what they have "found" to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyways, moving on to the comets and the geological evidence. I explain in those posts of mine about Atlantis that something would have likely happened to first fracture Atlantean civilization to have allowed the elite to rise to power. It would have to have either been a mistake or something unavoidable, like a natural disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comet you speak of 12,900-12,800 years ago does not have an actual crater, and it is only believed that a comet or meteor fell because of the sediment of a mexican lake and a few other places in north america and nanodiamonds that are supposedly in that sediment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientists who have claimed this say they have the evidence and have published their "findings" but they won't ever allow people to actually examine this evidence in a completely open manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have to actually present evidence as obviously and open as possible while letting everyone see it, if they truly are trying to help humanity. Saying that you've found evidence is not enough. Even doing things like posting pictures of what a nanodiamond looks like isn't enough. And Graham Hancock, a total fringe author, says that fragments of this comet were 2 kilometers wide, if that is so then it should be completely obvious and scientists should do everything possible to show humanity how that is so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing applies for the comet that supposedly hit earth in 11,600 bc as well. The only references to this are from Graham hancock. All of this "evidence" should be completely obvious and totally out in the open for everyone to see in as obvious a manner as possible, which always includes in person viewing and examination when it comes to these "scientific" findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conjecture is not enough and the vast majority of science is conjecture and convincing humanity to believe this conjecture because "most people aren't qualified to see the evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the job of the person or people who know the truth to show and explain as obviously as possible why the truth is the truth, and the vast of scientists do not do that. Many play man in the high castle and expect the rest of humanity to simply believe their conjecture because "they've seen the evidence". The rest do the same thing but at the bidding of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they dont do everything they possibly can to show and explain why their conjecture is actually truth, then their conjecture needs to be shown for what it is:
       <strong>
        conjecture
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot, and
       <strong>
        <em>
         should not
        </em>
       </strong>
       be accepted as truth. They do not do everything they can to help you understand why what they are claiming is "true" and simply expect you to believe them based on authority, and many do so at the bidding of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is both conscious and subconscious that they do this, but both ways are inexcusable and should never be excused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I write incredibly long connected and logical posts because I want to show and explain as much as possible why this is the truth, and I am doing so. When you are able to make connections between seemingly unrelated things and use logic to understand those connections, you naturally do as much as possible to show and explain why the truth is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at my post history, I essentially never write anything short and I show and explain everything as much as possible. Now of course I don't know the whole truth about Atlantis, no one except the e.t.s who are constantly showing themselves to us does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know all of the cities and buildings that were in Atlantis, I don't know their language, I don't know many of their customs, I don't know much of their technology, I don't know exactly how they dressed, I don't know so many things about Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do know some things about Atlantis, and being able to make connections and use logic allows you to actually know things since connections and logic are objective and are not subjective. Combine evidence with that and it only cements the truth you already know for other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is objective and is not based on conjecture or falsified information, which is what mainstream science is. Mainstream science cannot and does not tell you or anyone, the truth.

      <p>
       Now regarding even the possibility of a comet or meteor hitting, such a civilization that was as advanced as Atlantis that was also in constant contact and communication with advanced aliens would have known without a doubt that a comet/asteroid or multiple was coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the help of the aliens, who are capable of things we deem impossible, they would surely have been able to stop a comet/meteor or multiple from hitting the earth, and they would have had every reason to because they were living in a utopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the natural disaster came from the earth itself, they would have had a much harder time stopping such a thing. 
Now there are different things that could have come from the earth that could have happened. One could have been a small series of massive earthquakes since Atlantis would have been on the crossing of numerous different fault lines, and that is if the location of the fault lines is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earthquakes would have had to been big enough to cause a good amount of devastation, enough of it to allow the elite to rise to power based on the promise of making things better. And it would have had to have been enough to reduce their capacity as a civilization since the elite would have had to have time to implement their system of inequality and competition and thus sew the seeds for today's system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might not have been natural, but we can't know for certain yet, although there is a good chance it was natural. All we can be certain of is that it wouldn't have come from space.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that means there would have had to have been 2 different catastrophes, 1 that was unavoidable but not completely destructive, and 1 that finally destroyed Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now again, we can't know for certain yet what exactly was the cause of the first cataclysm but the 2nd one is easier to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis would have certainly had nearly infinite free energy because of how advanced they were. A continental plus civilization of that magnitude couldn't have had a single power generation area due to sheer distance and inefficiency of transfer of the energy. Since they were such a large civilization that means they would have had many areas designated for the generation of this power, like power plants. .
      </p>
      <p>
       These power plants or centers of power generation would have most likely spread out throughout Atlantis and around it to supply as many areas of civilization as possible. It wouldn't have made sense to have them near its colonies however, because they were isolated patches of civilization  that were most likely not as vital as the mainland of Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with the kind of power needed to run this advanced of a civilization, it had to have run on technology, at least as a mechanism for storing and transferring it. Since Atlantis was so big and so advanced, that means that the power stations would have had to have been part of a connected power grid that allowed the quickest and most efficient transferance of energy possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this grid would have been interconnected, the possibility of a chain reaction catastrophe was very real. Any chain reaction with so many incredibly powerful power plants/stations would have caused a cataclysm that even eclipsed the first one that allowed the elite to rise to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of chain reaction would most likely be nuclear level due to the amounts of energy being stored and transferred between these power plants/stations and anything that powerful and that numerous would be enough to cause gigantic earthquakes inside and around Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we know, earthquakes cause tsunamis and the sheer magnitude of this chain reaction would have been enough to essentially sink Atlantis, again both due to the amount of power being stored and transfered in and between each of these power stations, and due to how many there would have been and their spread around the continent.
      </p>
      <p>
       We simply cannot imagine the amount of destruction such an event would have caused but it's almost assuredly what would have happened because whatever happened the first time wasn't enough to completely destroy Atlantis and sink the entire continent. So if it was natural, this one certainly wouldn't have been natural because we know it couldn't be from space and the earth itself wasn't able to sink Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       That then gets into why and how this happened. There could be many reasons why and ways this happened. One thing is for certain and that is that the elite were involved because such a thing hadn't ever happened before when the elite were not around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their involvement means that the cataclysm had something to do with them. That connection is enough to damn them and allows us as humanity to realize that they are part of the reason why Atlantis was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we realize as a planet that the elite were part of the reason for the end of utopia on earth, that is truly when the planet will be able to throw off the shackles that the elite have placed around it and once and for all embrace positivity again as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see, the elite are part of why Atlantis was destroyed and Atlantis is the key to destroying their system they have created in replacement of Atlantis.

       No, since all books written on the subject are written by those who either don't make all of the connections and use logic and have not made any actual rediscoveries, or do the same thing and have only rediscovered a tiny part of Atlantis
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm saying don't read any books because even if the book is by a person who has rediscovered a tiny part of Atlantis it's still going to be filled with obvious information, including a few of the things I say in my posts (
       <em>
        no point in reading the same thing twice by someone who doesn't see the big picture
       </em>
       ), and will be filled with further falsehoods and the books absolutely will not use actual connection making and logic. Now of course you should reaearch, but the internet is far better for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leads me to the main reason why you shouldnt read a book, and that is because you shouldn't spend money on a book that only contains a small amount of information on the rediscovered part of Atlantis, since that's the only valuable part of the entire book.
      </p>
      <p>
       A much better use of your money would be to get involved with those making expeditions to rediscover Atlantis like
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        Dr. Greg Little
       </a>
       and to help fund these people or if you have a lot of money, start an expedition yourself with people from here near you or others who you have shown my posts to and who question the narrative and system of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       And an excellent use of your time would be to study my posts so you can understand the connections made and the logic used, and that enable you to truly understand the topic. Further excellent use of your time would then involve creating threads on Atlantis
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       in this sub and again, to research on the internet for hidden rediscoveries mainly since I have already covered the main and most important aspects of what Atlantis would have been like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then of course once more rediscoveries inevitably happen, the best use of your time would be to disseminate those rediscoveries everywhere you can to as many people as you can because that is what will be the catalyst for true global change.

       Alright so I just finished reading your reply and so far Magicians of the Gods has not stated anything about the rising and falling of humanities consciousness correlating with the precession of the equinox. That's something I discovered before hand. Also it isn't necessarily full of non-sense when you can literally go out into these areas of the world and see it for your self, that's the beauty of science - true science that is - as long as the evidence is physical and unchangeable by mere human manipulation (besides in the event of a global nuclear war) it is there to be discussed and built upon. I also subscribe to the idea that the universe is dualistic in nature, however the rising and falling of humanities consciousness does not necessarily mean the flipping between negative and positive. All it means is that the cycle of the the heavens correlates directly to the connection we have to source within our selves, and how conscious humanity is as a whole. A person less conscious of the world and their actions isn't necessarily a negative person right? Do I believe this cycle can be broken? Yes. Do I believe its possible while elites are still in control - no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if negativity is not natural, how can you explain a child who has been nurtured in the proper environment and given proper love and care being a negative being and committing acts of violence against others and or animals? I don't think negativity is our natural state because if it was we would've wiped our selves out but I do think negativity is still a part of natural existence because without it how could we possibly understand what a utopia is or what positvity is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also can you give me an approximation of where you believe Atlantis to have been located? For all we know there could've been a whole global civilization that was interconnected much like we are today that was wiped out and the main continent or super power (for lack of a better term) was called Atlantis. Because of this we wouldn't really be able to know exactly where Atlantis was located because of the possibility of so many different underwater ruins being able to claim the title of "Atlantis" again I'd be happy to look into this deeper if you could guide me in the right direction with some links and or books.

       The point is that those who say that such a thing happened and have the "authority" need to do literally everything they can to show and explain why what they are saying is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       By saying you can go to these places yourself you're now saying the burden of proving this is now on the listener's shoulders.

      </p>
      <p>
       If the person doesn't do everything they can do show and explain the "truth" they've found, then they almost assuredly have not found the truth because once you actually find the truth the intense desire do do everything you can to help people understand the truth is there, like how I am doing with all of my incredibly long posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now believing that every sunken ancient city could be Atlantis proper disregards the simple fact that Atlantis itself would have been far more than just a small collection of concentrated ruins. And there are not thousands of miles of ruins in the parts of the world that have these occasional sunken cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very easy to surmise where Atlantis would have been and there are so many clues. I go into this in my original thread which I'm not sure you read since these types of questions are being asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       One simple thing is that the colonies closest to Atlantis would have been the "biggest" and most advanced civilizations, and since these colonies escaped the cataclysm that effected Atlantis proper, they would have survived and had existing Atlantean architecture that survived as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 places that fit this description without a doubt are the yucatan and egypt. These 2 places both have many pyramids still standing and many advanced architectural marvels that are spread throughout the geographic area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 places would have certainly been the primary colonies, the biggest and most advanced of all atlantean colonies. And they would have certainly been the 2 main locations for Atlantean survivors to go to after Atlantis was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would mean that Atlantis would have had to have been located directly in between these 2 places, right in the
       <em>
        Atlantic
       </em>
       ocean. And I go into why it would have had to have been a continent in my original thread on Atlantis, which I urge you to actually read in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       These 2 civilizations, the yucatan and egypt give us the clues we need to understand part of just how incredibly advanced Atlantis was. These colonies were more than likely established sometime before the 1st cataclysm that rocked Atlantis and allowed the elite to rise to power. If it was near the 2nd/destruction of Atlantis, they probably wouldn't have had the capacity to build so many magnificent and grand structures, and the elite most likely would not have let them had the colonies been established after the elites had gained power.
      </p>
      <p>
       There other places in the world with pyramids as well but nowhere near to the scale as the yucatan and egypt, so these places would have either also possibly been minor Atlantean colonies that survived or were places thst Atlantean survivors arrived at with some of the advanced knowledge and technology needed to build pyramids, but not to the capacity of the already established colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So more than likely both of these scenarios happened simultaneously in different places, where in some spots with larger, older, and more sophisticated pyramids there would have been already been an established colony there but Atlanteans still would have fled there and perhaps tried to build more pyramids like in China for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it makes far more sense that Atlantean survivors would mainly congregate towards already established colonies so they wouldn't have to start again completely from scratch. Now of course some most likely would have gone to places where there were no colonies like different parts of europe, North america, South america, africa, and asia. But there definitely is a concentration of many megalithic structures in certain areas, along with pyramids, so those places are very likely colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest guide I can give you right now is all of those posts that I have linked you to. Also for more evidence of ruins of Atlantis proper, watch
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        this
       </a>
       . But doing your own research while also keeping in min the things I have shown and explained in my posts will greatly benefit your understanding of the topic.

       On this specifically, the burden of proof is not on the listeners shoulders. The proof is shown, in clear high resolution pictures and factual data. I was just saying that you can go to the places - shown in the pictures - and see the exact same things depicted in the book. I really think you should read the book because it gives credence to a lot of the things that you're saying and it's like you're attempting to discredit it merely because someone with a background wrote it. Graham has dedicated his life to trying to prove the mystery of an ancient super advanced civilization and has received tremendous amounts of ridicule and now that it's coming to light, the idea's he wrote about and presented (usually his ideas in tandem with other people in the "alternative history" field who you're probably familiar with and take the words into account.)  are being shot down by people who have never read the book even though you're speaking about the exact same premise, it's kind of ridiculous to be honest. This man isn't controlled by the cabal, hes spoken against them and has received ridicule. Look at me for example, I'm an artist and make music but if I were to blow up and still talk about the things I talk about today would you think I'm controlled by the cabal?

       Anyways, continuing on the with the conversation;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The 2 places that fit this description without a doubt are the yucatan and egypt. These 2 places both have many pyramids still standing and many advanced architectural marvels that are spread throughout the geographic area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2 places would have certainly been the primary colonies, the biggest and most advanced of all atlantean colonies. And they would have certainly been the 2 main locations for Atlantean survivors to go to after Atlantis was destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        That would mean that Atlantis would have had to have been located directly in between these 2 places, right in the Atlantic ocean. And I go into why it would have had to have been a continent in my original thread on Atlantis, which I urge you to actually read in detail.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a very interesting point and I can agree on this. I believe that this civilization spanned much further into the past than what is talked about in magicians of the gods, the book merely provides a premise for people to dig deeper into the mysteries surrounding this ancient civilization. I also believe Egypt is a central key to understanding this civilization, another reason the precession of the equinox is so important is because its a way of indefinitely keeping a timeline of history. The ancient Egyptians speak of a civilization spanning into great antiquity going back about 1.5 precessional cycles, so about 36,000 years into the past. Coincidentally this is also between 24,000 and 14,000 years into the discovery of psychedelics, specifically mushrooms (because of cave paintings). I can agree with things that you're saying because they do make sense and I do support you 100% on wanting to persuade people on the notion of the ancient civilization but conjecture is simply not enough unless you are an authority figure (which is fucking stupid I know). If you want to make a change (I do as well) you're going to have to get out there and dedicate YOUR life to finding the hard physical evidence behind this. Whether it be going to egypt and the yucutan making the connections between both of the places and other parts of the world while documenting them, or starting a youtube channel documenting your journey around the searching for the evidence of a lost civilization. At the end you can be coppernicus and speak about what you believe or be galileo and do something to prove what the coppernicus' of this subject have said in the past. If you do start a channel I'd be willing to donate on patreon. You your self say the internet is the most powerful thing we have to overthrowing the elite. Commenting about your belief wont change the lives of others (it might but will not reach many people), go out and do something about it please because you seem to be knowledgeable on the subject and just commenting on forums is letting your knowledge go to waste.

       I wrote half of my reply before I minimized Google Chrome in my phone and the completely inefficient design of reddit of course deleted all of my writing so I'll cut to the chase from what I remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never discredit a book simply because the author has a background. That isn't the problem. The problem is that while he is making connections, he is not making so many of the right ones and he isn't making enough connections. It is one thing to make connections, but another thing entirely to be able to connect everything together and simultaneously use logic to both go along a sequential path to lead to the next connection and to order those connections in the most effective sequence to help understand the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had not made the connections between Atlantis, the elite, the negativity of the world today, the global system of control, aliens, true spirituality, and just how advanced Atlantis would have certainly been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham supposes thst Atlantis was super advanced and he  most likely also supposes that aliens had something to do with it. But connection making
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       logic both point to just how advanced Atlantis would have been and how even more advanced the aliens helping Atlantis were/are (
       <em>
        since they're still around
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposing that Atlantis and the et's helping them would not have knowm about a comet (
       <em>
        the et's come from space for pete's sake
       </em>
       )  heading towards earth is so incredibly disingenuous to the counter supposition that "Atlantis was super advanced", and flies in the face of the obviousness of just how incredibly advanced the et's are.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone is so disingenous , in fact, that his entire book is a complete contradiction. Either Atlantis and the et's weren't/aren't very advanced at all, or there was no comet that destroyed Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       To suppose then, that Atlantis and the et's weren't/aren't very advanced at all simply falls flat when confronted with the things that both the combination of connection making/logic, and pure obviousness bring up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Et's would have certainly been the source of Atlantis's advanced technology and knowledge and that means that they would have had to have been even more advanced than Atlantis as the proverbial "parents" of Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literally thousands upon thousands of sightings, reports, videos, encounters, etc of the ships of the et's doing quote "impossible" unquote things, things like speeding off far beyond the speed of any human craft from literally sitting still, performing 90 degree turns
       <em>
        at this speed
       </em>
       , multiplying into separate craft, unifying into a single craft, forming changing geometric patterns while changing colors, and simply appearing out of nowhere and disappearing into nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any civilization that is able to master anti-gravity as well as all of those other things would be able to stop a comet, Supposing that they ever even needed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis would have very likely had similar, albeit slightly reduced, capabilities technologically and the combination of these 2 things simply nullifies any comet ever destroying Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       To even propose otherwise while still claiming Atlantis was an advanced civilization that was capable of creating massive pyramids and monoliths with laser precision while utilizing sacred geometric patterns and fibonacci spirals (
       <em>
        the golden ratio
       </em>
       ) is so incredibly contradictory that you might as well say that Atlantis simply didn't exist at all because that contradiction nullifies what Atlantis actually was.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to simply add insult to injury there is also their incredible knowledge of astronomy and all of the other things I have mentioned in my original post (I'm still not sure you actually read it) like essentially having no negativity and being able to cure any disease, and knowing what happens after we die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic, far more than "science", will lead you to the actual truth because the majority of today's science is inherently illogical. It forgoes the actual use of the mind and makes illusory correlations in literally every category. Illusory correlations backed by a total arrogance regarding the true accuracy and efficiency of "science" as it is in most fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not value connecting all of the seemingly unrelated things and actively uses skepticism in regards to connecting
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       that seems unrelated. It does so under the premise that amounts of absolute proof is always needed no matter what, and then this extends further into what proof consists of and what "a massive amount" consists of, all the while ignoring the fact that so many of its conclusions are simply illogical and do not involve all of the connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very much akin to staring at each individual brick in a wall while being very close to the wall, studying it intensely, and doing so many illogical things before determining that it is indeed a brick. And then the same thing happens at random to different bricks and then scientists debate whether or not this is actually a brick because it doesn't look exactly like the other brick.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are never able to put the bricks together and see that it is a wall of bricks and God forbid if anyone (like me) simply steps back and is able to make all of the connections and use logic to find the truth that it is a brick wall, and even worse if that person then tells people it is a brick wall and how to do the same thing to understand that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is essentially a form of insanity and there are many forms of insanity that plague humanity, from religion, to economics, to government, to social trends, etc. Once you take a step back and make all of the connections and use logic simultaneously, you are able to see all of this insanity for what it is and you know exactly why it is insanity to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read the book and I have seen the pictures you talk about and it was exactly as I knew it would be: no actual pictures of all of the things they talk about, simply geographic pictures of the areas they reference and more talk about nanodiamonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham cleary hasnt made all of the connections and has not used logic otherwise he would understand that Atlantis and the aliens would never have allowed a comet or meteor to destroy Atlantis and he clearly doesn't understand that they absolutely would be able to stop such a thing from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since actual connection making and logic were not used, the only way he could have actually made a case (
       <em>
        he simply couldn't have because there was no comet
       </em>
       ) would be to provide as many pictures of the actual "evidence" as possible, while also going above and beyond to get as many people as possible to see the evidence in person, first hand, if he actually knew he found the truth (
       <em>
        rather than just believe he did, which is what happened
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, actual connection making and logic are not common at all among people, including this sub, and there is a reason for that, but there's not need to explain why here (
       <em>
        you can read my other stuff, I explain it multiple times
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple things that are illogicsl about yoyr suggestions. Changing the world is not and can never be a one person job. All of those connections are already made so such trips are completely uneccessary. Youtube is not the place that is the biggest concentration of people actively questioning the narrative and system of the elite, this subreddit is. The internet is indeed the most powerful tool for change which is exactly why my knowledge is suited to be used on it, and this subreddit is the center of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say that what I am doing is a waste and to go do something about it is akin to telling the conductor of a gigantic Orchestra to stop leading the orchestra and to sit down and play the violin if you want music.
      </p>
      <p>
       My talents are infinitely better suited here and organizing everything than simply trying to play a Symphony with my single violin. I will inevitably get involved with the rediscovery of Atlantis but I don't have the money nor the to I'm at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There also simply isn't enough momentum for me to get involved yet, but my place is to lead others to get involved themselves and to get them to coordinate with each other to do so as well. I also am here to change this subreddit to entirely one about discussion of Atlantis and the related topics like aliens, antarctica, hollow earth, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can help me in this last pursuit by starting your own threads about these things, but without the Graham hancock stuff. My posts have laid out what things will inevitably be like, because I will not stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know the actual objective truth do everything you possibly can (
       <em>
        within reason of course, because logic dictates priorities
       </em>
       ) to make everyone understands what you understand, and you will stop at nothing , and I mean nothing, until the truth is known by everyone else as well. Now the intensity varies of course because I too have obligations to family that aren't aware of these things yet and to myself and those things come first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who do not know the actual objective truth do not prioritize correctly and thus become obsessed with their beliefs and yet simultaneously eventually stop in their goal to inform everyone of their "truth". Religious people for example, like christians, mormons, or Muslims will become obsessed and do not prioritize correctly but will eventually stop trying to convince others of their "truth" because they do not actually objectively know if it is the truth. The same goes for scientists, and economists, and skeptics, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of them use actual connection making and logic and so none of them know the actual objective truth. But everyone on earth will eventually be able to do these 2 things and everyone will know the objective truth.

       Sourcing people who themselves operate entirely on conjecture and yet simultaneously demand that you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       their word as
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       because they have hidden evidence locked away somewhere that you are not allowed or able to see for yourself in person, is insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above anything else, including religion, "science" is the most deeply entrenched belief system on the entire planet because of the very obvious and simple truth that "scientists" have the "authority" that is backed by "evidence", when in actual reality, they have more fervent and strongly attached beliefs than any almost any other group on the planet besides the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence can only ever be considered evidence if it is obvious and able to be seen by everyone. Those "sources" you are implying I should use, are completely filled to the brim with conjecture, even if some of them happen to be objectively accurate about certain things (like Graham Hancock about there being an advanced ancient civilization here on Earth existing over 10,000 years ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is utter and complete willing blindness and ignorance to continue to posit, in any way whatsoever, that there are not et's visiting the planet daily and that there is no way they did not do so in the distant past as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fantasy to even think for a moment, that WWIII could ever be possible and that nuclear missles could ever do any damage what so ever because the et's that are constantly in the skies every single day around the world would never let the elite go so far as to attempt to annihilate and irradiate an entire area of the planet while also killing hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions, possibly billions, with these weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking into account all of the obvious evidence, making all of the connections needed, and using logic to order those connections in the correct sequence are the main actions that are needed to find the
       <em>
        objective
       </em>
       truth of reality. That means there can be no "I think" or "I believe" when it comes to the actual objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it does not matter what "you think" about politics or Donald Trump, neither of those matter in any way what so ever and have no relevance or importance at all to actually permanently (and I mean permanently) changing the world for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       This topic is what matters, and it is the only thing that
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       matters in regards to actually destroying the elite's global system and finally changing the world.

       randall carlson. Look him up. He provides real scientifc evidence for a near extinction event around 12,000 years ago that hit the North American continent. He has collabed with Hancock on this theory.  It's not all conjecture.

       I've already covered the comet theory hitting North America, and the micro-diamonds and all of the other "evidence" that they support their theory with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before continuing to regurgitate "sources" and their beliefs, I implore you to read all of the other links I continuously provide in my posts. There could never have been a comet or a meteor that could have hit the planet at that time because it would never have been allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, "backing up" things with beliefs and conjecture which themselves are "backed up" by incomplete and inaccurate information is not something that could ever help in any way lead to the actual objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is completely pointless, though, for me to type everything I have already gone over in the links that I continuously provide (
       <em>
        which you know of because they are the only way you would have come to this very thread
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to take into account
       <strong>
        <em>
         all
        </em>
       </strong>
       of the obvious evidence (not just
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       ), and you need to make
       <strong>
        <em>
         all
        </em>
       </strong>
       of the connections needed (not just
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       ) between everything. Then you need to use
       <strong>
        <em>
         logic
        </em>
       </strong>
       to order those connections in the correct sequence in order to find the actual objective truth. The only way you can know the correct sequence is by looking at what is objectively possible, and the only way to know what is objectively possible is by taking into account all of the obvious evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It revolves around
       <strong>
        obvious
       </strong>
       evidence, but the other 2 things are equally important to finding the actual objective truth. This is objectivity, it is not subjectivity being used to determine reality. This is not conjecture, i.e. conclusions formed from incomplete and inaccurate information. Conjecture is belief, and beliefs are subjectivity being used to determine reality, which is insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot operate solely on obvious evidence, but it is the first thing that is needed. Yet without the other 2, you will never be able to find the actual objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that is me indulging you by rewriting what I have already wrote in my links, and in many many many other comments across this sub. Now please, go read those links and instead of coming back to simply regurgitate more "science" (
       <em>
        which, of course, I should specify means the vast majority of mainstream science
       </em>
       ), come back with legitimate questions that are
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       loaded and meant to be demeaning, sarcastic, antagonistic, or negative in any way.

       If you don't even try to understand written language, then why on earth would you try to understand anything else related to this? None of this is about belief, and yet
       <em>
        beliefs
       </em>
       make you, and so many others,
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that these things are speculation and they simultaneously make you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that obvious evidence isn't actual evidence and that hidden "evidence" is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insanity comes in many forms and when its exposed, those who are under its sway always react with negativity and seek to create more negativity, as well as defend their beliefs using any means necessary. These beliefs always have negativity attached to them and they always create more and more negativity when allowed to persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not read what I have written and actually try to understand that, then that means you don't actually want to understand and simply want to externalize some form of negativity which itself stems from the attachment to a negative belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, no links aside from the ones you already know about. Insanity will no longer be tolerated and no amount of negativity can stop it from being completely destroyed. Pure positivity is returning and any who try to stop it will not enjoy the experience of doing so. The only thing you can do is use your free will to not be negative and to actually read and ask questions to help you understand and appreciate this. Otherwise you will not enjoy your experience, I guarantee it.

       I read your reply thanks for replying. Now am I supposed to just take your word on this stuff or have you done actual research that you can site? This isn't something I've heard of before so I likely would not have heard of anything yet that you could link. If you actually know this stuff and haven't made it up then you should have some kind of research that you could cite and point me towards. Otherwise It looks like  you're just rambling on.

       The entire reply was of substance, and one more final time, it is
       <em>
        beliefs
       </em>
       that make you
       <strong>
        <em>
         believe
        </em>
       </strong>
       that there is nothing of substance, and that things of substance are what the established "authorities" say is "fact". Obvious evidence, connections, and logic. Those 3 things I continuously write about in my posts. But you actually need to read everything thoroughly and in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Objectivity does not, and cannot come from conjecture and hidden "evidence". It does not and cannot come from incomplete and inaccurate information, which is what the vast majority of "science" bases its conclusions on, and is what everyone else in the world bases their conclusions on. Conclusions formed from incomplete and inaccurate information = conjecture. Conjecture will never and can never lead anyone to objectivity, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my final reply regarding this because if you do not want to actually take the time to even read after already reaching out and replying twice, then it is pointless to show and explain everything any further because that would be beyond reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you do choose to read everything thoroughly and in detail, then do so twice and in the order in which the links are linked. If you choose not to do so then do not reply to this because I will know if you have done what I just specified to do.

       The irony of this is something this sub is so immensely guilty of:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Can't stand to read anything longer than a paragraph.
2.) Completely dismisses everything written in favor of what is essentially actual "bullshit".
3.)*Is told to actually read before saying anything further in order to understand and appreciate what is being said.
4.) Proceeds to completely dismiss that and then proceeds to say the exact same thing, albeit now openly favoring "bullshit".
5.) Is explicitly told exactly why said "bullshit" is "bullshit" and is once again told to actually read before saying anything.
6.) Proceeds to completely dismiss that and then proceeds to completely dismiss everything in absolute favor of total "bullshit".
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is so very contradictory that it almost defeats the entire purpose of this sub even existing.
       <em>
        Almost
       </em>
       . You want to understand what I am saying yet to proceed to behave in the exact opposite way and completely dismiss any effort to actually show and explain to you how you can understand what I am saying. And this sub claims that they are "awake" yet does everything in its power to stay "asleep". This sub claims to desire an end to the elite's rule over the world, yet does everything in its power to spread as much negativity and as many negative beliefs as it can.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are point and case of that, yet the irony doesn't stop there. Those that post about this topic claim they know of its importance yet treat it as completely inferior to the negative "bullshit" that constantly fills this sub. This sub claims to be full of people who see through lies yet propagate them as much as any other sub. This sub claims to be completely free thinking yet is constantly following what "authorities" say as if it were fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the biggest contradiction of all, the biggest irony, is that this sub claims to fight against those who make conspiracies, yet actively and constantly is part of the most harmful conspiracy of all: Silencing and devaluing the actual truth that will set humanity free.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try to enjoy the irony of it all, but you won't be able to, because it applies directly to you just as much as it does almost everyone else on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, try to enjoy your time ahead, for it will surely be a bumpy one.

       I'm talking 25 thousand years ago. Atlantis had lots of technology. The aliens were helping the more primitive humans but they slipped up and gave them too much technology which was weaponized and the humans warred until the whole world basically suicided itself. Since then, those same aliens have been very cautious with giving humans technology although they recently gave us 0 point energy which is limitless energy. Government hasn't shared it with us.

       Maybe you should reconsider your definition of 'alien'?... there are non-human depictions on artifacts from every ancient culture that has unexplained construction technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watchers/Shining Ones are extraterrestrial (if not the incarnated versions), Nephilim were genetic hybrids (giants), Elohim are higher dimensional 'solar' beings, like Archangels and might be consider inner/extra-dimensional instead of extraterrestrial.

       yea, i agree but their native home was not earth, it's explained in the text that they actually petitioned to come here against the wishes of God and though He objected, He allowed it. I think being a spirit basically equates to being extra-dimensional.

       You are correct that Atlantis existed 25000 years ago and that yes aliens were not only helping humanity, but in constant contact and communication with it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you absolutely shouldn't believe the law of one, it is completely false and is full of lies. Atlantis was very very real and aliens are too, but the main premise of the law of one, which is oneness, is not real in any way and if you'd like, I can tell you why. Oneness is utterly illogical and has no basis in reality. Interconnectedness does, but not oneness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, the law of one is crap crap and more crap. And no, humanity would not have warred with itself because Atlantis was a completely positive place, and negativity was introduced once the elite of Atlantis came to power. They were the ones who destroyed Atlantis, not the rest of humanity.

       Humanity during Atlantis came under the control of a group of elites who had lost sight of the most important part and core of true spiritulaity which is learning lessons, and this same Atlantean elite have passed down this elitism to select individuals through the ages including the ones who control the world today. The original Atlantean elite are long dead of course, but they set the groundwork for the global system of control and oppression that currently poisons every aspect of life today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis was far more advanced than we are today, albeit lacking a few things like the internet and also having a smaller population. Atlantis was almost certainly destroyed by the actions of this elite and that would have happened due to both an inability to stop the catastrophe and an acceptance by the population who realized that they could learn very valuable lessons from the negativity of the event and the world to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have made a thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/importance to defeating the elite and their global control system

       comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow "spiritually" minded.

       Yeah, there's lots of Antediluvian Civilizations from when were supposedly cavemen 10,000 years ago. There's a big underground city off the coast of India too.

       Dr. Greg Little has found ruins off the coast of the Andros Islands in the caribbean as well,
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        here is a relatively long but superbly informative video about it
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis was a continent in the
       <em>
        Atlantic
       </em>
       ocean, not just a small or even country sized island. There are ruins all along the bottom of the Atlantic and in the caribbean and azores and we need to find them to free the world from the oppression of the elite!
      </p>
      <p>
       What we as a sub needs to be doing is discussing Atlantis more and researching it, but most importantly organizing expeditions to the caribbean/bahamas/azores to find it and/or getting involved with those who are already doing this, like the guy in that video I linked, Dr. Greg Little.

      <p>
       Your source mentions a couple of things:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Account of Josephus is a Fraud
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's a bold claim to make and is actually wrong. Josephus calls Jesus 'Messiah' which wouldn't make sense, since Josephus was Jewish - that much is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, most scholars accept that it was Josephus who wrote it but that later historians such as Eusebius made it more 'Christian' so to speak (by using a word like 'Messiah for example)'
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, quite some scholars accept the Testimonium Flavium to be authentic. These include Paul Maier, Zvi Baras, Craig Evans and Robert van Voorst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that the writing style fits with Josephus
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First Written Accounts of Jesus's Life Occur Decades After His Purported Existence
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's true, but that doesn't mean much. Jesus would just be some random "preacher" from Judea. Makes sense that there isn't much mention of him before he died as his death is one of the more important parts about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, about the Gospels, some are accepted as historically correct - such as the Gospel of John. These are called the Synoptic Gospels
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Pilate Stone actually speaks about Pontius Pilatus.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nero's Persecution of Christians and Mention of Jesus is Highly Doubtful
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is still the discussion of 'Chrestians vs Christians' - although it's probable that 'Chrestians' is just the older way to spell it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Seutonius does mention Christians being punished by Nero
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pliny's Letter About "Christiani"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I really don't understand this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, yes, just because Pliny punished 'Christiani' does not imply that Jesus existed...
      </p>
      <p>
       But that has nothing to do with disproving his existence....
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like saying: "Yes Egyptians sultans fought Mongolians in the Middle East but that doesn't imply that Genghis Khan existed!".
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, yes, I guess it doesn't.... But I'm not seeing how that disproves his existence neither...
      </p>

      <p>
       So, Seutonius claimed that Jesus caused Jews in Rome to riot, but this wouldn't be possible since Jesus wasn't in Rome at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But from my POV, Seutonius never claimed that Jesus was in Rome, just that Jews in Rome rioted because of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, am I wrong does that paragraph speak against its point?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jesus couldn't have caused the Jews to riot since he was being crucified at that point."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds to me as a perfect explenation as to why the Jews rioted in the first place - still because of Jesus.

       Any sources on those things? And because there are similarities between these characters/deities that automatically means Jesus never lived...?

       Also, even if parts of the story of Jesus are bullshit, that doesn't imply he never existed at all.

        Supposedly, the claims that Horus was crucified is based on thin air

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://coldcasechristianity.com/2014/is-jesus-simply-a-retelling-of-the-horus-myth/">
        This source claims that Horus had only 4 disciples, called ‘Heru-Shemsu’', it's also claimed here that Horus was never crucified since he is reborn everyday
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That same source also claims that Horus had many names and that those are titles you could expect of a God

       <a href="https://www.quora.com/Mythology-Was-Egyptian-God-Horus-born-on-25th-of-December-What-about-other-Gods-compared-with-Jesus-in-Zeitgeist-movie">
        Here it is claimed that Jesus is never considered to be born on the 25th and that Horus was traditionally celebrated somewhere in August rather than December
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Janmashtami">
        Krishna's birthday is in August
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't find anything to disprove Krishna having 12 disciples but hilariously enough - Wikipedia makes no mention of this, at all. The only websites I found that claimed Krishna to have 12 disciples are "conspiracy"-like websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take
       <a href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/sunsofgod.htm">
        this one
       </a>
       for example. Many claims are made on that unprofessional page, including Krishna having 12 disciples. However, the page is bullshit as Krishna's birthday just isn't on the 25th of December, which is something that page claims. Therefore I really doubt the authenticity of the claims made there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how can Krishna be crucified, if according to the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna#Later_life">
        Mausala Parva
       </a>
       , Krishna doesn't age nor detoriate
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, Krishna has
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_titles_and_names_of_Krishna">
        many titles
       </a>
       yet "the light" or "the way" don't appear to be any of them.

       The older episodes with Michael Ruppert (at least the first one) are pretty cool from a general conspiracy point of view, and I would also recommend the one time Giorgios Tsoukalos from AA was on. Bit silly in places, but overall it's a light-hearted romp through similar subjects to Yonaguni.

       I think he means never told about as in by "commonly accepted history" or by the authorities of today. Now of course the ancient civilizations we know of all had references to the flood, since some were colonies of Atlantis and also there would have certainly been Atlantean survivors of the flood influencing those civilizations that weren't colonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even those "scientists" who say that something must have happened 12000 years ago will still say it was something natural , which would be the work of the elite forcing/threatening/coercing/influencing them to say so, while also fabricating the actual "science" used to "confirm" that.

       The poles were different. I think if the change was sudden by perhaps an event like an impact it could be a  plausible explanation for why the ancients built temples on power points along a grid that has changed slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the north pole was once located at the Bermuda triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another theory I wonder about is if at times in the massive history of this world man leaves this world, only to reappear at another time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some things being found point to man existed 250,000 years ago, some 50,000 years ago, and then we have our history starting again about 20,000 years ago with the pyramid builders.
      </p>
      <p>
       These structures in Africa and throughout the world that we have barely a trace of, are an epoch before that:

        https://vimeo.com/user12206452/videos
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So to it seems man is around, then gone, then here again, then gone, then here again. This could have no beginning or end to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we imagine Atlants and their downfall, Regardless of how it happened but we imagine them as sort of cosmic. Man had blinked into EArth and found the way to leave Earth. We are getting closer to doing it in our time. Man had also done this before.

       While there almost certainly is a history of humanity before Atlantis, it wold have been around for quite a long period of time, very well spanning hundreds of thousands of years. Atlantis is the most important part of human history, even more important than what came before because it had the most relevance to humanity today and is the model of what global human civilization will be like again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis and humanity were in constant contact and communication with advanced aliens so they would have certainly known how to leave the planet. But Earth is a paradise and humanity would have been, and is here for a very good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is our planet and we are to look after it, so there is absolutely no need to leave. Now, branch out? Of course thst would be the case in the future once humanity is United and back to the level of Atlantis again (*which will happen far sooner than anyone realizes btw).

       I agree. Most of my energy lately is being directed towards ancient man's use of nature. They didn't separate themselves from it like we do. In r/holofracal I am trying to remember this connection if you would like to contribute to the remembrance.

       While the use of nature is extremely important, there are other far more important things that have to do with Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis is the key, and not just any specific part of it alone. All of it is important but not all of it is necessary to change the world, things like what Atlanteans wore, where their cities were, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage you, please read my posts that I have linked and not only read but study them  so you can understand the connections made and the logic used and that will enable you to truly understand the topic and appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then once you understand and appreciate all of that you can and should start threads on Atlantis specifically and post comments and links in your thread to my posts. You also should research on the internet, mainly for hidden rediscoveries of different parts of Atlantis since most of the other important stuff has been covered in my posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have done that your biggest contribution can and should be to get involved with the rediscovery of Atlantis and getting involved with people like
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        Dr. Greg Little
       </a>
       and to help fund these people, and hopefully  eventually start an expedition yourself with people from here near you or others who you have shown my posts to and who question the narrative and system of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them you absolutely can and need to disseminate the rediscoveries of Atlantis everywhere you can, especially on the internet. That will be the catalyst that will destroy the narrative of the elite, and by extension their system of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to top it all off you can and should encourage others to do all of these things I'm encouraging you to do, and to tell those people to encourage others to so the same things and encourage even more people etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will create a snowball effect that will truly speed up the process of changing the world

       Thanks for that. I'm getting there as right now I am absorbing all the info a can about ancient mystery. Particularly the world grid and energy portals the geometry the ancients used.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an alternative view of Atlantis I want to run by you. Atlantis is a bleed-Through of sorts. What Plato did was tap into world views about Atlantis. Atlantis being an other dimensional reality. A parallel history to our s. This is one reason we don't find it in our world but only through an oral tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this is not to say we won't insert Atlantis into our reality in the near future. Bleed through action happens in our world at times. For example, the Nazca lines are a bleed through , crop circles are a bleed through, Easter island is a bleed through. There are parallel realities that have bled through into our world, but most don't accept the idea these objects originate from other lines in the Earth History.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, Atlantis is one type of paralell we may insert if the collective intent would gain value from it. But it's basically just floating within probabilities for us, but I bet if enough people were interested we would start to discover it here.

       My knowledge of x is a bit foggy. I'm not sure what it represents , it could be where a civilization might blink to. What I mean by blink is like the whole species blinks to another world. I know that's a far out concept but we need alternate ideas than the jumbled mess of history we have ,where it seems large empty spaces between appearances of major civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard from Seth, a channeled essence, about the great civilization before what we even know. He described them as master tunnel builders who were trying to remove the concept of aggression from their consciousness. But he described that they could make entrances to tunnels seem solid on the outside but inside the entrance was transparent. So they would be recluse, watching primitive man around them, super intelligent ,who could communicate with telepathy and their written language was lines. and depending on their curvature would give meaning. Some of the oldest cave paintings show these amazing use of lines. It's really interesting if you would like to read his info search 'Seth Jane Roberts' and the 'three great civilizations. '

       There is evidence of it and it's colonies all around the world and it is the single most important thing we could be talking about on this sub, even more important than ufos/aliens and I explain why in those links.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is amazing and there needs to be more like it and especially ones discussing Atlantis. Atlantis proper (in the bahamas/caribbean/azores/mid atlantic needs to be rediscovered and that rediscovery needs to be shared and dessiminated as far and wide as possible, especially through the Internet and social media.

       My contributions to this sub will continue until the world is completely changed and the system of the elite is destroyed once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you can and absolutely should contribute as well, and you can do that by studying my posts so yoy can understand the connections made and the logic used and that will enable you to truly understand the topic and appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then once you understand all of that you can and should start threads on Atlantis specifically and post comments and links in your thread to my posts. You also should research on the internet, mainly for hidden rediscoveries of different parts of Atlantis since most of the other important stuff has been covered in my posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have done that your biggest contribution can and should be to get involved with the rediscovery of Atlantis and getting involved with people like
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        Dr. Greg Little
       </a>
       and to help fund these people, and hopefully  eventually start an expedition yourself with people from here near you or others who you have shown my posts to and who question the narrative and system of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to top it all off you can and should encourage others to do all of these things I'm encouraging you to do, and to tell those people to encourage others to so the same things and encourage even more people etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will create a snowball effect that will truly speed up the process of changing the world

       There are lost civilisations.
       <br/>
       And most of them are in the ocean.
       <br/>
       Reason for this is simple
       <br/>
       We humans tend to live near the oceans ( great excess to food and water )
       <br/>
       Especially older civilisations would live there.
       <br/>
       Over time water raised and places near the ocean,s sank into the water ( remember the land bridge ;) )
       <br/>
       This means that a lot of old civilizations ( and its locations ) sank into the ocean.
       <br/>
       .

       Now look at what a lot of teh history stated ( the great flood )
       <br/>
       Wen humans where living close to costal area,s ( and the sea lvl raized ) there was a flood ( not all was flooded ) but most places where humans lived got flooded ( ia the great flood )

       Our catastrophic disasters are just the earth doing earth things. I have no doubt in my mind that there were older, advanced civilizations that were wiped out by floods, earthquakes, asteroids, etc. But why do people in the scientific community disagree with Graham Hitchock and Randall Carlson, it makes no sense (oh wait, probably religion)

       Yep im currently reading it. I was reading it the other day while under the infleunce of an edible and listening to some fantasy/adventure background music and man if that didnt leave and imprint in my mind. I was peaking around the same time the music was and I had just gotten to the first section of images and I started visualizing the catastrophic events unfold. I felt such a strong connection to what the book was saying. It read like a fictional story yet it is the story of our past. Amazing book this is.

       Any sources on those things? And because there are similarities between these characters/deities that automatically means Jesus never lived...?

       Thanks for that. I'm getting there as right now I am absorbing all the info a can about ancient mystery. Particularly the world grid and energy portals the geometry the ancients used.
      </p>

       I have an alternative view of Atlantis I want to run by you. Atlantis is a bleed-Through of sorts. What Plato did was tap into world views about Atlantis. Atlantis being an other dimensional reality. A parallel history to our s. This is one reason we don't find it in our world but only through an oral tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this is not to say we won't insert Atlantis into our reality in the near future. Bleed through action happens in our world at times. For example, the Nazca lines are a bleed through , crop circles are a bleed through, Easter island is a bleed through. There are parallel realities that have bled through into our world, but most don't accept the idea these objects originate from other lines in the Earth History.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, Atlantis is one type of paralell we may insert if the collective intent would gain value from it. But it's basically just floating within probabilities for us, but I bet if enough people were interested we would start to discover it here.
