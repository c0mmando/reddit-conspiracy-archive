        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s have a discussion about the recent event regarding Julian Assange.</p>

<p>Recently he did an AMA here on Reddit. There were many questions asked but the one that sticks out to me is the one where he was asked to provide his pgp signature to prove his authenticity.</p>

<p>Now honestly, I would have dismissed all of this if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that people have posted videos where people have been CGIed to look as if it was them speaking. That along with the fact that Mr. Assange himself said his pgp signature and live video was the only way to prove authenticy raises alarms. Especially since the request was the second highest comment and not some obscure downvoted comment.</p>

<p>What also raises flags is the influx of random quotes attritubed to Julian Assange in meme form that have made the it to the top of this sub recently. </p>

<p>Are we being played? Is he compromised? Or am I just being irrational?</p>

<p>I hope we can have a civil discussion and actually adress an issue here. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JA is alive.</p>

<p>JA may or may not be at the embassy.</p>

<p>JA will only talk about recent events and going forward. He went silent for a few months and since returning will not comment on what happened.</p>

<p>JA is a smart man he knows we are all noticing that he won&#39;t talk about the events that transpired in October.</p>

<p>An addition to the point above, I think what was readily apparent to a critical thinker was what he did say at the end of the Hannity interview. JA signed up to fight the big boys and will take the consequences that come with it -- but as he said, his children did not.</p>

<p>I think the word here is that he is being coerced. </p>

<p>TL;DR - he&#39;s alive but unable to speak freely for any of the multiple reasons /r conspiracy can come up with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll do the best I can. </p>

<p>In October, when assange went MIA, I pulled a chart for him which located him in a &quot;place near water&quot; but at 29 degrees - which means an ending. The London Ecuadorian embassy is (obviously) on the island of Great Britain. According to the chart, his time there was at an end. </p>

<p>Same time period, he was being <a href="https://wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/toddandclare-emails-3-sep-2016-to-21-sep-2016.pdf">threatened</a> by the dating site, Todd and Clare, with being taken to ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Colorado. </p>

<p>His second chart, which I pulled yesterday, indicates that he is there, and no longer in the embassy. </p>

<p>In all honesty, I am not a horary expert by any means. I&#39;ve found the charts are never wrong, only my ability to read them. Right now, I see him in an institution for sure with his day-to-day experience near mountains. </p>
