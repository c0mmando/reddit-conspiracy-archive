       Everyone on FB is having a circle jerk about how sad they are that Obama is leaving. I know that a lot of people are are optimistic that the tide is turning, and Americans are waking up. I want to believe that, but my FB newsfeed tells me otherwise. Most of my friends have not woken up yet. I can count on one hand the # of people I know that actually pay attention to what our gov't is doing overseas. Obama is leaving behind a bloody, failed foreign policy legacy. And everyone is more interested in talking about Meryl Streep's stupid speech. Or Trump's unsubstantiated golden shower escapades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how anyone could argue that thousands of civilians have not been killed by our bombing campaigns in 2016. The Gov't won't release the #'s because it'll make them look bad, but do the math and be realistic. Obama dropped 26,000 bombs in one year! The White House estimates that only 64-114 civilians have died by drone strikes between 2009-2015, but this figure only accounts for airstrikes in areas outside of active hostilities (ie not Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc). Its propaganda in its finest form. The White House is refusing to release the numbers of civilians that have died in war zones from our bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bogus stats on # of civilians died by drone stikes.

       Then I wonder what does. I have no idea how else to help wake up the sheep without the use of facts and logic. I posted this on FB and the partisan dribble has already started to come through. "Bush bombed Afganistan 17K times in 2003." OK .... I was against Bush's illegal wars also. Going to war should never be partisan. But if you are Anti Bush, Anti Obama, Anti Trump, people don't know what the fuck to do. They can't label you in their little fantasy of what the world really is.

       Stop trying.  Encourage them to vocalize and loudly proclaim their discontent.  There can be no question that the United States lost a war of subversion.  The beauty of our system, however, is that it allows for both capital punishment/common defense and cyclical, bloodless coups.

       I am a registered Democrat that didn't vote for him.  I get it.  People are very divided: they quickly accept what bolsters their choice of candidate and dismiss any criticism just as fast.  I am trying to accept it's an emotional, reactionary response, but I have considered stabbing myself with a fork the next mention I hear of weeping over this.

       I am so sick of hearing about it. Obama is done, its over he is out of office. Memorializing him as some kind of saint is sickening. I voted for Obama in 08 and 12, so I get it. Its taken me years to unwind my feelings about Obama and what he really is. I wanted so badly to believe that he was better than Bush, that he was different. He was going to end the unjust wars. It turns out I was just naive, and applying partisan politics to my value system. I don't know how to help wake people up because most people just simply don't take the time to actually understand what their leaders are doing, and can't wrap their heads around the fact that the leaders they voted for might not be as good as they thought. They just ingest the stupid memes and fall complacent to Obama's beautiful smile and adorable family.

       What's ironic is that I see the same thing happening with Trump supporters. They want to believe so badly that he is different than the Obamas and the Bushes and the Clintons. But he comes from the same cloth. Only time will tell with Trump does. But one thing is a guarantee, his supporters are going to hold onto their beliefs about him no matter what damning evidence is provided to show otherwise. Just as the liberal counterparts have done with Obama. How do we get people to reject this partisan mantra of "us vs them" how do we get people to realize that it's not the "Democrats vs Republicans" its the "People vs the Govt"

       If he doesn't go along with the CIA and Shadow Gov't's war machine he will likely be impeached or killed. If he does he'll be a hypocrite like all the others. I hope I'm wrong and there is another path here, but I think that's my naivety showing through again.

       Eh. The happy medium you are referring to still involves war and innocent civilian deaths. I like to believe in compromise, but the American war machine is just somewhere that I don't see that as possible. I cannot find any justification for foreign policy that lends itself to war. And I haven't seen any President in modern history that hasn't led us to war.

       I've spoken to some black people that have their eyes open. Predominately, its been my more self-aware friends that live in DC that have or still live in poverty. The income divide in DC is staggering, the people there know all too well how awful federal rule over their city has been and how disadvantaged that has made them. Many realized after a few years of Obama that he was not their savior, but others still made excuses and blamed it on the gov't, reserving that special exception for Obama. Basically if you are a true Democrat, 90% of you believe that Obama's administration has largely been a success. This is based purely on belief, not on actual facts. One of my DC friends posted this on FB recently:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKMtqFbB004">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKMtqFbB004
       </a>
       a very profound and accurate assessment of what is wrong with black culture and idolizing Obama. And then 2-months later, she's become delusional again posting this: "THANK YOU OBAMAS FOr finally doing it right||YOU DIDNT FIX IT ALL, BUT REALLY; I HOPE NO ONE WAS REALLY SITTIN UP HERE EXPECTING THEM TO? 🤔 YALL FIXED A HELL OF A LOT THAT WAS WRONG WITH This COUNTRY AND FOR THAT MFS||bOW|| THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD WITH WHAT THEY WERE GIVEN TO WORK WITH AND THEY FIXED WAY MORE MORAL &amp; ethical ISSUES AND CORRUPT ASS SHIT The US Has done in all its history. Oh y'all mad cuz they black?! Eat it up, cuz the OBAMAS Slay'd they term with style and graaceee. Y'all can't F wit them|||they COOL AF, so intelligent, and sharp. FUCK RELATIONSHIP GOALS||| The Obamas are MY Whole Life and FAMILY goals, they just set the FXn bar||SALute||Long live The CHIEF|" Like WTF, did you just take the happy pills again?? Ppl are not living in fucking reality anymore.

       That is crazy. That video was great. She was speaking truth. You know I notice so many people conflate Obamas marriage with his job.. Just be he loves his wife it doesn't make him any better of a person. He's still the #droneking. That girl Is smart though

       Its identity politics rearing its ugly head. Oh he is a good husband, he is a good father, he loves his family, he must be good. I voted for him because I believe in what he says he believes, I am a good person, so he must be good. I can't even get this point through to my own family.  It's OK to be afraid of Trump, I certainly am too, its hard not to when you hear some of the crazy things Trump has said and that its been manufactured by the media. But misplacing that fear into believing that Obama was some kind of saint is incredibly misguided. A healthy fear of ALL our nation's leaders is something we need more of.

       Just to clarify. I am white, but lived in DC for 4 years. I lived in a "not-so-great area", across the street from section 8 housing. There were shootings on my block at least once a month. Instead of hiding in my apartment like the other white people in my neighborhood, I went out and made friends with my neighbors. I was known as the crazy white cat lady, because people would see me running through the allys looking for my escaped cats (most of my neighbors had stray cats they fed, so an indoor cat didn't make a lot of sense). I've overgeneralized in my comments here, but if anything I've said is offensive to you, just let me know. I do not purport to understand the experiences of others, just share my opinions based on the conversations I've had with people.

       I agree with you, it is likely well over the thousands mark. But without any "official report" or "evidence" I chose to low-ball here. I chose the figure thousands, because its an easier pill to swallow for my FB sheep, than millions.

       First they'll demand proof to muddy the waters.  They may show you official DOD and SD and WH estimates- which are obviously downplayed for legal and PR reasons.  Then you show them independent reporting from places like The Bureau for Investigative Journalism and they will try to discredit the journalists there with Ad Hominem attacks.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Investigative_Journalism">

      </p>
      <p>
       Then they'll tell you that the guided weapons being used are extremely controlled and targeted and that there is an exhaustive process which takes place before a green light is given.  Then they'll acknowledge that collateral damage happens, but not to the extreme you are suggesting.  Then they'll ask you if you think Obama really wants to be murdering civilians.  Because why would he do that?  You must be a conspiracy theorist to think he's targeting civilians- that would be a war crime.  If given an example, they'll cite hanlon's razor- blame stupidity over malice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they're gonna go after you for the being the idiot/ bad person here.  So they'll flip it on you.  "Are you saying we should just let (insert villain here: ISIS/ Sadam/ Ghaddafi/ Assad/ Al Quada/ Iran/ The Russians, etc) terrorize innocent women and children?  Maybe they'll call you unpatriotic (though that tends to be more of a republican thing. "If you don't like American, why don't you just move?!").

       These are not thinkers.  These are angry, indoctrinated war mongers who struggle to justify their support and will lash out at you with rage for compromising their bubble.

       Honestly, most of my FB friends are not " angry, indoctrinated war mongers" most of them believe in non-violence and peace and are simply Democrats who want to believe that Obama was a good president and when presented with facts that prove he is not what he seems, they either just flat out ignore it or do these kinds of mental gymnastics to justify his actions. 99% of the time its flat out denial or ignorance that wins out. "If it doesn't fit into my perception of reality, it must not be true. So therefore she is just crazy." If they do argue my very truthful FB posts, I tend to pick apart their arguments with more logic and they give up and deem me as "one of the crazy conspiracy theory lunatics." I'll continue to try to pop their bubble and push against the tide. When people use the "You are un-American" line I like to remind them that our country was founded on dissent, and not wanting our country to bomb innocent children doesn't make me unpatriotic, it actually makes me more patriotic because I want our country to be better than it is. This tends to shut them up very quickly.

       I'm reacting a bit more to the israel first "atheist" cabal of democrats which consider themselves moderate realists, blame religion for all the ills of mankind and use memes like "the regressive left" and "the racism of low expectations" to demonize those who criticize their antagonism and violence.  And if you really rile them up, they attempt to associate your perspective with "racism/ bigotry/ anti-semitism/ misogyny/ homophobia etc"...

      <p>
       This is the apologist narrative I see pushed by establishment "liberal media" like comedy talk shows, NPR/ NYT, abc/cbs/nbc and so on- which feature a narrow array of political guests who push scripted and defamatory talking points to justify support of continued violence against brown people and forceful regime change in "enemy states".

       Yes thankfully I do not personally know any of these kinds of Democrats. They are littered across the Democratic Party however. I too am left-leaning. It's refreshing to see that this sub is not littered with "Trump supporters" or "Hillary brigaders" as many posts as of late have implied. I've been afraid to post in here for that very reason. But this also seems to be the only place I can have a rational conversation about what is really going on here without being called a "tin foil hat crazy" (talking about
       <a href="/r/Politics">

       obviously). I agree that Obama could have been worse for America, but he also could have been much much better, and fell flat on every one of his promises, and his foreign policy is just unforgivable in my eyes. I am considered an extremist because I find that there are very little, if any, justifiable reasons to engage in war. But alas that is not the reality we live in with the American Industrial Military Complex, and it won't change until more Americans share our sentiment that 70+ years of endless war is 70 years too many.

       try the news subs.  they are heavily brigaded by groups with political agendas, but pretty balanced when it comes to the types of opinions you see generally promoted here.

       And there are plenty of leaning people in this sub.  You just have a large number of people skeptical of authority and big government- which typically lends itself to right wing ideologies.

       It's not that they argue against it, it's that CNN or HuffBlow or theSkimm or any other MSM source talks about it. So they are unaware of it. And in the age of instant access to info, the mindset becomes "I've never seen/heard about it so it must not be true". The opposite can be said about "pissgate". It might not be true (likely isn't) but people have heard about it so now they're much more likely to believe it.

       Nope. I love this sub. But I don't think this is really a worthy topic. The Middle East(or SW Asia) sucks, plain and simple. They've been killing each other for thousands of years, why not help speed up the process? Lol

       Then you are pro gov't intervention. Kinda the opposite of this sub honestly. It is a conspiracy when the gov't engages in continuous warfare, lies to us about the causalities and the purpose of going to said wars, and the media justifies our use of warfare and encourages our complacency of it. What compelled me to conspiracy theories in the first place was the 2003 bombings in Iraq and the realization that our gov't was lying to us about their reasons for engaging in war. Also, "they've been killing each other for thousands of years" is a broad oversimplification, and I have yet to see any facts that actually prove this claim, I am happy to see articles and academic journals that cite otherwise. It also doesn't take into account the 100s of years of European and American imperialism in the regions. The long and the short, I may be somewhat of an outlier, and I am happy for that, because I became anti-gov't, and a skeptic precisely because I deeply believe in anti-war and strongly impose all interventions in foreign affairs.Then again that could just make me a libertarian, who knows.

       I'm all for staying out of it. I really am. But I just want the Middle East wiped out. We don't need that part of the world. But I'm pro-gov. Only small, limited gov't. I'm just a run of the mill nationalist. Lol I'm really not trying to spark anything. I just wish that part of the world would be gone ASAP. No harm, promise.

       Air Force reported estimates about a month ago. It was obviously kept on the down-low, but word was about 50,000 people have been killed in the last four months of 2016 alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has amazingly managed to keep the group think off foreign policy, so people generally don't have any notion that we are at war. Ironically, that means when we have "terrorist" attacks at home, people are just totally bewildered as to why anyone would do such a thing. To them it seems like random insanity.

       Oh interesting, I'm going to look for that Air Force report. I agree with your thought that Trump will be no different. People believing he will be different is reminiscent of mine and many others' beliefs that obama was somehow going to be different than Bush. We saw how well that worked

       I looked it up myself to make sure I got it right. While I could have sworn the article I read said "since September", I can't seem to find it now. But a
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/11/pentagon-counts-isil-dead-refuses-discuss-them/95215262/">
        report
       </a>
       in USA Today I found, very similar to the one I read, says 50,000 since September
       <strong>
        2014
       </strong>
       , and that the figure is conservative. So that might be were I got that figure and I somehow misconstrued the year. Not sure. I'll keep my eye out for more reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another article I found which says 20,000 in 11 months as of August.
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/us-isis-fighters-killed/410599/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course these reports are just of ISIL combatants, which at the very least leaves out the Taliban and probably Yemen and Libya casualties too.

       Its identity politics rearing its ugly head. Oh he is a good husband, he is a good father, he loves his family, he must be good. I voted for him because I believe in what he says he believes, I am a good person, so he must be good. I can't even get this point through to my own family.  It's OK to be afraid of Trump, I certainly am too, its hard not to when you hear some of the crazy things Trump has said and that its been manufactured by the media. But misplacing that fear into believing that Obama was some kind of saint is incredibly misguided. A healthy fear of ALL our nation's leaders is something we need more of.

       Yes thankfully I do not personally know any of these kinds of Democrats. They are littered across the Democratic Party however. I too am left-leaning. It's refreshing to see that this sub is not littered with "Trump supporters" or "Hillary brigaders" as many posts as of late have implied. I've been afraid to post in here for that very reason. But this also seems to be the only place I can have a rational conversation about what is really going on here without being called a "tin foil hat crazy" (talking about
       <a href="/r/Politics">

       obviously). I agree that Obama could have been worse for America, but he also could have been much much better, and fell flat on every one of his promises, and his foreign policy is just unforgivable in my eyes. I am considered an extremist because I find that there are very little, if any, justifiable reasons to engage in war. But alas that is not the reality we live in with the American Industrial Military Complex, and it won't change until more Americans share our sentiment that 70+ years of endless war is 70 years too many.
