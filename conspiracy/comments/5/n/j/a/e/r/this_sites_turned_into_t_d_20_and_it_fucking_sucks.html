    <div class="md"><p>I think it would help if this community had a clear standard for the burden of proof (or remove any burden of proof completely). </p>

<p>During pizzagate I argued with a lot of people, but I never advocated the threads be removed. They thought there was something there, I didn&#39;t. I said my case, and moved on. I mostly just argued about what constitutes circumstantial evidence anyway but in retrospect it was probably just people using a term that has a specific legal meaning in a lay conversation. </p>

<p>I always thought the standard on this sub was post what you want, back it up the best you can, and, if you can&#39;t, others will call you out on it. Self-regulating in a way. You see crazy shit here all the time and it doesn&#39;t get removed. I guess the rules don&#39;t get followed that often anyway, considering rule ten. Shill gets thrown around all the time. </p>

<p>I understand the need to regulate subs. I think subs like r/askhistorians are better for it. But it was kind of weird to see a sub that loves calling other subs out for removing posts that get attention do the same. </p>

<p>Literally the day after Trump won I said it would be interesting to see what happens with the sub and so far I think I&#39;ve been right. At least if nothing else it&#39;s making some good subredditdrama material. </p>

<p>The point of a conspiracy sub is to talk about conspiracies, regardless of how little information or verifiable factual evidence is actually behind it (<em>Cough Pizzagate Cough</em>.) It&#39;s up the the reader to weigh up the arguments provided and judge themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I&#39;m a bit of a Trump fan but he&#39;s got big issues himself. If I read a conspiracy about him that seemed somewhat plausible, given the extreme prejudice against him and utterly excessive coverage elsewhere, I&#39;d still take a look and give it some thought. That said, if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> just regurgitates the anti-trump narrative on buzzfeed or Huffpost or Washington Post then it isn&#39;t useful either. My personal belief if is that conspiracy more likely resides within the State (CIA, NSA, security councils) as that is they are paid to be experts in, rather than with the tone-deaf, real-estate selling, reality TV star. I think you see a similar bias in many other readers/posters which is why it feels like it has Donald slant. When the MSM and establishment tone down the attacks and it&#39;s not interesting anymore this place will go back to what it was. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about where people&#39;s energy and excitement is these days. One can just scroll down. </p>

<p>Everyone, talk yourself off the edge, and surely don&#39;t go out on one because Buzzfeed (lol this is a joke like the Onion), CNN, whomever the highest paying org is paying tells you to get on that ledge and flail frenetically.</p>
