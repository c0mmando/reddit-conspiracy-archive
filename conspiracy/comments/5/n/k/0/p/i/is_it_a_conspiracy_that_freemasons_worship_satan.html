Taxil later admitted that it was all made up, but the damage was done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;dd say solid advice for anyone venturing into conspiracies: personally define what fact means for you.</p>

<p>Officially, nothing can be concidered fact unless an official (oftentimes) scientific institution claims it so. So what are some of the official claims on topics I&#39;ve recently seen passed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obama&#39;s birth certificate is real.</li>
<li>The Holocaust happened.</li>
<li>The Earth is a round ball spinning in space.</li>
<li>Chemtrails don&#39;t exist.</li>
<li>Pizzagate is an internet hoax.</li>
<li>Fake News rigging the election is a thing.</li>
<li>The White Helmets are a peacefull, non-armed humanitarian aid group in Syria.</li>
<li>Terrorists did 9/11.
...</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming any of these to be truth or false, but if you&#39;re looking for what is &quot;officially&quot; concidered fact, all of these should be concidered true.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;ve listed enough to illustrate that by definition, a conspiracy theory questions the official narrative. If you believe any of the statements I&#39;ve listed above to be false, you automatically have to assume that &quot;some powers&quot; took hold of the official narrative to fit their agenda.</p>

<p>As for the actual question u asked:</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read/watched on the subject:</p>

<p>Alot of the illuminati (freemason whatever) symbolism traces back to ancient Egypt/Sumer. Baphomet (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet</a>) can be traced back to an Egyptian God, as can many of the &quot;satanistic&quot; rituals be traced back to Egyptian or Sumerian rituals.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit lazy trying to find the exact documentaries I&#39;ve watched (which provided good &quot;evidence&quot; to see the analogies between everything occult and ancient civilizations). So if you want, I can list em here later.</p>

<p>TL:DR;</p>

<p>Be sceptical of even what is concidered &quot;scientific fact&quot;. Alot (most) of the occult symbolism and ideology stems from Ancient Egypt/Sumer. They don&#39;t worship Satan, as in the all-evil being we know from the bible, I&#39;m not even sure they believe God/Satan exist, but rather good/evil in an eternal balance.</p>

Anything they believe in is of this world and all the symbols and mysticism is related to their culture and history.  There is no &quot;power&quot; in the symbols themselves.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not have the information to answer your question, but I want to bring up something about your post.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a <strong>conspiracy</strong> that freemasons worship satan, or is it a <strong>fact</strong>?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Conspiracy</strong> or <strong>fact</strong>?</p>

<p>The verbal dichotomy you&#39;ve established implies that factuality and allegations of conspiracy are mutually exclusive. You&#39;re using the word conspiracy as a synonym for fantasy. That is not what the word means.</p>

<p>From the sidebar: Conspiracy—A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.</p>

<p>A conspiracy may be real or it may be imagined and often researchers cannot verify with 100% certainty which. That is why you often see the word &quot;theory&quot; following &quot;conspiracy&quot;. None of this has anything to do with the veracity, truthfulness, reality of whatever is being proposed, that&#39;s a whole different qualitative aspect.</p>

<p>One can hardly blame you, though—the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; was coined by the FBI as a derogatory, catch-all term for anyone who had doubts/questions about the official narrative surrounding the Kennedy assassination.</p>

<p>Language is instrumental in how we construct our thoughts, relate to the world around us, and bestow meaning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of connections between high-level Freemasonry and Luciferian worship, due to Lucifer&#39;s symbolization of truth, knowledge, &quot;light&quot;, and giving humanity a gift at his own expense. Lucifer is not directly connected to Satan, and the idea of Satan itself is a relatively new construct so I would look further back to Saturn, Baal, Beelzebub worship (especially in Caananite, Roman, Khazarian contexts). Freemasonry itself has a lot of carefully constructed &quot;myths and allegories&quot; which seem very innocent at first (ie. Hiram Abiff) but have implications against the beliefs of Christianity for example. At the higher levels, &quot;keys&quot; can be revealed which show how there is another way to interpret the story, or additional information/allegory to be revealed, sometimes revealing a more controversial truth underneath.</p>

<p>This is something common in how most secret societies operate. They keep making ever-changing promises, making you more committed and locked in to the whole charade, and then revealing that details they drew you in with were not the entire truth. </p>

<p>This is what keeps me most skeptical about the high levels. Freemasonry and Catholicism had a large schism for quite some time, and I would consider the Catholic 9th circle to be much more sinister, but most of these organizations are just varying styles of Kabaalistic power-seekers who choose varying shades of good/bad to follow. Freemasonry itself isn&#39;t inherently evil, but it is part of a dangerous sort of game that can promise big rewards with evil deeds (right vs. left hand path sort of stuff).</p>

<p>TL;DR it&#39;s more about worshipping Lucifer, who is not as bad of a dude as satan per-se, and at the high levels is quite incompatible with some religions, but involves a fair amount of choice based on the individual&#39;s choices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Jordan Maxwell is to be believed Saturn is Satan. Its just a perverted pronunciation. Words change over time thanks to dialect and accent. Murder used to murther, but obviously English people probably pronounced it as murter ( the name Thomas is a clue on this, also the river Thames, etc ) and softened the T sound, this murder is now the word. </p>
