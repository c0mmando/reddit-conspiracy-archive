       To clarify: most of it comes from a hoax known as the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxil_hoax">
        Taxil Hoax
       </a>
       , which made up lots of claims whole-cloth in an effort to gain press and bait the Catholic Church. Taxil later admitted that it was all made up, but the damage was done.

       Later hoaxes layered on top of the Taxil Hoax (such as the

       I was 3rd Degree Freemason and 32 degree scottish rite.  I quit because I became an atheist and in good conscience not stay.  It requires you have a higher power belief.  Most Brothers I know are very agnostic but do enjoy the esoteric side but most really enjoy the fellowship and camaraderie

       If Jordan Maxwell is to be believed Saturn is Satan. Its just a perverted pronunciation. Words change over time thanks to dialect and accent. Murder used to murther, but obviously English people probably pronounced it as murter ( the name Thomas is a clue on this, also the river Thames, etc ) and softened the T sound, this murder is now the word.

       We do pray multiple times per meeting but when we pray it is to just the general names of Deity. "God" "Grand Architect of the Universe" or "Deity". It is basically our way of praying that allows people of all religions to participate. (rather than praying to Jesus or any other specific religious figure.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Might as well be praying to "insert name here".

       Why don't you answer this though: the top grand masons, who are they? And what agenda do they push for in freemasonry? And what religion do the top of the top practice? Does it start to concentrate to a certain religion the further you go?

       You don't get any "higher" than the state level. You can go to the "Officers" section of each of these pages and see the men who were elected for this year. They are the "top grand masons".

       There are a FEW sects of actual "Satan" worshippers, but there a sliver of a sliver of the populace. Le vey satanism is not devil worship.

       "Conspiracy theory" should be in your title. A conspiracy implies that it is proven already and indeed fact. Conspiracy theories and conspiracies are 2 different things

       I'dd say solid advice for anyone venturing into conspiracies: personally define what fact means for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officially, nothing can be concidered fact unless an official (oftentimes) scientific institution claims it so. So what are some of the official claims on topics I've recently seen passed:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Obama's birth certificate is real.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Holocaust happened.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Earth is a round ball spinning in space.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chemtrails don't exist.
       </li>
       <li>
        Pizzagate is an internet hoax.
       </li>
       <li>
        Fake News rigging the election is a thing.
       </li>
       <li>
        The White Helmets are a peacefull, non-armed humanitarian aid group in Syria.
       </li>
       <li>
        Terrorists did 9/11.
...
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not claiming any of these to be truth or false, but if you're looking for what is "officially" concidered fact, all of these should be concidered true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I've listed enough to illustrate that by definition, a conspiracy theory questions the official narrative. If you believe any of the statements I've listed above to be false, you automatically have to assume that "some powers" took hold of the official narrative to fit their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the actual question u asked:
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've read/watched on the subject:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of the illuminati (freemason whatever) symbolism traces back to ancient Egypt/Sumer. Baphomet (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet
       </a>
       ) can be traced back to an Egyptian God, as can many of the "satanistic" rituals be traced back to Egyptian or Sumerian rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a bit lazy trying to find the exact documentaries I've watched (which provided good "evidence" to see the analogies between everything occult and ancient civilizations). So if you want, I can list em here later.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR;
      </p>
      <p>
       Be sceptical of even what is concidered "scientific fact". Alot (most) of the occult symbolism and ideology stems from Ancient Egypt/Sumer. They don't worship Satan, as in the all-evil being we know from the bible, I'm not even sure they believe God/Satan exist, but rather good/evil in an eternal balance.

       I've known two freemasons in my life.  My father (who died some time ago) and a close family friend.  I was told by both that masons must believe in some kind of God.  My father was a mild Christian and my family friend is a devout Catholic. Any talk you hear about Freemasons worshipping satan or satanic symbols is completely false as far as I understand.  Anything they believe in is of this world and all the symbols and mysticism is related to their culture and history.  There is no "power" in the symbols themselves.

       According to him, no.  The freemasons do not interfere with religious practice or require you to accept an authority above God.

       Interesting.  Didn't know that one.  I can only say that not all Christians/Catholics do what the Pope says.  I can confirm my friend is a mason and I can confirm he's a practicing Catholic. Beyond that I don't have an explanation.

       "Is it a

       </strong>
       that freemasons worship satan, or is it a
       <strong>

      </p>
      <p>
       The verbal dichotomy you've established implies that factuality and allegations of conspiracy are mutually exclusive. You're using the word conspiracy as a synonym for fantasy. That is not what the word means.

      <p>
       From the sidebar: Conspiracy—A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy may be real or it may be imagined and often researchers cannot verify with 100% certainty which. That is why you often see the word "theory" following "conspiracy". None of this has anything to do with the veracity, truthfulness, reality of whatever is being proposed, that's a whole different qualitative aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can hardly blame you, though—the term "conspiracy theory" was coined by the FBI as a derogatory, catch-all term for anyone who had doubts/questions about the official narrative surrounding the Kennedy assassination.

       There is a lot of connections between high-level Freemasonry and Luciferian worship, due to Lucifer's symbolization of truth, knowledge, "light", and giving humanity a gift at his own expense. Lucifer is not directly connected to Satan, and the idea of Satan itself is a relatively new construct so I would look further back to Saturn, Baal, Beelzebub worship (especially in Caananite, Roman, Khazarian contexts). Freemasonry itself has a lot of carefully constructed "myths and allegories" which seem very innocent at first (ie. Hiram Abiff) but have implications against the beliefs of Christianity for example. At the higher levels, "keys" can be revealed which show how there is another way to interpret the story, or additional information/allegory to be revealed, sometimes revealing a more controversial truth underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something common in how most secret societies operate. They keep making ever-changing promises, making you more committed and locked in to the whole charade, and then revealing that details they drew you in with were not the entire truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what keeps me most skeptical about the high levels. Freemasonry and Catholicism had a large schism for quite some time, and I would consider the Catholic 9th circle to be much more sinister, but most of these organizations are just varying styles of Kabaalistic power-seekers who choose varying shades of good/bad to follow. Freemasonry itself isn't inherently evil, but it is part of a dangerous sort of game that can promise big rewards with evil deeds (right vs. left hand path sort of stuff).
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR it's more about worshipping Lucifer, who is not as bad of a dude as satan per-se, and at the high levels is quite incompatible with some religions, but involves a fair amount of choice based on the individual's choices.

       If Jordan Maxwell is to be believed Saturn is Satan. Its just a perverted pronunciation. Words change over time thanks to dialect and accent. Murder used to murther, but obviously English people probably pronounced it as murter ( the name Thomas is a clue on this, also the river Thames, etc ) and softened the T sound, this murder is now the word.
