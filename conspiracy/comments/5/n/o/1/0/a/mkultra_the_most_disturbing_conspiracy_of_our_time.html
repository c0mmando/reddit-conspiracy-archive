        <strong>
         What is MKUltra?
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Project MKUltra – sometimes referred to as the CIA's mind control program – is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects, at times illegal, designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.[1] Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. Organized through the Scientific Intelligence Division of the CIA, the project coordinated with the Special Operations Division of the U.S. Army's Chemical Corps.[2]
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Why is this important?
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well for starters, it was ETREMELY illegal. Our own government targeted
       <strong>
        unwitting
       </strong>
       participants for their experimentation. AKA, the CIA gave drugs to people without their consent.
      </p>

        <strong>
         I don't believe you
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay, well from Wikipedia: 
In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest.
       <strong>
        While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent
       </strong>
       , U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.[80]

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Okay so why does this even matter? The program ended in 1973.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well it is extremely plausible that these CIA experiments are still going on. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         What is even your point with all of this?

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Esteban Santiago killed 5 people at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. He reported that the CIA was telling him to watch ISIS videos. That is extremely strange.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Okay so he's a lunatic. All of these mentally ill shooters need professional help.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, Esteban Santiago,
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       seek professional help, he sought the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
      </p>
      <p>
       Santiago, who served as a combat engineer in the National Guard in Puerto Rico and Alaska, was discharged from service last year for unsatisfactory performance. Santiago was reported for several infractions like AWOLs, or absences without leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       During Santiago's time with the Puerto Rico National Guard, he was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011. The U.S. pulled troops from the country at the end of that year.
      </p>
      <p>
       His aunt, Maria Ruiz Rivera, tells The Record of New Jersey that after he returned, she noticed changes in his mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       "He lost his mind," Ruiz Rivera told the newspaper in Spanish. "He said he saw things."
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the course of 2016, Santiago was repeatedly reported to Anchorage police for physical disturbances, according to the city's police chief, Christopher Tolley — including two separate reports of domestic violence and strangulation in October last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next month, Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage "to report that his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency," said FBI special agent Marlin Ritzman, at a Saturday press conference. Tolley described them as "terroristic thoughts," in which "he believed he was being influenced by ISIS."

      <p>
       My point is that this is not the first instance of a shooter meeting with the FBI prior to carrying out their attack. If someone would be kind enough to find a source for me, that would be great. Something about 12 lone wolves meeting with FBI.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Okay that's a little spooky, what can we do about MKUltra? What is their end goal?

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Spread the word to everyone you know. Become aware of your consciousness and protect it. Their end goal is to take away our guns and to achieve the New World Order. These are evil forces we are dealing with. Godspeed.

       I read an article a few days ago (can't find it dammit) that listed a handful of "domestic terrorists" that reported hearing voices prior to the incidents. I was reading on v2k tech and electronic harassment. Spooky stuff. I'll edit if I can find it.

       The Kalamazoo shootings were mentioned in the original article I read but that was a little more on the "crazy" side. Will try to remember the others. Was also researching TAMI (thought amplifier and memory interface) in addition to v2k and electronic stalking/harassment. Somewhere to start at least

       Other countries have similar technology that the CIA has. So it very well could be foreign influence. Point is, many signs lead to domestic (or foreign)
       <strong>
        mind control
       </strong>
       . Which I am not okay with. Fair point though.

       If you're going to plant a shooter, and want to throw people as far off of your trail as possible, what do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I say you have that mofo go out and create an official record of psychotic thoughts/behavior.  You have him talk to a government agency.  That is guaranteed to create a paper trail suggesting schizophrenia or some other mental disorder, hell maybe even have him talk about mind-control to throw off the fringe-theory people.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people look into this guy's back-ground those two actions (walking into the FBI and reporting "hearing voices") are going to stick out like a sore thumb and distract from anything that might point to an outside (foreign) group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's that's happened.  I'm just saying its much more plausible than a mind-control induced shooting rampage that achieves no
       <em>
        domestic
       </em>
       political goals.

       People are going to think I'm off the wagon. But here is what's going on. I'll be amazed if this comment even stays up. MKUltra is very real. In fact it's only the tip of the iceberg. The first thing people need to understand is that MKUltra is only one of many tools they use for mind control. Electronic harassment is their go to right now. Basically, they have weaponized sound to the point in which they can influence your brain activity. They use satellites to bounce the signals onto targets. If you think it's bogus go look it up. There are multiple organizations mostly in the EU who are trying to add it to the Geneva conventions list of banned weapons of war. Depending on what they want. Stimulus they create will vary. They also have "psychic spooks" who they pay to mentally assault and coerce targets. They also use them to pin point targets who have figured out how to hide by going off the grid. The NWO is extremely powerful at this current junction. "Evil forces" doesn't even begin to describe these beings. And I say beings because a lot of them have sold their humanity away long ago. Now let's talk about how to protect yourself. Having a disciplined mind is key. But even through advanced meditation alone you would stand very little chance against their telepaths. If you find yourself in a situation where you are face to face with a psychic attacker it's best to not fight. Unless you are highly trained you're just going to cause more damage to your brain. Even expertly trained individuals have a less than 5% chance of resisting. Now if you are being psychically attacked from afar your chances go way up. Especially if you know this following information. Pure gold can protect you. The more of it the better. The key is to cover certain key chakras. (I can hear all the pseudoscience deniers scoffing. Just STFU and listen to the rest of what I have to say) The most important chakras to cover go in this order: throat, heart, and root. All the chakras can be used as attack points. However those three are the most vulnerable. This has been known for thousands of years. Why do you think important people in ancient Egypt wore gold. It was to protect themselves from the supernatural and psychic assaults. I'm not going to get into semantics. Throat chakra is the toughest to cover, because you need a lot of gold. A gold chain choker is ok, not ideal. Ideally you want a gold bangle choker or a thick gold ring or rings covering your neck just below the adam's apple. Heart relatively easy to cover just wear a pure gold pendant, cross, whatever. The design doesn't hold power it's the material. Make sure it's  resting on or slightly above your heart. The root chakra is easy to block as well, wear a pure gold belt buckle the  bigger the better. I would also recommend gold rings, ear studs, any body jewelry really long as it's gold. Also it's expensive but gold bracers and or wrist bangles. Also wearing them around the ankles helps block the solar chakra. Now before you laugh off what I'm telling you here. Take moment and think about what the NWO has been doing with their little shadow government cabals. Gold hoarding. Cash for gold, most companies out there who are buying up gold are directly working with NWO. They have been doing it for years. Trying to get as much gold off the market as possible. Why? Multiple reasons, the one we are concerned about is as stated above. The time has come to open your mind. Closed mindedness and skepticism is what they are counting on. Don't close mental doorways that could save your life.

       I have purchased nano silver as well as made my own nano silver by soaking sterling silver jewelry in water for 20 days and shaking the jar daily. Then I poured it into a spray bottle and added essential oils of holy basil, frankincense and saffron. I spray my head and candles.

       Yes, when I say off the grid I mean away from cities and power lines. Basically into rural areas or heavy woodlands. Homeopathic gold also works. It is expensive but effective. Long as you keep up a steady dosage. I would not however rely on it alone. Silver does grant protection. But mostly from the paranormal. Ghosts, demons, ethereal beings, and non-physical entities. Wearing gold anklets block the solar chakra because a lot of the bodies toxins come out of  the pours on our feet. When this happens that chakra becomes vulnerable.

       Imo that is what pizagate is,  its mkultra selection process also imo most political leaders,  superstar mainstream musicians, famous actors,  captains of industry are victims /participants so they can be used to sway public opinion or make economic benefits or  follow what ever orders . That is why so much pedophiles in Hollywood and rich person land. Sure you may have the odd terrorist but that's small fry,  we have plenty of people in Arabia Africa Asia  that would gladly do terrorism if given  the opportunity.  Imagine you had a Katy Perry or a meryl streep as your mouth piece to help get your chosen sympathetic to your cause to shill your politician into power,  now imagine you had them all,  that is pretty much what we just saw in the recent election pretty much uniform obedience and shilling for their  choose candidate.  I think they learned  their lesson with jfk,  why bother mkultra sum random assassins too risky,  music and art (thought leaders) are much more powerful "the 60s man" don't let them ruin your Vietnam party again. K done enjoy the chow down on my word  vomit.

       the Dutroux case had a lot of hallmarks of an MKULTRA ring as well. If you get into the details a lot of the witnesses who had come forward had the same dissociative identity disorder profile and described the same sorts of things going on with other victims.
