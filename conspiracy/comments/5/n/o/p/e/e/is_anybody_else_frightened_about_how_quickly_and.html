    <div class="md"><p>Music is a very important aspect of the &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot;...  just as dangerous at spreading the truth and subverting the mainstream media as the internet is now... Devo&#39;s musical style might not appeal to a lot of people... but the messages they tuck into nearly every song are really strong... and not partisan. The album they dropped a few years was genius. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQJHBhwK_sE">Devo - Sumthin&#39;</a> is pretty overtly political... calling out Obama for pandering on a global scale... but usually they are much more subtle. </p>

<p>Ill be somewhere with her, she&#39;ll ask what I&#39;m reading on my phone, and I&#39;ll be like &#39;UN reports from what happened this week in Syria&#39; she almost gets offended, like &#39;like how can you sit there and read that depressing stuff. Isn&#39;t there something better you could be learning about&#39; and to explain to her I like understanding why and what is going on in the world, she&#39;s like why?

It is important because the lie affects your life (e.g. your labor is looted and used to bomb brown people).

    <div class="md"><p>Yea i feel yea..makes sense, just idk seems like alot of people, not even just her fine living in their own state of ignorance, as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with their peaceful, content life, it doesn&#39;t effect. 
During the election I was excitable for like 2 months. And a majority of people, peers included, where basically why put so much effort into American politics. And honestly it feels like this a drastic changing point in the world. Like not to sound all mellow dramatic, but it feels like, nothing is going to be the same from here on out. </p>

<p>And to me that&#39;s something to understand. But again I&#39;m always met around here with basically &#39;yea it&#39;s good you wanna understand but what difference does it make&#39; </p>

<p>And honestly it won&#39;t make a stitch of difference. But my &#39;desire&#39; to understand even though the level of impact I&#39;m able to contribute is basically next to nothing. Im almost positive a majority of my friends on Facebook, haven&#39;t unfriended me, but have unfollowed. </p>

<p>I guess in my personal experience, for me, people try ridiculously hard avoid the issues that effect us all.
And it&#39;s not like I push my opinion or knowledge on anyone. Actually the last Idk year or so, I literally try not to get in serious discussions. I feel like I&#39;m bothering or bugging when I talk or bring something up. And it&#39;s not like I talk about a reptilian takeover. Or Mk ultra. With my  peeps, if I even do bring up anything it&#39;s always a mild form of what issues are taking place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I very much identify with this post. Almost Eerily so. I have been almost to the point of frustration that nobody cares... but that is wasted energy. What matters is loving the people you love very much, and never getting distracted from that or letting any of the many distractions these days take your time from those people.</p>

<p>Because (I&#39;m gonna sound like a fucking hippy) that love directly pushes against the evil forces that have taken over certain branches of government. Redpill, argue with, inform strangers if you feel the need to redpill.. But leave it be for people you love. Best thing you can do is love them and help them see things for what they are after they sense bullshit on their own. very hard to convince people something they believe is wrong, moreso that it&#39;s a lie or a high level plan. </p>

<p>Good luck brother </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, to your question, this is a new form of coordinated propaganda. Degree-2 propaganda, i.e. propaganda that isn&#39;t meant to be believed. It reinforces existing cognitive biaises, polarizes the field even more. At the very least it is meant to divide (and conquer). It is more likely this is an elaborate psyop, to prepare, mould the public, for some coming event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like you and your mom are about to travel the planet and fix it.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s not interested.  She feels it&#39;s futile and because of that she doesn&#39;t want to put herself through unnecessary strain trying to accomplish things she ultimately knows are in vain.  It&#39;s like watching a live stream of someone slowly getting run over by a train.  You can&#39;t fucking go stop it so why fret about it (her pov).</p>

<p>Or she&#39;s completely naive and doesn&#39;t care.  Either way there&#39;s no point in jerking her around subjects she doesn&#39;t care/cant/doesn&#39;t want to fathom.  Just hit the key points and use them as discussion topics.</p>

<p>You did set a bit of a scene for me to pick through.  I think she&#39;s upset because she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s close to you.  You are on an errand together and she&#39;s upset that you&#39;re putting so much attention into your phone.  An errand I&#39;ll go ahead and assume was your moms idea.  An errand that she was probably only looking forward to interacting with you during it.  From her perspective it doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s on the phone.  If anything you&#39;re gonna be met with animosity towards it because she won&#39;t want to give up her angry feelings towards what&#39;s distracting you.</p>

<p>We all see life from a mile back in our own heads; completely blind to anything that could happen outside of your own thought.</p>

<p>You think your mom is being naive but perhaps this is how she&#39;s learnt to deal with the bullshit world we live in.    I&#39;m not saying that naivety is strength, I&#39;m saying that these old people have been down this road and should be treated with respect if we&#39;re gonna convince them to pull their heads outta their asses.  Be selective with the info you try and share.  You&#39;ve gotta break that bubble using it&#39;s weak points. (ie obvious bs in mainstream narrative)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo.  I don&#39;t wanna make everything sound futile but all we can really do here is spread awareness.  If someone decides they don&#39;t wanna even hear the crap anymore I don&#39;t blame them.   On the other hand it looks like our awareness spreading may actually be starting to have an effect.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot to handle on top of every day life and every day problems. For me these are a part of my every day problems. </p>

<p>I wonder if it&#39;s been designed such that people have every day problems, thus preventing them from discovering any inconvenient truths? Almost certainly. If you consider how far technology and economics have come in the past 50 years how are people still working 40+ hour weeks, or unemployed or poor for that matter? Given our technology and gifts of Earth our abundance of resources should be almost infinite although for some reason we perceive it as being scarce. Perhaps our overlords squander many resources inorder to keep this tight grip on us. </p>

<p>But I digress. You can&#39;t redpill people really, you can only guide them. </p>

<p>Ask yourself how it benefits America to ‘destabilise’ the Middle East? </p>

<p>What does benefit America (who no doubt <em>did</em> encourage and hep create the Arab Spring) is a <em>stable</em> friendly ‘Democracy’ or something that looks closely like one.</p>

<p>Not rampant civil wars and internal strife, we want our stolen oil and natural resources cheap and easy to access, not in the middle of a war zone.</p>

<p>Exactly, so when an area is destabilized it is easier for multinationationals to extract resources at a discount. Take Iran for example; in the 50&#39;s they had a strong nationalistic democracy that wanted to nationalize what was then BP&#39;s oil interest in the country. Cue the CIA fomenting a coup and installing the Shah of Iran. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a great documentary on youtube called &quot;Stories of an Economic Hitmen&quot; (think that&#39;s the title) that details the process.</p>

<p>1) Destabilize country 2) install easily corruptible, friendly dictator 3) extract resources at a discount</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like at this point, especially with this sub in particular I don&#39;t think it matters as much. A lot of the people on this sub are woke and are seeing through the bullshit. When you&#39;re woke you don&#39;t go back to sleepwalking after that, so we all see right through it and call out the shills and continue searching for the truth. So it is our job to try and spread the word now through what we have come to learn ourselves. The more people awakened the closer we are to beating them </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot to handle on top of every day life and every day problems. For me these are a part of my every day problems. </p>

<p>I wonder if it&#39;s been designed such that people have every day problems, thus preventing them from discovering any inconvenient truths? Almost certainly. If you consider how far technology and economics have come in the past 50 years how are people still working 40+ hour weeks, or unemployed or poor for that matter? Given our technology and gifts of Earth our abundance of resources should be almost infinite although for some reason we perceive it as being scarce. Perhaps our overlords squander many resources inorder to keep this tight grip on us. </p>

<p>But I digress. You can&#39;t redpill people really, you can only guide them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, to your question, this is a new form of coordinated propaganda. Degree-2 propaganda, i.e. propaganda that isn&#39;t meant to be believed. It reinforces existing cognitive biaises, polarizes the field even more. At the very least it is meant to divide (and conquer). It is more likely this is an elaborate psyop, to prepare, mould the public, for some coming event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like you and your mom are about to travel the planet and fix it.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s not interested.  She feels it&#39;s futile and because of that she doesn&#39;t want to put herself through unnecessary strain trying to accomplish things she ultimately knows are in vain.  It&#39;s like watching a live stream of someone slowly getting run over by a train.  You can&#39;t fucking go stop it so why fret about it (her pov).</p>

<p>Or she&#39;s completely naive and doesn&#39;t care.  Either way there&#39;s no point in jerking her around subjects she doesn&#39;t care/cant/doesn&#39;t want to fathom.  Just hit the key points and use them as discussion topics.</p>

<p>You did set a bit of a scene for me to pick through.  I think she&#39;s upset because she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s close to you.  You are on an errand together and she&#39;s upset that you&#39;re putting so much attention into your phone.  An errand I&#39;ll go ahead and assume was your moms idea.  An errand that she was probably only looking forward to interacting with you during it.  From her perspective it doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s on the phone.  If anything you&#39;re gonna be met with animosity towards it because she won&#39;t want to give up her angry feelings towards what&#39;s distracting you.</p>

<p>We all see life from a mile back in our own heads; completely blind to anything that could happen outside of your own thought.</p>

<p>You think your mom is being naive but perhaps this is how she&#39;s learnt to deal with the bullshit world we live in.    I&#39;m not saying that naivety is strength, I&#39;m saying that these old people have been down this road and should be treated with respect if we&#39;re gonna convince them to pull their heads outta their asses.  Be selective with the info you try and share.  You&#39;ve gotta break that bubble using it&#39;s weak points. (ie obvious bs in mainstream narrative)</p>

<p>Here in Canada, people are happy living in their bubble. And will almost flat out tell you that.
For instance, my mom won&#39;t watch news that&#39;s not happy. And if I causally mention something, Syria, or trump, or sometimes even just regular politics, she&#39;s not having it.</p>
