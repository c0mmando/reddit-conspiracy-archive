       Pizzagate is a distraction from the us government using child trafficking to fund black ops and put out a lot of disinformation about it, give it a stupid name and a political narrative. And call it fake news. ... lmao any other questions?

       The use of it for blackmail is a very small piece of the proverbial (pizza) pie.... it's way bigger than that but don't take my word for it. .. just Google world wide trafficking statistics. ... all that money why wouldn't our government be involved?

       I think this sort of thing says less about Joe Biden and more about the people who watch that clip and immediately assume "Pedophile!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the interest of fairness I welcome anyone to point me in the direction of any similar pedophile allegations being leveled at
       <em>
        literally any conservative
       </em>
       currently active in government.

       I don't watch one video and imeditlly assume "pedophile!". I've seen multple different videos of multple angles of either Joe biden being extremely weird with children at senate swear in's, even so much as people picking up what he whispers in chidlrens ears. Multiple other of him either going behind women and innaporoitle squeezing/rubbing their shoulders to the point where obama even makes fun of him about it in speeches and Obama has also made weird innuendos of "them getting so close to each other they don't even let them eat pizza together" in some city (i forget which one) that had some ban on homosexuality (summary the situation)

       No, he doesn't count at all because I asked for an
       <em>
        active
       </em>
       conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically because you guys can only point to Dennis Hastert whenever I bring this question up. On that subject I'll just cut and reply my response:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On May 29, 2015, after Hastert had been indicted for illicitly "structuring" financial transactions (see below), two people briefed on the evidence from the case stated that "Individual A"—the man to whom Hastert was making payments—had been sexually abused by Hastert during Hastert's time as a teacher and coach at Yorkville High School, and that Hastert had paid $1.7 million out of the total $3.5 million in promised payment.[14] On the same day, the Los Angeles Times reported that investigators had spoken with a second former student (not the person who was receiving payments from Hastert), who made similar allegations that corroborated what the first student said.[15]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He was outed by the people he molested. Not any investigations done by the internet or anything even vaguely relating to Pizzagate, but nice try.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your word-wall is nothing but speculation that, again, says more about you than it does about Biden. That you take awkward photo-ops and jump to "pedophile" is quite the mental leap to make and you either have some issues of your own to work out, or you're just trying to push tired right-wing rhetoric.

       Joe Biden isn't inappropriate with young girls. You watch videos of photo-ops and jump to that conclusion. I wonder why that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually the biggest homophobes end up being gay themselves. So I have to wonder, based on the same amount of evidence you guys use, are you ever inappropriate with young girls?

       That has nothing to with what I said and i'm actually not even sure what your trying to say. But from the jist of it I can assume that you've already made your mind up, it was only a suggestion that maybe people should take off their partisan colored glasses using history as an example.

       And i'm just saying that from some clips of a guy you don't even know you were able to come to the conclusion that he is a pedophile. That seems like a huge leap in logic there are numerous reasons why he could be a touchy guy but you immediately jump to the absolute worst and treat it as fact. Forgive me if I assumed wrong but for me it seems like there must be a preconceived bias for someone to come to such an extreme and absolute conclusion with almost no "evidence" whatsoever.

       Compared to the "McCarthyism" when the Dems just paint anyone  who doesnt agree with their narrative as "Russia supporters"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even try using that word when the MSM has done nothing but push this unfounded narrative since election day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM has basically been saying "Trump is with Russia. We have evidence. Can you see it? Don't worry, we are cooking something up" since his election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. If it is true? And they've held onto this data and KNEW since before election day and didn't tell us? Is that not in itself treasonous? What was their game plan? An attempted coup such as this? Not releasing that information and waiting til this moment to take action? Maybe put Pence in instead of Trump? Back to establishment as usual?
      </p>
      <p>
       In short... NONE of them have your interests at heart.

       Do you watch any media on television or pop culture. They're praised and "given a break" almost all the time. Sorry I criticize our government, especially one that has been at war his entire 2 terms, killed children, expanded the drone program, prosecuted more whisteblowers than past presidents combined and much much more (like doing absolutely nothing his last year other than campaign for Hillary only to lose and make an entire mess out of our election with help of the media and to jump start cold war tensions with a super power) just to name a few... such nice people who deserve a break. They are the highest officials of the government, they deserve criticism, no matter what party is in power.

       There are many!  Just check out Biden senate swearing in videos.  It is creepy to the point you know his advisers tell him to stop asking EVERY FUcKINg girl under 17 how old she is.  There is a pattern and a focus to him.m and it isn't something you would want around the girls in your family.

       Some of those things you mentioned are very important like Hollow Earth, Antarctica, and Ufo's (&lt;--
       <em>
        this one being the most important out of those 3
       </em>
       ). 9/11 is not even on the same scale of importance and Nibiru is just silly (
       <em>
        I can go into why later but the most important thing is that it simply isn't relevant to changing the world
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       These 3 things all revolve around a single thing though, and that thing is Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis is the key to defeating the elite and their completely negative global system of control and oppression that has humanity in shackles.

        This

       comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow "spiritually" minded.

       This is great, thank you. I've been looking for some Atlantis specific information recently. I'm going to devote some time this weekend to read through the links you sent.

       That is exactly what you should do, and please study them so you can understand the connections made and the logic used and that will enable you to truly understand the topic and appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then once you understand all of that you can and should start threads on Atlantis specifically and post comments and links in your thread to my posts. You also should research on the internet, mainly for hidden rediscoveries of different parts of Atlantis since most of the other important stuff has been covered in my posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have done that your biggest contribution can and should be to get involved with the rediscovery of Atlantis and getting involved with people like
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s0T-xIOaWBM">
        Dr. Greg Little
       </a>
       and to help fund these people, and hopefully  eventually start an expedition yourself with people from here near you or others who you have shown my posts to and who question the narrative and system of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them you absolutely can and need to disseminate the rediscoveries of Atlantis everywhere you can, especially on the internet. That will be the catalyst that will destroy the narrative of the elite, and by extension their system of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to top it all off you can and should encourage others to do all of these things I'm encouraging you to do, and to tell those people to encourage others to so the same things and encourage even more people etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will create a snowball effect that will truly speed up the process of changing the world

       Pedophiles exist in every social circle, not just among the "elite". You're accusing a man, not just accusing but presenting "evidence", that is purely speculation. You say the MSM is corrupt, that it presents a narrative that sheep follow, you're doing the exact same shit on reddit. Don't you see that? You are doing what you see as evil.

       I want to be ethical. To move, and prosecute, based on hard evidence. I want our media to be explicit in corroborated truth, and to shine with integrity and fact driven storytelling. And I want the world to reel in disgust when it isn't. And I want it to view your repugnant view of the world as false advertising, which it is.

       I've totally noticed this too. There were a lot of biden memes not too long ago being thrown around by instagram accounts - even popular ones like fatjewish - to try and hype him up for some reason (what has he even done the past 8 years by the way?).
      </p>
      <p>
       wouldn't put it past them to at least plant the seed for an operation like that. That fatjewish dude apparently has met with Obama as well, clearly has his own views he's promoting.

       I want to be ethical. To move, and prosecute, based on hard evidence. I want our media to be explicit in corroborated truth, and to shine with integrity and fact driven storytelling. And I want the world to reel in disgust when it isn't. And I want it to view your repugnant view of the world as false advertising, which it is.
