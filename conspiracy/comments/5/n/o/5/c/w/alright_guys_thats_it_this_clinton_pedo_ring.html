        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not an American but I am pretty much convinced with the Pizzagate theory,the links,the pegasus room,the murals,the signs,the connection,the money flow,PsyOP to discredit this &#39;fake news&#39;.</p>

<p>Those were the Pedophile code words in those email,people who have done some research over it have understood the hidden message,but when normies like me see those messages we think its a normal conversation,but when you stick those words to the alternate meaning of it,you see the big pictures.</p>

<p>I am demanding for a big organized PsyOP of ours which will result to mass awakening,we have to frame documentaries,like How would you convince a sane noob by arranging facts and details about this topic,we have to collectively work to improve the Pizzagate.wiki website.</p>

<p>We have to get the word out,there is so much activity regarding it that we but still the asshole cudly Joe makes it to the front page,this is the level of Propaganda the world is dealing with.</p>

<p>I belong to a industrial city of India,our city was formed because of a Steel company,my grandfather migrated there in 1930&#39;s and then he ran back to his village,when asked why? he said there is a secret sacrifice going on in there,my parents tell these stories and laugh it off thinking why would some rich people push the workers for the sake of &#39;ritual&#39;,after getting my internet connection I discovered how crazy these elites are they bow to Moloch and shit,bohemian grove.</p>

<p>My cousin roams around with a dollar note in his purse,I examined it,13 numerology everywhere and that creepy owl at the side,WTF!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s blow this thing wide open,lets create MEME,I have a class now but in 2 hours I will start engaging in making MEME&#39;s this thing has to go out,no mercy,they have took many children from our cities,from our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>To all those &#39;other country&#39; folks who don&#39;t belong to USA who lurk around thinking that Pizzagate exposing is the job of Americans,then you are wrong,its not about America,India or Britain.It&#39;s about the whole world,they have organization tied to every country,there are reports of NGO&#39;s interfering in these kind of shady deals abducting children from remote villages,they simply can&#39;t stop the world from sharing meme&#39;s with different hashtags.</p>

<p>Things I think should be important in creating a MEME army,we have to do some tavistock level research on how human perception works.</p>

<p>Firstly we have to create a Stickid post on MEME circulation.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have to work on the Pizzagate.wiki.</li>
<li>We have to add our own review on this topic to the some stickied margin of the Pizzagate.wiki page.</li>
<li>We have to stick the website name in Notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a story of a famous bogus words written in the notes 
<a href="http://www.news18.com/news/buzz/heres-why-sonam-gupta-bewafa-hai-is-trending-1312027.html">www.news18.com/news/buzz/heres-why-sonam-gupta-bewafa-hai-is-trending-1312027.html</a></p>

<p>it gone viral within no time,we can do that as well,everyone start writing this link on notes,on toilet of some bus stop we have to get the word out,we have to atleast let the people have a look at the resources.</p>

<p>Ok,its time I will join back in three hours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s different here in America, everyone knows there are pedophiles in government but no one seems to care. Also Americans are taught in school that they can be convicted of crimes they didn&#39;t commit by unreliable eyewitness testimony and about False Memory Syndrome a horrible disease that makes hundreds of schoolchildren simultaneously think they were subjected to satanic ritual abuse.</p>

1970&#39;s became involved in cash

worked in pizzerias controlled

<p>Isn&#39;t one of the claims of pizzagate that child sex slaves are also something they might put on the table when friends come over for a movie? Isn&#39;t casual sexual abuse &quot;mundane&quot; to them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks fart_in_a_sandstorm. I think meme-ing is an excellent idea. On facebook, twitter, in forums (even unrelated) -- to hopefully capture people&#39;s interest and then direct them to a noob friendly summary of the facts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been keeping up to speed with voat/pizzagate and I agree that the amount of circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. I think making fun of them is the best way to go. </p>

<p>This is an incredibly upsetting topic, but at the same time, these people are so disgusting and pathetic, it&#39;s absurd!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know my biggest issue with y&#39;all who completely spam this place with pizzagate isn&#39;t the obvious agenda or the fact that y&#39;all act like you have unearthed some huge revelation, or even that y&#39;all continually act like y&#39;all are fighting a hero&#39;s fight and will undoubtedly succeed against all odds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s how y&#39;all always bring up how one can not help but come to the same conclusion with &quot;research&quot; and those who disagree are monsters for supporting pedophilia because they haven&#39;t done their &quot;research&quot;.</p>

<p>The complete bastardization of such a scientific concept is what irks me. You can post endless walls of text and ridiculous amounts of links to images with arrows, memes with bold text and youtube videos of other &quot;researchers&quot;, but actual research involves actual work and actual evidence.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter anyway y&#39;all have made up y&#39;alls mind and convinced yourselves that anything &quot;strange&quot; (a subjective concept that&#39;s entirely unscientific) that you find immediately justifies your &quot;research&quot; and confirms your preconceived notions. </p>

<p>But i&#39;m sure you and your fellow &quot;researchers&quot; don&#39;t care, this place is no longer interested in being skeptical of something unless it adheres to a pro pizzagate, pro trump, ant Hillary or anti MSM narrative.</p>
