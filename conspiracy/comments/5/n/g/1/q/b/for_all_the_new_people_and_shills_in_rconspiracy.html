<p>If you want the whole story, start googling Christopher Steele and Orbis Business intelligence limited... but since you waited until today, you are going to have to wade through millions of hits to find information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there though? Not defending trump by any means, but it doesn&#39;t appear that he is doing much that any of these other politicians aren&#39;t doing - at least in regards to his money and what not. The whole serial Sex abuser thing is pretty bad, but that didn&#39;t seem to catch much traction. Yes he is a shifty person, but one shitty person can&#39;t really call out another shitty person without bringing attention to their own shittiness. I&#39;m wondering why, if there is so much stuff out there (which I am positive there is), isn&#39;t the media digging into him more about it. Maybe they&#39;re afraid of getting called out personally? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you honestly saying that most people do not have a preconception of Trump as a womanizing sleazeball?  Were you around in the 90&#39;s? </p>

<p>The fact is, most people who are not significantly left of center find the idea of peeing on someone profoundly non-evil or controversial.  Similarly, they would agree that many men most certainly do brag about their sexual proclivities in private with other men in order to assert an alpha persona.  It was locker-room talk in that sense to many, many people; the question of it was true or not was irrelevant once one can remember their buddies in the 5th grade whose balls hadn&#39;t dropped bragging about banging the substitute teacher.  Was it gross and if Trump had said that to a police officer at the time would there be grounds for a sexual assault investigation?  Most certainly.  But since that was not the case many would feel there is no need to harp on it any more.  </p>

<p>From the same perspective, kids do disappear, Clinton does have incredibly open and dubious dealings with various organizations through the Clinton Foundation involving tax payer and corporate money, did mediate arms deals with horrendous countries involving tax payer and corporate money, has flown on a plane with someone who was actually convicted of sexual assault, has a campaign manager/Sec. of State pick who is childhood friends with another sexual assault convict, and was extremely reckless and potentially dangerous with her communications and blatantly dishonest in her dealings with the fallout.  There is more than enough character evidence to warrant extreme scrutiny of those she holds company and their incredibly questionable, publicly available, personas.  And we were handed on a silver platter the means with which to do so, thanks to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>The sad part is, all of this is true for Trump too. His honesty, competence, business ties, relations and debts are all major alarms and should be the focus of as much vigorous investigation as Clinton&#39;s. But instead we&#39;re being fed, from those in authority rather than the people, a story of sexual perversion and then being chastised for not taking it as seriously as Hilary raping and eating kids in some ping pong arcade basement when that was <em>never the assertion</em>, let alone the core of the outrage the common voter had with what they read in her emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is actually a pretty reasonable post for this subreddit.  A few points of disagreement (or perhaps misunderstanding)</p>

<p>pretty much anyone left of center has essentially no problem with urine as a fetish, with the exception of some cases when it&#39;s used as an assertion of male power over females or wtv, but really the sex police are largely on the other side of the center, Ted Cruz types.  trump is interesting as a republican in that he largely repudiates this.  as for bragging, there is a profound difference between so-called locker room talk (&quot;haha that substitute totes montied my python&quot;) and bragging about sexual assault or harassment.  the former is maybe impolite but by no means dangerous, whereas the second one displays perhaps guilt of a felony but at the very least a profound disrespect for women as other human beings</p>

<p>as for the problems with Clinton, while everything you said was true, this is largely circumstantial.  If we look hard enough, we can find everyone is going to have close connections with predators if we look hard enough, especially when you&#39;re rich and powerful and doing these things is largely recoverable from.  but this certainly doesn&#39;t lead to the sort of conspiracy theories that we see now where podesta or clinton are directly involved at least in the coverup of ongoing rape of children.  as for the general dubiousness and irresponsibility that we found with clinton via the email leaks and russia hack, this is all very apparent, we&#39;ve been given an excellent pile of information, and it has been thoroughly reviewed by countless parties.  The fact that the worst of what has been found publicly is small-time corruption is honestly very surprising, as for a politician (and by extension, a wealthy person) of her stature and duration in the public-eye, i would expect far more.</p>

<p>regarding the stories for trump, you must remember that the primary goal of news establishments is not to spread the truth, but to put out entertaining news and garner readership.  in this way, &quot;trump is an evil rapist&quot; is a much better story than &quot;trump is a robber baron&quot;, even if the second one is realistically much more evident and relevant to the common interest.  the reason why clinton&#39;s mundane scandals saw such a greater focus in the election is that the media in aggregate generally paints a pretty even picture.  if politician A has fifty scandals and politician B has fifteen scandals, they are both going to have 30 stories run about them in time t, so the depth wherein these things are covered is going to vary.  it&#39;s a shame, but it&#39;s why we should be focusing as those who care enough to read the emails (that is, /not/ the common voter) on these things uninvestigated rather than the dead horses that we are currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither one has real evidence as of yet. I know which one is more plausible. Most of the early pizzagate &quot;evidence&quot; was pretty clearly fabricated but good luck trying to point any of that out. It has a mind of it&#39;s own now, generating it&#39;s own context and pre-determined endgame, continuing to shred the credibility of anyone yanked into the story. Bring up the word &quot;smear&quot; and you&#39;ll get waves of blowback and SHILLERY screams; bring up any of the Trump allegations and the word &quot;smear!&quot; will find you in seconds. </p>

<p>What&#39;s frustrating about the Russian and Putin stuff is that we really have no idea how things function there, while our new president is telling everyone to trust only him and the media that props him up. Is there even a law against colluding with a foreign government toward winning an election? He&#39;s a private citizen until the 20th. I&#39;m sure his army of lawyers are on the case, even if the whole thing&#39;s just a convincing, suspicion-confirming piece of fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because he needs to give the impression of being an outsider or else the globalists &quot;false prophet&quot; approach does not work. He needs to get our trust, the trust of real skeptical people within the conspiracy community like ourselves. </p>

<p>For example. Today when he called out buzz feed and CNN as fake news. I agree wholeheartedly! </p>

<p>However, I realize this is just a political move in his part to add to the impression that trump is anti establishment. He is not, he is an undercover puppet. You must realize this before it&#39;s too late. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and see your point, but compared to his enemies there hadn&#39;t been much of shocking value to be talked about in regards to The Donald beyond what you stated in half a sentence: that he is a billionaire conman. Everyone alive in the 90s knew that already. </p>

<p>Personally, I think he&#39;s a self-righteous asshole with an infinite ego, but also someone with a soft spot for what &quot;the American Dream&quot; once stood for. That does not mean he is in any way the right person for the job as the fucking POTUS. Politically, he&#39;s in way over his head. </p>

<p>I like to think he actually would sympathize with many here and would agree that the game would be much more fun if everyone was allowed to play in a truly open and efficient market kind of scenario, but I also get the sense he has not the slightest clue as to how to go about actually achieving something of that order.</p>

<p>By now, it seems he has backpaddled his &quot;ambitions&quot; enough in exchange for being allowed (to live on, as well as) to conduct a moderately successful &quot;mock&quot; presidency.</p>

<p>That to me seems the most logical big picture view of what&#39;s going on with Trump. If anything more sinister or incompetent comes up I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll know all about it first here, one way or another. In the meantime I just don&#39;t see the point of this daily false equivalency of &quot;Trump is bad too, why are we only talking about Democrats?&quot;. Because there is Data, that&#39;s basically why. And that&#39;s basically the whole difference. </p>

<p>None of them have experienced a life equivilant to the average American citizen&#39;s. This fact only compounds they&#39;re difficulty to empathize with the issues that we deal with daily. The fact that Trump is no different from the rest is not a controversial idea. We accept that fact because he was the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>Could Trump be successful at POTUS? Maybe, I have no idea. But at least we understand the kind of person Trump is. Until recently we had no idea of the extent of crimes against Hillary and friends there were.</p>

<p>The main reason you don&#39;t see much of a negative narrative about Trump on here is because the guy isn&#39;t even in the oval office yet. You gotta give him a chance to actually fuck up something before you can start criticizing. </p>

<p>He surprised them. They exist and are very powerful but relied on influence peddling.</p>

<p>If it is true Russia helped Trump win, this is even more evidence Trump is anti establishment because the establishment is anti Russia. This is because Putin actively works, not for our freedom but for Russia&#39;s freedom, and if Americans are completely dominated by the pedophile elites it is harder for Russia to remain free and their children safe from the Clinton Foundation mollestors.</p>

<p>If Russia did hack or expose or assist Trump in any way then I thank them from the bottom of my heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I guess that could be phrased better. Certainly you can be anti Russian for other reasons, however the establishment is also anti Russian so they would be aligned on this viewpoint.</p>

<p>The danger is that there must be a reason the establishment is against Russia. I believe it is because of Putin&#39;s great success in putting down the establishment in Russia. The elites thought they were going to break up the federation and exploit its people and resources, and Putin played them like children. Played the entire NWO and now they are terrified of him. He is like a modern day Alexander The Great. Putin is a black swan even that they could not account for in their models. This is why they are bending the west to destroy him and Russia.</p>

<p>Putin is saving the Russians from the NWO. Made Russia great again. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Trump is our Putin, he is not smart enough, but at least he might try to emulate him. Make America great again. Allied with Russia we could go to the stars.</p>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t Putin be opposing the NWO for the same reason every sane person would? To prevent the exploitation of his people?</p>

<p>I mean I could be wrong but he has consistently acted in the best interests of Russia and the majority of Russians. If he was just another NWO type the mask would slip occasionally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin was a brilliant KGB operative who was tapped by the sell out Yeltsin. Yeltsin in case you don&#39;t remember was bending over for NATO and allowing the rape of the federation. The only good thing he did was stop the Jihadists that NATO armed funded and trained in Chechnya (with the aim of breaking up the federation into ministates ripe for exploitation.)</p>

<p>The NWO initially thought he would be in the same mould and gave him favourable media coverage. </p>

<p>Putin consolidated power and proceeded a campaign of removing the elites who had taken over Russian resources and assets. he jailed them, killed them, exiled them. Brilliant shit.</p>

<p>At this point the NWO turned on him and through their puppet NATO enticed Georgia to attack Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia. This was a test run to see how Russia would react to aggression. They promised Georgia NATO assistance, pushed him out in front, and waited for him to die.</p>

<p>Putin crushed Georgia so hard and fast that the NWO decided to pull back.</p>

<p>Putin began modernising the military. Around this time I believe he became fully aware of the NWO threat.</p>

<p>The NWO through NATO overthrew the Ukrainian government but again did not anticipate Putin&#39;s savage and forceful reaction taking Crimea and assisting Eastern Ukraine to defeat the UKR.</p>

<p>NWO destroyed flight MH17. There are various methods they could have used to do this. Most likely they forced the flight to fly over the killzone and low enough to be confused and had their UKR stooges perform the shootdown. This was to turn European opinion against Putin.</p>

<p>Do I need to continue?</p>

<p>I have studied Russia and Putin in depth. I have always liked Russia and admired Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surely you are not suggesting Putin is attempting world domination. Even the NWO is not a single individual but hundreds of thousand of very powerful people over decades perhaps longer.</p>

<p>Putin would be starting from scratch and well he is brilliant and powerful but he isn&#39;t a god. I don&#39;t think he could do such a thing.</p>

<p>He would need to be like The Mule from Isaac Asimov&#39;s Foundation series. (Don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read those) Where this foundation is attempting to direct the evolution of all societies in the galaxy but a psychic mutant called The Mule temporarily prevents their plans from fruition until their own telepaths acting in concert get him back under control.</p>

<p>Personally I believe he is doing what he is doing for the good of Russia. Even helping Trump is for the good of Russia so the NWO is weakened and stops attacking Russia.</p>

<p>But as I admitted. I could be wrong. But right now I see no other hope than Putin and Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not suggesting his goal is world domination in his lifetime. You&#39;re right. In order to achieve that he would either need the Mule&#39;s ability to emotionally manipulate people OR an externally triggered existential threat event where he can become a global hero. Neither of those seems realistic.</p>

<p>Somewhere I read a quote from Putin more than a decade ago where he essentially said his goal was to break the NWO and replace it with one of his creation. Of course he wasn&#39;t that explicit, and I will never be able to find the quote, but I find it is generally best to give some credence what people tell you about themselves.</p>

But my take on the deletion of threads against DT lately is that its more so the squashing of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; pedaled by those in power, those who the more popularly accepted theories usually target like the Intelligence Community and Mainstream Media, rather than because of specific political alliances.  </p>

<p>It may just be an unfortunate byproduct that the usual visitors here have a greater disdain for the IC and MSM than they do for Trump, couple that with the fact that both of those outlets seem anti-Trump then you end up with the outward appearance of this sub being pro-Trump.  </p>

<p>His business ties to Russia?  Can&#39;t do that, he won&#39;t detail them, and there is plenty of public outcry requesting that, maybe we can revisit this one once he provides more information, I&#39;m sure that will be soon.</p>

<p>The evidence asserted in the dossier of communication between Trump and &quot;The Kremlin&quot;?  Don&#39;t have that either. Surprising.</p>

<p>The evidence that Russia hacks things? I&#39;m pretty sure at this point they&#39;d show you their scripts.  They&#39;re hardly denying it.</p>

<p>What else is there to go on that isn&#39;t already either being demanded by the media and public or completely inaccessible and most likely already destroyed?</p>

<p>This sub has been pro Trump for a while now. If you can&#39;t see that you&#39;re being deliberately naive.</p>

<p>Trump has plenty of links to Russia- look at some of the people in his cabinet for fuck sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would you differentiate a sub that was anti-authority/IC/MSM from one that is pro-Trump(pre-presidency)? </p>

<p>And if the reason a <em>conspiracy</em> sub does become somewhat pro-Trump is due to the fact that the traditional bastions of authority (both in the US and abroad) seem to hate him and display clear conspiratorial efforts in order to control him, would that honestly be so surprising?  </p>

<p>Its not as though this sub is calling for a Russian coup, I&#39;d imagine if information and accountability was available regarding their recent efforts there would be much more mobilization on that front as well as an effort to hold Trump&#39;s feet to the fire about it.  But until Wikileaks wakes up from its (completely normal and not suspicious) coma, we can&#39;t really do much there and as a result the sub appears one sided and partisan.  </p>

<p>You know full well there have been multiple cries from both moderators and regular posters to keep blatant, non-conspiracy related topics away from here, and the &quot;pro-Trump&quot; topics that are discussed can easily be acknowledged as anti-authority in the same breath.</p>

<p>The majority of people dislike him because he&#39;s a terrible human being. He&#39;s arrogant, hugely narcissistic, a pathological liar, shows no remorse, thin skinned, and seems to have no respect for anybody. The reason why the majority of the world (except Russia of course) don&#39;t want him anywhere near the White House is because he&#39;s entirely unsuitable for the role. </p>

<p>have you not seen the massive overlap of people that post here and on T_D? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of people do not browse conspiracy subs, that&#39;s my point.  And my contention was not that Trump isn&#39;t a repugnant character, he certainly is and many here would actually agree. </p>

<p>My contention was that it isn&#39;t surprising that those who see a large epidemic of authoritarian corruption as a bigger problem than Trump&#39;s faults, concern themselves with the authoritarian corruption.  I am not talking about why the <em>majority</em> of people hate him, I am talking about why the usual targets of conspiracies seem to hate him and not finding it mysterious that a conspiracy sub concerns itself with them instead of him.</p>

<p>Again, I am not saying that once he becomes a part of that authority the sub will not turn on him, I fully expect it unless he makes a very explicit effort to dismantle corrupt entities with diligence, in a legal and transparent way.  Which is to say, the sub is going to turn on him.  </p>

<p>But still, there is going to be a time between then and now, as the IC and MSM wage a propaganda war against him, that this sub focuses its attention on his enemies and in turn finds itself with strange bedfellows.  Including a <em>lot</em> of transplants from T_D.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will certainly give you that it is an issue to be scrutinized extensively, in keeping with the main aim of the sub. </p>

<p>I guess I just find it concerning, seeing how T_D and altright and other subs that align with Trump have been systemically silenced across reddit, and feel there needs to be pushback here on the idea that we&#39;re in the same vein. If it goes to far this sub will be sidelined in one way or another by the admins and one more place for honest and alternative criticism of TPTB will be gone.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff (Epstein) for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

<p>Definition of adipocere: known as corpse, grave or mortuary wax, is a wax-like organic substance formed by the anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of fat in tissue, such as body fat in corpses. In its formation, putrefaction is replaced by a permanent firm cast of fatty tissues, internal organs, and the face.</p>

<p>Just messing. I&#39;m on the same side as you here with regard to the incredible leaps made by conspiracy theorists. Just messing again. I&#39;ll admit one of the sentences regarding &#39;having pizza for an hour&#39; initially stood out to me before I read the rest of the at best circumstantial evidence to warrant further investigation on my behalf. When you consider that these people schedule every hour of their day and rarely have free time it makes sense.

<p>What is there to debunk? A made up code language used to explain emails? A bunch of pictures with red arrows that provides no evidence of anything?

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, referencing other instances of institutional abuse or trafficking doesn&#39;t help any.  I am aware of other instances and even sometimes believe they are true, but it doesn&#39;t prove anything about this one.

<p>Cathy O&#39;Brian is a questionable source, as is anything regarding Project Monarch (Is it possible?  Sure, but the proof is tenuous at best) in my opinion. Why is she alive let alone doing speaking engagements if this is all true?  I am weird and read about Monarch...no &quot;normal&quot; person is going to take you seriously if you bring up an alleged CIA mind control subproject.</p>

<p>I am open to all this being correct, but I need more proof.  I am not trying to be dismissive so much as explaining why people think this whole thing is balls out nuts...</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem right there. A poster in 4chan supplied a list of &quot;codewords&quot; and told people to search wikileaks for them. So, people did and used their imagination. To me, playing dominos on cheese is just a dumb drugs allusion, like me asking if I&#39;ll play chess better on Vanilla Coke or Red Bull. No need to ascribe hidden meanings to it, and in fact, asking if you&#39;ll do better playing domination on little girls than little boys (using the 4hcna translations) makes no sense. Likewise, Herb Sandler saying he expected cheese and sauces in the delivered box makes no sense using the &quot;translations&quot; (little boys and orgies in a box). You&#39;re just discarding things that don&#39;t fit your preconceived theory which is a ridiculous methodology. Similarly, someone suggested that &quot;realtor&quot; must mean a specialised evidence clean-up agent (they&#39;ve been watching too much Tarantino). Of course, it couldn&#39;t just be that Kathryn Tate is a realtor (that is, a real estate agent, not a forensic cleanup expert).</p>

Adults do find children entertaining, you know – you don&#39;t have to be a paedophile or abusing them to get enjoyment out of interacting with them or simply watching them play.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust an anonymous poster on 4chan with no corroborating evidence or citations to be telling the truth about anything. And when it comes to accusing people of serious and terrible crimes, you should have more than a post on 4chan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i can imagine a pedophile saying that to another pedophile,</p>

<p>People can imagine all sorts of things, but that&#39;s not evidence, particularly when the alleged coded messages can easily be understood without reference to a supposed code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m not sure where you are getting orgies in a box</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/50332">Herb Sandler wrote</a> that he had received a &quot;square shaped box&quot; and &quot;instead of pasta and wonderful sauces&quot;, it contained &quot;a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses&quot;. Using 4chan&#39;s codewords, then, Sandler was expecting there to be little boys (pasta) and orgies (sauces) in the box.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can find videos on youtube talking about pizza and hotdogs and how they connect with sex going years back</p>

<p>So, provide citations, then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how do you explain obama flying in 65000$ worth of hotdogs in from chicago</p>

<p>This is another common pizzagate misrepresentation. There is no evidence that Obama ever flew in any hotdogs. There is <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">an email from Fred Burton of Stratfor</a> in which he wrote &quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago&quot;. One person thinking something <em>may</em> have happened is not proof that anything did happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i doubt we will find a secret pedo code in the dictionary... but there is at least one word that we corroborate, that instagram pic of alefantis with a young boy, with the hashtag &quot;#chickenlover&quot;, the term dates back to an 80 doc which i&#39;m too lazy to look up, and chickenhawk is also an established term.</p>

<p>you claim that it can all be understood, but some things still raise eyebrows like the get pizza for an hour one, or the email with the pizza pac attatchemnt (where does this busy politican find the time to make a pizza pac, and what are the legal ramifications of such a thing),</p>

<p>yeah i&#39;ve seen someone explain that email, apperently they were talking about playing dominos in a previous email. i bet podesta wishes he worded that one differently rofl</p>

<p>he thinks obama spent 65k$ on hotdogs and he thinks they are using the same channels, he seems very exited about the &quot;waitresses&quot; too. i know the white house only takes food from secret and secure channels, i guess these guys use these same secret hotdog channels. also obviously if there was some sketchy shit going down there would be no public record of it</p>

<p>also sorry far too lazy to go through pages and pages of history to find some obscure video</p>

<p>they really should have clarified some things instead of screaming fuck you fake news FAKE NEWS, i guess thats not really an option for some reason tho</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny that you are accusing him of prescribing his own meaning when you are doing the same thing. You do know that pedophiles actually use cheese and pizza as codewords right? So when you see those words used out of context and several times it isn&#39;t unlogical for someone to be skeptical and formulate what think it is, especially when there has been dozens of cases of pediphilia in high ranking members of the political establishment?</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m applying the standard meanings of these words and finding nothing that cannot be explained using those accepted meanings. I am not applying non-standard usages with no independent verification or corroboration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You clearly didn&#39;t understand what I meant by drugs allusion. I meant that Sandler was referring to cheese and pasta as though they were performance-enhancing drugs. The cheese and pasta were relevant in the context and replacing them with &quot;drugs&quot; would not have made any sense.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a Beltway in-joke referencing the well-known Bohemian Grove frat-boy &quot;rituals&quot;.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a refreshing comment. Most pizzagaters immediately jump to accusing people who disagree with their &quot;findings&quot; of being shills or paedophiles themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s nothing wrong in people wanting to search for the truth, throwing away and adding possible theories to form connections</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s not what is going on here. Some people are deliberately misrepresenting the situation or just lying (like saying that Clinton and Silsby were friends and Clinton got Silsby off; that Alefantis said there was a basement at Comet Ping Pong; that Obama flew in $65,000 of hot dogs; that the McCann identikits are of the Podesta brothers; that the Podestas were staying at Clement Freud&#39;s house in Portugal when McCann was abducted, etc, etc), and others are accepting these inaccurate assertions at face value and perpetuating them. And they are then accusing named individuals of committing heinous crimes on the basis of this shonky research. I&#39;ve seen people commenting that these individuals should be killed and we&#39;ve already had people snooping on them and even one person going into Comet Ping Pong with a gun. These &quot;investigators&quot; are putting real lives and livelihoods at risk and they don&#39;t even have a single criminal complaint to back up their claims. This is not how research is done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate isn&#39;t an investigation into a pizza shop. It&#39;s an investigation of a broader and insidious infestation of pedophilia into the very institutions intended to stop them. The other cases are instances were they had to prune a branch to save the tree. Almost universally, these cases find a scapegoat and the immediately shut the case down despite testimony from people involved in the case saying there was evidence of more people being implicated.</p>

<p>This is what Pizzagate is about. And it&#39;s utterly horrifying, and absolutely true. We do not own this world. The criminals do. That is changing though. </p>

<p>Pizzagate started because of podesta email code words and James Alefantis running a pizza place. </p>

<p>Resolve those questions before trying to sew distrust in the countries institutions... Hmm who could possibly want Americans to have even less trust in their institutions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t start on reddit. It started on 4chan. Also the term &quot;pizzagate&quot; came later. That didn&#39;t gain traction until it hit twitter, which was after it hit reddit.</p>

<p>Hawaii actually got more attention early on, along with Haiti and Epsteins Island. The David Brock connection came later, which lead to alefantis and comet ping pong.</p>

<p>&quot;But he conceded that his brother often says--in a voice that seems only half-joking--his biggest goal after the White House is to run a hot-dog stand in Hawaii. Even that might prove too stressful for a presidential chief of staff already getting the feel of beach sand in his toes. His true goal, Tony Podesta speculated, is to run &quot;a crazy T-shirt store on the Big Island.&quot;</p>

<p>Every post from the early days on reddit and the 4chins was about podesta and comet ping pong. There are archive links of this, I just haven&#39;t got the patience to find them at the moment. Search for threads 2 months old and you&#39;ll find them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m talking about the underground bunker/broken hard drive cp ring.</p>

<p>Some guy in Hawaii found a site on some property linked to someone, I forget who, it had a ton of power boxes with cables leading underground. General concensus was a weed farm. But the same guy was linked to an eBay store that sold &quot;broken&quot; hard drives for exorbant prices with absolutely glowing reviews. People figured that was cp related.</p>

<p>There was also a bunch of other property around the country linked to someone they were investigating that according to Google Street view were all fenced off house in suburban neighborhoods with bars on the windows. Only houses in the areas that looked like that. Never did figure out what that was about.</p>

<p>The investigation is much larger than a single pizza shop. And that is not even talking about Pegasus, the mysterious school owned in Hawaii or the DynCorp tail numbers on Epstein&#39;s chopper. And in Haiti there is the dead trafficking researcher and the lady convicted of trafficking that Hillary personally interviened with the government to get released. Or the dead trafficking researcher in Germany. There are several other leads I can&#39;t recall at the moment.</p>

The reaction to the Trump/Russia story on this subreddit yesterday was an almost textbook example of how these groups work. The front page was immediately flooded with posts claiming hoaxes and brigades in an obvious attempt to forum slide the BuzzFeed article. When it failed, mods censored the discussion by deleting the post, and are now sticking pizzagate post in a very transparent attempt to direct this subreddit back to an anti-Democrat pro-Trump narrative.</p>

<p>Now you have Nevertrumpers crying about why we&#39;re not all up in arms against Trump after this manufactured scandal and Trumpeteers losing their heads over this attack on their emperor, while truth is nowhere to be found as this story is a ghost not worth chasing after.</p>

The Finders cult investigation being halted as a &quot;CIA internal matter&quot;. The thousands of Pentagon employees not jailed for buying child porn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like the pentagon employees that got caught with child pornography... And got jailed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many out of the ~5000 suspected were investigated? How many were jailed? How many had no punishment? How many were not even investigated?</p>

<p>Do we need a special prosecutor when it seems like ICE and current law enforcement is working on it?</p>

<p>What evidence do you have to support your claim that they&#39;re working on it effectively? The Saudis had 28 pages of the 9/11 report classified. That doesn&#39;t sound like effective government oversight to me.</p>

<p>Special prosecutors exist to remove the appearance of a conflict of interest. We&#39;ve shown that such an appearance exists. Therefore we need a special prosecutor. </p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t oppose one being appointed, right? Just to be safe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;No if you had video evidence of anything I&#39;d support the conspiracy&quot;
I don&#39;t believe you.
&quot;but right now all the evidence is very flimsy and involves too many mental gymnastics to seem likely.&quot;
such assertions wow, nobody is claiming this is 100% proof and they should be sent to the execution chamber, in the past investigations into alligations like this have started with way less evidence than we have here. 
&quot;Code words in emails is all anybody actually has and it&#39;s a guess at this point.&quot;
that code is hardly a guess (play dominos on cheese or on pasta, get pizza for an hour, expected pasta but got a lovely assortment of cheeses instead, pizza related maps, sacrificing a chicken(term coined by nambla in a 80s documentary) to moloch(god of child sacrifice), or emails like this &quot; We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be  Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and &gt; almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in  that pool for sure.&quot;
we also have an efit from maddie mccans dissapearance, i know it&#39;s supposed to be of one person, yet they pictures look completely different and one of them has a depression where podesta wears glasses, the other one a mole above his eye the same as tony.
no we also know he is friends with convicted pedophile dennis hastert, and if you did some research into the occult aspect of what podesta believes you would eventually see spirit cooking, crowley, and child abuse are all connected.
&quot;The problem is this sub has turned into such a pro-trump safe space...&quot; 
WRONG, if this was true, not every single thread would have one of the top comments complaining about exacly this, you guys are the ones being partisan cause it was your candidate that had a pedo running her campaign.
&quot;It seems like people here want it to be true&quot;
I assure you, people that think pizzagate is real, don&#39;t want it to be.</p>

She&#39;s too much a part of the system for my liking. Denying this sub hasn&#39;t turned into r/the_donald_part2 is just kinda sad at this point. The mods have helped make it clear that pro-trump is the narrative here. I&#39;ve actually seen posts on r/the_donald tell people to come over here to brigade it and downvote anything anti-trump. Countless posts about how anything anti-trump is bogus and fake news which goes against the very fucking point of this sub. You don&#39;t have to believe it but let others look into like I have with pizzagate. Personally I don&#39;t buy it but if proof surfaces I&#39;ll have no choice but to admit being wrong. </p>

he speaks like a sales person, fast and repeating himself a lot, it&#39;s actually a tehnique of speaking.

&quot;How about people being honest about the &quot;evidence&quot; they are presenting, instead of continually misrepresenting it?&quot; that&#39;s what happens when a giant disinfo campagin is launched to discredit, I don&#39;t have proof of this but i have personally seen it as it was happening.

    <div class="md"><p>Supply a single complainant backing up the pizzagate conspiracy theory, not just a person claiming to have been a victim of satanic ritual abuse.</p>

<p>You again try to avoid the lack of any evidence of a crime by saying it&#39;s buried somewhere. So, lack of evidence = evidence in your world then?</p>

<p>No, the misrepresentation and lying is not part of a disinformation campaign; you can easily check the claims being made for pizzagate and see that many are not true (for example, the McCann identikits are of two people and the artwork in Podesta&#39;s house is based on a victim of Dahmer&#39;s).</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t have a brain capable of connecting basic dots&quot;: typical pizzagater response – won&#39;t debate the issues and resorts to insults instead. In fact, I can connect basic dots; I don&#39;t need some ridiculous code to make sense of fairly banal email conversations. But tell me how you put orgies in a box and deliver them?</p>

<p>The emails you referred to were both written <em>before</em> Hastert was convicted, so again, where is your proof that he has remained friends with him after he was convicted and confessed to abuse?</p>

<p>No, I cannot find any evidence of a picture in Jphn Podesta&#39;s house showing tied up children. You made the claim, you provide the evidence. The burden of proof is on you, not me.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing more insults around (playing chess with a pigeon), why don&#39;t you just discuss the issues with me? Start by answering my questions and providing the proof I asked for. Why is it that pizzagaters shy away from intelligent discussions and simply resort to ad hominem attacks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>eh pizzagate is occult ritual abuse, i&#39;m not gonna go through pages of yt history to give you something you will just dismiss as soon as you see it.
how exacly do you propose we get this evidence from these powerful and influental people? no, the emails which use obvious code, the artwork he is interested in, the friends he has, thats the part that raises suspicion.</p>

<p>lol that part only works for people that are sure everything is as it appears, sure it says it&#39;s of one person, yet the efit of podesta has a depression where his glasses rest, and the efit of tony has a mole above the eye, not to mention that the efits don&#39;t look like the same person.
well sorry, you just don&#39;t. you literally keep reseting to orgy in a box after you have been corrected 2 times... i only resort to insults to add color to this very boring looping conversation.
the fact they were written before hardly makes it better, the one where a goldmansach guy is saying it might be time for danny to dissapear to an undisclosed location in asia is still telling tho...
you are correct, it&#39;s just his brothers house <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43480-2004Sep22_3.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43480-2004Sep22_3.html</a>
also the &quot;it&#39;s just based on a victim of dahmer&#39;s&quot; oh okay then rofl
you know the reason people get frustrated with you is probably cause they have to explain the exact same thing 5 different times to you and you refuse to understand very simple things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, you could call the <em>Venus de Milo</em> a dismembered corpse statue too. The <em>Arch of Hysteria</em> is a well-respected artwork by a well-respected artist and has even appeared at the Tate. So what if Podesta created a basement exhibition space?

<p>Please provide proof of this painting in John Podesta&#39;s kitchen. And please provide proof of Vladimir Plahotniuc blackmailing politicians using child prostitutes. Though even if he did, how does that implicate Podesta in anything? Or are we saying that people who are friends with child abusers are always child abusers themselves? If so, what does that say about the people that voted for Trump, given that he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>The Venus de Milo originally had arms.
Fair enough, though it&#39;s certainly arguable that its current fame is due at least in part, to the loss of those arms. But, in any case, substitute the bust of Nefertiti. You could just as easily claim that is the decapitated head of a corpse.</p>

<p>The arch of hysteria was designed without a head (because Jeffrey Dahmer chopped it off his victim).
There&#39;s no evidence for that and plenty against it. Bourgeois&#39;s <em>Arch of Hysteria</em> as seen in Podesta&#39;s house dates from <a href="http://wtfarthistory.com/post/12881691465/men-are-hysterical-too">1993</a>, but she was working on the form <a href="https://mixerella.wordpress.com/tag/modern-art">from at least 1992</a>. She has been creating variations of this artwork for many years, and <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection_lb/object.php?object_id=150447">some iterations have heads and are clearly of women</a>. In <a href="https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria">a discussion of the artwork here</a>, you can see the influence of an 1824 engraving by Charles Bell (obviously not based on Dahmer&#39;s work), and <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/25/e0/66/25e0668373e0832cdc7aaa5da9f3122f.jpg">Paul Regnard&#39;s  <em>Arch of Hysteria</em></a> from 1877 is also a clear antecedent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By contrast, [the image of Dahmer&#39;s victim(<a href="http://disturbinghorror.com/sitebuilder/images/Jeffery-Dahmer-victim-6-300-275x165.jpg">http://disturbinghorror.com/sitebuilder/images/Jeffery-Dahmer-victim-6-300-275x165.jpg</a>) that everyone links to apparently was first published in 1996 in Vernon Geberth&#39;s <em>Practical Homicide Investigation</em> (that is, <em>after</em> Bourgeois had already been using the pose). It&#39;s not even clear from that photo that the head has been removed. Even if the work had been based on one of Dahmer&#39;s victims, what does that have to do with child abuse? Dahmer killed adult men. He wasn&#39;t a child abuser.</p>

<p>So, on the one hand, you have clear precedents predating Dahmer by more than 100 years. On the other hand, you have a photo that probably wasn&#39;t even in the public domain when Bourgeois was first utilising the form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, no problem.
So, tell me, why did you describe that image as being of a &quot;little girl with legs apart&quot;? Clearly, you wanted to imply some salacious content to the image and imply that it was akin to a porno shot, but all I see is <a href="https://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/PhillipsFineArt/31/296931/H2166-L20719900.jpg">a painting by Biljana Djurdjevic</a> of a young woman of indeterminate age sitting on a bar stool. Her legs are not touching but there is nothing indecent about their position. If you see that image as being sexual I would say that says more about you than it does about Tony (not John) Podesta. </p>

<p>Tony Podesta also has a nude teen painting in his bedroom, according to the same article that described his interest in statues of murder victims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you talking about the <em>Washington Post</em> article? If so, it does not say he has a &quot;nude teen painting in his bedroom&quot;, nor does it describe his &quot;interest in statues of murder victims&quot;. If not, please link to the article. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s hardly proof. That&#39;s an uncorroborated assertion, and apparently <em>Komsomolskaya Pravda</em> was the source of some of these assertions. (<em>Pravda</em> has also claimed the US was behind the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> shootings.) To say this is proof is like citing a voat pizzagate post and saying that&#39;s proof the Podestas are child abusers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds eerily familiar to what Pizzagaters have been pointing out all along- that blackmailers and pedophiles are too common in elite circles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t say anything about paedophiles, and it&#39;s hardly surprising that criminals seek to entrap powerful people, just as some security services do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it&#39;s FISHY AS FUCK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t even supply proof this guy has done anything and then you&#39;re using that to imply guilt by association.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think I give a flying fuck if Trump gets taken down along with all the other pedophile sadists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, at least you seem to believe that Trump is involved. Most pizzagaters I&#39;ve read think Trump is going to be the one to confirm the truth of the conspiracy and throw everyone in jail.</p>

<p>&quot;Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style <strong>pictures of naked teenagers</strong> in their parents’ suburban homes.” </p>

<p>Plahotniuc is the richest man in Moldova, and there was not even a photo of him available until a few years ago. Very kind of you to stand up for his innocence though. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s squeaky clean.</p>

<p>No, it takes its inspiration from depictions of hysterical patients. But even if it was inspired by a murder victim, how does that mean the owner is a child abuser? If I owned <em>Guernica</em>, would I be guilty of indiscriminate killing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, a photographer <em>known</em> for those pictures. That doesn&#39;t mean Podesta has one of those pictures. It&#39;s like me saying that an art collector owns a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, the painter known for the <em>Mona Lisa</em>. That doesn&#39;t mean the art collector owns the <em>Mona Lisa</em>. This lack of concern for the truth is typical of pizzagaters.</p>

<p>Plahotniuc may be a criminal and Podesta may not have any ethics and may work for anyone who offers him a contract, but an article that did not offer any sources, quotations, or backup documentation is still not proof of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I don&#39;t want to see your evidence, I just want to condemn your opinion&quot;. Do the courtesy to these victims to hear their stories. Watch the videos.</p>

<p>As for what I believe:
I don&#39;t have the hubris to claim I know how the world works, but my best estimation at this time is there are secret societies controlling the levers of power all over our world. Many of these secret societies are deeply rooted in royal bloodlines, and occult rituals for initiation which coerce participants to engage in extreme taboos, such as child abuse. Satanism is an undeniably large part of this. They reward members for this, and use these activities for blackmail to guarantee permanent loyalty to the cause. You are given easy access to any form of sexual gratification you desire, any drug you want, any earthly pleasure you wish to satisfy no matter how twisted or depraved. They are made completely above the law in every aspect of life, in exchange for becoming a complete puppet for the will of this cabal, who we affectionately call &quot;The Powers That Be.&quot;</p>

<p>Given the fact that our leaders regularly manufacture excuses for war and genocide to feed their agendas, I don&#39;t think child rape and murder is that far outside their demonstrated moral boundaries. So yes- I tend to think it&#39;s highly plausible these freaks are dressing up in silly robes and fucking kids behind closed doors. The evidence for Pizzagate certainly seems to suggest that&#39;s what they&#39;re up to. If it&#39;s all fake news, believe me, everyone researching this would love to go back to thinking this isn&#39;t happening...but the coverup and backlash we&#39;re getting is not helping to ease any suspicions.</p>

<p>I am open to all counter-evidence that disproves any specific part of this theory, one portion at a time. But it&#39;s going to take a lot more than saying &quot;he doesn&#39;t have a basement!&quot; to satisfy my questions about Mr. Alefantis here.</p>

<p>No, the codewords were <em>not</em> established by the FBI or any law enforcement agency. This is another pizzagate lie. The FBI did release <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">a document</a> depicting two <em>symbols</em> that they had found being used by a few paedophiles (the heart in heart and the triangle spiral). But the FBI did not verify the &quot;codewords&quot;. They were posted by a 4channer, who said they may be possible codewords and said to search wikileaks for them. Pizzagaters just ran with it from there.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean it&#39;s literally about drugs. As I said, it&#39;s a joke; Sandler was just joking that maybe the cheese would make him play dominoes better. The point is that this statement is perfectly explicable without having recourse to codewords. In fact, using the codewords makes no sense, because then you have Sandler asking if he&#39;ll play domination better on little girl than little boy, which is nonsense. And he had earlier said he was expecting there to be a little boy and orgies in the box, which is also ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would someone say something like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why don&#39;t you email Burton and ask him? Obama did <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/President-Needs-a-Hot-Dog-Helping-Hand-96078774.html">fly in a Chicago chef</a>  to help make hot dogs, though this particular incident happened after a year the email was written. Possibly, he&#39;d done it a previous year too, and the cost of the whole event was $65,000.</p>

<p>As for misrepresentation, it is indeed misrepresentation to present as established fact that Obama spent $65,000 on hot dogs. All that can be said is that Burton thought Obama did this. There&#39;s a big difference between saying &quot;Obama got $65,000 in hot dogs&quot; and &quot;it was claimed that Obama may have spent $65,000 on hot dogs&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh and strangely you completely ignored this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing strange about it at all; you didn&#39;t provide a link to it and I overlooked the quotation in the email I linked to. So, to address it, it&#39;s not clear whether Eisenstein is replying to Burton or Kuykendall and thus whether the &quot;waitresses&quot; were at a previous Sratfor hot dog event or at the Whitehouse party, but I assume he&#39;s implying they were promiscuous, prostitutes, or maybe just models. Or maybe there was a rumour floating around Stratfor that Obama spent $65,000 on prostitutes and that was what the exchange is about. Notably, Eisenstein uses scare quotes to draw attention to the non-standard use. He&#39;s not trying to hide anything there. Again, there&#39;s no evidence that anything illegal occurred, and if something illegal did occur, why jump to the conclusion that it was child abuse? Why not simple prostitution?</p>

<p>No, people who disagree are not simply lying. And people who disagree are not all CTR. For the record, I&#39;m not American, I don&#39;t live in the States, I don&#39;t support Hillary Clinon, and I&#39;m not being paid or otherwise induced to post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea nothing strange about saying &quot;Waitresses&quot; at all mhm.. </p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> say there was nothing strange about writing &quot;waitresses&quot; in scare quotes; I said there was nothing strange about me omitting to comment on it in my previous post. You said &quot;strangely [I] completely ignored this&quot;, and I was merely saying it wasn&#39;t strange, it was just that I had overlooked the comment was in that email I linked to. It&#39;s clear from my comments that I do think Eisenstein was implying something about the waitresses, but I don&#39;t see any evidence that it relates to child abuse and it may not even refer to the supposed White House party. But I have found that this sort of misrepresentation is typical of many pizzagaters – they don&#39;t worry about the facts, twist other people&#39;s words, call people who disagree shills or CTR, and then other pizzagaters just repeat this rubbish without checking for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... i&#39;l tell ya what&#39;s going on. Mass denial. That&#39;s it. ... There is a MOUNTAIN of &quot;coincidences&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not mass denial. It&#39;s just that people who have looked into the pizzagate claims with open minds have found that there is no evidence to back them up. The &quot;mountain&quot; of coincidences you claim does not exist – a lot of them are simply wrong (for example, that the &quot;codewords&quot; were validated by the FBI, that the Madeline McCann identikits were of the Podesta brothers, that the Podestas were staying at Clement Freud&#39;s house when McCann was abducted, that the emails make no sense unless a code is being used, that &quot;James Alefantis&quot; is a homophone for &quot;I love children&quot; in French, that &quot;L&#39;Enfant&quot; in the t-shirts refers to a child, that Clinton was being informed about Silbsy for years and got her off, that Elefantis has previously said that Comet Ping Pong does have a basement, etc, etc), some are misrepresentations, and others are just guilt by association. And the claims are very selective too: for example, pizzagaters make much out of the fact of Tony Podesta writing that he had stayed in touch with Dennis Hastert, but they never point out that he wrote that before Hastert was convicted or that Podesta wrote that he &quot;in shock&quot; on hearing the news about Hastert. And they also never mention the letters written by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-congressmen-send-letters-in-support-of-hastert/">Republicans Tom DeLay, John T Doolittle, David Dreier, Thomas Ewing, and Porter Goss</a> asking the judge to show leniency in sentencing. Pizzagaters also make much out of Bill Clinton being a friend of Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s but never talk about how Trump as also a friend or that a woman filed court papers alleging Trump raped her at Epstein&#39;s house when she was 13. (I&#39;m not saying that was a legitimate claim, just noting that, if such a claim had been made about Bill Clinton, it would have formed a part of the pizzagate narrative for sure.)</p>

<p>Also, some of us are old enough to remember the international satanic child abuse claims of the 1980s, so we&#39;ve already seen the harm that these sorts of bogus claims can cause.</p>

<p>In short, it&#39;s not mass denial by those who disbelive pizzagate – it&#39;s extreme gullibility and naivety on the part of those who do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all the people involved in Pizza gate are actually just fucking dumb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like most conspiracy theories, pizzagate relies on people being incredibly stupid but smart evil geniuses. Supposedly, they&#39;re clever enough to set up an international child trafficking ring catering to the rich and powerful, leaving no physical trace, no witnesses, and no identified victims, yet they&#39;re dumb enough to broadcast their involvement on Instagram and openly advertise their services in their businesses&#39; marketing. As well, they&#39;re so open that <em>GQ</em> names James Alefantis in its top 50 powerful Washington people for his crimes. And anyone who calls bullshit on this is labelled CTR or a shill, because pizzagaters just can&#39;t comprehend that anyone could genuinely find this ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So yea we basically can&#39;t lose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you mean, you&#39;re going to hurt the lives and livelihoods of people on the basis of unsupported accusations and no evidence of even one case of child abuse, then, yes, you&#39;ve done this. But being part of a despicable campaign of cyber-bullying and harassment is nothing to be proud of. But, if you mean that you&#39;re going to see actual proof of the pizzagate claims, prosecutions, and convictions, then you&#39;re dreaming. I guarantee you that, in 10 years&#39; time, there will have been no prosecutions (let alone convictions) based on the pizzagate claims, and most of those people who were pushing pizzagate will be looking back on it with some degree of embarrassment and shame at how gullible they were, while a small number will still be posting comments about the great coverup and how it really was all true.</p>

<p>Because a site that lies about its own material (it repeats the lie that the &quot;codewords&quot; are corroborated by the FBI and that the <em>Arch of Hysteria</em> is based on a Dahmer victim) and that rules out any sources it decides are &quot;fake news&quot; is never going to accept that its claims have been debunked.

<p>It isn&#39;t evidence. If you gave me access to all your emails and social media posts, I could invent &quot;codewords&quot; and make links to other things to paint you in a bad light (to the gullible, that is). It is much easier if I&#39;m allowed to lie about things, as pizzagaters do.

<p>Please provide evidence that  the Podestas were anywhere in Portugal at the time. You won&#39;t be able to, because there is none. None at all. What&#39;s more, the efit images are <em>not</em> of two people; they are two images of the <em>same man</em> and were based on <a href="http://www.mccannpjfiles.co.uk/PJ/MARTIN_SMITH.htm">the different recollections of members of the Smith family</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>One email saying they would have to eat leftover MONTH OLD Pizza</p>

<p>Do you really believe that this was &quot;scrubbed&quot;? Really? It couldn&#39;t just be that you&#39;ve conflated two pizzagate claims, namely an email referring to eating three-month old pasta (<em>not</em> pizza) and a post allegedly from Comet Ping Pong&#39;s message board that refers to last month&#39;s pizza? The first is nothing suspicious, since pasta has a shelf life of up to two years, and the second one is completely uncorroborated: no links were given to the message or even to the claimed message board. I have been unable to find any Comet Ping Pong message board, and in any case other pizzagaters claim that it wasn&#39;t a message board but a secret page that was hacked by 4chan. So, no evidence that this post is genuine, but people believe it presumably because they can easily believe in satanic child abuse rings among the rich and powerful but they can&#39;t believe that someone might lie on the internet.</p>

<p>So, if I email someone saying that I think that builder1117 kidnapped, raped, and murdered a young child, that means you really did that? It&#39;s not about me debunking anything, it&#39;s about you not providing evidence for anything in the first place. The burden of proof is on the people making the accusations.

But in the context of the email, the author had already noted that swimming was a possibility, despite it being autumn, because they were planning to heat the pool, and they were just further emphasising that swimming was an option by saying the kids would be swimming. Why do you keep seeing child abuse in everyday conversations? That says far more about you than the email writer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I guess none of this counts since it&#39;s not &quot;Real&quot; evidence, Right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you have unremarkable emails that you think prove something if you replace some words with  terms like&quot;little boy&quot; and &quot;little girl&quot;. You say you have an email about eating month-old pizza, but no link to that email. And you presumably think that children can&#39;t be transported or be entertaining unless they&#39;re being abused. No, that doesn&#39;t count as real evidence. Not even close.</p>

<p>Do you really believe that this was &quot;scrubbed&quot;? Really? It couldn&#39;t just be that you&#39;ve conflated two pizzagate claims, namely an email referring to eating three-month old pasta (not pizza) and a post allegedly from Comet Ping Pong&#39;s message board that refers to last month&#39;s pizza? The first is nothing suspicious, since pasta has a shelf life of up to two years, and the second one is completely uncorroborated: no links were given to the message or even to the claimed message board. I have been unable to find any Comet Ping Pong message board, and in any case other pizzagaters claim that it wasn&#39;t a message board but a secret page that was hacked by 4chan. So, no evidence that this post is genuine, but people believe it presumably because they can easily believe in satanic child abuse rings among the rich and powerful but they can&#39;t believe that someone might lie on the internet.</p>

<p>So, if I email someone saying that I think that builder1117 kidnapped, raped, and murdered a young child, that means you really did that?

<p>Please provide links to all these many things he was right about. But why would he put in &quot;false shit on purpose&quot;? That makes no sense. You&#39;re just trying to explain anyway the fact that he is clearly wrong about things. And he didn&#39;t &quot;reveal&quot; anything. All he has done is make uncorrobated and unverified allegations, some of which are clearly wrong. First, there is no evidence the Podestas knew Clement Freud.

<p>Oh, now you know the case better than the police investigating it, the parents, and the witnesses who clearly said they saw <em>one</em> persons. This alone shows me that you are not interested ion the truth at all; you are just so invested in this crap that you&#39;ll believe anything anyone supporting pizzagate says, no matter what the evidence against it.

<p>No, she&#39;s not.

<p>Wrong gain. He just says he&#39;s <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49348">seated with the kids so little wired</a>. To most people, &quot;wired&quot; just means &quot;nervous, tense, or edgy&quot;. To pizzagaters, it means &quot;sexually excited&quot;. You guys see child abuse everywhere. (And for anyone who&#39;s had to sit by children on a flight (or even a long bus ride) it&#39;s not hard to see why someone might be &quot;wired&quot;.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m gonna guess a private investigation firm wouldn&#39;t be able to get warrants, So it&#39;s pretty much worthless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More excuses. What happened to &quot;we are asking for a INVESTIGATION&quot;? A private investigator can turn over anything indictable to the police. But you guys won&#39;t put up the money for that because you know it won&#39;t produce anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look dude your just in denial cause you can&#39;t emotionally accept something this bad exist in the world.</p>

<p>Not that old line! Every pizzagater eventually falls back on the denial argument. If I have no problem believing in the Holocaust, the slaughter in Rwanda, Pol Pot&#39;s Year Zero, the Belgian Congo outrages, then why would I have trouble believing that people abuse children? The problem is that there&#39;s no evidence for pizzagate. You are clearly gullible and believe anything that fits your worldview without question but I require evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I still expect a apology when it blows open.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be waiting a long time then. I remember when pizzagaters were saying Trump was going to move on pizzagate as soon as he got into office. Not only is he not interested, he called for a standing ovation for the Clintons the other day. I could say I&#39;ll expect an apology from you when nothing happens, but I suspect you&#39;ll be one of the ones that 10 years from now will still be trying to convince people it really was real. Meanwhile, others will have moved on and will be looking back on their promotion of this myth as embarrassing and shameful.</p>

Wait till he&#39;s inaugurated.&quot; (Even though Obama didn&#39;t need Trump to say anything if he wanted to pardon anyone.) Then he got inaugurated and still nothing happened.

    <div class="md"><p>No, that doesn&#39;t work for me. There is no evidence that Clinton even knew Silsby, let alone was a friend of hers. The claim that she was being forwarded emails for years about the New Life Children&#39;s Refuge was based on a typo in the date on the wikileaks formatted version. We know this because the date was not on <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776">the original</a>, the document references the 2010 earthquake, and the refuge was set up in 2009 (it didn&#39;t exist in 2001). The claims that the Clintons helped get Silsby off are based on a <em>Sunday Times</em> article by Tony Allen-Mills in which he said that 
&quot;The intervention of Bill Clinton, the former president, who is co-ordinating relief efforts in Haiti, <em>may</em> accelerate the resolution of an affair that has embarrassed the US government&quot;. [My emphasis.]</p>

<p>In fact, Silsby wasn&#39;t &quot;got off&quot;; she was found guilty and served three and a half months (the prosecution had wanted six months).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the State Department had been asked to keep an eye on the detainees by an <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/CityDesk/archives/2010/?page=60&amp;amp;year=2010">Idaho congressional delegation</a>; <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/02/09/state-department-rebuffs-call-for-clinton-intervention-in-haiti-case">one of the lawyers had written to Clinton personally asking her to get involved</a>; and Haiti&#39;s prime minister had said that <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/05/haiti.arrests">its government was open to the possibility of the case being transferred to the US</a>, all good reasons for Clinton, as secretary of state, to be kept in the loop about the progress of the case.</p>

<p>In addition, there is no evidence that the group were intending to traffic the children to abusers or that they were anything more than misguided Christian do-gooders. And some of the parents <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1249280/Haiti-earthquake-Missionaries-led-Laura-Silsby-accused-stealing-orphans.html">were reported</a> as saying they wanted their children to go with the group in hopes of a better life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>6 million pieces of evidence? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following pizzagate since the beginning. The most basic questions still go unanswered. </p>

<p>Where does the walnut, hotdog, map etc code come from? </p>

<p>How does modern art indicate someone&#39;s proclivity for child abuse? </p>

<p>What is wrong with hipster bands and weird music videos and how does that connect to John podesta and child abuse? </p>

<p>What is wrong with dexter (kill room) references on a once public instagram? </p>

<p>How does a picture of a child, smiling, playing with her arms taped to a table indicate a pedophile ring operating from CPP? </p>

<p>These are the basic questions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure children are being abused in every city in the world. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a surprise unfortunately but it doesn&#39;t mean you can call people pedos without any evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I did not say &quot;6 million pieces of evidence&quot;, I said &quot;coincidences&quot;- Which is the only other explanation you have for these things that clearly warrant major suspicion.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;ve really looked into this, and seen nothing wrong, then what exactly would someone have to do for you to suspect they&#39;re involved in pedophilia? How exactly would you go about identifying a person engaged in child-trafficking, if not for clues like these? The logos of surrounding businesses are EXACT MATCHES to the FBI&#39;s chart for pedophile symbology.</p>

<p>From an investigative standpoint- Please tell me where your threshold for concern lies, and why, if this much circumstantial evidence existed for any other person, it would not be enough to tip the police?</p>

<p>The people who do this stuff aren&#39;t liquor-store bandits with scruffy jackets and head lice- they are very often people who put themselves in high-profile positions of status in their communities- coaches of their football team, priests at their local church, or I don&#39;t know- Speaker of the House of Representatives- like Dennis Hastert? Or Billionaires with private islands like Jeff Epstein? Just to name two, who are both well connected with the Podestas!</p>

<p>One more little thing before I go for the day- you&#39;re still only talking about instagram photos when the research has gone WELL beyond that point by now. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Laura Silsby? No? Well most people haven&#39;t until they actually do some research beyond the funky code words. She ran a fake charity in Haiti with help from the Clintons. They stepped in to protect her after she was convicted of child trafficking for kidnapping 33 haitian kids and attempting to smuggle them out of the country. They wouldn&#39;t have had to intervene, but unfortunately her previous lawyer- Jorge Puello Torres, was also charged with child trafficking in a separate case, and had to step down. Oopsie!</p>

<p>That&#39;s a remarkable coincidence if you ask me. Personally, I don&#39;t make habits of finding excuses for CONVICTED KIDNAPPERS. But it seems like you might like to give it a try? Should be pretty easy to debunk that one, right? Free upvotes await your reply! </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve discussed all this before so I&#39;ll just paste my response again. </p>

<p>The Haiti stuff is so tangential, how does she relate to a pizza place in DC anyway? </p>

<p>I saw a great comment about Silsby before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3539">this email</a>.</p>

<p>First off, we need some context.</p>

<p>Pizzagate investigators cite <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">this document</a> as proof that &quot;One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not true according to their own link. The linked document says:</p>

<p>Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, <strong>except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.</strong></p>

<p>Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">this shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet from Wikileaks</a> where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that &quot;One of the first things <strong>Hillary</strong> did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook...&quot; This has been edited to say &quot;the Clintons&quot; instead of &quot;Hillary&quot; because the linked 46-page document doesn&#39;t even mention Hillary&#39;s name. And besides, &quot;the Clintons took over the scene?&quot; The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the &quot;orphans&quot; and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.</p>

<p>So what happened to Silby?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an
unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as
Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal
association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the
additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3
months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence
was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether
Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings
or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.</p>

<p>Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared
to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained
that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had
“[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge
Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were
not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another
trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he
parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more
about trafficking of human beings.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More bombshells about the people who were &quot;trafficking in Haitian orphans,&quot; from the <em>same document.</em> Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help.
It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">ICE News Release</a> to put it all into context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. <strong>Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of &quot;Puello Consulting&quot; in the Dominican Republic.</strong></p>

<p>Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. <strong>However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the &quot;alleged&quot; lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.</strong></p>

<p>An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.</p>

<p>So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">this email</a> &quot;where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children&quot; but <em>it&#39;s just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization.</em> Nothing more, nothing less. </p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3539">this email</a>.</p>

<p>First off, we need some context.</p>

<p>Pizzagate investigators cite <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">this document</a> as proof that &quot;One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not true according to their own link. The linked document says:</p>

<p>Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, <strong>except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.</strong></p>

<p>Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">this shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet from Wikileaks</a> where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that &quot;One of the first things <strong>Hillary</strong> did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook...&quot; This has been edited to say &quot;the Clintons&quot; instead of &quot;Hillary&quot; because the linked 46-page document doesn&#39;t even mention Hillary&#39;s name. And besides, &quot;the Clintons took over the scene?&quot; The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the &quot;orphans&quot; and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.</p>

<p>So what happened to Silby?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an
unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as
Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal
association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the
additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3
months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence
was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether
Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings
or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.</p>

<p>Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared
to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained
that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had
“[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge
Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were
not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another
trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he
parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more
about trafficking of human beings.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More bombshells about the people who were &quot;trafficking in Haitian orphans,&quot; from the <em>same document.</em> Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help.
It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">ICE News Release</a> to put it all into context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. <strong>Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of &quot;Puello Consulting&quot; in the Dominican Republic.</strong></p>

<p>Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. <strong>However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the &quot;alleged&quot; lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.</strong></p>

<p>An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.</p>

<p>So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">this email</a> &quot;where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children&quot; but <em>it&#39;s just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization.</em> Nothing more, nothing less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. It would just take a long time to debate that I don&#39;t have today. I have a day job. The leaps are only far-and-wide if you refuse to look at the history of secret societies, and the occult practices we know the elites engage in, a la &quot;spirit cooking.&quot; </p>

<p>I will cede some minor points on Silsby, to a degree, but I&#39;m very skeptical of any government articles &quot;debunking&quot; any conspiracy theory. We need dissenting opinions in the investigation process to sift through material. If you think you&#39;ve got a mind to help, go to Voat and start adding your thoughts there. Help refine the arguments. I care about the truth, everybody does. If anything&#39;s going to be done about the crimes, we need our information to be as solid as possible, but poking one hole here or there in specifics does not destroy the whole case that there is code being used in the emails, and Alefantis is one disgusting, well-protected motherfucker.

    <div class="md"><p>Your reasoning behind that argument effectively equates to this: You live in your house, and have friends and family over at your house sometimes, who have never seen you masturbate. Now, I&#39;m supposed to take that as proof enough that you have NEVER masturbated in your house. 
Now, I&#39;m all for innocent until proven guilty- but I&#39;ve got times of day when you were home alone, uncleared browser history from your laptop, strange jokes from your friends about spanking it on social media, and several 29.99 charges from private websites during the same month as the alleged spankery.</p>

<p>The fact that Epstein holds regular &quot;normal&quot; events on his private property, is NOT evidence that he does nothing else there. He&#39;s a billionaire, he owns the whole damn island. His private jet is called the Lolita Express, and he&#39;s a convicted pedophile for god&#39;s sake. His mansion isn&#39;t some big complex totally dedicated to year-round scientific conferences. He can, and does, and will do whatever the hell he wants there, at any time in total seclusion. A few staged press events do not change that at all. But we do know Bill Clinton has flown there 20+ times <em>without</em> his Secret Service. And Bill is definitely a man with a reputation regarding sexual misconduct. What better place to avoid prying eyes than the house of your trusted billionaire friend who donates to all your political operations? Who better to keep that info quiet than your Chief of Staff, John Podesta? It&#39;s not any SINGLE thing that makes this conspiracy theory a fact. It&#39;s ALL of these things together, that form a distinctly suspicious pattern, that have us concerned. When there&#39;s this much going on, the possibility of everything just being a coincidence becomes the LEAST likely scenario, not the MOST likely, and it&#39;s time to look at alternative explanations.</p>

<p>Trump flew with epstein, is the peotus a pedophile too? </p>

<p>Your wank analogy doesn&#39;t work either James Alefantis wasn&#39;t hiding anything, all the instagram stuff was public until the autists started harassing him and his staff. </p>

<p>Not exactly what one would expect from a leader in a child abuse ring centred on the upper echelons of power is it? </p>

<p>If you had evidence of a missing child you can link to JA or Podesta that would be a start. Oh, but they&#39;re so powerful victims are &quot;dealt with&quot; -  yet JA is so inept he talks openly about the abuse on his instagram? </p>

<p>A super pedo ring that can murder and silence anyone but leaves oblique references to taunt us? </p>

<p>It is beyond belief quite frankly and it&#39;s why there is no investigation, by anyone, into any of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality doesn&#39;t care what we think is possible. If it&#39;s happening, it&#39;s happening. People HAVE died trying expose these crimes. It&#39;s no different than any other large conspiracy, except for how big and essential to the cabal this operation appears to be.</p>

<p>Whistleblowers are constantly attacked in the press, and by the government. The people engaging in these acts have ENORMOUS egos. They are literally the Untouchables. You think you&#39;ll be afraid to show off your latest scores on instagram to your friends in-the-know, when you have the entire MSM ready to attack anyone who bats an eye? Not to mention having the <strong>darkest</strong> form of dirt on hundreds of the most powerful politicians in the country? What makes you think he&#39;d feel any threat by posting these creepy things to his own social media?</p>

<p>Look up the Boystown scandal of the 80s. Look up the Hampstead case. Look up all the abuse that still goes on by the Catholic Church. Look at how hard the media is rallying to the defense of Alefantis, why was he listed as the 49th most powerful person in DC by GQ magazine? 
This man does LOTS of slimy favors for the elites and the political class. You&#39;re telling me you don&#39;t see this as a program of protection? Get real. The ladies doth protest too much.</p>

<p>As for so called &quot;modern&quot; art? Tony Podesta&#39;s favorite artist regularly depicts forms of child abused. Comet Pizza featured the works of artist Kim Noble, a woman with Dissociative Identity Disorder, which is a psychological trait commonly diagnosed in victims of child abuse. She paints pictures of adults having sex with kids, and kids being killed by adults. But hey, nothing wrong with that, it&#39;s just art right? Same as taking your children to play in a bar where they feature &quot;all-ages&quot; acts like Heavy Breathing, where a freak in a ski mask jokes about &quot;special pizza&quot; and murdering infants. That&#39;s totally normal too, right? It&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault you can&#39;t connect these very obvious dots to see something is going on here that, at the very least, betrays the innocence of a so-called Family-friendly restaurant. A very well-connected, well-protected man goes on a media blast where they all denounce all this as a conspiracy theory the moment it started to raise some eyebrows. None of the interviews or stories about Pizzagate ever address these things.</p>

<li><p>An accuser who is a victim of the crime (or a parent of a victim) or an accuser who witnessed the crime.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence linking a person directly to a victim or potential victim (e.g. being the last person to have seen or been around someone missing, previous threats, strange/volatile relationship with the victim, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>A confession</p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t any of the things I mentioned above. Did you read the whole email? What about the previous emails about them playing dominoes that don&#39;t reference cheese, pizza, or pasta? He&#39;s obviously asking if he will play dominoes better after having consumed the gift of pasta vs the traditional gift of cheeses. &quot;Do you think I&#39;d lift more on whey protein?&quot; It makes perfect sense unless you have some kind of sick mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>having kids in a pool for entertainment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The email also clearly puts it into context. Even if it meant what you are saying it meant, Podesta, Alefantis, or any of the other accused weren&#39;t even attending the party. So why would you implicate them? You&#39;d have to build a whole new conspiracy revolving some old lady pimping out her grandchildren to support your original conspiracy. Do you have kids? Do you always think about kids in a sexual way when they are brought up by adults?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Why would anyone even investigate if you don&#39;t have any of the things I previously mentioned. If I knew you personally, I could easily accuse you of being a pedophile based on the exact same accusations that these &quot;people on the internet&quot; are providing. No evidence of a crime being committed. Only accusations. An investigation isn&#39;t even warranted. An inquiry at best. At least women who accuse a man of rape <em>know</em> the accused. You don&#39;t even have an accuser who knows them.</p>

gotta call bullshit on your bullshit call, if a normal person posted a photo of a baby with foreign currecy in their mouth or a girl tied up, i&#39;m pretty sure they would be investigated, as far as i know alefantis is a single gay man, i don&#39;t know where those kids are coming from and I haven&#39;t seen proof that the girl is his god daughter or what did he claim.

<p>It&#39;s called speaking with a tongue-in-cheek. Don&#39;t you have any friends, make jokes, or have any kind of fun whatsoever?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if a normal person posted a photo of a baby with foreign currecy in their mouth </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Triple bullshit. Babies put shit in their mouths all the time. Again, do you have any kids? If you saw them put a small stack of crisp Euros you just brought back from vacation in their mouth, would your main thought be a sexual one about the baby? That&#39;s sick. No one would investigate someone based on a picture like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a girl tied up</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lie. The picture is of a smiling little girl with some tape taping her to a table. Again, if you had kids, it&#39;s common to imagine ways to restrain their rambunctiousness. Here&#39;s some other examples of the same joke/playfullness:</p>

<p>Again, is your main thought when you see these pictures about sexual assault? Why don&#39;t you have a seat right over there?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i don&#39;t know where those kids are coming from and I haven&#39;t seen proof that the girl is his god daughter or what did he claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to brush up on your research skills before accusing someone of diddling little kids? This took me all of a few minutes to find:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going tell you her name, but her name is on that post and on a bunch of other posts that not even pizzagaters have been able to twist into some kind of obscure sexual reference. There&#39;s absolutely no reason to believe that&#39;s anyone but the girl who&#39;s mentioned (his god-daughter).</p>

<p>Additionally, accusing a gay man of pedophilia just plays into the <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html">bigoted old narrative/myth</a> that homosexual = pedophile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i can&#39;t find other emails of him playing dominos, so if you could share that it would be great.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually just one other email, but it provides context for the second one.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to imagine, but it&#39;s possible they get together to play and don&#39;t always email each other about it.</p>

<p>That post is made by someone named named Joshua Ryan or something, not Alefantis. He/She&#39;s some kind of performer. You were probably mislead by a pizzagate <del>investigator</del> proponent.</p>

<p>Every single piece of evidence you&#39;ve presented to me I&#39;ve been able to debunk or easily explain. Easily. And not with any preconceived notions. I&#39;d engage with you all night going one by one, but I have to get to bed.</p>

<p>Additionally, you&#39;re taking, what?, less than 100 emails out of <em>tens of thousands</em> of emails leaked. You&#39;re right. We shouldn&#39;t just look at one. We should look at all of them. <em>All</em> of them. And when these emails constitute a sliver of a percentage of the body of evidence that is the lives/careers of the Clinton, Podesta, and company that were released in the leaks, they don&#39;t point to these people being pedophiles. The evidence, as a whole, just doesn&#39;t. At least that&#39;s my conclusion based on everything I&#39;ve examined objectively as I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, those don&#39;t look like kids to me. </p>

<p>The $65000 thing, is honestly hard to explain. It&#39;s not surprising that not everything&#39;s easily explainable. These emails weren&#39;t meant to go public. The senders/recipients are the only ones who know. However, child sexual assault is not the first thing I would think of, especially considering there&#39;s no evidence that &quot;hot dog&quot; was used to refer to molesting kids. Other than that 4chan post.</p>

<p>Personally, it seems like a joke. Read the whole email chain:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html</a></p>

<p>Take <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1168940/Obamas-fly-chef-860-miles-White-House--just-make-pizza.html">this article</a> written just a few months before, for example. The criticism is that the president wastes money on his whims.</p>

<p>In context, it looks like they&#39;re playing along to wasting taxpayer money indiscriminately. I&#39;ve also played along to being a &quot;shill&quot; when I&#39;m accused of it. It&#39;s a form of mockery. Of course, I can&#39;t be sure this is the explanation, but seems the most likely. You&#39;d really have to stretch to link that to child-molestation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny you bring up speculation. But anyway...</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way you can honestly tell me what Biden said in that video. It&#39;s intelligible. I think that video&#39;s essentially unrelated to Pizzagate. A little creepy, possibly, but it&#39;s essentially weak stand-alone evidence of a separate conspiracy. I don&#39;t really know of any other &quot;evidence&quot; tying Biden to pizzagate, so it doesn&#39;t look like much more than an old guy not recognizing (or stepping back) when someone&#39;s uncomfortable. No one who was present there has made any kind of accusation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Miss Coons&#39;s father, Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, said of his daughter: &#39;No, she doesn&#39;t think the vice president is creepy.</p>

<p>&#39;He&#39;s known my kids their whole lives. Joe was just being thoughtful.&#39;</p>

<p>He told Fox News Sunday that Mr Biden was simply leaning forward to offer her support for what would be a busy day in the public eye.</p>

<p>&#39;He was whispering some encouragement to her about how when he was sworn in and his own daughter Ashley was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable and he was encouraging her about how to get through a day with lots of cameras and lots of folks watching.</p>

<p>&#39;He was being Joe. He was being thoughtful and he was being sweet.&#39; </p>

<p>Play the unaltered audio from the original source to 10 friends who don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Don&#39;t lead them, and ask them what he said. If they corroborate what you hear, then you might have a case. I highly doubt they would, though.</p>

<p>I apologize for my rudeness, but how can you type this out and not see why I might start getting frustrated or using &quot;colorful&quot; language? You&#39;re essentially accusing me of protecting pedophiles.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how proper investigations work. Follow the evidence. An investigator doesn&#39;t protect or attack an accused. The evidence does that. I&#39;m trying to defend proper research so innocent lives aren&#39;t ruined. I&#39;m trying to defend a world in which I could post pictures of my relatives without fear that if some sicko is going to accuse me of pedophilia, my 4th amendment rights will be violated. And of course, you know, the whole &quot;innocent until proven guilty thing&quot;. I want <em>The Crucible</em> to be nothing more than a play or container.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. She&#39;s a pathological liar and was proved to be a pathological liar <em>decades</em> ago. She also never said anything about &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;pasta&quot;, &quot;walnut sauce&quot;, etc. Here&#39;s some of her more colorful fabrications:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like &quot;alien&quot; which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes. In retrospect, I understand that Bush had been painstakingly careful in positioning our seats in order that the hologram&#39;s effectiveness be maximized.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you think, &quot;Break a leg!&quot;, is a command to hurt yourself? Do you think, &quot;Let&#39;s hit the road&quot;, is a suggestion to punch a road?

<p>Yes, you were a witness to a crime. I would fully believe you or at least demand an investigation. Your testimony is direct evidence of a crime having been committed. We lack that in Pizzagate. Here&#39;s a list I&#39;ve made before as to what I would expect before accusing someone of pedophilia:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Forensic evidence of the crime (e.g. crime scene, blood, photographs/video/audio, paper trail, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>An accuser who is a victim of the crime (or a parent of a victim) or an accuser who witnessed the crime.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence linking a person directly to a victim or potential victim (e.g. being the last person to have seen or been around someone missing, previous threats, strange/volatile relationship with the victim, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>A confession</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is very unfortunate, but PG doesn&#39;t even have witnesses. You&#39;re using your experience and projecting them onto PG. Imagine if you were accused of pedophilia. And not by a relative. Or a friend. or a child. Or anyone who even <em>knows</em> you. The only ones making the accusation or complete strangers. That&#39;s where PG is at.</p>

<p>However, we have to keep a level head and remember that a false accusation of child molestation can be extremely damaging. And you shouldn&#39;t take your past experiences and apply them to someone else under completely different circumstances. I&#39;ve tried to look at PG as objectively as I can, and I just don&#39;t see the evidence we have pointing to them running some kind of pedophile ring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is in relation to the last link with Anderson Cooper and Chuck Grassley on the Pentagon Investigation: </p>

<p>Long time senator Chuck Grassley <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley</a> was championing the investigation. I think he was pretty bored as for a long time he had only served on senate committees for things like aging and finance. Not exactly the most exciting or acknowledged work in the Senate.  </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o6W8H5Z0XAc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o6W8H5Z0XAc</a></p>

<p>Senator Grassley came out with his support for reopening the investigation in 2011.</p>

<p>This is his campaign donor list for 2004. <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2004&amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;recs=20">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2004&amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;recs=20</a> His top donor is DC &quot;fixer&quot; group DCI Group <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI_Group">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI_Group</a></p>

<p>Here they are again in 2006, not a presidential year but they were still his 2nd top donor <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2006&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2006&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20</a></p>

<p>And 2008 <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20</a></p>

<p>So 2010-2011 Grassley begins his work on the Pentagon investigation. Let&#39;s look at his finances after 2008 </p>

<p>In 2010 much of his core donor ship has changed. DCI Group is gone as well as several other top donors. <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2010&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2010&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20</a></p>

<p>They would remain gone for the 2012 presidential cycle. 
Also very interesting is looking at his opponents funding. In 2004 his opponent received a couple hundred thousand in funding and Grassley several million. But in 2010 you&#39;ll see his opponent was given over 3 million in donations <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/elections.php?cycle=2010&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/elections.php?cycle=2010&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I</a></p>

<p>Grassley was still vocal and pushing the investigation in 2012 <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2012/09/19/to-catch-government-workers-with-ties-to-child-porn-call-the-irs/#1a7827be7b9d">http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2012/09/19/to-catch-government-workers-with-ties-to-child-porn-call-the-irs/#1a7827be7b9d</a>
(Side note many other very interesting things said in that article about the DOJ) but since 2012 Grassley hasn&#39;t said anything about this investigation. </p>

<p>Since he got quiet DCI Group and a few other donors have come back Grassleys donorship for the 2014-2016 cycles. Here&#39;s 2014 <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20</a></p>

<p>And 2016 <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;amp;amp;type=I&amp;amp;amp;amp;cid=N00001758&amp;amp;amp;amp;newMem=N&amp;amp;amp;amp;recs=20</a></p>

<p>Since dropping his push into the Pentagon investigation Grassley has also been promoted from the aging and finance committee to Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a highly sought after position, and Chairman of the Senate Narcotics Caucus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  This is god damn bullshit.  Pizzagate = podesta e-mails.  Pizzagate does not = every case of child abuse by an authority figure.  Stop putting all these other, PROVEN, cases under some umbrella term right next to unproven bullshit like podesta e-mails and pizza resteraunts!!  You are grouping unproven 4chan bullshit with completely unrelated but legitimate cases to make your 4chan bullshit look more legitimate, and people are right to call you out on it.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever said that child abuse of this nature does not happen by authority figures.  The argument is that podesta e-mails are not proof of anything and that pizza resteraunts are a red herring meant to keep stupid people distracted from more important issues.</p>

Pizzagate describes the allegations against comet ping pong, all of the other horrible shit that has happened or is happening to kids (Dutroux x-dossier, the finders, Jeffrey Epstein, Jimmy Saville, McMartin preschool, boystown, etc...) is just called child trafficking or ritualistic child abuse. Using the term &quot;pizza&quot; to refer to child pornography or child abuse frankly just comes off as unnecessarily goofy (or paranoid and clueless if you think you&#39;re avoiding being tracked by the NSA) aand since the term has already been plastered everywhere it&#39;s best to retire it so people don&#39;t immediately tune you out. I mean this honestly as someone who would like to see all these creeps in a courtroom.</p>

<p>Those thousands of Pentagon employees who purchased child pornography were not punished for it. And the Pentagon is &quot;too big to audit&quot;, so they may even have purchased CP with taxpayer money!</p>

<p>Child sex trafficking is not a problem that the government is prepared to address (likely because many of them have been blackmailed). So you tell me why pedophiles were protected by the Pentagon.</p>

<p>I initially assumed Pizzagate was utterly false. But then one day I was bored and had nothing else to do but investigate this &#39;myth&#39; for laughs.</p>

<p>What I saw in the emails the references to children as entertainment and the drawn images of child abuse being traded was a brain explosion. a paradigm shift.</p>

<p>If you saw the same evidence I saw you would be convinced that there could be child abuse going on. That&#39;s not a, bad thing, but I advise researching stuff before posting about it. </p>

<p>If however you have seen the evidence yet are claiming you don&#39;t believe anything could be wrong, well you are clearly trying to cover it up and prevent others from finding out. It was people like you who initially stopped me from bothering with a personal investigation of the evidence. Your tactic works which is why CTR uses it. If you are doing this for CTR, well protecting child abusers is a bad thing.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe no one is suing any of you because the dent you think you are making is small, like Trump&#39;s hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that. I said that obviously a large number of people ie the general public ie trump supporters thought there was something to the accusations.</p>

<p>Go on The Donald and ask them whether they think there could be something to it. Or a survey of any Trump supporter. Not believe it 100% but are suspicious of it. I expect most of them will say yes there could be something there.</p>

<p>All Im saying is that the shit is sus and a lot of other people, millions even, think its sus. Some believe it. Some think it needs investigating.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all Im saying. </p>

<p>Now as for law enforcement. It doesn&#39;t matter if they believe it or not. They are controlled by the elites and cannot act against them. So they don&#39;t matter any more than any other individual does.</p>

<p>Organized crime is real, and there is crossover with people in high levels of government.  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked into the relationship between these guys and art dealing, but pizza shops and art dealing have both notoriously been used to launder money (sell illicit goods/ services).  Compromising sexual tastes have also been used for a long time by intelligence operatives. And these guys seems to be very overtly sexualized- something which is valued by certain intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>I think there is probably something here.  But the &quot;investigation&quot; has relied on huge leaps which are misleading.</p>

<p>There is no link between these two topics. Snowden was leaking things because he wasn&#39;t allowed to go through the proper channels. One of you calling a public press conference on the information that you&#39;ve discovered isn&#39;t even comparable.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right! That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t compare a press conference with Snowden. What I did compare to Snowden was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all of these believers should just shut their mouths and <strong>file police reports</strong></p>

<p>TIL fleeing the country and going public with your info is &quot;the proper channel&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was sitting on information that he knew would be swept under the rug.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kinda like DC madam Heidi Fleiss before she &quot;committed suicide&quot;? Do you think she would agree with you that it&#39;s better to stay silent when you have dirt on powerful people?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s how proper investigations happen. You do the hard work before you go public. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you said so? And who the fuck are you to be telling anybody how to conduct a &quot;proper&quot; investigation? We&#39;re crowdsourcing this, because the elites are being controlled by blackmailers. Clinton&#39;s buddy Epstein got a slap on the wrist for his pedophilia conviction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s this, or stay quiet and get killed ourselves when we find anything incriminating. So we&#39;re going public, just like Snowden did for his safety. And just like Heidi Fleiss should have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a nobody. However, I also don&#39;t delude myself into thinking that I&#39;m performing an &quot;investigation.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re crowdsourcing this, because the elites are being controlled by blackmailers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you believe that the &quot;elite&quot; has all of the power you say they do, do you really think it&#39;s a brilliant idea to be performing your &quot;investigation&quot; in public, for all of them to see? That&#39;s foolish. </p>

<p>That is my point about why you do the hard work first, before going public with something. Snowden didn&#39;t get his documents and then just immediately dump them on voat like a fool. He specifically sought out respected news outlets, provided them with the material, and they helped him present them in a way that was appropriate. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally think he should have had to flee the country but that is a risk that whistleblowers face and he knew it well in advance. But he had real evidence, not just a pile of ridiculous, circumstantial rubbish.</p>

1970&#39;s became involved in cash
flow businesses, though the great majority
worked in pizzerias controlled
either by the American LCN or earlier

<p>Earthquake:
&quot;On January 12, 2010, a devastating earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 struck Haiti. More than 220,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured. The massive earthquake, the biggest the region had seen in 200 years, left more than 1.5 million people homeless,&quot;</p>

<p>Cholera
&quot;The ongoing Haiti cholera outbreak is the worst epidemic of cholera in recent history, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[5] After the 2010 earthquake, in little over two years, as of April 2013, it has killed at least 7,000 Haitians and sickened a few hundred thousand more while spreading to neighboring countries including the Dominican Republic and Cuba.[6] Since the outbreak began in October 2010, more than 6% of Haitians have had the disease.[7] While there had been an apparent lull in cases in 2014, by August 2015, after the rainy season that year brought a spike in cases, more than 700,000 Haitians had become ill with cholera and the death toll had climbed to 9,000.[8]&quot;</p>

<p>And then, HURRICANE Matthew </p>

<p>Over three weeks since the hurricane struck, the number of displaced stands at 141,493. Those displaced are living in 204 temporary shelters. Almost 800 schools in the affected areas are damaged or destroyed, leaving 116,000 children without education.</p>

<p>The U.N. estimated that 2.3 million people are living in areas impacted by the hurricane. That population includes an estimated 17,000 pregnant women expected to give birth within the next three months, said Marielle Sander, a representative of UNFPA, that deals with population health issues.</p>

<p>Dutroux Affair - Ritual abuse covered up by the Belgian government, Royalty of Belgium and Hillary Clinton attend Bilderberg conferences together. Additionally, the most recent Hillary emails from the FBI vault reveal another pedophilia cover up during a more recent visit.</p>

<p>Franklin Scandal - More ritual abuse. The guy who helped cover up, though fired from DoJ, ended up going to Raytheon, which seems highly involved with the Clinton Cartel. A lot of Republican politicians seemed to be wrapped up in it.</p>

<p>The Finders - The CIA buried an investigation after it had been discovered that the Finders were involving children in sacrifices. They had pictures, video, etc. Media went silent on it.</p>

<p>Jimmy Savile - Hundreds of victims, often in hospitals. Ritual abuse. The guy at the BBC helped cover it up then moved to the New York Times.</p>

<p>You can really go nuts tying these people together. I&#39;ve been keeping a spreadsheet to keep track of it.</p>

<p>Indiana Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Engaging in a Child Exploitation Enterprise</p>

<p>A member of a highly sophisticated, global child exploitation enterprise dedicated to the sexual exploitation of children was sentenced to prison today.</p>

<p>According to admissions made in connection with the plea, Fluckiger acted as the co-administrator of a highly-sophisticated global enterprise dedicated to the sexual exploitation of children, organized via a members-only website that operated on the Tor anonymity network, through which he and more than 150,000 other members authored and viewed tens of thousands of postings relating to sexual abuse of children as young as infants and toddlers.  </p>

<p>As a result of the ongoing investigation, at least 48 alleged hands-on abusers have been prosecuted and 49 American children who were subjected to sexual abuse have been successfully identified or rescued.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like &quot;alien&quot; which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes. In retrospect, I understand that Bush had been painstakingly careful in positioning our seats in order that the hologram&#39;s effectiveness be maximized.&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think &quot;sacrificing a chicken to moloch&quot; is a confession?</p>

<p>Do you think, &quot;Break a leg!&quot;, is a command to hurt yourself? Do you think, &quot;Let&#39;s hit the road&quot;, is a suggestion to punch a road? Do you think &quot;Cut the cheese&quot; is instructions to cut children? It&#39;s called a figure of speech. This is notthing more than SRA scare-tactics. It&#39;s a figure of speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I accused my brother-in-law&#39;s boyfriend of fondling my six year old son. He did it right in front of me. Do you know what happened? He and my brother-in-law destroyed my credibility with the rest of the family. All of a sudden I was the one who was being viciously attacked as the bad guy. They were horrible to me about it and they kept demanding &quot;proof.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you were a witness to a crime. I would fully believe you or at least demand an investigation. Your testimony is direct evidence of a crime having been committed. We lack that in Pizzagate. Here&#39;s a list I&#39;ve made before as to what I would expect before accusing someone of pedophilia:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Forensic evidence of the crime (e.g. crime scene, blood, photographs/video/audio, paper trail, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>An accuser who is a victim of the crime (or a parent of a victim) or an accuser who witnessed the crime.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence linking a person directly to a victim or potential victim (e.g. being the last person to have seen or been around someone missing, previous threats, strange/volatile relationship with the victim, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>A confession</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently he was some well connected old money lawyer from the deep South. I thought it was stunning that anyone would assume fondling a six year old boy in front of his mother was even remotely normal. I sure did start wondering about him. What would have happened to me if I had proof? I was just an eye witness, I thought that was proof enough, but what would they have done to me if I had a picture of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very unfortunate, but PG doesn&#39;t even have witnesses. You&#39;re using your experience and projecting them onto PG. Imagine if you were accused of pedophilia. And not by a relative. Or a friend. or a child. Or anyone who even <em>knows</em> you. The only ones making the accusation or complete strangers. That&#39;s where PG is at.</p>

<p>However, we have to keep a level head and remember that a false accusation of child molestation can be extremely damaging. And you shouldn&#39;t take your past experiences and apply them to someone else under completely different circumstances.

<p>A simple reddit search for &quot;pizzagate&quot; will show you all the old posts and they all refer to podesta and comet ping pong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that. I said that obviously a large number of people ie the general public ie trump supporters thought there was something to the accusations.</p>

<p>Go on The Donald and ask them whether they think there could be something to it. Or a survey of any Trump supporter. Not believe it 100% but are suspicious of it. I expect most of them will say yes there could be something there.</p>

<p>All Im saying is that the shit is sus and a lot of other people, millions even, think its sus. Some believe it. Some think it needs investigating.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all Im saying. </p>

<p>Now as for law enforcement. It doesn&#39;t matter if they believe it or not. They are controlled by the elites and cannot act against them. So they don&#39;t matter any more than any other individual does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is there to talk about when the only evidence we have is a PDF provided to the public by the MSM, and &quot;anonymous agents&quot; pushed forward by the MSM?  There is nothing for those who could investigate to truly investigate, as is always the case with assertions from authority.  This is the key difference between Pissgate and Pizzagate and a perfectly plausible, non-partisan, reason why the people here have not latched onto the former as vehemently as the later.</p>

<p>What would they look at, his travel record?  All they would find is that he did in fact travel to Russia, as he and Russia both agree on. They wouldn&#39;t find anything publicly available to corroborate that aspect of story.  </p>

<p>His business ties to Russia?  Can&#39;t do that, he won&#39;t detail them, and there is plenty of public outcry requesting that, maybe we can revisit this one once he provides more information, I&#39;m sure that will be soon.</p>

<p>The evidence asserted in the dossier of communication between Trump and &quot;The Kremlin&quot;?  Don&#39;t have that either. Surprising.</p>

<p>The evidence that Russia hacks things? I&#39;m pretty sure at this point they&#39;d show you their scripts.  They&#39;re hardly denying it.</p>

<p>What else is there to go on that isn&#39;t already either being demanded by the media and public or completely inaccessible and most likely already destroyed?</p>
