        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As much as we all want Julian Assange to be safe and sound, you need to know that over 300 posts from Reddit users have been deleted from both WhereIsAssange and Wikileaks and the users banned for trying to exposed two compromised mole troll mods who do not allow people to post this Anonymous video (they claim it was already posted in another thread but will not give a link to the thread)   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlpqYMpOOD0">www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlpqYMpOOD0</a></p>

<p>Upon further investigation, we discovered and outted the newest mod deleting a very active thread just last week. It is all explained here <a href="https://www.scam.com/showthread.php?714524-Scam-Alert!-Reddit-Censoring-Once-Again-This-Time-Wikileaks-amp-WhereIsAssange-sub-reddits">https://www.scam.com/showthread.php?714524-Scam-Alert!-Reddit-Censoring-Once-Again-This-Time-Wikileaks-amp-WhereIsAssange-sub-reddits</a></p>

<p>Also please note in the AMA thread at WhereIsAssange that 90% of the comments made are from Reddit mods from 36 different subs!  A bit odd wouldn&#39;t you say?  This had to be pre-arranged.</p>

<p>The NEW mods that came onboard recently have banned over 30 users in one month and do not allow us to post and talk about this link <a href="http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/public-warning-wikileaks-now-run-cia-technicians-operation-mockingbird-after-julian-assange">http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/public-warning-wikileaks-now-run-cia-technicians-operation-mockingbird-after-julian-assange</a> or anything found at scam.com.  See for yourself.</p>

<p>If you agree that the Wikileaks and WhereIsAssange subs are compromised,please tell five others so we can get to the truth of Julian Assange. A U.S. Secret Service agent leaked that Assange was captured about a month ago, but all trace of that story has been deleted from the internet. He claimed to have overheard Obama ordering a media black out on all things related to Julian until he leaves office. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/warming-whistle-blowers-wikileaks-and-reddit-wikileaks-whereisassange-subs-are-all">http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/warming-whistle-blowers-wikileaks-and-reddit-wikileaks-whereisassange-subs-are-all</a>  About 50 users at VOAT and 4Chan have made the same observations but when we try to discuss or challenge at Whereisassange or Wikileaks we get called shills and then get banned. Draw your own conclusion, but read about the high tech fakery used first that is explained at Scam.com (The Stanford University demo video, the silicone, masks, and voice duplication software that works in real time)</p>

<p>A body double can read sport scores you know. But that is just a fraction of what we noticed... It is likely that Julian was rendered and then waterboarded for the encryptions codes and the CIA simply took over Wikileaks. </p>

<p>If you think the CIA does not use body doubles or we are lunatics in tin foil hats, read up here;</p>
