       No, he doesn't need to leave, he needs to understand that if people disagree, they will state as much, we don't tolerate bullshit from any side here - mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your post is bullshit, we'll call you out and provide evidence to support our reasoning.  Just because someone states "Trump and Putin are not working together", doesn't mean we support either of them.  I know I've called out bullshit, and I don't support Trump.   Claiming this sub is "The_donald2.0" is very cunty.  Borderline shill behaviour.   Provide specific examples to back claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this may be a newbie who thinks we aren't talking about pissgate or whatever because we are biased, when truth is, we've already proven it to be false.   OP really needs to provide examples, because while we do have some very pro-trump individuals, most aren't politically based, but rather fact based.

       Hillary Clinton happens to be at the top of the biggest conspiracy everyone is focusing on right now.

       Hillary Clinton has a unique ability of making everyone hate her.

       But it's not a brigade, it's just how reddit works.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       got exposed to the rest of reddit because a legit conspiracy was brought to the attention of the masses, eg the document saying the Trump campaign was working with Russia (which whether true or not would fit the very definition of a conspiracy). It should surprise no one that this sub would be visited by a lot of outsiders looking for some professional opinions on a conspiracy which was just revealed to them.

       It was a brigade that's why the mods deleted the thread. CTR exists, Trumps equivalent exists, they are paid to be a fast response team to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes reddit threads that get to all will bring lots of people. its the dead zone from being a new thread in conspiracy to being a gilded top of all thread that is suspect. It was not the first thread about it, and a majority of the top posters were all from politics or some other sub that literally posted here the minute it was put up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not all a conspiracy of course, but there are a lot of suspect accounts and votes going on with that thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all i've got to say, its largely irrelevant and impossible to prove for us plebs i suppose but you can easily find the arguments in the 'hot' threads discussing this.

       Conspiratonal for other reasons. Crazy amount of upvoting BEFORE it even reached r/all. If you really want to know, than look for the damn answers, this has been and is being discussed in other areas of this sub. Don't expect people to soon feed you.

       The mods have been around for a lot longer then the trump brigade, and have nothing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't deny that there is heavy pro-trump bias at the moment, but it was an influx from all the pro-trump subs do to all the conspiracies following this election.

      <p>
       This is something new to the sub and most conspiracy theorists who have been through more conspiracies then pizzagate and Wikileaks hate just about every one.

       Seems there would be more posts about mods deleting posts? Front page looks complete with conspiracies involving politics. Not that strange considering the amount of conspiracies surrounding this election? r/politics auto mod deletes low voted posts. Is this happening here too? Anyway what about Trump is hot enough to compete with the other stories?

       You don't think that first one, 17,000 upvotes top of the subreddit, that was removed for "4chan hoax/raid" which is actually completely false (4chan had nothing to do with it) and thus it was removed for completely false reasons is kind of odd?

       The Buzzfeed thread the OP is complaining about received a

       that the story was "unverified" and "included clear errors."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the article was labeled and subsequently removed. As a longtime contributor to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       (as opposed to newbies who recently wandered in from

       and
       <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">
        /r/EnoughTrumpSpam
       </a>
       ), I support the moderators' decision. This is a janitorial decision to remove spam and an obvious hoax, not censorship.

        Correct the Record has come back to life as American Bridge

       No you are intentionally lying. I have to assume it is because you are being paid to do so.

       I personally saw the tag "4chan hoax/raid" on the deleted thread, and the rationale used in the thread that that was the reason. That turned out to be false. That false reason was alt-right propaganda, the same alt-right propaganda the moderators, and I presume you, are trying to spread now.

       Maybe you give some examples, 'cause I really don't see it. I do think that Clinton lends herself more to conspiracy-type comments, as Trump has been pretty straightforward about who he is (he's a rich bully who acts like a rich bully), but Clinton likes to pose as a liberal but is a corporate-sponsored warmonger with more shady events in her life than you can shake a stick at.

       From my understanding the first flair was a quote from the article and the second occurred after it was discovered to be a hoax and as a result of brigading and vote manipulation. That was also why it was eventually removed.

       Why has no other thread ever been labeled like this?

       The 4chan connection has been proven to be wrong.

       Actually lots of posts have been flaired similarly, if not exactly, the same. I know I've flaired lots of them with "misleading" and some with "hoax".

       Another mod, TheGhostOfDusty was renowned for adding similar flairs too.
