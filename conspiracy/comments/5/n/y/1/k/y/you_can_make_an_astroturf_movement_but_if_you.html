       With that I mean that these media narratives and coordinated movements are becoming more and more obvious. I don't give two shits about Trump, but it's obvious there are a bunch of Olivia Pope's out there spinning this Russian narrative and have been since before the election. Now we have this subreddit suddenly flooded with pro DNC accounts the same moment that Piss story hit? These shills don't comprehend that their mere presence and obviously stenciled talking points reeks of PR to anyone not blinded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can come.in here and try to convince me the whole Trump /Putin trash is a legit conspiracy, but normally real conspiracies aren't put on blast in the media, paraded by the CIA, and shunned by conspiracy communities.

       So why didn't one of those 11 veto it? And the donations to the Clinton foundation were all around her 2008 campaign for President before anybody knew she was even going to be Secretary of State.
      </p>

       Not to mention the terms of the deal mean that Russia can't ever take that uranium out of the US, and that Russia didn't even have shares in the company involved in the deal until 2009.

       I guess it's just a coincidence that a company that paid her 2.5 million dollars ended up getting a shit ton of uranium in a deal she happened to give approval too

       So let me just make sure I understand your timeline right.
       <br/>
       2008 Russia donates to the Clinton foundation, most likely to curry favor with somebody who is in the running to be the next president.
      </p>
      <p>
       2009 Russia buys 17% stake in Uranium One (the company in the deal)
      </p>
      <p>
       2010 Russia ups its stake to a controlling interest (51%)
      </p>
      <p>
       2013 The state department is one of nine government agencies to approve the uranium deal which involves no uranium leaving the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you say the company gave her money.  The company never gave her money.  Russia donated to the Clinton foundation, the company never gave Clinton anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're trying to establish a quid pro quo, in which Russia donates 2.5 million 5 years before the deal, before they were even involved in the company and before anybody knew Hillary was going to be secretary of state.
      </p>
      <p>
       So according to you Russia is sneaky enough to have all this planned out in a nefarious plot to steal our Uranium (that never left the country) by bribing a corrupt politician. But we shouldn't be wary of them or buying into any of this "new red scare bullshit".

       It wasn't actually selling Uranium to Russia, it was approving the sale of a US company that has Uranium holdings in the United States to Russia.  The company Uranium One, has a much greater amount of holdings in Kazakhstan which was probably the original reason for the Russian purchase of the company as they produce a LOT more Uranium than the US, which does not have that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a lot of people benefit from being able to splash "CLINTON SOLD RUSSIA 20% OF OUR URANIUM!" all over the news, which is why it became such a big deal.

       This is a story about Clinton's 2016 campaign advisor, who had no official position in the state department at the time the deal was made, receiving money from Russia to lobby for Russia (his job), and accusing him off insider trading in an unrelated company.

       The US simply doesn't have a uranium mining industry anymore. American ore is of a lower grade and more difficult to obtain than Australian, Canadian and khazak deposits.

       The US wanted rid of its mining business and the deal was a reflection of that. There is no national security risk inherent in such a sale.

       And in all that conjecture not a single peep as to WHY this company donated 2.5 million to the Clinton foundation. It's cute how you deflected by pointing out they paid her foundation she uses as an ATM instead of her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way, your time line is a blatant lie, this is directly from the NYT article on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well."
      </p>
      <p>
       So she received donations before Obama was president that she neglected to mention when he was president, huh? Or perhaps your time line is horse shit and you're lying about the donations? Which brings into question the rest of your argument?

       The funny part is how based on zero evidence you can feel so much convinction that Trump is up to something, while simultaneously talking away a multi-million dollar payout between two parties that later on completed a transaction for one fifth of the USA's uranium. Maybe if she peed on the check they cut her you'd be interested

       It wasn't a two party transaction, it was a ten party transaction, as I've said multiple times now, and as I've also said multiple times now the uranium never left the country and the US doesn't lose control over its use.

       Normal procedure. Ideas get passed around and copied and pasted by the different think tanks to create the perception of an expert consensus before they are introduced to the plebes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best one by far is the NATO handbook that uses Russian sources accusing the US of cyber warfare as proof that the Russians are doing it, and the details they project onto the US are accurate details of their own programs, which they have foolishly publicly exposed. Classic I am rubber, you are glue.
