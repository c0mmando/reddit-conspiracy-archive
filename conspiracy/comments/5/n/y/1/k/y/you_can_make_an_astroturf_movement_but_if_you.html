    <div class="md"><p>So let me just make sure I understand your timeline right.<br/>
2008 Russia donates to the Clinton foundation, most likely to curry favor with somebody who is in the running to be the next president. </p>

<p>2009 Russia buys 17% stake in Uranium One (the company in the deal)</p>

<p>2010 Russia ups its stake to a controlling interest (51%)</p>

<p>2013 The state department is one of nine government agencies to approve the uranium deal which involves no uranium leaving the United States.</p>

<p>Also you say the company gave her money.  The company never gave her money.  Russia donated to the Clinton foundation, the company never gave Clinton anything.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re trying to establish a quid pro quo, in which Russia donates 2.5 million 5 years before the deal, before they were even involved in the company and before anybody knew Hillary was going to be secretary of state. </p>

<p>So according to you Russia is sneaky enough to have all this planned out in a nefarious plot to steal our Uranium (that never left the country) by bribing a corrupt politician. But we shouldn&#39;t be wary of them or buying into any of this &quot;new red scare bullshit&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t actually selling Uranium to Russia, it was approving the sale of a US company that has Uranium holdings in the United States to Russia.  The company Uranium One, has a much greater amount of holdings in Kazakhstan which was probably the original reason for the Russian purchase of the company as they produce a LOT more Uranium than the US, which does not have that much.</p>

<p>But a lot of people benefit from being able to splash &quot;CLINTON SOLD RUSSIA 20% OF OUR URANIUM!&quot; all over the news, which is why it became such a big deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And in all that conjecture not a single peep as to WHY this company donated 2.5 million to the Clinton foundation. It&#39;s cute how you deflected by pointing out they paid her foundation she uses as an ATM instead of her.</p>

<p>And by the way, your time line is a blatant lie, this is directly from the NYT article on it.</p>

<p>&quot;As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.&quot;</p>

<p>So she received donations before Obama was president that she neglected to mention when he was president, huh? Or perhaps your time line is horse shit and you&#39;re lying about the donations? Which brings into question the rest of your argument?</p>

<p>The best one by far is the NATO handbook that uses Russian sources accusing the US of cyber warfare as proof that the Russians are doing it, and the details they project onto the US are accurate details of their own programs, which they have foolishly publicly exposed.
