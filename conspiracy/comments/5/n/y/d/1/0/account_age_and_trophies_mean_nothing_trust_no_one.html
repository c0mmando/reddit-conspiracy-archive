       So I guess selling accounts is a thing, and judging accounts from their age and account trophies don't really mean much.
       <a href="https://upvotes4reddit.com">
        Here is a link
       </a>
       to a page with account details of those currently on sale. There is also a link on that page to the vendors fb page. Ethically I'm not happy about posting the link, but if you really wanted to sell/buy account I'm sure you would find a source anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows how prolific the selling of accounts is and how much damage has been done to Reddit. Sad really. This site is selling up-votes also.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more you know I guess..
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Note; I had posted this earlier, but I guess FB links are a no no, so I deleted and resubmitted using their web site as the link.

        Ever wondered why some links get crazy amounts of upvotes even when they're nothing special ? You guessed it right. Reddit is a social network just like Facebook and Twitter. People buy likes and tweets all the time and it's the same with Reddit. Buying Reddit votes is the most simple solution for professionals and companies who want fast and cheap exposure to their target audience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchasing upvotes is not that simple however. Reddit has a strong anti-spam algorithm and that's why the conventional automated bots and programs don't work. Manual upvoting from real humans and from different unique accounts with unique IPs is needed. And here is where BuyUpvotestFast comes.

       Exactly. If you had 5 people managing 5 accounts through VPNs you could effectively dominate a discussion thread with the ability to up/down vote by 25 votes. In threads we find here, typically 25 votes would crush a comment to the bottom fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was the video from youtube someone posted in the past week or two where the guy did research and found only 10-15 up votes were all that were needed to get the thread trending to the top.

       So this is how the hasbara people would wipe out a thread, or a post. Do you think reddit gave them some kind of unlimited access to do this for free? This could be very costly when done by a group or organization.

       Reddit accounts are free to open and access, and anyoe can sell their accounts. I have my other account with 6 years on it and countless trophies just sitting there pretty much unused for the past couple of months I could sell and probably not miss. I started this account to keep the political talk off of my other one. I could probably shift that other account for $300 or so I bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The company I listed probably isn't the only one buying and selling accounts, so imagine the probably scale of vote buying and account selling.

       Back in 2013, Reddit
       <a href="https://archive.fo/jhvCW">
        made a blog post
       </a>
       that claimed Eglin Air Force Base is Reddit's "Most Addicted City."
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after that, this academic study funded by Eglin was published:

      <p>
       "
       <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5644.pdf">

       " (.pdf)
      </p>

       The US government certainly has the money and resources to manipulate votes and push certain narratives here on Reddit and on other social media platforms. And that's assuming they
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       actively colluding with Reddit's management.

       There were some researchers who may have laid the foundation for buying and selling upvotes.  Apparently they did a test on Reddit, up or down voting various posts and trying to see what happened.  Upvotes posts attracted more upvotes and downvoted ones usually attracted more downvotes even if they contained the exact same content.

       It's been a while since that was talked about, but I swear it was done years ago and was posted in quite a few subs.

       Really?  I'll have to look for that.  The research from before suggested to me that there's multiple ways to manipulate Reddit and it's users, with vote manipulation in a topic being as or more important than vote manipulation of the topic itself.

       I think it's just stuff to make you feel good. But account with the trophies look more legit, so I think they would likely command a higher price on sales

       I saw that from the prices. If I knew that back then and enjoyed being a scumbag I'd have made 50 accounts and trophied the fuck out of them.

       Yeah the trophies make people feel good, they come back, make the default subs their place for news, get all emotional over stuff, and reddit makes advertising dollars and can be used to push a narrative. It's interesting stuff man.

       Basically they found that hitting a thread early with 5-10 up votes for it trending upward more frequently than if it was left to do it organically on its own. Pretty interesting!
