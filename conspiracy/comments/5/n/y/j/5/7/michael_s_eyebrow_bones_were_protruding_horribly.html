       No its not a manly bone structure. It's a man's skull. Look at any woman's eyebrows. There is no bump on the skull. Every man's skull protrudes at the browser.  She is a trans or a man

       Yeah, some have been saying that a long time.  Her shoulders too wide, her walk to manly, the bulge in her crotch occasionally.  I think there was mention that Barack was in a gang of gay guys when he was younger.

       This is just nasty stuff that is tinged with a lot of racism and transphobia. 
Michelle is actually attractive for being how old she is. Why get this nasty about a person who isn't even a government figure? Calling her Michael? It's just mean.

       The point isn't that Obama might be gay, that Michelle might be a transvestite and their children might be hired.

       The point is that if these suspicions are correct then installing them underhanded was meant as a message itself to the USA and its citizens.

       Gay men aren't attracted to transwoman and so what if she was trans? But she's not because there are pics of her pregnant, so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, was she faking the pregnancy a long time ago as some sort of long con?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that she is probably more physically attractive than all the men that the men who have ever called her "tranny" score, but that won't stop them from calling her ugly.

       I consider him a Manchurian candidate and a glorified teleprompter. So what function does he have personally besides that? He was always meant as a symbol, a message. His package was even delivered with a gifted noble peace price.
      </p>
      <p>
       The birth place fake speaks for itself. Ask yourself why would they do all these bad fakes to install somebody who has no inherent political value/currency itself. Couldn't they select somebody without all these issues? I can only conclude that it was by intention, again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the speculation from before would not surprise me at all anymore but I don't know. Personally I surely don't waste any time on Michelle's "attractiveness". It's not the point here.

       Donald Trump is a politician whereas Michelle is just married to one.  And yes it is actually less horrible if a man gets judged by his appearance than a woman because women are generally judged by their appearance more so than their actions or their personality.

       Oh, lord.  Biology deniers.  The 'trans' movement is about destroying identity, not protecting it.  You're exploiting peoples' mental health struggles to advance a cheap, anti-human and anti-science agenda.  Don't sit here pretending to be some sort of good guy.

       That is a stupid comment. You think you know my thoughts on Black beauty? I love Black woman. I think some of the most beautiful woman on Earth are Black.  Whitney Houston was gorgeous. Don't play the race card in every argument.

       So you didn't look or think or research what was said. Thanks for your opinion though. I'm not hate filled racist or uneducated. I have looked at the scientific facts. Not my high-school opinion on things.

       Your attitude is horrible. I put up a fact and because u disagree you say silly things. I have no problem with anyone. Gays trans heds aliens. Just don't lie to me. This is not my original thought. It's been out for a long time. I just noticed how he looked at his husbands speech.

       Have u looked at her. Just saying I'm an idiot is a great way to look at thoughts you don't agree with. This is not my opinion on her. I don't dislike Michael. I saw her bone structure which has characteristics of a male not a female. If you don't agree then buzz off.
