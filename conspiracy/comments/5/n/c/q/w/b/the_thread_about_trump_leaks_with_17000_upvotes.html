<p>Go read the whole story. Trump and NBC were snuggle buddies until NBC backed Univision in the fight over the rights to Miss America. Suddenly, NBC fires Trump from the apprentice and cancels the contracts over Trump pageants.</p>

First it became apparent when they marked that thread &quot;unverified&quot;, while NOT marking any of the other &quot;unverified&quot; anti-Clinton/Pizzagate threads the same way. Then they just removed the thread altogether...and the frontpage is now nothing but people screaming about the CTR-conspiracy. It&#39;s back to being completely pro-Trump again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, there used to be a time on this sub where I WAS able to debate 9/11 theories with people here without getting downvoted into oblivion. I&#39;m the type of person who believes 9/11 was most likely the result of our administration/intelligence agencies either failing massively (different agencies holding different pieces to the puzzle but unable to put them all together in time to see the bigger picture), or they simply knew what was going to happen but <em>allowed</em> it because they knew it would be a good opportunity for them to capitalize in order to take us to war with Iraq. I&#39;m not one of those &quot;inside job&quot; people who believes Bush/Cheney rigged the buildings with explosives themselves.</p>

<p>But I definitely know what you mean...the past few months I&#39;ve been downvoted almost every time I expressed my doubts about Pizzagate on here. Which is a shame, because people should always welcome polite and civil discussions about things like 9/11 and Pizzagate where NONE OF US can know the absolute truth at this point in time. Anyone who acts like they KNOW without a doubt the truth behind these conspiracies should not be listened to.</p>

<p>Any of those three stories is worth having a conversation about. So is the willingness of Buzzfeed to publicly torpedo itself in order to serve as a semi-credible repository for mainstream media to point to so they can have the conversation they want to have without dirtying themselves.</p>

<p>I think this goes back to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mdssc/trump_and_nbcuniversalcomcast/">NBC/Comcast vs Trump</a> that I tried to start a conversation about a while back, but no one wants to talk about that either for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny.</p>

<p>Liberal media outlet counters another liberal media website&#39;s fake news.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when you know how much bullshit is being floated around for people to read.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing with the guy from Project Verita&#39;s video.</p>

<p>Every Democrat loves him because he&#39;s a Democrat. But when he&#39;s recorded telling a reporter how he supports voter fraud - every single liberal turns their backs on him and calls him a liar.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t even trust each other. How do you expect us, the American public, to trust them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what do you have to gain from this thread? if you want to actually talk about the allegations, it&#39;s no skin off anyone here&#39;s nose, we know how to ignore things since we deal with disinfo all the time. it seems like you&#39;re taking modding action to mean either that the allegations are true (which is fallacious and no one here would accept that as evidence) or that r/conspiracy is a cesspool of censorship, which you can draw your own conclusions about. but what do you gain from trying to convince others of either of these? if you think the allegations are true, investigate and come up with some real evidence. if you think r/conspiracy sucks, then no one is stopping you from leaving. so what was your purpose in making this thread?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, there used to be a time on this sub where I WAS able to debate 9/11 theories with people here without getting downvoted into oblivion. I&#39;m the type of person who believes 9/11 was most likely the result of our administration/intelligence agencies either failing massively (different agencies holding different pieces to the puzzle but unable to put them all together in time to see the bigger picture), or they simply knew what was going to happen but <em>allowed</em> it because they knew it would be a good opportunity for them to capitalize in order to take us to war with Iraq. I&#39;m not one of those &quot;inside job&quot; people who believes Bush/Cheney rigged the buildings with explosives themselves.</p>

<p>But I definitely know what you mean...the past few months I&#39;ve been downvoted almost every time I expressed my doubts about Pizzagate on here. Which is a shame, because people should always welcome polite and civil discussions about things like 9/11 and Pizzagate where NONE OF US can know the absolute truth at this point in time. Anyone who acts like they KNOW without a doubt the truth behind these conspiracies should not be listened to.</p>
