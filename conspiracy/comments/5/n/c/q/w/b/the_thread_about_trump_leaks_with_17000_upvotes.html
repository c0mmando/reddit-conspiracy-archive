       It's been compromised and run by pro-Russian stooges. This has been going on for years.

       This is the first time that something critical about Russia has hit the front page in ages and it got an incredible amount of attention.

       do you have a source for your assertion?  To be clear... that the mods are compromised by... the Russians? Do you realize how fucking stupid that sounds? That Russia Trump post is more CIA disinfo, and should have been deleted. Wake up to reality, your games don't work here.

       the main source of vote and comment PAID manipulation on reddit is the American political establishment run by corporations. When you start talking about Russian influence, it's painfully obvious that you are spouting CIA / Corporate talking points.

       Now as to whether you are spouting corporate talking points and manipulating people, that's just my opinion. I'll leave it to others to consider that. I wouldn't want to break rule 10, as I respect the mod team here.

       But it isn't the Democratic narrative. It is a personal grudge match between the President and Comcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go read the whole story. Trump and NBC were snuggle buddies until NBC backed Univision in the fight over the rights to Miss America. Suddenly, NBC fires Trump from the apprentice and cancels the contracts over Trump pageants.

       This isn't about propaganda. Its about dueling empires.

       Meh.  Maybe, maybe not.  Being brigaded is a difficult situation to deal with.  Let it roll, and maybe take over?  Nip it in the bud?  Hope that the truth reveals itself, and doesn't get lost in the rabid mob of wheels?  I don't know.

       The posts screaming oh noes Russia are downvoted because they're stupid, not because there's an agenda. If you stuck around here for a while, you'd figure that nationalism isn't really all that important and that our enemies aren't countries but ideas

       Yup, I completely agree with you. This sub has finally just revealed its true colors and it appears only a few people (like yourself) noticed what happened. First it became apparent when they marked that thread "unverified", while NOT marking any of the other "unverified" anti-Clinton/Pizzagate threads the same way. Then they just removed the thread altogether...and the frontpage is now nothing but people screaming about the CTR-conspiracy. It's back to being completely pro-Trump again.

       This subreddit has been compromised, everyone. It's now being used as a pro-Trump propaganda front for places like the_donald.

       It's not conclusive, that is a given. It is however highly incriminating.

       I like how you tried to play like it was conclusive by suggesting that I "look at the evidence". I knew I could shut down your bs easily by going back and finding more quotes that prove inconclusiveness so I took my time :)

       Incriminating yet inconclusive evidence may include something like a murder weapon being found under your bed. We know that it was that gun that fired the bullet but we don't know if it was you who fired the fatal shot.

      <p>
       Other evidence would be used to tie you to the crime, like motive, like the Russians have.

       And this is the reason I actually somewhat appreciated places like r/conspiracy in the past. I HATE subreddits where majority opinion insists on silencing/censoring any dissent. r/conspiracy used to have a good level of skepticism towards BOTH major political parties and politicians. These days it's clearly pro-Trump and anti-Democrat.

       Believe it or not, there used to be a time on this sub where I WAS able to debate 9/11 theories with people here without getting downvoted into oblivion. I'm the type of person who believes 9/11 was most likely the result of our administration/intelligence agencies either failing massively (different agencies holding different pieces to the puzzle but unable to put them all together in time to see the bigger picture), or they simply knew what was going to happen but
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       it because they knew it would be a good opportunity for them to capitalize in order to take us to war with Iraq. I'm not one of those "inside job" people who believes Bush/Cheney rigged the buildings with explosives themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I definitely know what you mean...the past few months I've been downvoted almost every time I expressed my doubts about Pizzagate on here. Which is a shame, because people should always welcome polite and civil discussions about things like 9/11 and Pizzagate where NONE OF US can know the absolute truth at this point in time. Anyone who acts like they KNOW without a doubt the truth behind these conspiracies should not be listened to.

       well I think it's because recently the one who does shady things are bill clinton wife and friends, and trump mostly just tweeting, and leftist think trump is just stupid people, while bill clinton wife has lots of connection to big player who running things from behind the scene, so it's just natural that recently there are more anti democrat post at

       How was it "horseshit" precisely?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was definitely a conversation to be had about the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either John McCain is trying to discredit Trump with really flimsy info, or the CIA is totally inept, or Trump is a sexual deviant and his team are taking %20 of a Russian oil company as payment for removing sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any of those three stories is worth having a conversation about. So is the willingness of Buzzfeed to publicly torpedo itself in order to serve as a semi-credible repository for mainstream media to point to so they can have the conversation they want to have without dirtying themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this goes back to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5mdssc/trump_and_nbcuniversalcomcast/">
        NBC/Comcast vs Trump
       </a>
       that I tried to start a conversation about a while back, but no one wants to talk about that either for some reason.

       I am not supporting them. I am pointing out that a play is being made here by people with opposing interests. Buzzfeeds tiny remaining shred of credibility as a source that sometimes occasionally repeats something correctly is about to be obliterated in what I view as a move by Comcast to set Trump up for impeachment.

       Buzzfeed has zero credibility to informed users. Informed users are NOT the target of this action. This is targeted at people who primarily use sources like television news because those people aren't aware of Buzzfeeds credibility gap... all they will hear is "Source X released this post."

      <p>
       Then the inevitable investigation into Buzzfeed will happen, but not before the story has traction.

       Liberal media outlet counters another liberal media website's fake news.

       Every Democrat loves him because he's a Democrat. But when he's recorded telling a reporter how he supports voter fraud - every single liberal turns their backs on him and calls him a liar.

       what do you have to gain from this thread? if you want to actually talk about the allegations, it's no skin off anyone here's nose, we know how to ignore things since we deal with disinfo all the time. it seems like you're taking modding action to mean either that the allegations are true (which is fallacious and no one here would accept that as evidence) or that r/conspiracy is a cesspool of censorship, which you can draw your own conclusions about. but what do you gain from trying to convince others of either of these? if you think the allegations are true, investigate and come up with some real evidence. if you think r/conspiracy sucks, then no one is stopping you from leaving. so what was your purpose in making this thread?

       Are you serious? It's a huge story dominating all media.

       It got so big because it hit the front of /all and non conspiracy users joined the conversation.

       Your comment is slightly inaccurate.  Let's try it again.  "It got so big because non conspiracy users joined the conversation and brigaded it to the front of /all".  Our entire media infrastructure is a joke.  They are a pack of liars who push the narrative given to them by our government.  If you'd been in r/conspiracy long, you'd have noticed that we aren't very trusting of any MSM.

       Perhaps those of you who feel something wrong has happened here should start your own conspiracy subreddit and talk amongst yourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This of us who have been here for a while and paid very close attention to what happened last night and what's happened over the past several months with this ridiculous "leak" know exactly what went down.

       I am definitely taking note of users' names, both in this thread and the original failed clusterfuck, for future reference.

       Believe it or not, there used to be a time on this sub where I WAS able to debate 9/11 theories with people here without getting downvoted into oblivion. I'm the type of person who believes 9/11 was most likely the result of our administration/intelligence agencies either failing massively (different agencies holding different pieces to the puzzle but unable to put them all together in time to see the bigger picture), or they simply knew what was going to happen but
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       it because they knew it would be a good opportunity for them to capitalize in order to take us to war with Iraq. I'm not one of those "inside job" people who believes Bush/Cheney rigged the buildings with explosives themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I definitely know what you mean...the past few months I've been downvoted almost every time I expressed my doubts about Pizzagate on here. Which is a shame, because people should always welcome polite and civil discussions about things like 9/11 and Pizzagate where NONE OF US can know the absolute truth at this point in time. Anyone who acts like they KNOW without a doubt the truth behind these conspiracies should not be listened to.
