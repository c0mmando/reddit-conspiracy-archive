    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about narrative. So long as every single news story fits into their established narrative of a population split neatly up by race, class, ideology, etc., they don&#39;t have to think critically about anything and their business model of being supported by donors so long as they peddle their agenda can stay in place. They all get to keep their jobs... which is nice, because god knows they couldn&#39;t make a profit by telling the truth thanks to the internet.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Trump, but he&#39;s defied their narrative and has questioned things that were supposed to just be accepted as Truth... 9/11, Clinton corruption, climate change, media bias, Obama&#39;s birth cert, globalist trade deals, etc. We were never meant to question any of these... we were supposed to laugh at and mock people that brought them up. The people that <em>did bring them up</em> were supposed to be fringe anarchists that were isolated from society...</p>

<p>Now, the doubt is creeping heavily into the mainstream and poisoning their well. Their reaction of outright propagandist strategies (while labeling dissent as &quot;fake news&quot;) says a lot about how afraid they are of their utter irrelevance in the modern world.</p>

You can call Obama a neoliberal all day long if you want (and I&#39;m not saying I disagree) right/wrong or indifferent.

<p>We are all just voting for our approximation of what closely relates to our belief system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to forget that the party behind Trump is mostly a party of neoliberals. Plus, his tax policy is neoliberal (gross economic inequality). If Trump somehow manages to end global trade (first in world history), then he can prove me wrong. Until then, his cabinet choices (corporate on roids) and the people backing him don&#39;t help the perspective that Trump is against the establishment.</p>

<p>The real establishment in American society is the corporate 1%, and Trump is apart of it. Plus he supports the Patriot Act, so your the fight for your conspiracies isn&#39;t going to get better.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s funny that the &quot;alt-right&quot; or whatever you want to call it likes to blame the government for being corrupt and wants them to have less power.  The liberals like to blame corporations for being corrupt and want them to have less power by giving the government more power.  In reality people are corrupt and whatever people run will be subject for abuse.  The only real way to combat this is a system of actual working checks and balances because people can never be trusted to much power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why you think government isn&#39;t corruptible by the same forces that corporations are.  Anywhere there is a potential for power and people are involved there will be corruption.  This is what laws are for.  In order for laws to work everyone must follow them including the government.  Why do we need 3 letter agencies that have the power to grant themselves more power?  You don&#39;t think there are other ways of keeping things in check?  What about the DEA?  You think we need an agency that has the power to classify what is and what isn&#39;t legal for you to put in your mouth while simultaneously making profit from civil forfeiture for these very same substances?</p>

<p>The original government had checks an balances.  Now we have rogue agencies seeking their own power without much check.  Hell just think what the CIA is capable of.  You think the people in power in government positions have some sort of moral superiority or what?  </p>

<p>Believe it or not but for the last ~50 or so years it has been the will of the American people to make those drugs illegal and they kept voting for representatives to keep it that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually thats not true either if you wanna be specific. The DEA can petition the department of Health and Human Services to re-examine a substance and make a recommendation to reschedule it, but thats not unique to the DEA. Companies or even citizens can submit these petitions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the DEA feels a substance should be reclassified, the agency can request a scientific and medical evaluation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to determine if there are safe medical uses for the drug in question. Anyone from a drug company to a local government or even an individual citizen can also petition for review of a drug.</p>

<p>Whatever conclusion HHS determines &quot;shall be binding on the attorney general as to such scientific and medical matters,&quot; according to the law. That means the DEA cannot change the classification of a drug unless HHS says there are medical uses and it’s safe for consumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just know that the DEA has the power of emergency scheduling because I almost watched them do it with Kratom before there was so much outrage they retracted.  They may have petitioned the department of HHS and if that is true I would say the HHS goes along with whatever the DEA petitions.  Is there any instances you know of where the DEA petitioned the HHS and their recommendation was denied?  It seems that is more of a formality than a check.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it a formality? The HHS runs safety tests through the FDA. Im not defending our drug scheduling since it is pretty arbitrary, but thats because those drugs were scheduled by act of congress in the 1970&#39;s under Nixon before testing and science was necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corporations <strong>are</strong> the force corrupting the government, though. </p>

<p>The problem has always been that what is good for a corporations bottom line: underpaid employees, no benefits, no taxes, no regulations, is almost unanimously BAD for the people as a whole.  </p>

<p>Corporations have reached such monolithic status because they&#39;ve successfully infiltrated and corrupted the government to their whim.  A completely dismanted government won&#39;t help competition and capitalism, it&#39;ll just further enpower the oligopolies that already own the major industries.  </p>

<p>You think the government is bad for you because it was invaded long ago by corporate interests that created bills to give themselves massive taxpayer subsidies and loopholes to avoid taxes, then the government is forced to overtax the little guy to make up the deficit.  </p>

<p>If you look into the history of many 3 letter agencies, you&#39;ll see they&#39;re part of the Deep State.  The Deep State was created by the corporate elite: Rockefeller, Bush, etc. to serve the ruling elite while operating under a quasi-governmental moniker to shield them from scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just said it was not justified to bash the corruption of trump because he wasn&#39;t in office. You took no issues with using clintons&#39; past in different offices as solid proof of her corruption, but will no look at trumps past the same way? </p>

<p>My point on the MSM is that many people nowadays have taken their skepticism TOO far, and literally only think the stories they agree with are not fake news. MSM&#39;s lines are blurred more and more in our modern era. Many people confuse FAKE CNN, etc sites, which are fairly easily run and manipulated, compared to a massive corporation, with bad reporting and call both fake news. </p>

<p>The truth is, the media is full of both truth, snippets of, bold lies and agenda pushing. Disinformation and misdirection abound everywhere, and alt media needs EXTRA scrunity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the good thing about MSM, you can verify CNN, and they MUST use some caution with reporting, as there are laws. Fly by night website will never be brought to court like nbc would. They can say ANYTHING. CNN cannot. </p>

<p>The statement that Either everything MSM claims is an absolute lie, or it&#39;s all verified and fact is NOT reality. You shouldn&#39;t disregard information soley on bias against the platform. Be wary, yes, question, please. But don&#39;t put your head in the sand or only listen to one outlet.There&#39;s disinfo everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enlighten me on how trumps &quot;Russian ties&quot; are anywhere near the level of corruption seen in the Clinton foundation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not making a comment on the MSMs reporting necessarily but rather their attitude and agenda. The CIA is blatantly connected to he Washington post and NYT. The CIA is what everyone on this sub knows not to trust. The CIA is in bed with many media organizations and wikileaks proved that the Clinton campaign, and likely the foundation as a whole are even further in bed with the MSM. They all have an agenda. There is no free reporting when it comes to the MSM, I don&#39;t think anyone should allow anything they say to influence their opinions. </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think alt right media is in any way trust worthy either. It takes critical thinking and constant skepticism to try to see the bigger picture. But it&#39;s important to recognize an agenda and see their potential motives. The establishments motives are to maintain power in order to create a one world government. That&#39;s pretty obvious. Trump&#39;s (and I&#39;ll just entertain the Russian motive too) are to <em>challenge</em> the current standing powers. The current powers are known to be corrupt and diabolical. If the worst theorized about them is true, it would be hard for trump and Putin to be worse. </p>

<p>I think there is a significant amount of evidence at this time to suggest that, at this time, trump can be considered a potential &quot;outsider&quot; and a challenge to the MSM based on their constant conflict.</p>

<p>If trump is part of it and this was all planned and it&#39;s going accordingly, cudos to them for creating this massive facade, but fortunately there&#39;s more evidence suggesting otherwise. </p>

<p>Seriously, I can&#39;t believe so many self-professed conspiracy theorists are latching on to a politician like that person is their savior. Disturbing</p>

<p>Most of us aren&#39;t. For once, we have someone who isn&#39;t an establishment elitist in office, and he might do some good, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not fair game for criticism if he screws us over or sells out. He&#39;s no Thomas Jefferson and I was very skeptical at first, because of his ties to the Clinton family and possible Bilderburg connection. That might prove to be something; maybe he&#39;s controlled opposition, but maybe he&#39;s woke AF and legitimately trying to help us fight the globalists. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see what he does once he takes office. </p>

<p>Prior to running for POTUS he was a mixed bag, said some things that made him sound like he was &quot;on our side&quot;, like questioning the official 9/11 story, but some things that made him sound like he definitely wasn&#39;t (&quot;Bill Clinton was the best President of the past x years&quot;, Obamacare works, conflicting stances on the War in Iraq, etc.).</p>

<p>I think the litmus test will be to see whether or not he goes after the Federal Reserve and the UN in his first 4 years. If not, then either he&#39;s a globalist who&#39;s saying the right things to get into office or he&#39;s not quite as woke as we thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an experience that helps us grow as people... people are literally learning to learn again... Teaching themselves how to teach themselves. This wasn&#39;t a huge problem before... the system was designed to keep everyone in the dark so they had no choice but to agree with the established narrative or labeled a nutcase...</p>

<p>It&#39;s the wild wild west now in people&#39;s minds... a shootout between their own beliefs... I had to apologize to plenty of people in the last few months because I had long held beliefs backed up by &quot;science&quot; and never realized that &quot;science&quot; isn&#39;t always reliable... It started when they told me there were only 8 planets after there had been 9 for so long... I&#39;m sure people felt the same way when suddenly someone claimed there was more than just Earth out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I like about this sub... it is just free thought running wild and free... unrestrained by the boundaries of what we&#39;ve been taught in school. Nothing is off bounds... no one is pummeled into submission because their theory &quot;isn&#39;t true&quot;... One big party of people saying &quot;What if...?&quot; and expanding on the ideas... fact to support... facts to detract... bunking... debunking... but in the end what it boils down to is... people are thinking... actual honest to God thought! In this day and age... it is beautiful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hulimilty people. Let me just quote the great u/PleiadianBigfoot </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the key elements of research is humility. It&#39;s realizing that every piece of information you digest is second hand information. Unless you happen to be there and witness it for yourself, you never have 100% proof it went down the way you see it in the news.
Every day I read dozens upon dozens of articles. And every day I try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I read it all: mainstream, foreign press, alternative, conspiracy, fringe, govt documents, etc. and the more I learn the more questions I have.
I&#39;ve been researching for 30 years. And in thirty years I have never seen society so split on what truth is. Every group is in firm belief the other groups are misinformed sheep.
I learned a long time ago not to share information in a declarative fashion. I share what I learn in an inquisitive fashion. Because what I&#39;m sharing may or may not be true.
And therein lies the wisdom. We don&#39;t know. We may pile up more evidence in one area or another, and start to see a consensus forming, but how much do we really know?
My advice to anyone new on the path of studying current events or conspiracy or anything for that matter is to be as objective and detached and as neutral as possible. Never instantly accept what you see, and never instantly reject it either. Cross reference as much as you can. Let it float around your head. Don&#39;t turn it into a belief system. Always let the information you digest be malleable, so you can add to it and shape it and let it grow naturally. Allow yourself to go down the rabbit hole without effort.
People have a tendency to cherry pick information to bend to a belief system they have already created for themselves. Then they justify their belief system with said information. It&#39;s better to just digest the info without any emotional or personal attachment. That&#39;s not easy of course. But you see the results everyday on comment sections of how reactionary people can be. Most people do not respond. They react. It&#39;s an emotional reaction. They then proceed to tell you what went on where and how such and such went down and suddenly they are all master sociologists who call you names because they don&#39;t agree with you.
And now it&#39;s reached a point where we may actually have our alternative media shut off, according to this latest news of congress passing a bill to censor alternative news.
We are on a very slippery slope. Not only is critical thinking and a wise approach to research not being encouraged, it is being legally threatened. We have an establishment which historically controlled what people learned, and then along comes the Internet, with peer to peer knowledge, and an entire new world sprang forth. And this world is a massive threat to the status quo.
So please, whether you have researched only a few months, or are a veteran doing it for decades, always keep in mind that research means nothing without humility. Don&#39;t bother getting into pissing contests with strangers family or friends over who is right or wrong. Just plant your seeds. They will grow. The paradigm can only shift one person at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol just a bunch of hippy bullshit. Humans will never ever work together like you hippies want. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t want that too happen but the natural state of nature is war. You think when you look at a forest you see a nice peaceful scene of plants and animals working together. Me I see a war zone of plants competing against each other for light and nutrients. The trees at the top don&#39;t care about the shrubs at the bottom. As soon as you are nice and try to work together with those around you someone will come and take advantage of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not mad. Even if Trump only lasts a week in office, he ended the Bush and Clinton dynasties forever.  For that I salute him.  He also potentially ended the center right shift in the Democratic Party.  That would also be a great outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re not mad. For the people on the left, it&#39;s time to get over it and get back to their lives. To the people on the right, it&#39;s time to quit &quot;high fiving&quot; and get back to their&#39;s too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 63, a retired teamster. As I&#39;ve told many people...you will be amazed at what little impact Donald Trump or any other president (Democrat or Republican) will have on your life.</p>

<p>You&#39;re still going to get up and go to work. You&#39;re still going to go out to dinner, go to the movies, watch your favorite TV shows, etc.</p>

<p>I saw this morning where some pissed off Hillary supporter has started a campaign to boycott L.L.Bean because the &quot;company&quot; donated $50,000 to Trump&#39;s super-pac campaign fund without even considering the people that work there, many of which may have even voted for Hillary. They&#39;re willing to put people out of work for their childish revenge.</p>

<p>The Democrats want this division to continue and the media helps them by continuing to stir the pot. I think the media is mad because they were made to look like fools. Did you see the magazines that were on the newsstands the night of the election with Hillary&#39;s picture on the cover saying, &quot;Madam President&quot;? They looked like idiots having to go out and pull all those magazines.</p>

<p>Every president ever elected is a crap shoot. What they say they&#39;re going to do and what they&#39;re actuall able to accomplish are often two different things.</p>

<p>Donald Trump won for two reasons. People are tired of the same old politicians and wanted to see what a business minded person could do, and it&#39;s not that they didn&#39;t want a woman president...they just didn&#39;t want THAT woman.</p>

<p>It is what it is, let&#39;s see what he can do for America. In the meantime, people need to relax, put it behind them, and just start enjoying their lives again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes back much further.There have been <a href="/r/RomeRules/">infiltrating interests</a> in existence since long before the North American continent was conquered. The Articles of Confederation were born of this fear. Then the powerful retaliated with the US constitution.</p>

<p>&quot;All the perplexities, confusions, and distresses in America arise, not from defects in their constitution or confederation, nor from want of honor or virtue, as much from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.&quot; 
- John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson (25 August 1787) The Works of John Adams</p>

<p>&quot;No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.&quot; 
- The Constitution of the United States, Article 1, Section 10, Clause 1</p>

<p>When questioned why Parliament had lost respect among the people of the Colonies, he answered: &quot;To a concurrence of causes: the restraints lately laid on their trade, by which the bringing of foreign gold and silver into the Colonies was prevented; the prohibition of making paper money among themselves, and then demanding a new and heavy tax by stamps; taking away, at the same time, trials by juries, and refusing to receive and hear their humble petitions&quot;. 
- Benjamin Franklin, made during his examination by the British Parliament in February 1766, published in &quot;The Examination of Benjamin Franklin&quot; in The Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to the Year 1803‎ (1813)</p>

<p>“I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.” 
- Thomas Jefferson, a letter written to John Taylor on May 28, 1816</p>

<p>&quot;I hope that we may find some means in future, of shielding ourselves from foreign influence, political, commercial, or in whatever form it may be attempted. I can scarcely withhold myself from joining in the wish of Silas Deane - that there were an ocean of fire between this and the old world.&quot;
- Thomas Jefferson, quote from The Crisis! An Appeal to Our Countrymen, on the Subject of Foreign Influence in the United States! (published 1844)</p>

<p>“It is maintained by some that the bank is a means of executing the constitutional power &quot;to coin money and regulate the value thereof.&quot; Congress have established a mint to coin money and passed laws to regulate the value thereof. The money so coined, with its value so regulated, and such foreign coins as Congress may adopt are the only currency known to the Constitution. But if they have other power to regulate the currency, it was conferred to be exercised by themselves, and not to be transferred to a corporation. If the bank be established for that purpose, with a charter unalterable without its consent, Congress have parted with their power for a term of years, during which the Constitution is a dead letter. It is neither necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank, and therefore unconstitutional.”
- Andrew Jackson, veto message regarding the Bank of the United States(1832)</p>

<p>“A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various powerful interests, combined in one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in banks.” 
- John C. Calhoun, Vice President (1825-1832) and U.S. Senator, from a speech given on May 27, 1836</p>

<p>”A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.”
”We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world — no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” 
- Woodrow Wilson, 28th US President, The New Freedom (1913), pages 185 and 201</p>

<p>“Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.” 
- Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography, 1913 (Appendix B)</p>

<p>“The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.”
 - Franklin D. Roosevelt, 32nd US President, letter to Col. Edward Mandell House (21 November 1933); as quoted in F.D.R.: His Personal Letters, 1928-1945, edited by Elliott Roosevelt (New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1950), pg. 373.</p>

<p>“If you are awaiting a finding of ‘clear and present danger,’ then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent… For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.” 
- John F Kennedy, 35th US President, speech delivered on April 27, 1961</p>

<p>&quot;Commercial banks create checkbook money whenever they grant a loan, simply by adding new deposit dollars in accounts on their books in exchange for a borrower&#39;s IOU.&quot; 
- Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Friedman, David H. (1977). I Bet You Thought.... p. 19. OCLC 5356154.</p>

<p>&quot;The 12 regional reserve banks aren&#39;t government institutions, but corporations nominally &#39;owned&#39; by member commercial banks.&quot; 
- Federal Reserve Bank of New York, I Bet You Thought... (1977), p. 27</p>

<p>&quot;Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton [Friedman] and Anna [Schwartz]: Regarding the Great Depression. You&#39;re right, we did it. We&#39;re very sorry. But thanks to you, we won&#39;t do it again.&quot; 
- Ben Bernanke, &quot;Remarks on Milton Friedman&#39;s Ninetieth Birthday&quot; (8 November 2002).</p>

<p>And for the record, the sexism/misogynistic/xenophobic shit is awful. Also please please please don&#39;t bring pizzagate into this. This is a completely separate issue. I would like to not make this a left vs right issue and actually get clarification.</p>

<p>I am a woman who believes in human equal rights for all, and who also believes that the powers that be can and will manipulate the masses to fit their (however nefarious) agendas.
How can I have hope for this nation, forever futile it may be?</p>

<p>I cant remember a time where people on both sides automatically believed info that matches there belief without any research at all.</p>

<p>Its not just the left you T_D motherfuckers are guilty as fuck also.  I want Trump to succedd and I support him but you T_D MFrs just the the libtards make each side hard to like and thus wanting that side to fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, I think you <strong>are</strong> a crazy libtard or a Trump supporter and I don&#39;t see any intermediary. Hahahaha downvote me Reddit I don&#39;t care. I say people gotta get with the program and learn how we&#39;re all being manipulated, learn how the media is manipulating us, how the intelligence agencies are manipulating us, how even the GOP establishment has manipulated us and how ESPECIALLY the Democrats have manipulated us. And if you don&#39;t do that then you&#39;re on &quot;the other side&quot;. The side that does not want truth and prosperity for me or my family. So I will deem you either a Trump supporter or a &quot;crazy libtard&quot;. Fair assessments IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people who support Clinton really are ignorant.  They accuse you of being a racist nazi and then you say something like &#39;which party was abraham lincoln?&#39; they say &quot;democrat of course&quot;.  Wrong.  You ask them who founded the KKK?  They&#39;ll say &quot;republicans of course&quot;  wrong it was wealthy southern democrats (dixiecrats...with connections to freemasonry).  You ask them which religion has overwhelming influence over national security policy.  They&#39;ll say &quot;there&#39;s a separation of church and state....probably none, probably maybe christian?  atheist.  I dunno man you&#39;re asking too hard questions that are really specific&quot;.   Wrong it&#39;s the Jesuits.  Obama&#39;s National Security Council are overwhelmingly graduates from Jesuitical ivy league universities, which are to public schools as unlike Mormon Brigham Young University or Oxford University is.</p>

<p>My point is, yes I get that you say &quot;don&#39;t divide&quot;.  However I&#39;m pointing out that through my conversations with these people and through youtube videos of them (fewer and fewer as I avoid them), I&#39;ve come to realize these people really don&#39;t a) read, b) know anything, c) talk in a productive way, d) care to know anything (anti-intellectual), e) there is no way to inform them without being subjected to their unfocused social justice rage</p>

<p>My issue in this is that they believe--and this is really the crux of the matter--that it&#39;s OK to sacrifice criminal justice for social justice.</p>

<p>I would only agree with that in the cases of prostitution and drugs.  There&#39;s no need to criminalize either one, for anyone involved.  If you can buy alcohol and allow porn, then you ought to be able to buy pot and pay for sex.  That&#39;s not an endorsement of either, and some drugs really are bad for society; but criminalizing them doesn&#39;t solve any problems at all--in fact it only creates more problems.</p>

<p>Try to have a conversation with a liberal over legalizing methamphetamine and theylll say that&#39;s stupid; yet they are all for legalizing pot.  They don&#39;t understand how to be consistent and how not to be a hypocrite.  They don&#39;t understand human liberty actually.  They want to take away the rights of people to speech under the guise of &#39;safe spaces&#39;; they want to be the arbiters of &#39;the line that separates speech from hate speech&#39;, the problem is, they&#39;ll keep moving that line  You either have free speech or you don&#39;t.  It&#39;s enough to say that hate speech has consequences, and nothing has ever stopped people from voluntarily muting people who say things you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Because of these obtuse and repugnant anti-liberty behaviors, the liberals don&#39;t deserve the title of &#39;liberal&#39;, only the libertarian who is against ending drug schedules does and wants speech--for better or worse--to be free is a true liberal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the bloated size and limitless scope of the federal government that puts us at each other&#39;s throats like this.  300 million people only have a small number of things in common that makes sense for a nationstate to cover.  But the politicians want power so they are constantly expanding the scope of their offices. The result is that voters are like criminals who don&#39;t trust each other all fighting over the one gun in the room, more to keep others from using it against themselves then any real desire to impose their own will on others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s much easier to label and act like a condescending asshole than it is to look at the evidence and deduce what&#39;s happening. The biggest problem that the &quot;left&quot; has is that people who consider themselves to be open-minded, free-thinkers are sometimes the most dogmatic and blinded by the label. Both sides suffer from ignorance and dividing ideologies, it&#39;s just interesting that the one that&#39;s suppose to be &quot;morally superior&quot; and &quot;intellectually grounded&quot; is also the one that also plays right into the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just said it was not justified to bash the corruption of trump because he wasn&#39;t in office. You took no issues with using clintons&#39; past in different offices as solid proof of her corruption, but will no look at trumps past the same way? </p>

<p>My point on the MSM is that many people nowadays have taken their skepticism TOO far, and literally only think the stories they agree with are not fake news. MSM&#39;s lines are blurred more and more in our modern era. Many people confuse FAKE CNN, etc sites, which are fairly easily run and manipulated, compared to a massive corporation, with bad reporting and call both fake news. </p>

<p>The truth is, the media is full of both truth, snippets of, bold lies and agenda pushing. Disinformation and misdirection abound everywhere, and alt media needs EXTRA scrunity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the good thing about MSM, you can verify CNN, and they MUST use some caution with reporting, as there are laws. Fly by night website will never be brought to court like nbc would. They can say ANYTHING. CNN cannot. </p>

<p>The statement that Either everything MSM claims is an absolute lie, or it&#39;s all verified and fact is NOT reality. You shouldn&#39;t disregard information soley on bias against the platform. Be wary, yes, question, please. But don&#39;t put your head in the sand or only listen to one outlet.There&#39;s disinfo everywhere. </p>

<p>Think for yourself, question authority. </p>
