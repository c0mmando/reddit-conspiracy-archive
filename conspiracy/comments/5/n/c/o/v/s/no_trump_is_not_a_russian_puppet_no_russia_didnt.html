<p>if only there was a sub that was dedicated to such type of &quot;pointless&quot; speculation, somewhere we can speculate about things like: democrats being missing and dead because they haven&#39;t used twitter in a couple months, or that D.C pizza places are selling child sex slaves from their basement, or if a &quot;leaked list of clinton cabinet picks&quot; posted on some random twitter account is legitimate, or that every shooting is an MKultra false flag, maybe even a place to speculate about how McCain is a homosexual reptilian shape shifter............ </p>

<p>IF ONLY we had a place for such non nonsensical speculation, someone should contact reddit and ask them to address this obvious void by making a dedicated sub for these types of conversations </p>

<p>The degree to which we should take theories or speculation seriously is directly correlated with the amount of evidence to support them.  </p>

<p>MKUltra can be taken seriously because there is &quot;some&quot; evidence to support many of those ideas.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen so much insane, unverifiable bullshit on this sub for the past few months and they didn&#39;t have a problem with ANY of it. There were multiple threads accusing the Podesta brothers of kidnapping McCann, there was another thread accusing Clinton of being a cannibal...all kinds of essentially tabloid nonsense flooding this sub.

There&#39;s no problem with someone examining the possibility, of Trump being with the Russians, or the possibility of the media framing him.

<p>No. Actually, you just proved my point, you were too dumb to even understand what I said.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, was every thread and poster in this subreddit on the pizzagate is 100% real train? I certainly wasn&#39;t. But I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s too strange, either. Hollywood has a giant pedo ring, as does the UK&#39;s elite. It wouldn&#39;t be a big surprise if America&#39;s political elite did as well.</p>

<p>And I guess you missed the megathread last night full of people who absolutely believed 100% that this document is the real deal.</p>

<p>Thanks for failing to address the most relevant point I made. Pizzagate was buried by the media; this Russia bullshit cannot be pushed any harder. Do you honestly think MSM reporting qualified for evidence? Then you are dumber than I thought. All it does is point out that the establishment is desperate to create you guessed it fake news.</p>

<p>Believing a document is real is different then presenting it as a fact and that all the allegations are true. It&#39;s the nuance.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe because you were getting the owner severely harrassed and threatened by a guy with a gun over a conspiracy.</p>

<p>So everyones lying then, Russia had no hand in our elections or Trump at all even though all leads point to the fact they did. Fine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fake news would imply no proof or sources. This is the opposite with the intelligence community as well as this document being their sources and proof. Meanwhile, they aren&#39;t qualified, so who is? Breitbart? Alex. Jones?</p>

<p>Who the hell said I believe everything the CIA says. There&#39;s a point where if enough people back something up, then it&#39;s idiotic to at least not do some research for yourself and find you agree with their statement. There are 16 other intelligence agencies as well as the white house and numerous senators that agree with the sentiment that Russia was involved in our election. Yet you sit here and call me the idiot. Wheres the discussion on this? Where&#39;s the conspiracy about that? Oh right, this is r/the_donald support group, that&#39;s why that isn&#39;t discussed here.</p>

<p>Also. Speaking of idiots. The WMD&#39;s in Iraq were never agreed upon at all by the intelligence community and was actually highly debated at the time. This is the first time in history that the entire intelligence community has backed a unified finding. Do some research before spouting off bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that the dossier was a &quot;4chan hoax&quot; is in itself a hoax. The idea is based on 2 vague posts on /pol/ which don&#39;t actually go into any details - just that someone emailed someone something (and he refused to tell us what was in that email). There&#39;s also misinformation floating around about what&#39;s in the dossier, I&#39;ve seen many people believe that there was something in there about &quot;obama sex dolls&quot; and &quot;hentai&quot; and yet neither or those things are mentioned at all in the dossier.</p>

<p>While I am skeptical of the dossier itself, this &quot;4chan hoax&quot; hoax and misinformation itself shows us there is a big effort to discredit it, which should raise some flags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that simple. There has been quite a bit of discussion in this sub criticizing Trump&#39;s cabinet picks and his attitudes regarding Israel.</p>

<p>The reason this sub keeps attacking the Russia/Trump posts is because they&#39;ve repeatedly been exposed as bullshit propaganda. When one fake story fails, they come up with another (Russia hacked the election, Russia hacked the power grid, Russia has incriminating evidence that Trump likes piss).</p>

<p>This sub saw a very clear agenda by the media to sway the election in Hillary&#39;s favor, and now that she lost, there&#39;s similarly a very clear agenda to sabotage Trump&#39;s presidency. Regardless of your opinions on Trump, these people are openly weakening and destroying our country. We&#39;re tired of their stupid games and false narratives</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t underestimate our adversary.</p>

<p>Reality has been a plaything for the money power since the Industrial Age, and their dominion over reality has only grown more complete. They are at least a century into operations extending their control <em>beyond</em> reality: over <strong>Perception</strong>.</p>

<p>We are in the Post-Truth Era. <strong>Lies</strong> are more powerful than truth, because you can create a new lie by fiat, but there is only a finite amount of truth which can be told.</p>

<p>This is why <em>everyone</em> seems biased: in the Post-Truth Era, neither speaker nor listener deals in the truth, but rather emotion. Mass Media exploits biology, which dictates that one may forget the specifics of the truth, but emotional connections persist in the brain far longer.</p>

<p>This is not esoteric knowledge, but the full context is.</p>

<p>Come on bro, that&#39;s not serious right? Just ask Hillary how government corruption is handled in DC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you nailed it.  Trump needs to be held up to the light and criticized for valid points, but this sub doesn&#39;t need to coddle every piece of disinfo.  And I said the same thing about how pizzagate was presented- and think the mods eventually did an admirable job managing rule 11 with regards to those posts.  They tend to be pretty even handed and not particularly partisan.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sick of the russia putin trump official propaganda coming out of the current administration, state department, intelligence agencies and MSM- and whoever else may be behind it all.  I don&#39;t completely doubt that he has russian ties, but what we are looking at is not organic conspiracy theory- this is state sponsored propaganda and should be called out for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t some pretty hefty reason to suspect that trump has ties to Russia. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people on here spouting how &quot;circumstantial evidence is used in court cases all the time to convict people.&quot; My main concern is why all the lying about not knowing Putin, never meeting him, or have any connection with him. the interview he did for years ago, clearly shows the man is a complete liar. When a man specifically lies about having contact with a powerful political figure, I begin to wonder what that man is hiding. </p>

Jesus, the Kremlin had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych">the President of Ukraine in their pocket</a>, so not exactly a stretch to imagine them getting a military officer to support their propaganda. </p>

<p>Dude, no one is buying this. Ever. I think about the only person left who is still arguing that Russia did not invade Ukraine is Putin himself, and even he doesn&#39;t really expect anyone to actually believe it. The only way anyone could parrot this nonsense is if it is their job. You might have been more successful getting people to the rest of your shilling if you hadn&#39;t added this brazenly Orwellian lie.</p>

<p>The government in Kiev and the US government wanted everyone in the world to believe that Russia had invaded Crimea. Here is a video of a Kiev General who participated in the conflict admitting there were very few Russians, and no Russian military involved in the conflict. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have captured Russian tanks on display in the middle of the public square with the original Russian markings still on them.</p>

<p>So Russia invaded Crimea with tanks and then Ukraine captured those tanks? You believe that shit? </p>

<p>Being involved and actively invading are two completely different things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I said distant family, I meant it. I don&#39;t speak Ukrainian or Russian so I can&#39;t verify what is being said in that video. It also says the video was published on Feb 1, 2014 which is prior to when the vast majority of the fighting took place. </p>

<p>Yes, I believe the Ukrainians captured the tanks. I even put my hand through one of the fist sized holes in the armor caused by an anti-tank weapon. There is zero doubt in my mind that it was a captured Russian tank in front of me. I can upload the pictures when I get home tonight if you are interested. </p>

<p>There is a difference between being involved and actually participating. I believe (along with all reliable sources) that they were actively participating, but in this case I&#39;m not sure how it matters. Either way they still annexed an entire region of another sovereign nation and the world just sat and watched. Heck, there are still some people who cover their eyes and act like it never even happened. </p>

<p>How much more would you like me to post? That other user already gave you numerous links and all you did was respond with the one YouTube video that was from before most of the actual invasion. Before I dig up a bunch of additional links, please tell me the number it would take to change your mind. Something tells me there is no amount of evidence in the world that will get you to admit Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014.</p>

<p>While it is compelling, I still find myself not trusting anything... not even the Wikipedia post I found nor the views being presented in the video.  Everything is open to manipulation and interpretation. </p>

<p>How does anyone know for sure?</p>

<p>I wonder what it would be like to be in the a region under this sort of turmoil and it&#39;s fucking scary. How do those people know they aren&#39;t being lied to? Andd the assholes who took over the Ukrainian government - what if they are being manipulated by US forces/entities?  I saw fuck face McCain.  What is his involvement?</p>

<p>I always hope to know the truth and ever seen the truth. So, thanks for sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it is way more complicated that my simple statement. And more complicated than all of the &quot;Russia did nothing wrong!&quot; responses too. Yes, the people of Crimea did vote to join Russia. Yes, Russia did send in unmarked military units before, during, and after the vote. Do I think Russia did all of this out of the kindness of their hearts and the love of the Crimean people? No, they clearly wanted access to the port of Sevastapol and saw the perfect opportunity for a bit of land grabbing in the aftermath of the Ukrainian Revolution. In the end, it is still considered an illegal annexation since Ukraine still claims the region as theirs and (as far as I&#39;m aware) not a single other nation has officially recognized Crimea as part of Russia. And yes, the United States was doing plenty of their own meddling to try to get a new Ukrainian government favorable to their interests. They&#39;ve also invaded plenty of other countries too. I don&#39;t know why people keep bringing that up as if it makes this okay. I&#39;m well aware of the awful stuff our country has done too. </p>

They even scheduled visits in several ports that they cancelled at the last minute, causing news reports each time.

<p>Nukes still are, and always will be, a M.A.D device. Lets say Russia plants enough nukes to destroy the entire surface of America. When a nuclear Submarine comes to surface to make contact, and don&#39;t make contact, they do have standing orders. But that&#39;s assuming Russia can simultaneously kill everyone in America, without getting retaliation from another country. A war will never happen with nukes. If there is a war, it will be a meat grinder set up to lower the average person&#39;s living conditions. </p>

<p>It is believed that once production starts, the nuclear bombs will be housed on the territory of five European countries – Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perfect. So now Russia needs to not piss off 6 countries. </p>

<p>Also, fun fact. Assuming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons">this</a> is accurate, USA and Russia are, as you imagine, the top 2 for nuclear stockpiles. The seccond being, somehow, France. A fully loaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio-class_submarine">Ohio Class Submarine</a>, with Trident II missiles, will have 288 warheads on board (As they&#39;re cluster nukes). That&#39;s more nukes on a <em>single submarine</em>, than every other country... aside from France. There&#39;s 18 of those subs out there. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got to keep in mind most of the general public could easily be swayed in favor of nuclear arms usage if a small tactical nuke was ever used against America. MSM will spin it up as multiple times worse than the bombs dropped on Japan in WW2, which is possible as Little Boy was 15Kt blast power. Listed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon">Tactical Nuke page</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon">OTR-21</a>, which can fire </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a 100 kiloton nuclear warhead a distance of 185 km</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that&#39;s a tactical nuke, over 6 times as powerful as a bomb dropped in WW2. How much fun would MSM have if that was used against Ally Troops? Suddenly the entire American public is yelling to nuke Russia to glass. </p>

<p>I have to agree the US populace will support what the military considers to be an appropriate nuclear response.  For instance, if North Korea were to nuke someone, I could see an overwhelming response.  Russia, you would probably see an equal response.  But in truth, no nuclear engagement will end well.  Also, we are a bit naive to think that information won&#39;t propagate.  The knowledge of how to create more complex bombs also brings the possibility of creating a doomsday device like a Cobalt-60 bomb. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_bomb">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_bomb</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theoretically, a device containing 510 tons of Co-60 can spread 1g of the material to each square km of the Earth&#39;s surface (510,000,000 km2). Radiation output from 1g of Co-60 over one half life is equivalent to 44000 GBq, which is sufficient to kill any inhabitants. If one assumes that all of the material is converted to Co-60 at 100 percent efficiency and if it is spread evenly across the Earth&#39;s surface, it is possible for a single bomb to kill every person on Earth. However, in fact, complete 100% conversion into Co-60 is unlikely, as 1957 British experiment at Maralinga showed that Co-59&#39;s neutron absorption ability was much lower than predicted, resulting in a very limited formation of Co-60 isotope in practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d agree that to some extent we are fucked because this shit exists.  I&#39;m sure by now someone in Russia, China, or US has figured out how to make a bomb like that more efficient.  Can&#39;t wait until some armageddon-crazed religious fanatic gets their hands on one.  Then there are incidents like the one involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov</a> .   </p>

<p>Due to the situation, any provocation sucks.  And this latest hacking move by Putin was a very dangerous provocation.  If the GOP ever goes back to their traditional stance on Russia, which I suspect they will when Pence takes over after Trump does what Trump does.  They will have a democratic party that fully supports aggressively engaging Russia.</p>

<p>The use of a nuclear engine in the airframe promised to give the missile staggering and unprecedented low-altitude range, estimated to be roughly 113,000 miles (182,000 km) (over four and a half times the equatorial circumference of the earth). The engine also acted as a secondary weapon for the missile: direct neutron radiation from the virtually unshielded reactor would sicken, injure, or kill living things beneath the flight path; the stream of fallout left in its wake would poison enemy territory; and its strategically selected crash site would receive intense radioactive contamination. In addition, the sonic waves given off by its passage would damage ground installations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure by now someone in Russia, China, or US has figured out how to make a bomb like that more efficient.</p>

<p>In theory. We&#39;d be able to detect tests. Both by the seismic waves, and the sudden abundance of Cobalt. As we already have with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel">Low Background Steel</a>. </p>

<p>Once again you&#39;re assuming it&#39;s fact that Russia hacked anything of importance. Not only is there no concrete proof, and the only &#39;proof&#39; I&#39;ve seen is the fact that hackers have different styles, and the style seemed to match Russians, but there&#39;s absolutely no reason to think Putin, or the government of Russia, had anything to do with it. And once again, leaked emails is not that big of a deal, you&#39;re to busy shooting the messenger that you didn&#39;t even read the message. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we agree on MAD.  Anything that makes use of nukes more likely to use it bad.  MAD exists because everyone is afraid to use the nukes.  Pretty much that simple.  The Russian interpretation is that the nukes are bad because US commanders have used the term &quot;[more] ethical&quot; in the describing the new weapon.  The US interpretation is that if we have to use nukes ever, at least we can be more precise and less damaging.  It all depends on who you think has an evil motive I guess.  I do not think that anyone on either side intends to use nuclear weapons in a direct confrontational manner.  Not unless armageddon is triggered.  Many many times over the years they have been used as saber-rattling for the major powers.</p>

<p>As far as the hacking goes.  I believe the US intelligence agencies.  Particularly after the FBI changed it&#39;s position on further review.  I think it shows that there is credible debate going on in the community as well.  US intelligence agencies have a lot of good information and methods that cannot be revealed in a public document. Demanding they give you XKS logs or any other sort of privileged intel that could reveal sources and methods is kinda ignorant.  They just aren&#39;t going to do that.  So if you don&#39;t want to believe the assessment of all 17 intelligence agencies, then don&#39;t. I guess.  But lets be fair, no campaign manager on earth would like their chances in a race where their internal communications were made public.  Whomever perpetrated the hacks and subsequent leak, would probably have known this.  This was not something of no importance, that was stolen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I dismissed the pizzagate &quot;evidence&quot; as well as the spirit cooking &quot;evidence&quot; about just as fast, although I do believe that a lot of this stuff does happen, it was just weak evidence.    </p>

<p>It is too easy to be apt to dismiss conspiracy that involves someone you support/agree with, and be quick to rally around conspiracy that involves someone you don&#39;t; I definitely see that here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I guess if that is your point I can&#39;t really disagree. </p>

<p>That post about Trump having &quot;deep ties&quot; to Russia violated rule number 11 of this subreddit.  They had every right to take it down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol if that rule was actually enforced half of the posts in this sub would be gone. </p>

<p>Remember when this sub said the DC pizza place had kids in thier basement?</p>

<p>Remember how that same DC pizza place has no fucking basement?</p>

<p>Was that post removed? no. The rule is not followed by anyone, not even the mods. This sub is pretty much owned by Trump shills that won&#39;t allow any negative opinions on him</p>

<p>I say this as someone who despises Trump and Clinton both. I&#39;m not partisan on this issue at all, and it&#39;s total nonsense. This is just clear as day for anyone familiar with history and basic critical thinking.</p>

<p>Why should I believe &quot;anonymous sources&quot;? Why should I believe they are credible when Colin Powell said that the intelligence community didn&#39;t tell him that the sources they used for Iraq WMDs were burned? Why should I believe the agencies that lied about Libya? Why should I believe the agencies that lied about Syria and supported religious extremist terrorists?</p>

<p>Please, tell me. Partisanship is a sham, and the facts speak clearly. Anyone with a basic memory and attention span can see the forest for the trees and the farce for what it is. Can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks and we&#39;re seeing the exact same ones time and time again. But please, tell me about how the government didn&#39;t actually make an ambassador&#39;s daughter testify that Iraqi soldiers raided hospitals just to throw babies on the floor. Tell me about that second Gulf of Tonkin attack. Tell me about those fucking WMDs.</p>

<p>This whole media cycle is fucking insane and every sycophant spewing this baseless rhetoric should be ashamed of themselves. History repeats ad nauseum until ya&#39;ll get a fucking clue and stop sucking big corporate dick for scraps.</p>

<p>RT is the best news network around at the moment. Telesur is good too, but it&#39;s not as vast. They are easily the most impartial networks. Their debates are top notch and they are not partisan. They speak of higher issues and cut through the chaff. Their reporters are never belligerent, always reasonable, never on the lookout for shouting matches or drama. </p>

<p>Anyone who criticizes RT conveniently never has an example and has clearly never watched it. Look no further than Abby Martin&#39;s on-air criticism of the network and their response to see just how Kremlin-controlled it supposedly is. By your logic she would be dead by now.</p>

<p>The companies we&#39;re talking about aren&#39;t selling on international conflict, they&#39;re selling security analysis.  The break-in justifies their contracts, not the source.

    <div class="md"><p>And straight away:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin reported in 2006, that suggesting that freedom of speech is non-existent in Russia would be an exaggeration, the constitutional right for speech freedom is basically observed, as well as that there was no institutionalised censorship. Apparently for these very reasons journalists and publishers seldom appeal to the Commissioner protesting restrictions of their right of seeking, receiving, transferring, publishing or distributing information. Yet disguised restrictions exist to a considerable degree, they are often put through the economic pressure on mass media by the authorities and loyal business. The so-called &quot;self-censorship&quot; which induces journalists to refrain from disseminating information which, in their opinion, may not please the authorities, is also widespread. So in many places the right to praise the authorities is ensured, while the opposite right is just formally declared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what America does. Literally all that&#39;s different is that Russia is state capitalist and has direct control over the media, whereas American media is wholly corporate-controlled with a gross relationship between the media, military and government. Military retirees tend to acquire cushy jobs in corporate media as armchair generals shilling for the arms industry and pushing hawkish agendas. I believe there was a rather detailed report on this relationship, I need to dig it up.</p>

<p>Just look at the Podesta emails where political collusion with journalists is fucking rampant. One reporter grovels for his approval over a story. I&#39;d wager that this happens in Russia too, but again, &quot;but he does it too&quot; does not negate the actions of the other, all must be held accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are actually statements from three security companies, in addition to the statements by the FBI and CIA.</p>

<p>The leaks also served Putin&#39;s goals, improved the political power of his American supporters, and were in line with tactics used by the Russian government previously.</p>

<p>The Russian government had the motivation and capacity to perform the attacks, and multiple private companies and US government agencies have claimed the Russian government is likely responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI and CIA are utterly untrustworthy. Corporations even less so, especially when they&#39;ve changed their tune so many times already and keep scrambling for new angles to attack from every time one narrative gets shot down.</p>

<p>What goal did they serve exactly? Trump&#39;s election served many people, literally any of whom could&#39;ve been responsible for these &quot;hacks&quot; going by how sparse your intel is. A teenager could&#39;ve done it for all these agencies and companies you spout know.</p>

<p>There is an endless list of people who have the motivation and capacity to hack the US, including but not limited to the US itself. Private companies and US government agencies are unreliable without actual, tangible evidence. None of which exists because the whole story is a farce.</p>

<p>You still have not given me a single reason why I should trust any of these people. Corporations carry no inherent legitimacy. The intelligence agencies have burned themselves too many times to be taken seriously with no evidence and &quot;anonymous sources&quot; who are unlikely to exist when former members of their own fucking organizations are calling them lunatics.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t trust any of them, you should simply take information provided and come to a conclusion.</p>

<p>In this case, there&#39;s evidence that the Russian government was responsible, <em>proof</em> that the Russian government was motivated, and no exculpatory evidence for either one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please compile a list of sources showing Putin to be untrustworthy and I guarantee I have a list two or three times the size for those agencies. You clearly have not looked into them much if you&#39;re not completely disillusioned with them.</p>

<p>Contractors are not independent once they accept a contract. The moment money enters the picture, everything else goes out the window. Being untrustworthy is not the same as being guilty of course, except guilt.</p>

<p>There is ZERO tangible evidence, just claims, claims, and yet more claims. Perceived motivations are not motivations. To prove motivation, you would need to show that Putin expressed interest in rigging the elections. An act which he evidently failed since Clinton got three million more votes. It would appear he wasn&#39;t trying, because he wasn&#39;t, your entire argument is based on fiction.</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re quick to cite the CIA but seem to conveniently ignore all of the ex-CIA personnel outright saying it is all an outright lie. The fact that the anti-Trump narrative (and I don&#39;t like the cunt) has changed its tune so quickly and so furiously with each passing week only exemplifies this. First it was the electoral college supposedly undermining American democracy (which was so untainted before last year!).</p>

<p>Putin has openly supported Trump.  But when did I say the elections were rigged?  Or even imply that they were?</p>

<p>The evidence provided does not prevent Trump from coming to power.  If they were willing to fake evidence, they could have faked evidence of collusion instead.</p>

<p>They also could have faked more direct evidence, it wouldn&#39;t have been any harder to debunk.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the good old WaPo who made up the story to begin with. That&#39;s funny since Dmitri Alperovitch likes to flow between &quot;high confidence&quot; and &quot;no doubt&quot; quite a bit on his findings. That same article also claims the FBI was investigating Russia&#39;s hacks yet Buzzfeed discovered they didn&#39;t even glance at the DNC. Let&#39;s look at Dmitri&#39;s actual findings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CrowdStrike found that a variant of the Fancy Bear malware that was used to penetrate the DNC’s network in April 2016 was also used to hack an Android app developed by the Ukrainian army to help artillery troops more efficiently train their antiquated howitzers on targets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not evidence of anything. Once out in the wild, malware is open source. Anyone can appropriate and deploy it. They even acknowledge that the one supposedly used here is a variant, meaning it has been modified.</p>

<p>Actually, supporting a person <em>is</em> a motive for committing crimes in support of that person.</p>

<p>A gun can be bought by anybody but if a suspect uses the same model as the perpetrator, that&#39;s evidence of guilt.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Ben Swann ripping your narrative to shreds. Here&#39;s Wordfence dismantling it too. So you have an ACTUAL independent cyber-security firm conflicting with three firms paid by the US government. Interesting, no?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you watched those videos. Because Russian agents were known to use Ukrainian malware, Ukrainian malware is not exculpatory evidence.</p>

<p>And regardless of your constant stream of excuses, the fact remains that there is evidence implicating the Russian government, and no exculpatory evidence to prove innocence <em>or</em> implicate anyone else.</p>

<p>The only testimony to the contrary comes to a person whose credibility was under attack, and whose testimony conflicts with his previous mission-statement.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s absurd.  Any single Trump supporter does not have a history of attacking opponents of the Russian government.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a question of the scale of benefits, because the possibility of a favored president is quite different than the definite removal of sanctions on your country. </p>

<p>Excuses because you&#39;re obviously just posting links rapidfire without paying attention to the contents and making arguments that are only tangentially related but that don&#39;t address the key points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For months, the CIA, with unprecedented clarity, overtly threw its weight behind Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and sought to defeat Donald Trump. In August, former acting CIA Director Michael Morell announced his endorsement of Clinton in the New York Times and claimed that “Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.” The CIA and NSA director under George W. Bush, Gen. Michael Hayden, also endorsed Clinton, and went to the Washington Post to warn, in the week before the election, that “Donald Trump really does sound a lot like Vladimir Putin,” adding that Trump is “the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited.”</p>

<p>It is not hard to understand why the CIA preferred Clinton over Trump. Clinton was critical of Obama for restraining the CIA’s proxy war in Syria and was eager to expand that war, while Trump denounced it. Clinton clearly wanted a harder line than Obama took against the CIA’s long-standing foes in Moscow, while Trump wanted improved relations and greater cooperation. In general, Clinton defended and intended to extend the decadeslong international military order on which the CIA and Pentagon’s preeminence depends, while Trump — through a still-uncertain mix of instability and extremist conviction — posed a threat to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CIA was pushing the Putin puppet narrative long before this nonsense you keep regurgitating even began. After Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign team already used him as a puppet for their &quot;pied piper candidate&quot; and enforced the media to give him millions in free advertising while eliminating coverage of Sanders.</p>

<p>RT was created specifically to address Russia&#39;s media problem. But RT operates independently, its journalists do not receive talking points or bribes from the Kremlin.</p>

<p>There was a case regarding Ukraine when RT&#39;s coverage seemed slanted in favor of Russia, and this was largely due to RT relying on the Russian military as sources. Naturally that&#39;s a rather biased source. Abby Martin criticized it deeply live on air, and there have been no similar incidents since.</p>

<p>RT is consistently one of the best media outlets in the world with some of the best transparency and impartiality. I&#39;ve yet to see evidence otherwise.</p>

<p>&quot;Free speech&quot; (something I&#39;ve seen many disagreements over the meaning of here) is often illegal in America too. It&#39;s just a talking point now that people cite for political expedience, it has little meaning. Russia had a miserable relationship with its media, which is why RT was established to begin with.</p>

<p>Repeatedly spouting &quot;disinfo&quot; ad nauseum won&#39;t make it so, but I&#39;m sure you know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can believe anything they want. Really, that is just a basic premise that nobody here can challenge.</p>

<p>I believe the point of this post is to reach out to the original user base and remind people to use some common sense. People that have been coming here for years, like myself, can see through this manipulation in half a second. People that have been coming here for years heard the drumbeat for war with Russia start pounding during the election and realize that the propaganda campaign is continuing and even accelerating.  </p>

<p>We remember Bush, we remember Iraq. We remember the same tactics of anonymous leaks from intelligence services to media outlets and the deliberate narrative-building and the war(s) that resulted.  </p>

<p>Now there is very obviously some cautious optimism about Trump appearing in this forum. I believe this to be natural and genuine in response to the insane nightmare that we faced under a possible Clinton presidency. It is equally obvious that some kind of manipulation campaign is taking advantage of this to undermine the community by sucking it into partisan bickering. </p>

<p>You gave it away right there. You have no basis for conspiracies, you simply hate Trump so much you will believe anything to forge a conspiracy. Look the bigger question is why would the mainstream media push a unvetted fake claim through the airwaves? Not everyone believes Trump or Russia, as I said many have criticized Trump for being pro Israel. The people here haven&#39;t been taking the government, even during Crimea they were saying the coup against yanucovich in Ukraine was by the US (which we now know it was). The difference with Trump is that he is at war with the industrial military complex, the intelligence agencies, the media, which for years has been posted here because of their lies. Just because one time the mainstream media decides to manufacture a conspiracy people aren&#39;t gonna blindly believe it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people try to claim this and they are rightly mocked. If he was part of the establishment why is the media trying to crucify him for every little thing? To defend Obama they killed Romneys chances with a single comment and they ignored every single scandal about him, even when he first start e, Obamacare was widely praised by the press and ignored all evidence of future increases and rate hikes. That is being part of the establishment. </p>

<p>I followed the race from the start. Fox used to be his arch enemy and the first debates were 100% anti-Trump. He&#39;s using them, I think if push comes to shove he will dump them.

<p>Do you realize what sub you are in? Nothing the government says is trusted here. The fact that shit like what you&#39;re posting gets upvoted now totally exposes the whole shill brigade going on here.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy here is why exactly are our intelligence agencies and media are trying to divide this country and smear our President. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many many narratives, even just within single governments. Some are truer than others.</p>

<p>The black and white thinking you ascribe to is part of the problem. There are tons of instances where government has been used for good in various ways - whether that&#39;s helping people or as we&#39;re discussing here, trying to uncover the truth. And we can see very clearly that some governments are better in these terms than others (I prefer the american system to the russian one, for instance, despite all its problems).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the government is the people and the systems they develop to interact with one another. That&#39;s it. Obama did a lot of bad, particularly in foreign policy, in my view, but he also did a lot of good, especially at home, though of course not as thoroughly as I&#39;d hope he&#39;d do (I wanted more PWA-type new deal projects like trump advocates for).</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re so stubborn about misunderstanding the definition, I&#39;ll tell you: <strong>a conspiracy is a secret plot to do something wrong or illegal.</strong> That&#39;s it. They happen in government; they happen outside of government. They happen in business. They happen in churches and in armies and banks and any type of group you can imagine. Sometimes the government finds them out. Sometimes the government finds conspiracies in other parts of the government, believe it or not! Many times it&#39;s outside groups and independent citizens that unravel conspiracies, and that&#39;s what I think we need more of. Lots of times, it&#39;s many of these groups working together! Like, the government appoints independent citizen investigative committees to investigate things, believe it or not!</p>

<p>These days, this sub is chiefly about conspiracy theories that absolve or otherwise advocate for trump. It&#39;s obvious and it&#39;s stupid and it&#39;s doing nothing but hurting people (I also happen to think it&#39;s a secret plan).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing you are failing to grasp here is that our government has no credibility.</p>

<p>This is the same narrative they&#39;ve been pushing for 2 months. It just now that its gettting shilled over here too instead of just on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Same style of posts and everything.</p>

<p>Anyone who&#39;s kept up with this shit knows that the real conspiracy theory is the intelligence community colluding with media in order to smear a president they disagree with politically and ramp up tensions with a nation they want to go to war with and the millions being spent to astroturf sites like this in an attempt to influence opinions against our President and try to drum up war with Russia.</p>

<p>Again, this isnt a &quot;conspiracy&quot; in the normal sense of the word. Conspiracies dont tend to be government narratives pushed through corporate media 24/7. The fact that you are trying to play off the governemnts propaganda narrative as a legitimate conspiracy is honestly fucking hilarious, because no user here is dumb enough to buy that and you&#39;re just wasting your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your epistemological slip is showing.</p>

<p>the conspiracy isn&#39;t about whether you believe trump is a russian operative or not. but that the russian narrative is being used to rush us into WW3, this started at least as long as 3 years ago when i started taking note of the NATO build up and the push for new nuclear subs (on their way) and baby nukes (on their way). we just shipped 4000 tanks to europe...3 years ago we had finally brought our last home. the push to make girls register for the draft began last summer with a bill submitted in the house, it is being resubmitted...why? we aren&#39;t in a land war, we have an all volunteer army.</p>

<p>i&#39;m 44, I&#39;m guessing your probablly under 25. you might want to pay more attn to the big picture. you&#39;ll be the one bleeding for it.</p>

<p>ps: if you are willing to entertain the trump-russia narrative, then you should know and own that you are implicitly supporting the idea that he is a traitor. the punishment for treachery in the US is death. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t care what you believe. i could care less if trump is a russian operative--i&#39;m not willing to play a part in condemning a man to death esp based on the flimsy, sensational shit being advanced as credible that you say i should be willing to consider.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not willing to play useful idiot in bringing about the end of the world, and right now this russia narrative you and your 624 upvotes say i should consider is fast tracking it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, it&#39;s not about &quot;shadow organizations&quot;. There are a lot of groups competing for influence, but no single one pulling the strings.</p>

<p>However, there are pervasive ideologies among the elite that amount to a certain groupthink, one of which is that rich people are all wonderful, hard-working sorts and poor people are morally inferior and deserve a sort of punishment. Donald Trump believes this wholeheartedly. His tax plan and his infrastructure plan, and his appointees, will all promote the interests of already-powerful corporations and investors over the average American. However, his Administration will also find scapegoats to witchhunt and punish, usually the weakest and most marginalized in society, so that your attention will be diverted.</p>

<p>The fact that this sub bends over backwards to justify him packing his cabinet with Goldman Sachs members, after raking Hillary over the coals for her connections, shows how twisted into cognitive bias y&#39;all are.</p>

<p>Trump is definitely a loose cannon, but if you think he&#39;s taking it to the elite while simultaneously packing his cabinet with bankers, CEOs and billionaires, you&#39;re nothing more than a useful idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree with you. What I perceive as dangerous to western civilization and western culture is what happening in Europe. A creation of a super state is my worst nightmare.</p>

<p>I like a lot of the things Trump is pushing for and I think the US could settle the example for the word. The left completely freaking out and attempting to sabotage Trump&#39;s administration alone is enough reason to support him at least until he does something that can justify going against him.</p>

<p>I think the US, securing its boarders, pushing for trade deal that favor them, not having a heavy hand internationally, are all good things. So far Trump is doing much better than expected.</p>

<p>I think we are way beyond the stupidity that is capitalism vrs marxism, the real battle being waged is for control of the people be it by the corporations that want to keep control of the government or the government that want to increase its control of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%. People do need to remember that it is them who decides their fate; we live in a republic (supposedly), so we need to be watching our leaders&#39; every moves. No one likes to doubt or be wrong when it comes to trusting a leader. A large issue is that we very much ridicule people who are wrong, our egos can&#39;t let a good brag go to waste. This leads people on the other side to be arrogant when supporting a leader or institution and unaccepting of any criticism which is dangerous and divisive. I&#39;m a Trump supporter, I don&#39;t like criticism of him, I don&#39;t want to be wrong; but I have to remind myself that all government officials should be held to the highest of standards. I just wish everyone from both aisles would be reasonable.</p>

<p>You&#39;re moving the goal posts. I never said anything of the sort. I said when we some some evidence, as in ANY evidence at all. So far this is just an unsubstantiated accusation. I could say that Chris Farley was killed by the Illuminati because he had information that the Earth was flat, and  the burden of proof would lie on me. Until any evidence is provided it&#39;s bullshit. You&#39;re allowed to talk about anything you want, but I don&#39;t have to believe something just because you said so. Part of studying conspiracy theories is learning to be critical. You shouldn&#39;t believe everything your told just because it&#39;s a conspiracy, just as you shouldn&#39;t immediately discount a conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the docs have been in the hands of top journalists and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Buzzfeed are top journalists to you? Plenty of journalists were offered this story and declined because it&#39;s bullshit with zero evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is worth talking about already, no need to dismiss it entirely and insult everyone who wants to talk about it for a moment.</p>

<p>If you want to spend time talking about every single unsubstantiated claim then go right ahead. I am also allowed to call bullshit when I see it. Nobody actually believes this story, not even the people who reported on it. Read the article. They&#39;ve tried for months to substantiate the claims and couldn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my usual conversation with someone who is buying into the narrative. </p>

<p>How did Russia hack the election?
<em>&quot;Russia hacked into the DNC&#39;s emails!&quot;</em></p>

<p>And how did they use that to hack the election?
<em>&quot;They released it to the public!&quot;</em></p>

<p>So what does email belonging to the DNC have to do with &quot;hacking&quot; the election?
<em>&quot;Well that was private information!&quot;</em></p>

<p>So even if what you say is correct, they didn&#39;t &quot;hack&quot; the election. They provide information about corruption to the American people who decided the OompaLoompa was a better fit than your candidate. Am I understanding you correctly?
<em>incoming bullshit about how it&#39;s more complicated than that.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have the conversation with you.</p>

<p>Russia hacked our political parties and selectively released materials, then encouraged the media using shill accounts to frame &quot;politics as usual&quot; as corruption.</p>

<p>Doing that, they gave the public the mistaken impression that one side was corrupt, and the other side was not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The [at the time] head of the Democratic National Committee stated that another candidate with a significant challenge to Clinton would dismiss him with &quot;Not be the candidate.&quot; Then, only after the leak the DNC forces her to resign, she is immediately given a chairman position in the Clinton Campaign. </p>

<p>The Clinton Campaign has been shown to have an authority over MSNBC, CNN, BBC, The Guardian and numerous other organizations with the exception of Fox News, who&#39;s most popular employee, Megyn Kelly,  was in a constant battle with Trump over his rhetoric and childish behavior. What &quot;media&quot; did this abomination of our electoral system as reporting on the evidence? I do remember CNN reporting that the public could be breaking the law by viewing these emails. </p>

<p>Repeatedly they played up Clinton&#39;s advantage throughout the primaries through superdelegates where Sanders actually won states and still received less pledge delegates than Clinton because of this subversion of democracy. Then after the election she literally sobbed because of the same concept that allowed her to dominate the primaries had lost her the election. </p>

<p>Clinton continually, whether intentional or not aligned herself with the outrage culture pushing her gender rather than the issues which is why Bernie Sanders was so popular. Right until the very end she seemingly focused on issues being second to her gender where the true feminist such as myself didn&#39;t give a flying fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of your comment is really just criticism of Clinton&#39;s political stance and influence, rather than specific allegations of corruption.  Sifting through that with a point by point rebuttle would be pretty tedious.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll focus on the collusion with the DNC.  Sanders was a party outsider, who only registered to the DNC so he could become president.</p>

<p>The two party system is something that we need to get rid of, but enforcing it does not represent a level of corruption or misbehavior beyond what is expected from American politics.</p>

<p>Highlighting that behavior for only <em>one side</em> is  misrepresenting the political climate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like trying to choose between a sushi restaurant and an Indian restaurant, and the local fisherman has posted the food safety information for the Indian restaurant all over town.</p>

<p>We have no reason to believe one is better than the other, and the person informing us has a bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going through your post history I&#39;m going to not exactly buy this guy is some reviled character but I really have no interest in him or or any further interest into what exactly the implications of posting a video from his twitter is since you&#39;ve refused to explain it.</p>

<p>Instead this is a big day for you because you get to see that sometimes conspiracies are just in your head. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nc5nu/trump_melts_down_on_twitter_are_we_living_in_nazi/dcab7aw/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nc5nu/trump_melts_down_on_twitter_are_we_living_in_nazi/dcab7aw/</a></p>

<p>You see I sometimes browse r/politics. It&#39;s not my favorite sub but I feel it&#39;s important to get all different sides to the story before making decisions about what&#39;s true and what&#39;s a lie. I got banned for a post questioning mike pences words about gays which you can find me talking about in my history but I still browse the donald, I&#39;ve posted on stoptrumpspam, I believe confidently JFK was killed by very important people, some of them our world leaders and I believe that Clinton is corrupted or at least highly corruptible. I lean liberal in my morals like I like health care for all and it should be a woman&#39;s choice. My point is I like primary sources and I&#39;m sure you can work my post history to convince yourself I&#39;m a shill in some manner but at the end of the day, I saw a video on Reddit proving trump saying that, watched it on the twitter that was linked, then linked the twitter here. </p>

<p>Is this sufficient to make you mellow out because your posts portray you as someone who is angry about politics. Right or left, the system will always piss you off. And pissed people start looking for things to be angry about and it&#39;s a cycle of being angry. Smoke a bowl or grab a banjo but I hope you can see sometimes the rabbit hole doesn&#39;t run deep. Idk man just seems like u need to chill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean Russia didn&#39;t hack the elections?  Trump seems to support that Russia was behind the DNC leak now and he doesn&#39;t deny that they did it to influence the elections (though he claims they had little/no effect), and is now apparently very concerned with strengthening American cyber security and is making it a priority for the administration and current Republican platform.  No one in our gov wants stuff like that to happen regularly from foreign entities, and he was right, a lot of countries try to do those things.</p>

<p>Watching Rubio during the Tillerson confirmation hearing was pretty good too, Tillerson tried to not get backed into a corner for not having crushing sanctions on Russia, but it doesn&#39;t appear that is going to be politically feasible. Seems like Trump is going to support a strong US position on Crimea, Ukraine and Georgia while still maybe looking for other avenues the two countries can work together on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skepticism is fine, but I wouldn&#39;t really call Russia &quot;another superpower.&quot;  They are a nuclear power, sure, but their GDP is below Korea and falling.  Economically, culturally, technologically they aren&#39;t particularly relevant anymore.  The fall of the soviet satelight states makes them barely relevant.  They have resources, but can&#39;t compete with low cost countries.  They have an impressive nuclear aresonal and a conventional military that is significant, but not economically sustainable long term with how things are going.</p>

<p>If the rest of the West went full cold war again, the country would implode, more or less be able to keep up.  And the US does not want a nuclear power completely imploding.</p>

<p>Still, we (the US), aren&#39;t going to put up with aggression in places like Ukraine or Crimea anymore.  There was a bit of doubt of that before today, but the Tillerson/Trump public comments as well as the Republican/Democratic leadership stances have made it clear that isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>

<p>Given that the US has hinted at technology or contacts that greatly undermine Russian cyber threats, I doubt Trump or anyone else is going to give up that lever.  It appears protecting the US from future foreign cyber threats is going to be a priority for the Trump administration.</p>

<p>If we were going to go full cold war, I could see maybe needing to release information go justify more strict actions.  Or if we were going to back off completely on Russia and Trump kept denying it was Russia, I could see the information being leaked to back Trump into a corner politically.</p>

<p>As it is, the we aren&#39;t going to back off on Russian aggression in former Soviet bloc states, and economically their actions there aren&#39;t sustainable with the sanctions in place we already have libraries worth of information out there as to why the US should continue its current actions.  No one believes Russian soldiers were &quot;on vacation,&quot; lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lololol and it gets better. From your own source. Man, Putin needs to give you guys more breaks.</p>

<p>[&quot;A secret CIA assessment found that Russian operatives covertly interfered in the election campaign in an attempt to ensure the Republican candidate’s victory, the Washington Post reported, citing officials briefed on the matter.</p>

<p>A separate report in the New York Times said intelligence officials had a “high confidence” that Russia was involved in hacking related to the election.</p>

<p>The claims immediately drew a stinging rebuke from the president-elect’s transition team, which said in a statement: “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.”](<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report?CMP=share_btn_tw">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report?CMP=share_btn_tw</a>)</p>

<p>Trump admitted this week it was Russia who hacked the DNC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read the intelligence reports? I have and I&#39;m also in the well educated in the IT field. They have presented no evidence to date, just speculation and hand waving. Until recently, the intelligence agencies didn&#39;t even plainly say Russia hacked anything; it was all weasel words and CNN/NY Times publishing unofficial opinions of unnamed &quot;administrative officials.&quot; Now they&#39;ve came out with direct accusations finally, after CNN/NY Times/WaPo had been reporting it for a month or more. They&#39;ve released a report outlining two security breaches and nonsensical speculations as to who did them. They didn&#39;t even directly investigate the breaches, but relied on a 3rd party security team&#39;s investigation. Then they went on about how Russia Today&#39;s criticizing the US&#39;s two party system, its pitfalls, and on US police brutality, was equal to &quot;Russia hacking the election&quot;. Just empty slandering before inauguration. Funny when it is anti-Trump coming from all main stream media, instead of anti-Obama nonsense coming from mostly just Fox News.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a thought: why didn&#39;t Russia think about letting Clinton win so they could blackmail <em>her?</em> I mean, they <em>did</em> hack her private server, the DNC&#39;s server, John Podesta&#39;s personal email, and possibly more. Seems like a lot more leverage for blackmail to me, but they just released it to the public for free? I don&#39;t buy it! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Russia probably find Trump with his fragile ego much easier to potentially influence.  Clinton, in the end, just didn&#39;t have all that much in the emails, that&#39;s why they needed to inflate the public opinion about what &#39;could&#39; be in there during the campaign.  They can make her look bad, but once in office, they don&#39;t have crap.  On the other hand, Trump explodes at the slightest provocation against his self image.  </p>

<p>What about the 33,000 that she illegally deleted? You don&#39;t think there&#39;s a chance that Russia hacked her server and took those emails before she deleted them? Clearly she was hiding something, that sounds like a treasure trove of blackmail to me. </p>

<p>But, clearly, fighting an uphill battle to get Trump, the &quot;pied piper&quot; candidate according to the DNC, elected against all odds so they can control him via blackmail makes so much more sense to Russia. Because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-putin-russia.html?_r=0">Trump is the more easily provoked out of the two</a>. Riiight.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, so Russia is going to get him to go on a rampage against other countries... just like Saudi Arabia had us go after Iraq, Libya, and Syria. </p>

<p>And therein lies the crux of the entire matter. The bipartisan political establishment is guilty of everything they are accusing Trump of doing. But their partner was Saudi Arabia. Bush to Obama to Clinton (endorsed by Bush). They&#39;ve all been Saudi Arabia&#39;s lackeys for over a decade.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and Russia support opposing sides in Syria. Trump will not support Saudi Arabia, not because he&#39;s a Russian lackey, but because it&#39;s common fucking sense. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what&#39;s going on here. It&#39;s all a game. </p>

<p>You mean a small group of people would exercise continuing control over the country.  Kind of like how the Clintons would have had.  Complete with the core team held together with the old school Podesta/Soros crowd, that was in control not only in Bills term but also in Obamas, and almost in Hillary&#39;s.  Yeah, I&#39;m thinking those emails could have been influential in some Uranium deals or something (just conjecture, of course).</p>

<p>So how is Trump more valuable than Clinton in this scenario?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you... want me to ask the question with more detail?</p>

<p>Ok, so Russia has the Podesta emails (allegedly, but we&#39;ll roll with it).  Russia also has the pee video (allegedly, but again we&#39;ll roll with it).  The 2016 campaign is coming up, and they have two options.  Option 1, they can groom/back the longshot and use him as a puppet oligarchy.  Or option 2, they can usurp control of the standing oligarchy.  Either way, they can use the dirt on the other one to torpedo the campaign.</p>

<p>The scenario you have proposed is that they went with option 1.  Back/Groom the longshot and use the emails to torpedo Team Clinton.</p>

<p>(I think this is your scenario)</p>

<p>So, I asked, why did they think option 1 was the better option?  You answered: his cabinet.  Then gave Rex Tillerson as your primary answer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking, what is so valuable about Rex Tillerson, that controlling Team Clinton didn&#39;t offer?</p>

<p>Off chance?  He <em>ran for president</em> in 2012 and then they <em>groomed him to run</em>.  There was no &quot;off chance&quot; that your manchurian candidate will do what you say.  That&#39;s basically a 100% chance.</p>

<p>The real &quot;blackmail&quot; is going to be videos/recordings/records/etc of Trump and/or associates making quid-pro-quo deals with Russians in exchange for help with the election, and/or for business concerns.  That&#39;s the stuff the kind of stuff that can put people in prison, and that&#39;s what they&#39;d use if they were going to blackmail anyone.

<p>Ok.  So, either they already had this material, and Putin forced it.  Or Trump sought out those deals thinking he was in control, and Putin played him.</p>

<p>Sure looks like it&#39;s in order of <em>date</em>.  So it leads with the information compiled first.  IT&#39;s not even the first item nor on the first page.</p>

<p>It mentions they&#39;ve been contacting him for over 5 years.  I doubt this pee incident is what started anything.  If it&#39;s real at all, just one thing in a long line of things.  If I were gonna blackmail him, look at the stuff about his lawyer saying Trump will agree to drop sanctions once in office in exchange for some stake in the national oil company.  That&#39;s way more heavy hitting than some watersports.  Look at them providing intel on the oligarchs in the US in exchange for election help.  That&#39;s the kind of stuff they&#39;re going to use as blackmail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again:</p>

<p>This not about being &quot;Pro-Trump&quot;, &quot;anti-Russia&quot;, &quot;pro-Clinton&quot;, etc.</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s is about self-interests and self-preservation.</strong> That&#39;s it. You, me, Trump, Clinton, Putin, Obama, etc look out for one thing: ourselves. <em>Numero uno</em>. We&#39;re all simply out to make ourselves feel better.</p>

<p>If we want to keep a conspiracy discussion/investigation objective, we have to keep this in mind and not turn the discussion into a political witch-hunt or get on one&#39;s moral high-horse. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to discuss these conspiracies here, but it&#39;s possible to believe believe that both Putin <em>and</em> America (in addition to many other governments) engage in espionage and election-influencing. That doesn&#39;t make me &quot;anti-Putin&quot; or &quot;anti-American&quot;, per se. That&#39;s just what many governments do. Whether I believe that&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing is irrelevant. I&#39;m just looking at the evidence and motives.</p>

<p>I can believe Americans released a bunch of dirt on Putin in the Panama Papers, and Putin released a ton of dirt on Americans through the DNC leaks. That doesn&#39;t make me &quot;pro-Clinton&quot; or &quot;pro-Putin&quot;. It doesn&#39;t require a ton of resources to accomplish. Just a few leaks. Everyone&#39;s simply trying to get you on their side. Can you say you don&#39;t do the same thing?</p>

<p>I can believe that Assange wanted, and still values, transparency. But he also needed Russia&#39;s help to avoid bullshit sexual assault charges from the West. That doesn&#39;t mean I think Assange is good or evil. He&#39;s just out for himself. He probably did, and is doing, whatever benefits him and what helps him accomplish his goals. Just like you or me.</p>

<p>A conspiracy discussion shouldn&#39;t be about sides. It should be about discussing/following what the evidence tells us. Not look for or shun evidence that supports one particular side or pre-conceived notion.</p>

<p>Seriously though, how does everyone just eat up every single conspiracy as fact with no more than a three paragraph reddit post but when something bad comes out about Trump you guys are so quick to deny it without even giving it a chance. I get that you guys can&#39;t trust the media, I can&#39;t either, but are you guys seriously gonna trust Donald fuckin&#39; Trump of all people? He&#39;d lie and bomb the masses if he knew he could be king of the ashes, y&#39;all are some stupid mother fuckers for even believing a word out of him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These types of posts aren&#39;t new. These are ideas that have been discussed for quite awhile, especially the connection between Wikileaks and Russia. Relevant and interesting post from Conspiracy: <a href="https://redd.it/4obiy6">As If we Needed Further Proof...</a></p>

<p>The news that Russia may have some kind of blackmail material on DT and what that means politically is definitely something that should be discussed on Conspiracy. Don&#39;t let the sensationalist golden-shower language sidetrack you and make you think it must definitely be fake. This is the kind of stuff that could have far larger implications than just making one political party look good or bad. </p>

<p>Conspiracy is a place where people should be able to post their theories and other people should be able to comment on it without fear of being labeled a shill if their thoughts don&#39;t coincide with a specific political agenda. Don&#39;t sell out to specific set of truths because you identify as a supporter of one party or another and don&#39;t look for truths because you want to support your party lines. </p>

<p>OP is right, these fuckers who have been lying to our faces and getting away with it throughout the years are telling us Russia had any part in our election. Those who believe in this conspiracy that TPTSP are shoving down our throats are very gullible to their lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Trump is not a Russian puppet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he should release his tax returns and prove everyone wrong.  If he has nothing to hide then he should follow in the footsteps of every president since Jimmy Carter, including &quot;weak&quot; Obama and release his damn tax returns.  He wont because they are laced with the ties to Russia you seem to believe do not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia didn&#39;t hack the elections</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>You should probably tell Trump that.</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-press-conference.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-press-conference.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>Sorry for posting a libcuck rag like the NY times but I was having trouble finding this on Brietbart.  I&#39;m sure they will have an unbiased and factual article on it soon enough.  Not they are spinning a narrative or anything...<em>gasp</em> of course they aren&#39;t!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wikileaks is not a Russian front organization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  Not concerned at all that someone might have coopted wikileaks?  In spite of some really shady shit.  Shit that, even just a year or two ago, Asange would not have done.  Hell up until just recently the man was assumed possibly dead by a lot of folks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manufactured &quot;Evil Russia&quot; narrative</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RUSSIANS are not evil, by and large.  At least, no more so than anyone else Americans included.  But Putin, my friend, is not a &quot;good guy&quot; anymore than Obama is; and depending on who you ask may in fact be objectively more &quot;evil&quot;.</p>

<p>-Putin has used criminal actions to keep himself in power: Russian apartment bombings for one, political assassinations, and persecution of any dissenters.</p>

<p>-He&#39;s changed Russia&#39;s political system and government structure to benefit his personal interests and to ensure that he could stay in power.  So much so that there is a word for it:  Putinism</p>

<p>-He is a war monger.  Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So if the &quot;narrative&quot; we are being fed is that Russia isn&#39;t the bastion of free speech socioeconomic high water mark standard against which the rest of the world should be compared then that would be correct.</p>

<p>But if you want to push the narrative that Russia is just peachy and everyone there absolutely loves Putin then maybe you should check your facts for yourself, before wholesale buying into what ever bullshit lies Trump and the Alt-Right are spreading these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You new folks do realize trump literally has to say the intelligence report is correct because the report was made to describe russian propaganda efforts.</p>

<p>And yes he has to agree with the intelligence report because all 17 intelligence agencies had to take Crowdstrike&#39;s word for it that it was the russians. None of them were allowed access to forensics on the DNC server.</p>

<p>However there is proof that more than just Russia accessed Hillary&#39;s private email server (Where podesta emails come from and more). Proof that MULTIPLE state-actors accessed that information and saw it. Information that went from confidential to fucking SAP LEVEL! (above top secret).</p>

<p>Please get the facts straight okay. They had to make this intelligence report based on the information they were given. Noone can deny russia uses propaganda. And if you only have crowdstrike&#39;s report to go off of... you can&#39;t say anyone else did it because it&#39;s the only piece of tech evidence..</p>

<p>DOES THAT NOT RAISE FLAGS FOR YOU PEOPLE?? CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IS FUCKING SHADY WEIRD AND SUSPICIOUS AS FUCK?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read the report? It&#39;s making some really big big claims with absolutely nothing to provide evidence for it. Their basis of evidence required is </p>

<p>Source A overheard an official talking about the effect of the leaks on clinton. But taking that into mind look how it is written.. The beginning looks like it was in a different language and then was google translated. The grammar is totally fucking off. And then near the end it is just fine perfect american english.</p>

<p>FSB Claims it has tapes of trump in whore houses, and specifically a tape of trump ordering women to pee on the bed the obama&#39;s slept on. That sounds like a trump thing to do I kind of believe that.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t believe 100% is the real WHY behind it, you know? The motive of it all.. I tend to think trump at 70 years old didn&#39;t campaign for 20 hours a day everyday because he was just power hungry. I believe he really wants to eliminate the pedo&#39;s. And I think they threatened him in the presidential race early on, and he didn&#39;t like that. Now he&#39;s pissed and wants to take them down and amass wealth and fame while doing it.</p>

<p>He knew about them before and probably got disgusted as the farther along he got in the race the more he found out. Trump is no saint, has business ties in russia sure. He has done real estate deals in ST. Pete and he went to see whores. And he did a trump move and  disgraced an obama bed.(Probably needed to burn it anyway)</p>

<p>This still pale&#39;s in comparison to what hillary has done with what we have just seen in the fbi released files. I don&#39;t think trump is planning to hand USA over to russia.. you would have to be a damn fool to think someone greedy like him would do that.</p>

<p>If Hillary can&#39;t murder or buy her way to that video there is good authority it doesn&#39;t exist. 8 years ago no one was thinking about collecting blackmail on trump to fight him as president so that information wouldn&#39;t of been guarded as well.</p>

<p>Are you seriously trying to tell me you believe russia put all the marbles on TRUMP to win the US presidency? Excuse me if I don&#39;t believe you. Again you are relying on an argument that you believe 99% of americans are too stupid to know what russian propaganda is, and what american values are.</p>

<p><strong>Stop falling for the manufactured &quot;Evil Russia&quot; narrative!</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re right, there is no evidence that Trump has any involvement with Russia. It&#39;s probable that Russia did interfere with our elections, that&#39;s not a stretch at all. Like any superpower, they flex their own psyops around the globe. To what extent, who knows? For all we know, they may have favored Clinton.</p>

<p>I am highly skeptical of the dossier that was &quot;leaked.&quot; It&#39;s nonspecific and presents ZERO evidence, but it still does not excuse Russia&#39;s misdeeds one bit.</p>

<p>But like the US, Russia is CORRUPT to the core. I take umbrage with you claiming that &quot;Evil Russia&quot; is a manufactured narrative.</p>

It has just as much, IF NOT MORE legitimacy than the pizzagate conspiracy but it&#39;s deleted and people will call it FAKE even though nothing points towards either direction. If we have to believe McCain, it&#39;s kinda really pointing towards the other direction now.... Tell me why I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible they never got anything on him, but it seems much much more likely that they aren&#39;t as impartial as they claim to be.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  I&#39;ve been following Assange for 10 years and understand his motives very well. </p>

<p>He has an impeccable track record, protects his sources at all costs, and has not demonstrated any impartiality in the past.  </p>

<p>When asked wether he supports Trump or Hillary by Amy Goodman of DemocracyNow!, he responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you’re asking me, do I prefer cholera or gonorrhea? Personally, I would prefer neither. Look, I think—you know, we know how politics works in the United States. Whoever—whatever political party gets into government is going to merge with the bureaucracy pretty damn fast. It will be in a position where it has some levers in its hand. And so, as a result, corporate lobbyists will move in to help control those levers. So it doesn’t make much difference in the end. What does make a difference is political accountability, a general deterrence set to stop political organizations behaving in a corrupt manner. That can make a difference, because that changes the perception of what you can do or not do. And so, always—well, almost always, you should choose the principled position, which is to set a disciplinary signal about acting in a corrupt way, and take a philosophical position, which is our institutions can only be as good as our understanding of our institutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>russia is controlled by mafia, putin is a body double, and obama rotten administration closed their eyes / give  approvement when putin was killed secretly in late 2010 and replaced by a puppet/body double. This obama/USA approval to do this  happened  mainly because of arab spring situation during late 2010 / what was coming in 2011. The real (now dead) putin wanted to play a different card/encourage arab spring (to raise petrol price and &quot;bother&quot; US stupid foreign policies) which would have put rotten gulf emirate and USA in a (very) tricky situation. Since then russia is a &quot;rogue country&quot; (with huge nuclear arsenal lol) controlled by psycopaths as dangerous as nazis germany from the 40&#39;s. Trump has/had numerous mafia ties including russian mobs thus the troubles there is now, thus the blackmail/pressure that is tried on him. Hillary getting elected would have cleanse that dangerous / very bad situation but Trump because of his background and past activities / mafia ties won&#39;t  / can&#39;t do shit.

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude, it&#39;s not about &quot;shadow organizations&quot;. There are a lot of groups competing for influence, but no single one pulling the strings.</p>

<p>However, there are pervasive ideologies among the elite that amount to a certain groupthink, one of which is that rich people are all wonderful, hard-working sorts and poor people are morally inferior and deserve a sort of punishment. Donald Trump believes this wholeheartedly. His tax plan and his infrastructure plan, and his appointees, will all promote the interests of already-powerful corporations and investors over the average American. However, his Administration will also find scapegoats to witchhunt and punish, usually the weakest and most marginalized in society, so that your attention will be diverted.</p>

<p>The fact that this sub bends over backwards to justify him packing his cabinet with Goldman Sachs members, after raking Hillary over the coals for her connections, shows how twisted into cognitive bias y&#39;all are.</p>

<p>Trump is definitely a loose cannon, but if you think he&#39;s taking it to the elite while simultaneously packing his cabinet with bankers, CEOs and billionaires, you&#39;re nothing more than a useful idiot.</p>

<p>Trump stating his opinion that Russia interfered with the election, doesn&#39;t equate to Wikileaks being anything to do with Russia. It just means he was convinced that Russia Today&#39;s negative reporting on the US, its two party system and US police brutality, was as good as hacking (social engineering).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your rhetorical question about them wanting to be favored by the new administration is that they don&#39;t expect a new administration, or at least not a Trump one. Just look at the fight against the electoral college, or the protests, or shit, just these &quot;hacking&quot; accusations alone. All of it is designed to ensure Trump doesn&#39;t make it to the White House, or doesn&#39;t stay long. If a corporation was aware of this, they would not be so pressed to impress.</p>

<p>No, Abby doesn&#39;t work for RT anymore. She moved to Telesur and now produces The Empire Files, a career move not unusual for a journalist. I happened to watch her final show and it was a teary, heartfelt farewell. Not something you&#39;d usually see from a network supposedly under Putin&#39;s thumb. Give me an example of RT pushing Russian state propaganda, go on.</p>

Between you calling me &#39;blind sheep&#39; and taking issue with the rightful labeling of fake news as such proves it. First of all we don&#39;t blindly insult eachother here, I also browse UFO subs and no one is that disrespectful. I called you a likely shill because your first comment made you seem like one, and your assumption that we label eachother as sheep when someone disagrees solidified it. Look if you believe that the PissGate story is real despite it beIng profanity reported by mainstream media then browse <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> . If you are willing to challenge the government and other things post here. Trump isn&#39;t even sworn in yet, everything before that and up until his first 100 days are complete is just politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was pushed by Russia too.  I mean c&#39;mon - you should have seen the bots registering on forums like defconwarningsystems.com and posting pictures of Russian military hardware.  At the same time Russia sends its aircraft carrier down to Syria in a very public show of force.  They even scheduled visits in several ports that they cancelled at the last minute, causing news reports each time.  The Russians were in full propaganda mode and their entire push in Syria was timed to hit us during a transition and to help support the narrative that the party in power in the US was pushing for war with Russia.  In the meantime, it was Russia that was making statements about how small tactical nuclear devices have changed the equation regarding if they could be used in battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many of those were murdered by organized crime and big business?</p>

<p>RT was created specifically to address Russia&#39;s media problem. But RT operates independently, its journalists do not receive talking points or bribes from the Kremlin.</p>

<p>There was a case regarding Ukraine when RT&#39;s coverage seemed slanted in favor of Russia, and this was largely due to RT relying on the Russian military as sources. Naturally that&#39;s a rather biased source. Abby Martin criticized it deeply live on air, and there have been no similar incidents since.</p>

<p>RT is consistently one of the best media outlets in the world with some of the best transparency and impartiality. I&#39;ve yet to see evidence otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple.  A lie by ommision is still a lie and not objective truth. If the truth is revealed in a context of an outside foreign force to directly effect the election process of another country, it is very much NOT GOOD. This is basic sense.  If it was all knowledge and truth, sure.  But given the context, it is incredibly bad, and terrifying on behalf of our country that another country can, at a whim, hack us, and choose what to release to manipulate our electoral process in their favor.</p>
