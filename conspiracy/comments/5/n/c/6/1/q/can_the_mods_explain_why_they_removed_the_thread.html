Well, until they bring forth explicit proof that said post was a hoax and a raid from 4chan. I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m not holding my breath on this one. </p>

Interesting, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
Well, honestly, if I were to believe that post I would have to be literally brain dead. I cannot fathom any other way that&#39;d make me believe it.<br/>
<strong>First of all</strong>: &quot;I used their PGP keys and shit to make me seem legit&quot;, now I&#39;m nowhere near familiar with encryption methods, in fact you could say I&#39;m encryption-illiterate for what it&#39;s worth, but I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/PGP_diagram.svg/500px-PGP_diagram.svg.png">nowhere near that easy nor is it possible that such keys could easily be accessed</a> - that shit sounds weaker than a 12345678 password.<br/>
<strong>Second of all</strong>: &quot;I installed a new OS after the election so I have no proof that I fabricated them&quot;. HAH. Lucky bastard, ain&#39;t that fucking convenient.<br/>
<strong>Third of all</strong>: Oh, but wait! &quot;I wrote the pissgate leaks shortly after the RNC and circulated them to various journalists. Wapo, NYT, Mother Jones, various twitter shitbirds&quot;. Wouldyalook at that! It seems that nowadays when ya reinstall a new OS it also deletes all mails &amp; tweets so you still don&#39;t have proof. My, my, my, how much has technology advanced.<br/>
Not even 4chan redditors believe this guy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/5n9al1/anon_creates_fake_news/">https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/5n9al1/anon_creates_fake_news/</a>  </p>

<p>If <em>that</em> post is the very reason mods have re-tagged and deleted the post, I&#39;m calling <strong>buuuullshit</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article and comments didn&#39;t match up. The mods flared it with &quot;unverified allegations&quot; and it drove the commenters mad. It seems no one actually read the article where right above the title it explained that the allegations were unverified. It was clear that the the substance of the article was being ignored just to push an anti-trump agenda and try to show that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is more biased than people once have thought. Also, looking at /new you would have seen every other post was a copy in some way shape or form of the exact narrative. It&#39;s completely obvious what was going on. I&#39;m a long time lurker and im getting tired of this Trump vs Hillary stuff boiling over into other subreddits. There&#39;s a political war on for your mind, just pay attention to stay out of its wake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you and I am not in the Trump will be the savior of all America camp but I think it&#39;s fairly obvious that those that wish to paint him with the establishment brush are disingenuous at best. Yes he won the White House as a Republican but was largely hated by large swaths of his own party and the entire Democrat party there is the controlled opposition argument but I believe this to be invalid as well. Trump is a wildcard and we will have to wait and see what his administration actually does but we know what Hillary would have brought us and it is disturbing that the Russian boogie man is being built up so much by the propaganda arm of the Democrat party which is the mainstream news networks.</p>

But when a speculation about something that&#39;s been leaked is posted, then every mass media tries to debunk it and gets ridiculed for even thinking it.
