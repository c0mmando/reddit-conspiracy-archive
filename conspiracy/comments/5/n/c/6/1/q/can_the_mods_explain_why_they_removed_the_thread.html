       Why are the mods removing top posts and censoring what people have to say?
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       should not be so blatantly one sided. Republicans and Democrats both need to be questioned, actions reported on, and researched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are the mods censoring a wildly popular thread? Because it's is now about someone  (president elect Trump) that they like?

       Depends on your definition and what constitutes as huge.

       There's a difference between authentic stimulation versus synthesized and engineered stimulation.  A lot of these paid accounts and bot users do not understand that there traffic and user patterns are watched.

       <br/>
       <strong>
        First of all
       </strong>
       : "I used their PGP keys and shit to make me seem legit", now I'm nowhere near familiar with encryption methods, in fact you could say I'm encryption-illiterate for what it's worth, but I'm inclined to believe it's
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/PGP_diagram.svg/500px-PGP_diagram.svg.png">
        nowhere near that easy nor is it possible that such keys could easily be accessed
       </a>
       - that shit sounds weaker than a 12345678 password.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Second of all
       </strong>
       : "I installed a new OS after the election so I have no proof that I fabricated them". HAH. Lucky bastard, ain't that fucking convenient.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Third of all
       </strong>
       : Oh, but wait! "I wrote the pissgate leaks shortly after the RNC and circulated them to various journalists. Wapo, NYT, Mother Jones, various twitter shitbirds". Wouldyalook at that! It seems that nowadays when ya reinstall a new OS it also deletes all mails &amp; tweets so you still don't have proof. My, my, my, how much has technology advanced.

       The article and comments didn't match up. The mods flared it with "unverified allegations" and it drove the commenters mad. It seems no one actually read the article where right above the title it explained that the allegations were unverified. It was clear that the the substance of the article was being ignored just to push an anti-trump agenda and try to show that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is more biased than people once have thought. Also, looking at /new you would have seen every other post was a copy in some way shape or form of the exact narrative. It's completely obvious what was going on. I'm a long time lurker and im getting tired of this Trump vs Hillary stuff boiling over into other subreddits. There's a political war on for your mind, just pay attention to stay out of its wake.

       I would agree with you and I am not in the Trump will be the savior of all America camp but I think it's fairly obvious that those that wish to paint him with the establishment brush are disingenuous at best. Yes he won the White House as a Republican but was largely hated by large swaths of his own party and the entire Democrat party there is the controlled opposition argument but I believe this to be invalid as well. Trump is a wildcard and we will have to wait and see what his administration actually does but we know what Hillary would have brought us and it is disturbing that the Russian boogie man is being built up so much by the propaganda arm of the Democrat party which is the mainstream news networks.

       This is a lot bigger than the "golden shower" allegations. And even then, you're willing to take someone on 4chan saying "lol this was me but I don't have proof anymore" as concrete evidence it's made up?

       The difference is kinda funny though yeah? One little false information (fake news is a conspiracy yeah?) about trump and it's posted by mass media. But when a speculation about something that's been leaked is posted, then every mass media tries to debunk it and gets ridiculed for even thinking it. When it's about trump, it's being embraced as true and there's only truth in it.

       I'm not sure who upvoted it to the top of the sub in the first place my brother.  And further, you and I don't need to be arguing over politicians, do we?  These are false idols and there is a bigger picture out there.  There are so many things we do not understand, and you are going to be the one to help us put the pieces of the puzzle together, so I certainly do not want to alienate you or any other brother of mine by arguing over a false idol politician.  You may have a point, I cannot argue that is not a form of censorship, but was that thread pushed to the top of this sub with you and I in mind?

       Cognitive bias. IF you already hated Trump, you were more likely to think that unsourced and fake sounding news was interesting and less likely to notice it was a total pile of garbage sure to be outed as fake.

       We just don't get caught up in the emotionally driven anti-Trump hate. We are used to verifying facts and sources more so than others. When you look at the anti-Trump slander, it is mostly unsourced and speculation.  How many times can you hear news outlets nonsensically say, "Trump might end the world once he's president" in a million different forms before you say, "fuck that nonsense"?

       Nobody here defends Trump, he's open to as much scrutiny as any other politician. The difference is, he's not really a politician, and when you consider the heinous and traitorous activities of Hillary and her cabal, pissing on a russian hooker (if true), is bonkers.

       This is proof this sub has been over run by trump supporters. They deflect and try to spin anything negative against him, then tell you it's not happening. That's the real conspiracy here, and anyone with half a brain can see it. Sad!

       There are people willing to accept a guy on 4chan saying "hey I leaked this to media outlets but have no proof anymore lololol" as proof. That type of blindness to accept some 4chan post with no proof is not what

       Dude this sub is dead. One thread negative about trump makes it big, all these people get called out for being Donald supporters and now everything is back to pro trump. And that thread is gone. That's the real conspiracy.

       You are so blind with your hatred towards Trump that has been instilled in you by the media for over a year that you are willing to accept an "intelligence report" that BuzzFeed publicly stated has errors in it. I don't know about the 4chan but the fact that it is extremely poorly written and had errors suggests it's just more of the shameless slandering of Trump...
