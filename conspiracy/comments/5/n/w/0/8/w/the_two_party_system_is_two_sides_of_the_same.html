<p>Edit: wasnt expecting this much attention; since somebody asked what a proposed solution could be, id like to share a possible vision:</p>

<p>First off, were running antiquated bureaucratic processes in the modern age of instant information exchange. Every voice can be heard thanks to technology. Second point I want to make is that we live in a time where we have very large populations, with very complex infrastructures and relationships. So with both these points, Id like to draw the conclusion that things that worked in 1776 might not be efficient for the needs of the 21st century:</p>

<p>An idea of mine that i see possible with decentralized technologies such as the blockchain and initiatives like <a href="http://borderless.tech">http://borderless.tech</a>, would be a mesh network of governments that scale from local municipalities to larger regions such as districts, states, and nations. The founding fathers had it right with the design structure of the states, where they act independently of eachother but complement and coexist within the union. That in itself is a form of decentralized network; now we just need to adjust this idea to fit the needs of 100&#39;s of million people, and governing more than sects of land - we are a virtual world now, and its feasible that we can come to a point where we have virtual nations which govern the inter dependency of human relations.</p>

After about 45 years of this, they let us stop working only to find our retirement income doesn&#39;t allow us to enjoy our freedom from labor, the niggling details have only gotten more pressing and more difficult to resolve, and we have neither the money to enjoy our brief haitus before death, or access to medicine that allows us to enjoy that haitus without misery. </p>

<p>two sides of the same coin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is an old meme barely applicable here. When you say that, both sides of the same coin (republicans and democrats) laments that they are very different from the other side and start arguing that, burying the argument. Same thing the political parties have done as far as I remember. If X from party Y has done that, proponent of party Z will jump on the opportunity to bury party Y, and proponent of party Y will point out that W from part Z has done worse. The hype about Russia now is also a good example.</p>

<p>Each party get away with that shit by blaming the other side of the coin...but it seems that for the last 20 years the edge has been growing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fed is the most open and transparent bank ever conceived. </p>

<p>Markets move when the Fed act differently then they expect them to, which means it&#39;s not the rate but the expectation of the rate that really move the market (in the short term). Which also means the Fed has to release this information. </p>

<p>Everything they have ever done is right out there in the open, when they print more money they tell you, when they change rates they tell you, when they provide assistance they tell you. </p>

<p>The chairmen in appointed by the POTUS. So we even can control who runs the bank. We know how much money they make. </p>

<p>Now we can argue if the Fed is needed, if it&#39;s doing the right thing, if it&#39;s really stabilizes the economy. But if we audit it we will find that they have already told us everything. </p>

<p>Ohh and there is this </p>

<p>In 2015, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.[23]</p>

<p>A delusion is a belief in a false reality.</p>

<p>You sir are delusional because you believe in a false reality namely that the FED is hiding something which frankly it would have a hard time doing because everyone watches them, in order to print more money they have to tell the mint and they announce all their qualitative easing and rate changes out loud to the public for you to see. We have their balance sheet and they pay the vast majority of their profits. So let me say again the FED doesn&#39;t do things in secret we know exactly what they do and when the do it and they tell us before they do it. </p>

<p>So where exactly is my false belief? What exactly are you hoping to find? Some crazy scheme? The governors make a billion dollars a year (each give or take) completely legitimately, why the fuck would they risk that money to make pennies more? Come on now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The essence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left.E2.80.93right_paradigm_political_theory">Left-Right Paradigm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;false left–right paradigm&quot; is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.</p>

<p>The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class&#39;s hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.</p>

<p>Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can &#39;throw the rascals out&#39; at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My beach reading a few years back was Murray Rothbard&#39;s History of Money and Banking in the United States.  The title screams &quot;BORING!&quot; but it is just the opposite. He&#39;s a very entertaining writer, with just enough dry sarcasm laid on to let you know he thinks it is as absurd as you do.  Even though it&#39;s entertaining, it also is exhaustively cited - no wild assertions - he can point you to a legitimate link to every fact in the book.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m mentioning it here, is that he detailed exactly how each presidential administration was owned and staffed by various money interests.  The Rockefeller and JP Morgan camps alternated ownership of the presidency through much of the 20th century.  And it&#39;s all detailed in the book, names are named, their jobs before and after their time in government documented.  It makes all the ridiculous campaign hype seem ridiculous.  There&#39;s a lot of noise now about Trump hiring Goldman Sachs people - and I agree that it&#39;s bad - but I never was surprised for even a moment.</p>
