       I'll start this out with I'm a heavy Trump supporter,
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really subscribe to the Russian interference in the election, it sounds like a load of bullshit but this made a bit of sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if Hillary Clinton chose to blame the Russians for everything because that was part of the plan? Her anti-russian stance made Trump take the opposite stance and his base would becom more and more accepting of Russia in general, normalise Putin as a leader and friend of the US in order to drop sanctions sometime in Trump's presidency. She used a laughable cold war strategy in politics, probably fully aware that Americans aren't really worried about them anymore. This made her look out of touch to the Republicans and a shit-tier political operative but also made her look like she was furious and extremely anti-russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then she practically said she would start a war with them when she said she would implement a no-fly zone in Syria and when they were saying that cyber attacks should be dealt with military force amongst other options. No one would even consider that she is taking the dive for Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       She continues to fuck up the campaign royally and then brings up Pepe to stir up /Pol/, /Pol/ then mostly subscribes to the Putin and Russia isn't so bad bandwagon and effectively blinds them from even considering Clinton could be the plant on a large enough scale. The attack on Pepe makes her look even more ridiculous and out of touch, further making people believe she lost due to her incompetence and not from intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also explain why she didn't give much of a shit about rallies most of the time and would rather raise money with celebrities which she then spends on ads from the MSM in record quantities. These are the same networks that are going to hammer down both the emails (making people move away from Hillary) and make it look like Trump was the one working with Russia, taking the eyes off of her. She will also get a kickback from this eventually when no one is looking and she will get a kick back in some form from Russia in the future too.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the two major political parties of the United states had such lack luster security on their computer systems that they were "hacked". Nope. They were leaked intentionally. Nothing that would get anyone into heaps of shit but enough to make it look like they are super incompetent and set up the Russian angle later on in the game. Podesta intentionally fell for a phishing scam too to further the look of incompetence or the guys just a fucking idiot, I'll go with the latter. The reason that the democrats didn't want to turn over their computers for inspection is because people would find out that it was leaked on purpose by someone within the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so much more shit that kind of connects too. I like to think that Hillary is just shit-tier but this is something to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: plus there was more of a chance that she would win as there were really only two serious contenders and Sanders just sat down after he was beatwn, even though they had seemingly screwed the guy through the primaries. We also find out that she pretty much cheated and the DNC favoured her, that's possibly a point of Russian interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Hillary purposefully lost the election because SHE is actually Putin's pawn, not Trump. But she raised so much money to the MSM's help to make it look more and more like Trump is the Russian plant. She is projecting the real her onto Trump to blind them of the situation.

       I too thought that Putin was a strong leader looking out for Russia by telling the central bankers were to shove it. Russia has almost one-third of the world's natural resources, and Putin is in the driver's seat. But, sad to say, he hasn't separated himself from the strong arm of Rothschild. He doesn't want to end up like Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi.

       He's going to lose power if the Russian economy tanks even more than it has. He would be returning it to normalcy using the above method. Then all he has to do is have an incident with the US or a US ally and then they're back at it again with the normal level of anti-american attitude but without the sanctions.

       Correct... but notice how no one in the MSM ever says the word "Communist"... that makes me think that there are Communists in control

        somewhere

       Seems like there were plenty infiltrating the US government back in the early 1950s at the latest... starting "pervert" clubs and then using that information as blackmail to work their way in or gain control over people in the US government... Present day was supposed to be the civil war part of the plan... but the people have been too dumbed down to revolt.

       For all the things you can attribute to Stalinist Soviet spies, marxism isn't one of them.

       Russia called itself communist, but by that point the country had devolved into a degenerated workers state. All of the progressive gains made by the Bolshevik revolution went out the window when Stalin usurped power, paving the way for the reintroduction of capitalism which Trotsky warned would occur were Stalin and his bureacratic criminal clique not removed from power by a conscious working class uprising. Within a couple of years of giving this warning, Trotsky was murdered by Stalin's secret police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalinism masquerading as Marxist communism is tragic on two fronts. First, in claiming Marxism as doctrine, Stalin was able to solidify his power in a weakened nation. Second, it became more and more easy for anti-communists in the West to identify the murderous regime as Marxist communist in their own propaganda. This was quite the huge blow to the movement for genuine socialism (workers and peasants owning the means of production in order to build an equitable society).

       I can't... and neither can anyone that reads a bunch of history books... cause if we can't even trust is written now to be accurate how can we trust shit that is hundreds or thousands of years old.

       I got a whole different approach to understanding and it doesn't have anything to do with what the fuck people supposedly did... I look to the future and not to the past... the view is just as hazy either way... but one direction is much more rewarding to focus on.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ford first voiced his anti-Semitic leanings in 1915, around the time of his "Peace Ship" episode. Eventually, his belief that the "International Jew" was the source of the world's problems led him to conduct a campaign against them in the pages of his newspaper; The Dearborn Independent. The articles in Ford's newspaper blamed the Jews for everything from the Bolshevik Revolution and the First World War to bootlegged liquor and cheap movies. They also accused the Jews of conspiring to enslave Christianity and destroy the "Anglo-Saxon" way of life. The articles were later gathered into book form and published under the title: The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem. This book was translated into 16 languages, and was to have a profound influence upon the growing Nazi movement in Germany. Eventually, Ford publicly apologized for the articles in light of a legal suit. However; he continued to express his anti-Semitic beliefs in his private circles. In the 1930's, he hired many fascist sympathizers, accepted an award from Hitler; and engaged in business ventures in Nazi Germany. In the 1940's, the Ford Motor Company was transformed into a more tolerant organization through the efforts of Ford's son and grandson. However; Ford himself never abandoned his deep-rooted anti-Semitism. His anti-Semitic literature can still be found in great abundance, more than fifty years after his death. While Ford is considered to be a great man by many Americans, he spawned an ugly legacy of hatred and bigotry that still has ramifications today.

       Trotsky described fascism this way:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fascism is not merely a system of reprisals, of brutal force, and of police terror. Fascism is a particular governmental system based on the uprooting of all elements of proletarian democracy within bourgeois society. The task of Fascism lies not only in destroying the Communist advance guard but in holding the entire class in a state of forced disunity. To this end the physical annihilation of the most revolutionary section of the workers does not suffice. It is also necessary to smash all independent and voluntary organizations, to demolish all the defensive bulwarks of the proletariat, and to uproot whatever has been achieved during three quarters of a century by the social democracy and the trade unions. For, in the last analysis, the Communist party also bases itself on these achievements.

       For many, a fascist can be described as simply a right-wing authoritarian opponent of worker control. It's quite impressionistic, and only touches on what constitutes fascism, but I think that it suffices here.

       The only suggestion I'll make to you at this point, if you're so inclined to take a serious approach to history, in general, and the history of the workers movement, is to read the
       <a href="http://www.wsws.org">
        World Socialist Web Site
       </a>
       . I won't claim that you'll be recruited to the side of the working class, but I can almost guarantee that you'll find their analysis (in the tradition of the marxists) is profound. Of course, I've been wrong before.

       We're just not full blown yet... they already made the poor and the middle class on the same footing... major businesses are leading more towards monopolies... the next Ma Bell won't be broken up... it will be taken over by the state.

       Oligarchs like George Soros pull the strings on our government. Look how many high level positions that are held by former Goldman Sachs bankers. We are I am sorry to report a full blown oligarchy.

       Well yeah... Communism doesn't happen over night... they gotta show us how irresponsible we are to have let so few people control us and industry... The government will take the production means from the grips of those nasty oligarchs and put it back in the hands of the people... by giving it to the state.

       It doesn't matter what name you give it, if you start with the Red shield of England and the war of 1812 and look at money and how the powers in charge of the imf and fed have manipulated all the wealth of the world to a smaller and smaller group over time, you realize that China, Russia and the US have been played against each other to grow that wealth. Now the whole world is owned by a small group. George Soros is Definately in that group, the sultan of Brunei, the house of Saud in Saudi Arabia, the English royal family, Carlos Slim of Mexico, and others. Look at how these groups profit by selling weapons and controlling energy markets. The Russian Oligarchs are represented in that group as well. Our governments have been co-opted by the money these folks have pumped into the political systems of the world. At this point in history, with the information available to us on the internet it has never been so obvious that this is the case. Most events, news, paid for media are meant to distract us from the fact that our governments and media are owned by these same individuals that inherited their positions. The last president that tried to do anything about it was brutally murdered in Dallas in front of our eyes to show us the folly of challenging the elite.

       You are a good dude and I am in complete agreement. I don' t trust the government, and I certainly do not depend on the government for anything. However I live a simple lif that is very satifying to me. I hope y opinions have not offended.

       Those rich people are the suckers here... they dedicate their whole lives to hoarding money... once you have more than you can spend you are just wasting time... they keep playing a game that they already won... with no further benefit. They are the ones that are oblivious.

       Yes living a good life is always a good strategy. My concerns lie with oppressed peoples. In Pakistan and India people are sold into 30 years of indentured servitude by their parents. In the US far to many people are jailed for harmless victimless crimes like possession of marijuana or paraphanalia. Being aware and trying to organize resistance to oppression is never a bad thing. I am not recruiting just justifying my opposition to a ruling class.

       I think the establishment wanted war with Russia, in Syria. Since Russia was supporting the Syrian government, and the US was supporting the 'rebels'. The war on terror has been winding down in recent years. The trillion dollar war machine needs to go somewhere,

       Learned people don't answer what if questions.  By saying what you know you also say what you don't know, and that can be used against you.  Answer enough what if questions and a skilled person can talk you into a corner and make you look like a fool.
