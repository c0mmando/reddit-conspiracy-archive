    <div class="md"><p>i hope it&#39;s something about the pedo rings, but really.. it could be anything that upsets the proverbial &quot;apple cart&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>currency manipulation</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 planning / execution details</p></li>
<li><p>UFO / alien existence</p></li>
<li><p>free energy schematics</p></li>
<li><p>Proof that Seth Rich was murdered by DNC insiders</p></li>
</ul>

<p>etc.  i have even scratched the surface of posibilities....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of those seem really unlikely for different reasons.</p>

<p>UFO/Free energy.  That just wouldn&#39;t get people killed.  The public would be distracted by the implications of each, and would change focus from government, to those revelations.   Free energy has more chance to get them killed over UFO&#39;s though.</p>

<p>Seth Rich murdered, is probably 50/50 depending on who had it ordered.</p>

<p>Currency manipulation, people just wouldn&#39;t give a fuck over.  </p>

<p>9/11 and pedophile rings are the two most kill worthy, but the chances are also the lowest of being revealed.  I&#39;d imagine most 9/11 documents that are absolutely heinous, if any, have been destroyed.   Pedophile rings are just unlikely - it would be insanely hard to prove, and they ensure their information is accurate before release.    I&#39;m not saying pedophile rings are uncommon (Well, true rings are, but that&#39;s semantics..), but proven individuals is insanely hard, even special units dedicated to taking down pedophiles, have a hard time proving identities unless the person outs themselves.  </p>

<p>My personal guess, is that they received a tip that there is a plan in motion, likely due to previous releases, and are therefore taking precautions.</p>
