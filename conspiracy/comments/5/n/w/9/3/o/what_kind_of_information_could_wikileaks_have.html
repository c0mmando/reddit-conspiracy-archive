       Only one man operations like Michael Hayden can be taken out for finding something too big.  I assume the story had to do with child sex rings and maybe Wikileaks finally got the docs he was on to before he got murdered, spooking the source.

       Someone that is going to get life in prison/executed because of the election results anyways... so they might as well take everyone else in the files down with them by setting off the deadman switch and hoping you escape in all the chaos or just feel a bit of "misery loves company". Sore loser sour puss of some sort prolly.

       All of those seem really unlikely for different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       UFO/Free energy.  That just wouldn't get people killed.  The public would be distracted by the implications of each, and would change focus from government, to those revelations.   Free energy has more chance to get them killed over UFO's though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich murdered, is probably 50/50 depending on who had it ordered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currency manipulation, people just wouldn't give a fuck over.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 and pedophile rings are the two most kill worthy, but the chances are also the lowest of being revealed.  I'd imagine most 9/11 documents that are absolutely heinous, if any, have been destroyed.   Pedophile rings are just unlikely - it would be insanely hard to prove, and they ensure their information is accurate before release.    I'm not saying pedophile rings are uncommon (Well, true rings are, but that's semantics..), but proven individuals is insanely hard, even special units dedicated to taking down pedophiles, have a hard time proving identities unless the person outs themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal guess, is that they received a tip that there is a plan in motion, likely due to previous releases, and are therefore taking precautions.

       Remember,  whatever wikileaks releases, it won't matter until the PEOPLE do something about it.  We already know that the agencies won't do anything to stop what's going on,  because they've been bought and paid for, for decades.
