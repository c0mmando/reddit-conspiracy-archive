<p>She destroyed 13 separate devices and wiped a server after the investigation started, all with sensitive documents on them. Destroying evidence in an investigation is prison time. </p>

<p>Her and Bill stole and pork barreled the Haiti relief fund, money that was supposed to be used for housing was handed off to rich buddies. </p>

<p>We can speculate about her relationship with Saudi Arabia, African dictators, George Soros, Jeffrey Epstein, and we can speculate about her actions in Syria and Libya, but Haiti and her emails are two cut and dry reasons she deserves to be in prison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump drops repeated threat to jail Clinton: &#39;She went through a lot&#39;</p>

<p>The president-elect ‘doesn’t wish to pursue’ criminal investigations into Clinton over her use of a private email server, despite vows he made during campaign</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” Trump said, according to a tweet by Times journalist Mike Grynbaum. “She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.”</p>

<p>Trump was then pressed on whether he had definitively ruled out a prosecution, Grynbaum reported. The president-elect replied: “It’s just not something that I feel very strongly about.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Both she and Trump should be in prison. If you have a problem with her and not with him - given all of the evidence available that shows the criminal corruption of both, you really need to open your eyes and get off your knees. Very low energy. Sad!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me some real news on how Trump should be convicted, like I have here for Hillary, and I&#39;ll join your bandwagon.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t trusted anything I&#39;ve heard from the &quot;news&quot;, but so far all I&#39;ve heard is that Trump worked with Russia to hack emails, which all sounds to me like a diversion tactic to keep people from being concerned about the emails. I have yet to see actually proof for this claim, like I have for the claims that Hillary stole the Haitian relief fund and destroyed evidence. </p>

<p>Before you think someone is a Trump supporter, and you put the devil horns on them in your mind, stop for a moment and think about opposing perspectives that could also be true about a person.  </p>

<p>Extremism is a sign of misused energy, learn not to jump to conclusions and fabricate narratives that actually don&#39;t exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read that dossier, then search for the numbers and companies listed and compare to real life. It also discusses the DNC leaks and insiders at DNC (Seth Rich?) exfiltrating data. At least two sources in that doc are no longer living, dead in the last three weeks after the dossier was leaked. Also, that is one document - there are more out there.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t close yourself off from knowledge due to partisanship and a craving for some kind of God hero. There are no God heroes. I mean, you can live inside a delusion, but waking up hurts a lot more. And willfully staying asleep probably hurts even more than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only god is objective reality, I&#39;m also waiting for Trump to prove himself as part of the status quo, which all of his cabinet selections would be good starter indications, but not wholly indicative that he&#39;ll step in lime with the status quo. </p>

<p>The moment there is absolute confirmation that he wants war with Iran, then I&#39;ll know he&#39;s no good. </p>
