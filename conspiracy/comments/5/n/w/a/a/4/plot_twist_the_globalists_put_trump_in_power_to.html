    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, with the huge blowback from MSM and the even bigfer effort to delegitimize Trump every day, I have hopes that he will actually do some good. But with his cabinet, and some of his public stances, I&#39;m not super hopeful. We&#39;ll have to see what he does </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a possibility. They lost way too much money on this election. Also with Israel and the UN hating each other and trump being there for the cabal makes me skeptical about this theory.</p>

<p>It sounds very like the whole bill Clinton &amp; trump posted in this sub daily last summer. Everyone saying it&#39;s a joke but we can all agree that the clintons destroyed trumps rep with half the country and trump destroyed hers for the other half. Not to mention ALL THAT MONEY. She spent a bil and soros lost a bill. </p>

<p>I do think trump obviously works for the cabal or he is aligning with them to take over the oil game. Like greenwald said, trump halting the whole Syria bullshit the CIA and clinton/Obama were stirring up because of a fucking pipeline. Trump is against the globalists. If you want to get into a difference between them and the right wing of Israel we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Way too much money&quot; is extremely relative you know?</p>

<p>Soros actually ended up in the black after profiting from Trump&#39;s victory. The entire stock market has been doing extremely well,  with big banks doing the best as Trump lines his cabinet with Goldman Sachs people. Soros was able to recover a billion dollar in losses AND THEN MAKE ANOTHER +10% last year immediately after the election.</p>

<p>What makes this so damming to me is Soros, Hilary, and Trump are no strangers to each other. Even Ivanka and Chelsea are best friends. Trump is a complete fraud. He&#39;s said polar opposite things for years, and all &quot;his&quot; positons change constantly.</p>

<p>The tenants of democracy is the only way for the people to retain power, so ask yourself, why WOULDN&#39;T they try to undermine that by creating a no-win scenario?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my general feeling as well. I happened to catch Trump&#39;s propaganda minister, Katrina Pierson, on Hannity tonight, she said the president elect is now going to focus more on Islamic terrorism and growing the military. War is a favored hobby of the elite. </p>

<p>President Obama, who campaigned on a peace platform, approved more military spending than any other president since world war 2. About a hundred billion more per year than George W. </p>

<p>I mention President Obama merely to show that although we should have seen many big differences between the last two presidents, on many key issues there was very little difference, despite their opposing ideologies. </p>

<p>This, to me, is evidence that presidents serve the interests of a higher, hidden power.</p>
