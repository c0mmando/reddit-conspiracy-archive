    <div class="md"><p>Heh, they say that each year.  Flu shot only protects vs anticipated strains, not the ones they didn&#39;t expect to be strong.</p>

<p>You got hit by a strong one.  You were overdue if you&#39;ve been healthy for 15 years. :). Don&#39;t panic.  I used to get a flu shot to make myself stronger. But I honeestly think getting infected and letting the body deal with it is ideal.  Of course if you get a chest or throat infection, go in for antibiotics.  Don&#39;t get wrapped up in getting sick.  It is natural, and your body will take care of it.  Eat and drink well, rest, let nature take its course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, it is likely a symbiotic relationship between two or more infectious elements. I think is has been developed and it is part of the Technocratic solution to the &#39;useless eater&#39; problem. Look up the borax conspiracy, find out why franckisence and myrrh were so highly valued, and look into the uses of vitamin d and epsom salt. Then watch any talks you can by Angela Belcher and Paul Stamets (fascinating if not helpful). Your body is a temple, and you are its steward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use to get 3 or 4 sinus infections a year and I would goto the doctor and they would always give me antibiotics etc. I started doing some research on herbs and vitamins and found some excellent products that gave helped my family and I so much that I haven&#39;t been on antibiotics for 5 or 5 years. I&#39;ll list them and hopefully they will also help some of you.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wellness Formula tablets (Source Natural)</li>
<li>Oreganol p73 (North American Herb &amp; Spice)</li>
<li>SinuOrega nasal spray(North American Herb &amp; Spice) *It burns the first few times but works like a charm!</li>
<li>Vitamin Code RAW Zinc (Garden of Life)</li>
<li>Vitamin Code RAW Vitamin D (Garden of Life)</li>
</ol>

<p>If I start feeling like shit I will take quite a bit of everything but daily I still take 1 wellness, 1 zinc, and in the winter vitamin d. I also use the nasal spray almost daily.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

Even a trained eye can have a hell of a time spotting it.  The mold is often not visible at harvest, or grows in the first few days of the drying process.  Using a bright white LED light can help one notice any irregularities.   No need to get paranoid, just trying to spread awareness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okokok, stomach virus and upper respiratory? That is a strange combo of symptoms. If you research fungal diseases, this is a hallmark of fungal stuff, random incongruous symptoms even betwern like populations. I wrote in another comment, but I also suspect it could be some crazy combo like a fungus and a baxteria working in tandem i.e. symbiosis. If you go to the doc and get an anti-fungal or anti-bacterial, it will always help a little bit at first, but it will never cure you fully. Good luck God bless your health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a conspiracy. Either scientists don&#39;t fucking understand science or they do. There are no other options. Either way, we are being poisoned and infected, and effective treatment is being mitigated thoroughly. It is a culmination of conspiracies by medical institutions to teach doctors only what will cure symptoms and to not address the root causes of illness. It is a conspiracy about removing essential nutrients from our food supply. It is a conspiracy about attacking our systems with chemicals like chloramine and various forms of fluoride to keep us dumb and complacent. The attack on your personhood and every individual person and their right and ability to decide how to take care of themselves is THE CONSPIRACY. They are out to make it so difficult to take care of yourself that you can no longer feasibly be independent.</p>

Look up Angela Belcher for some crazy connections. It is fucking really real. You will be infected with something that can build circuits someday soon. When you &#39;get better&#39; you will not be fully better. I believe it to be something they are planning to or already have used to reprogram people. Even down to theur DNA. Honestly, I don&#39;t know what this is or what caused it to spread, but it is fucking really,really real. To fight it myself, I have been using Franckinsence, myrrh, borax, epsom salt and vitmain d3 mainly. Do your research, figure out dosing, and cure yourself.
