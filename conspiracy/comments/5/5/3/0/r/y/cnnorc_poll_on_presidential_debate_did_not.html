       41% of those polled also said they were democrats opposed to 26% who said they were republican.  I wonder how it would look if they polled an even number from each party.

       You don't necessarily want an even number of people per party. Rather you want to be close to the true breakdown of the US population.
      </p>
      <p>
       either way, 41% is clearly oversampling democrats. CNN/ORC's most recent presidential poll (9/8) said
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        32% described themselves as Democrats, 28% described themselves as Republicans, and 40%
described themselves as independents or members of another party.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       whereas in this poll:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        26% of the respondents who participated in tonight's survey
identified themselves as Republicans, 41% identified
themselves as Democrats, and 33% identified themselves as
Independents.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       CNN claims this is based on who responded to their poll. But I'm skeptical because this is the most watched debate in history.

       Pollsters are all about this shit. During the primaries, they polled "likely democratic voters" in order to make it seem like Clinton was winning. In reality, they used only "likely democratic voters" because it cut away young people and independents, two demographics where Sanders DOMINATED. It also cut away first-time voters altogether whether they be 18 this year or 50.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't be surprised that pollsters would twist statistics to fit their goals. "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." Always be skeptical of a source with an agenda.

       That's what I thought at first. But after looking more closely I realized they really don't have people under 50, or they don't have enough to change the averages by even a single point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Clinton line: 62% of respondents said Clinton won. 62% of 50-64 said Clinton, 61% of 65+ said Clinton. This means that if there were respondents outside of those age groups, there were not enough to change the final result by even a single percentage point.
      </p>
      <p>
       For college grads and non/college grads (also on page 9) it again averages to exactly 50/50 college and non-college for both Trump and Clinton supporters.

        (In the US population, it's closer to 70% non-college
       </a>
       )

       edit: clarified some things. Also if any editors/journos are interested, an academic researcher friend of mine is doing a more in-depth analysis of this, PM me and I can put you in touch.

       Sure. That's just seems highly improbable given that we know that the under 50 demographic and the over 50 demographic are never in that close agreement on CNN/ORC polls.
