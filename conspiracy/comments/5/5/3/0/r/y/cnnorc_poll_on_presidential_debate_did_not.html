    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t necessarily want an even number of people per party. Rather you want to be close to the true breakdown of the US population. </p>

<p>either way, 41% is clearly oversampling democrats. CNN/ORC&#39;s most recent presidential poll (9/8) said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>32% described themselves as Democrats, 28% described themselves as Republicans, and 40%
described themselves as independents or members of another party.</p>

<p>whereas in this poll:</p>

<p>26% of the respondents who participated in tonight&#39;s survey
identified themselves as Republicans, 41% identified
themselves as Democrats, and 33% identified themselves as
Independents.</p>

<p>CNN claims this is based on who responded to their poll. But I&#39;m skeptical because this is the most watched debate in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pollsters are all about this shit. During the primaries, they polled &quot;likely democratic voters&quot; in order to make it seem like Clinton was winning. In reality, they used only &quot;likely democratic voters&quot; because it cut away young people and independents, two demographics where Sanders DOMINATED. It also cut away first-time voters altogether whether they be 18 this year or 50. </p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be surprised that pollsters would twist statistics to fit their goals. &quot;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&quot; Always be skeptical of a source with an agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought at first. But after looking more closely I realized they really don&#39;t have people under 50, or they don&#39;t have enough to change the averages by even a single point. </p>

<p>Look at the Clinton line: 62% of respondents said Clinton won. 62% of 50-64 said Clinton, 61% of 65+ said Clinton. This means that if there were respondents outside of those age groups, there were not enough to change the final result by even a single percentage point. </p>

<p>For college grads and non/college grads (also on page 9) it again averages to exactly 50/50 college and non-college for both Trump and Clinton supporters.  <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/08/rick-santorum/70-americans-dont-have-college-degree-rick-santoru/">(In the US population, it&#39;s closer to 70% non-college</a>)</p>

<p>edit: clarified some things. Also if any editors/journos are interested, an academic researcher friend of mine is doing a more in-depth analysis of this, PM me and I can put you in touch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. That&#39;s just seems highly improbable given that we know that the under 50 demographic and the over 50 demographic are never in that close agreement on CNN/ORC polls. </p>

<p>My friend sent them an e-mail requesting clarification yesterday morning and hasn&#39;t heard back. </p>
