       I've been looking into the Clinton Body Count list and I was surprised by the findings. Their is enough evidence of mysterious deaths and cover-ups that I am certain many of the claims are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I am having a rough time tracking down primary sources. Let's examine the James Dewey Milam case as an example...
      </p>
      <p>
       Another case involved James "Dewey" Milam whose body was found without the head. In this case, Malak ruled the cause of death to be an ulcer. Although Milam's head had been clearly severed with a knife, Malak claimed the family pooch had bitten off the head, eaten the entire thing, and then regurgitated it. Malak says he tested the dog's vomit and found traces of Milam's brain and skull. Unfortunately for Dr. Malak, Milam's head was later found. Malak, it turns out, had made up the entire story. Media coverage of Malak's dishonest rulings resulted in a massive public outcry calling for his removal from office."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find any information confirming his head was later found. Anyone have a source for this? I think a public
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       google spreadsheet with a list of deaths would be a good project.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should include the victim, the motive, the connection to the Clintons, and as many sources as possible. Primary sources are most important.
      </p>
      <p>
       *I am not considering suicide.
