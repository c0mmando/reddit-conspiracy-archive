        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into the Clinton Body Count list and I was surprised by the findings. Their is enough evidence of mysterious deaths and cover-ups that I am certain many of the claims are true.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am having a rough time tracking down primary sources. Let&#39;s examine the James Dewey Milam case as an example...</p>

<p>Another case involved James &quot;Dewey&quot; Milam whose body was found without the head. In this case, Malak ruled the cause of death to be an ulcer. Although Milam&#39;s head had been clearly severed with a knife, Malak claimed the family pooch had bitten off the head, eaten the entire thing, and then regurgitated it. Malak says he tested the dog&#39;s vomit and found traces of Milam&#39;s brain and skull. Unfortunately for Dr. Malak, Milam&#39;s head was later found. Malak, it turns out, had made up the entire story. Media coverage of Malak&#39;s dishonest rulings resulted in a massive public outcry calling for his removal from office.&quot; </p>

<p>I can&#39;t find any information confirming his head was later found. Anyone have a source for this? I think a public <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> google spreadsheet with a list of deaths would be a good project.</p>

<p>It should include the victim, the motive, the connection to the Clintons, and as many sources as possible. Primary sources are most important.</p>

<p>*I am not considering suicide.</p>
