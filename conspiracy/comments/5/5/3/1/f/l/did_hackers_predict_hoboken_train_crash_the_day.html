<p>Last night around 615 PM locals in New York received a FEMA message across their TVs stating there was a hazardous waste warning for USA and then said &quot;could you/ would you ride a train&quot;. Local News WKTV reported FEMA had been hacked. Today in Hoboken a train crashed with at least 1 dead and more than 100 injured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Green Eggs and Ham line is the huge clue. It&#39;s a cryptic message for someone.</p>

<p>I searched for [green eggs and ham terrorism] and the first thing I found was Ted Cruz&#39;s filibuster in which he read Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor. This pushed the government to the edge of a shutdown.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is political distraction. This is political gamesmanship. And I think the American people find it ridiculous that in response to an ISIS terror attack the Democrats go on high dudgeon that we’ve got to restrict the 2nd amendment rights of law abiding citizens. This is not a gun control issue. This is a terrorism issue. And it is nothing less than political gamesmanship for them to try to shift for their favorite hobby-horse, of taking away the Bill of Rights from law-abiding citizens.”</p>

<p>(Notice the heavy democratic slant in the article)</p>

<p>Could there be more to it? Is this a Republican vs Democrat conspiracy? Was this a warning to people like Ted Cruz not to fuck with the Democrats? Was this <em>revenge</em>?</p>

<p>Furthermore, Cruz was the only thing that could derail Trump for the Republicans and he&#39;s out of the picture now. Trump could very well be a Clinton plant as people have suggested. He thinks Oswald acted alone. Pair it with the character assassination attempt the media (and Trump!) pushed about Cruz&#39; supposed family ties to the JFK assassination and you have yourself one nice big conspiracy soup. Careful, it&#39;s a salty one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The News Station, or any for that matter, have neglected to acknowledge anything synchronous about the warning. There&#39;s another shard of proof for those who cant fathom the idea of an inside job. These people, who, through their manipulation of the mass media, convinced us that we could trust them with our Lives have effectively ruined them. Ended them, too. They&#39;re sick pups. Like, irrevocably and incurably vile pieces of gnarly shit from something&#39;s gross ass. But, paradoxically, they are giving us a fucking badass once-in-all-of-humankind-opportunity and, in a sense, are opening a portal for us to step through and potentially surf a wave of Karmic Redemption. There is a reason that there are more people on this Earth than ever before; these are the most interesting times in human history!</p>

<p>We just have to approach it correctly and we have to take responsibility for our mistake in trusting these &#39;dump people&#39; because that was 100% our fault, but also manage to laser these cancer-laden, walking skin-tags off of our planet (necks, backs, arms, tummies etc..)</p>

<p>I think we can do this with humor. Anger and hurt feeds evil, and evil gets stronger with every hit of anger and hurt. But I&#39;ve noticed that Evil doesnt take mockery very well. They dont like to feel silly, if they did they wouldnt need all of that fucking gold. </p>

<p>Join me, somehow, in exposing the comedic value in how theyve hurt us, killed our friends and loved ones, and let us blame and kill someone else for it. An eye for an eye doesnt make sense anymore, right? Now both parties now only have one eye..and none the wiser. Please don&#39;t forget that Humor is Derived from Tragedy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so I hate ever having to put my tinfoil hat on, but damn seeing that video before showing the emergency broadcast message that displayed: &quot;Would you. Could you. On a train?&quot;. Why is there a reference to Doctor Seuss&#39;s, &quot;Green Eggs And Ham&quot;. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did some snooping and found this too... Familiar voice at the end seems to be Rush Limbaugh? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2WJ4ghNgQk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2WJ4ghNgQk</a></p></li>
<li><p>Also, here is the same EAS broadcast but a different person recording:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDMs1ZLV2xI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDMs1ZLV2xI</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The news station that broadcasted the message did actually post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FEMA replied that they did not send this out. They will launch a full investigation into how their codes were hacked. WKTV seems to be the only target of this hack. For now, we have disabled the codes in our decoder that trigger this alert. If there is a real National Alert, we will still receive it from the local radio stations we are assigned to monitor. WKTV will cooperate fully with FEMA, providing information about our hardware, software and internet access, and will provide log files from our devices. This information will be helpful to FEMA to track down the source of this hack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a system like this actually &#39;hackable&#39;/&#39;overrideable&#39;? Sorry I&#39;m very ignorant when it comes to this kind of stuff. Just curious if this is weird for anyone else?</p>

<p>Anyhow, is something like this actually doable, for a regular-ass dude?
