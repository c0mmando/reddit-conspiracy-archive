       Seriously that place needs to be wiped off of reddit it's ridiculous how much bullshit and one-sided agenda driven drivel is there. question: is it possible for whoever is technically owner of that sub to simply delete it , forcing every mod off the site and restart fresh ? because this needs to be done.

       Seriously.  That subreddit is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried to post shit in it that isn't bad content but simply goes significantly against their agenda and the downvotes its given me has caused me to be unable to post within the subreddit except for once every 10 minutes.  I won't say my posts were the best or most accurate ever but they were not content free or trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downvoting system there is being abused, they're silencing different opinions, and they're promoting their own personal agenda which is potentially swaying the uninformed public through personal bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not cost a lot for someone to infiltrate a subreddit and control the messages being promoted within it.  I'm not saying it's happening, but that it would likely cost less to do this than air commercials on public television.

       This shit happens in ever single sub, especially in this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also looking at your post history you have plenty of upvotes in r/politics too, additionally your posts are right along the lines of what would be considered "hivemind" in r/politics so what's the deal? Concern trolling? And which sub are you concern trolling, this sub or that sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: He's not a concern troll, just another lost wanderer looking for a sub to call home, good luck!

       I don't think anything I've said is strictly what concern trolling is.  Concern trolling seems to be about pushing opinions on others, when in reality I'm suggesting others utilize their own resources to dig into the subject more and formulate their own opinions on the subject rather than take the article at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       A concern troll seems to be feigning concern and purely causing disruption, while I'm legitimately concerned if people are not seeking more truth beyond what is immediately given to them.

       But you clearly don't have a problem in or with r/politics yet here you are feigning like you are, so you're either concern trolling for the karma, concern trolling for some effect within this sub or that, and you can say your goals are whatever but it doesn't change the evidence that you have no more trouble hanging out in r/politics than I do, and I'm there often and espouse the same politics you seemed to at my glance at your history, yet here you are bemoaning about it being compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       So like I said we're of similar political leanings, except I'm not here to fuck with these guys, I'm here out of my interest in conspiracies and to offer a dissenting opinion since most of these guys lean Right or Libertarian or similar political outlooks, whereas I lean Left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care either way I just thought it was funny, here you were working to join the r/conspiracy "hivemind" yet once anyone looked at your history you're just as much of a "libtard" as I am.

       I have a post chain there at least starting at -35 and slowly lowering in negative points until the bottom.  And my recent one is getting negative votes as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand it's reddit so it's hard to get people to vote accurately, but the majority of what I've posted there isn't me trying to fuck with people but to get them to really question what it is they're supporting.

       But if you're in r/politics trying to convince people not to vote for Trump, or to change the topic to something with more substance concerning Trump you're preaching to the choir but also at the wrong time to preach to them, that hivemind is in win now mode, the only thing they want is to crush dissenting opinion and prove Trump is wrong/lying/hypocrite/etc., which yeah he's a huge fucking tool, but they don't seem to want to get back to discussions about actual problems right now, it's all about the election, I'm sure once the election passes we'll get back to the issues over there in r/politics.

       They're a lot more balanced but there is a strong Pro-Hillary faction among the users and as much as it breaks my heart as a Bernie supporter they freaking loathe Bernie supporters, there is also a mellower yet seemingly more informed Donald faction there as well, but the mods seem to take it seriously and that's a positive.

       well, that's not job of reddit is it?  Subs are moderated and decided by the users.  If what they are doing attracts users, why should somebody else try to force them to stop?

       And giving reddit the power to shut down subs isn't going to end well with smaller subs like this one.

       If they want to be totally bias and sold out then that's their choice.  I don't think it should be deleted but it should definitely not be a default sub.

       You cannot delete the illuminati or the zionists; They won't delete themselves. The same goes for any subreddit; They won't bicker because we deleted it. They just go under different names.

       The Jews were banned in over 180 countries in the past and all it took was sending out Hitler and Mussolini, purchase the Japanese, have them all defeated and the Jews were no longer banned in any country.

       If you really want to have an effect in r/politics, stick to facts over fiction, provide sources without being asked, and don't let them bait you into hurling insults, difficult as that may be.  If my observations are correct, they may downvote a point you make, but they will downvote it to oblivion if you violate the rules which I have outlined.  Often enough there are other freindlies fighting through the detritus, and they will assist you.

       As a Libertarian I am semi active over there, regularly attack both HRC and Trump, and yet somehow I have remained in the positive.  This is my only account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is they want you to give up....so don't.  Force those CTR shills to work.  Make them prove their attempts at points, and counterattack with all that is unholy about HRC.....best part about that is, you never run out of ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nothing else, I will make them earn their fee.

       I don't think anything I've said is strictly what concern trolling is.  Concern trolling seems to be about pushing opinions on others, when in reality I'm suggesting others utilize their own resources to dig into the subject more and formulate their own opinions on the subject rather than take the article at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       A concern troll seems to be feigning concern and purely causing disruption, while I'm legitimately concerned if people are not seeking more truth beyond what is immediately given to them.
