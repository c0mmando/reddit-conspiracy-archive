        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In response to the Reddit thread <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/559ecs/fda_tests_confirm_oatmeal_baby_foods_contain/?st=itqea30l&amp;sh=982b3077">FDA Tests Confirm Oatmeal, Baby Foods Contain Residues of Monsanto Weed Killer</a>, I submitted this comment below. I noticed it would not show up. Then I decided to check if I could submit comments such as &quot;testing, glyphosate, crop desiccation&quot; and so on. Everything showed up except for the entire copy pasta or any portion of that copy pasta. </p>

<p>The censored copy pasta (slightly modified to suit current news article):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not certain if it is a widespread practice to use glyphosate (round-up) as a pre or post harvest desiccant (spraying a crop such as wheat to speed up drying time or nuke the field of weeds), but it would make sense that this is the case. Here we go:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/</a></p>

<p>Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid. <strong>In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties.</strong> These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate&#39;s toxicity to humans. </p>

<p>The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. <strong>The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>And for the people who will inevitably claim that crop desiccation is not a thing, see here:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBo4C96Ju0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBo4C96Ju0</a></p>

<p>And here is an excerpt from a German study on glyphosate desiccation: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en</a></p>

<p>“Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer. </p>

<p>9 comments in the thread, but only 6 show up. They are censoring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_desiccation">crop desiccation wikipedia</a> as well as this study: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would that I could up arrow this a thousand times. I&#39;d like to suggest that we work against TTP TTIP and whatever clone trade agreement they come up with. An article, such as this, would get you sued/fined with no recourse to your legal system or Congress or law enforcement. They only have to <strong>say you are hurting profits</strong>. It costs 800 Dollars an hour to use their own arbitration.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that this practice as detailed above is literally destroying the &quot;Breadbasket of the World&quot;. I encourage you to research the collapse of wheat prices and other grains. This may well be a depopulation/genocide agenda. </p>

<p>Be vigilant now that they&#39;ve got an unholy merger with IG Farben (poison gas) aka Bayer (who shipped drugs contaminated with AIDS!). Where are the great men of old? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They dessicate sugar cane with glyphosate, too. Wonder if they do the same to corn grits - conventional wheat, oats, and grits give me massive heartburn, I haven&#39;t been able to eat and enjoy them since the 90s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey there, I see that you&#39;ve discovered Dr. Stephanie Seneff :)</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. The post about this study in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> didn&#39;t get much attention for some reason.</p>

<p>I just made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55kvcx/my_research_on_glyphosate_roundup_brain_dump/">post</a> about the research I have done on glyphosate, give it a read if you are interested,</p>
