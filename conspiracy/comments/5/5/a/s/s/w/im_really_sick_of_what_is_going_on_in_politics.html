<p>Appalled with what I found, i continued to spot check 20+ users...</p>

<p>Literally ALL of them has page after page of SOLELY anti trump posts.  It&#39;s really disturbing.  Like 30 posts a day, some dating back 3, 4 months+</p>

<p>Why is this allowed?  It&#39;s really an eye opener of what is happening all over the internet.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be the &quot;paid shills&quot; guy, but literally it seems these people are professionally hired to shit on Trump.  </p>

<p>I personally am undecided, but shit like this makes me hate hilary even more.  </p>

<p>I did not run into ONE real account with a mixture of posts in other forums or other subject matter.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure but its obvious they have been pushing this stuff hard recently. They dont even make it subtle. They even go to places like 4chan and post endless threads its really annoying. Its really funny actually because they make it so obvious whats going on everyone understands the support for her isnt organic and it just ends up annoying all the regular users of the forums/message boards and they end up hating Hillary because shes invading their online space. I know a bunch of people who registered to vote and are voting for Trump just because they were so pissed that Hillary would try and manipulate internet forums like that in such a destructive way. </p>

<p>While the bias didn&#39;t start till CTR started doing its shilling, I strongly believe a ton of it is done by volunteers nowadays. Check out last weeks episode of The Circus on Showtime, gives a quick glimpse inside Hilary&#39;s office and those lunatics analyze everything then instantly put out something on the net when they have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is that while it is ment to foster the undecided voters into Hillary&#39;s camp, via an idea that there are millions of people who love her so somehow her crimes must not be that bad, and look how bad the other guy is. It gets boring real quick, and makes people question the legitimacy of it all. It&#39;s doing the opposite effect; just like the skewing of the polls. While I&#39;m no trump supporter, i would - gun to my head - vote him in over hillary BECAUSE of the overwhelming amount of collusion, corruption, and disgust the elite have for him, and how much gross support the elite have for Hillary. </p>

<p>I&#39;m voting Johnson on election day, he&#39;s an honest guy and when you say &quot;well he would sign the tpp&quot;, i garentee the person who gets into office will sign it; atleast Johnson is homest about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that &#39;shilling&#39; is one of the fastest growing trends on the Net. Don&#39;t think that Trump doesn&#39;t have paid shills doing there work. Anyone with enough money and concern for their public image are paying people to shill for them.</p>

<p>Posts here or anywhere need to be considered for their content. Don&#39;t let a post sway your opinion but do follow the info it provides yourself and check to find out the truth.</p>
