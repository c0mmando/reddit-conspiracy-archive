       Browsing around r/politics, I decided to spot check post history of some posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appalled with what I found, i continued to spot check 20+ users...
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally ALL of them has page after page of SOLELY anti trump posts.  It's really disturbing.  Like 30 posts a day, some dating back 3, 4 months+
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this allowed?  It's really an eye opener of what is happening all over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to be the "paid shills" guy, but literally it seems these people are professionally hired to shit on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally am undecided, but shit like this makes me hate hilary even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not run into ONE real account with a mixture of posts in other forums or other subject matter.

       Right, cool.. I'm just trying to get informed and understand how it works. Would you say it's mostly from this PAC? I see the 'Join Us' on their website .. zip code and email.. but how does it work.. can anyone join and then you send proof of your shillings or something? Or are they all working together in some office block?

       Not sure but its obvious they have been pushing this stuff hard recently. They dont even make it subtle. They even go to places like 4chan and post endless threads its really annoying. Its really funny actually because they make it so obvious whats going on everyone understands the support for her isnt organic and it just ends up annoying all the regular users of the forums/message boards and they end up hating Hillary because shes invading their online space. I know a bunch of people who registered to vote and are voting for Trump just because they were so pissed that Hillary would try and manipulate internet forums like that in such a destructive way.

       This. Problem is that's like asking cnn or nbc to be neutral. At the end of the day that sub is moderated by other users, who are obviously extreme democrats so they do what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the bias didn't start till CTR started doing its shilling, I strongly believe a ton of it is done by volunteers nowadays. Check out last weeks episode of The Circus on Showtime, gives a quick glimpse inside Hilary's office and those lunatics analyze everything then instantly put out something on the net when they have it.

       It's impossible to have neutral news sources, so the best hope that we have is a website that let's you pick your newsfeeds on a single website like how Reddit has their own reddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way you can compare  news from different websites on a single website. It will be Neutral as you would be receiving streamed news from biased Liberal &amp; Biased conservative outlets on the same site.

       It's disgusting. I've migrated to this sub for the "news" I used to get in r/politics. Looks like tptb figured out how to control the internet. Before CTR there was plenty of honest comments from real people; pro-bernie comments would be upvoted even in New York Times politics articles on their website. The way they have encroached the internet is seriously frightening.

       This political cycle has ruined so many publications for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       From news sites I found unbiased, to bloggers and musicians choosing Hillary Clinton to endorse, all the posturing, propaganda and lies, I'm flat out disgusted and my eyes are wider open than ever before.

      <p>
       Hillary is out here laundering money to fucking GQ to write slander pieces against Trump... GQ. She's got rappers with lyrics about selling cocaine like Pusha T helping push voter registration in Virginia, enough is enough.

       it just does not matter who you vote for - it will change nothing. its all about to giving you the illusion you have something to say. you can choose between pest or cholera - congratz. even talking about who is better or who is worse is just pathetic and stupid.

       It's all a show. Trump is an asshole oligarch, Clinton is an asshole oligarch. Clinton is paying people troll online, but that doesn't make her worse or better than the "competition". It's like comparing apples to oranges... Or rotten apples to rotten oranges. It's all bullshit either way.

       has been leaning pro-Trump lately. You don't see much negative mention of him except for maybe being a pylon for Hillary to walk around to the Presidency.

       I'm not out to get Donald as he is my preferential candidate between the two (id rather neither), but this is simply an observation I made, that much like

       doesn't allow Pro-Trump, we don't really allow Pro-Hillary (not that there is much) (from this perspective).

       I know what you mean. It's pretty insane. It's just non-stop anti-trump headlines and character attacks all the time. Thing that makes me sad is that your average person might not take the time to research Clinton's faults, but will have had Trump's faults plastered into their might by the propaganda.

       Well then it's not a guarantee it works.  Politics in general is about the perception of reality.  We see what they want us to see and they teach us what they want us to know.

       The funny thing is that while it is ment to foster the undecided voters into Hillary's camp, via an idea that there are millions of people who love her so somehow her crimes must not be that bad, and look how bad the other guy is. It gets boring real quick, and makes people question the legitimacy of it all. It's doing the opposite effect; just like the skewing of the polls. While I'm no trump supporter, i would - gun to my head - vote him in over hillary BECAUSE of the overwhelming amount of collusion, corruption, and disgust the elite have for him, and how much gross support the elite have for Hillary.
      </p>

       I'm voting Johnson on election day, he's an honest guy and when you say "well he would sign the tpp", i garentee the person who gets into office will sign it; atleast Johnson is homest about it.

       The truth is that 'shilling' is one of the fastest growing trends on the Net. Don't think that Trump doesn't have paid shills doing there work. Anyone with enough money and concern for their public image are paying people to shill for them.
