       Because nobody ever discusses "European Art", nobody is going to make a website for "European Art".  Europe is full of so many different cultures and art traditions, that are extremely well-documented, the phrase would be uselessly vague usually.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there has been recent interest in studying how blacks have appeared in European art throughout the ages because it gives a novel spin on art history. People like the OP trying to make this into some anti-white conspiracy are paranoid and foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar situation with "American inventors".  Few people are going to google or create a website dedicated to highlighting American inventors.  More people are interested in highlighting African-American Inventors, so that's what comes up.

       You aren't answering my question:  What does Google make out of this?  How would they profit?  How would they make money doing this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked there for years, as I said.  They're pretty liberal - but even more than that, they are very focused on making money - the proof being that they do, in fact, make a shitload of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do they make money giving weird results for a lot of obscure queries?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe my claim that no one - OK, actually "very few people" - search for European Art, go take a look and see how many ads are on that query, if any!  Or, if you like, make an AdWords account and see how cheaply you can get an ad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ads are literally as cheap as Google sells - because no one ever buys them, because there is so little traffic on that query, and so few clickthroughs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       , exactly, would you search for such a thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me clue you in - in the real world, people search for celebrities.  They search for things to buy.  They search for details for their favorite games.  They search for music, movies, TV shows, investment opportunities, thousands of types of porn, recipes, solutions to computer bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they very rarely tend to search for generic short phrases or individual words.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Google has historically had trouble with short, meaningless queries.  Take "jew" for example - a query that Google has always had issues with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that almost no one ever searches for "jew" except when Google's current state has a bad result for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you? Interested in "What it means to be a jew"?  You'd search for that.  "History of Israel", "Judaica", "jewish conspiracy", "Jews in Palestine" - these are all fairly common search queries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But very few people search for "jew" and the people who do, tend not to click on any of the responses and instead make a different query afterwards.  So Google's automatic learning tools do a very bad job on that, because there's simply no clear meaning.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Oh, and let me make one other thing clear.  Do I believe that Google manipulates search results for political reasons?  When I worked there, eight years ago now, I would have said the answer is no.  Today, I'd say my answer is "maybe/not sure".  Absolutely, I can imagine the 2016 Google manipulating search results for profit or for political gain - and yes, I've seen evidence of actual manipulation - manipulation in ways that either benefits Google directly, or indirectly by pushing neocons and neolibs into office.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we're back to my original question - why would Google deliberately give bad answers to obscure queries? How does it profit them?  Does it help their political ends?  Does it make them money?

       Firstly, if they are not providing results that were queried simply because they can't make money off it; that makes them a pretty shitty search engine.

       Secondly: "white European artists" or "white couple and baby" are a lot more specific than "Jew". Especially when looking for a picture. ("I just want a picture of a gat danged hot dog!")
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly: they would be compensated in the same way that the shills that moderate /worldnews do. By promoting the "PC culture"/ SJW narrative. In the case of wNews, it's deleting threads about the behavior of the Muslim immigrants.

       So yes, they've already politicized their business.  They've probably also been favoring misspellings of 'berenstain' over 'berenstein', causing a gaslighting of the public.  If you are so smart because you worked at google, then surely you understand the idea of clusters of correlated data being statistically significant signal over random noise?  Yes?  well if you look into the mandela effect, it becomes very obvious that the culprit here is google, algorithmically gaming the search results to favor misspellings.  If that's not the case, then something really weird has in fact happened, which I do not believe as--like any other modern rationalist--I don't believe in miracles since I've been privy to so few and those I've seen were psychological, not material, in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do they have to gain?  Everything.  Public opinion is more important to the establishment than a nuclear bomb.  If you lose public trust, you're done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why talk about 'public trust' when Google is a private business?  Well?  Is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       A: No.  It isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google is CIA.  I know you worked there so surely you can validate this for yourself: googles original parent company was in-q-tel, which was founded by the CIA--we know this because cia divested its private stock in the mid 2000s.  I know you think that makes google 'an autonomous biz entity' but since "corporations are people" (they are, legally), and "no one ever really quits the CIA", then it can be said that Google never left the CIA.  And this is of course
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/48vwqf/mass_surveillance_news_collection_from_2010/">
        validated by 14 pages of mass surveillance links, here
       </a>
       , demonstrating an extreme willingness of google (and at&amp;t, apple, verizon, etc) to work with the CIA to spy on americans, abuse their data, and gaslight them with disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you worked there, so you think: oh they'd never do that. Because if you actually faced up to the truth, you'd realize you had been washing the windows on the deathstar and so you were a trooper as well.  Cognitive dissonance inhibits you from seeing clearly, but everything I've said is factual, not conjecture.  Fact check me,
       <em>
        brothaman
       </em>
       , and you'll see.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does CIA gain?  Social kontrol.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea how much money the ruling establishment elites will pay in order to control society...anything...they will pay anything...and that's what's happening now.  They are losing control and that's why they are doing this type of gaslighting.  I can show you SO many more examples of this.

       Google searches by keyword or words of context surrounding images on a page. For instance, "European art" gives you a wide result of many different styles, but "European People Art" searches and finds the only probable reason "people" would be used as a keyword with the other two words, which would be "people of color." In this instance you're seeing the results for part of "people of color" being used as metadata.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for "American Inventors." The majority of the time people are keywording imagery, they're going to ignore the "American" unless they're noting African American inventors. So, in this result you're mostly getting black inventors, with some white inventors mixed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is actually about how
       <em>
        everyone else
       </em>
       uses keywords, context, and metadata. Google isn't deliberately doing it. These are accurate results for imagery based in the keyword combinations. It's not Google "having an agenda."

       Dude... Google "white woman and white man". Literally ALL couples will be interracial. I've known about it for couple of years now.

       Now google something very specific like "red and white polka dot coffee mug". No problem for Google, every picture will be exactly that.

       No, just that the majority of keyword combinations will only bother to use "white" as a descriptor in this instance if it is in contrast to something. In this case a person of color. Why would anyone bother to notice a white spouse in context or keyword unless the other spouse wasn't white? Thus, you get a lot of results about interracial couples.

       You are misplacing your ire, Google is just collecting
       <em>

       . The results are more or less the same on Bing.

       This here. The search results could still be indicative of  demographic engineering without implicating google. We have a "chicken and egg" situation. Is google merely reflecting a social trend, or are they actually promoting the agenda?

       And if you look up images of simply "woman" or "man", what do you get?

      <p>
       If you look up "white woman and white man" Google Images is seeing the words white, woman, man. Basically, the only reason someone would bother to point out race in the context of a couple with a white person involved is to point out that the other person
       <em>
        isn't white

       You just basically repeated yourself. You say google is seeing you put white, woman and man.  That is not what I am typing in at all. I am typing white woman and WHITE man. Not white woman and BLACK man or just MAN. So basically your saying the only men are black people? Is that what you are getting at then? Just like the other user said you can look up red polka dot coffee cup and get exactly that. Why aren't there images of purple polka dots since I used the word polka dots. It is because I typed in RED.

       You're looking up the words cup, red, polka dot. So, you're going to get a lot of pictures of cups, some red with white dots. Some white with red dots, yellow with red. White and red combos are generally classically pleasing to the eye, so you get mostly that. Paper cups, coffee mugs, travel cups, etc. Are you mad that it's showing you pictures of mugs when you said cups?
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, with the "white, woman and man" search you're going to get top results where you'd bother to mention that one or both partners are white. Well, generally the only reason you'd bother to point out that one is white is that if one isn't. Sorry if I'm repeating myself, but you don't really seem to know how this works. You can look up "white couple" if you're somehow needing to fill your quota of stock photos with two white people holding hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you wonder why the results for "woman" or "man" are almost universally white? Why are the results similar for all these contentious searches on all search engines?

       Oh, I see what you're saying. You're comparing web results with image results. Search engines look for both differently, a web site literally says what it is and what it contains, in addition to having metadata. Images are harder and searches have to be based on keywords and contextual clues.

       That's probably because the term white used with the terms man and woman only happens when the couple aren't both white (as we consider that to be normal and unremarkable). Ask yourself how many pictures of a couple where both people are white are labeled white man and a white woman vs cute couple or old couple or couple from California. There's no need to label the fact that they're both white because it's not distinctive, it's considered normal.

       DDG is likely control grid.  It was bought by yahoo and then suddenly it's results were terrible.  Which says to me they either sold out to dumdums or Yahoo! had a deal with Google to buy DDG so that DDG would then be sending people back to Google.  A kind of loss leader in DDG through suckage.

       Or it's more likely that those search exact search terms get funky with google searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if you search white family, or european art, or inventors you get what you expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you throw in "people" for the art question, it tends to bring up "people of color" and putting "American" brings up African-Americans a lot. Put in "Famous American Inventors" and it's basically all Alexander Graham Bell. There's not some conspiracy to make AGB "the" American inventor. It's basically how search terms work.

       I'm an art student and artist. Here's my take:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You probably won't refer to Western Art as European art very often uness you're not familiar with art.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's not going to be common to find the terms "people" and "art" together unless we're talking about a minority group in art, because you don't write or say "white people, art" since we consider that as the sort of default setting for our culture's art. We just say "people, art" or "our art" or "the art." So there are very few pages and images labeled "xxxxx people, art" which show white people. They're probably instead labeled by the name of the work or the movement in which the art was produced. In contrast there is much much less African American and African European art (or art depicting these ethnicities), so we can learn about our culture by how these subjects are treated in art, we also have entire departments and subspecialties who study the African diaspora and their culture in the West. This academic context is actually one of the few places where you will see all of our art referred to as European art, because it's specifically looking at the West, as a whole,  and how the Western art (across many periods and art movements) interacts with this ethnic group. (You could also see "European art" in the context of a world art class or survey but those are not very popular outside of educational contexts.  Even in this context we tend to teach embassy we call "world art" with a huge focus on Western Art and not acknowledge that bias in our coverage.)

       Sigh. Don't confuse a moderate amount of education with being liberal. You'll insult a lot of people if you do.

      <p>
       "Western" is not a literal geographic descriptor in this case. It's what we call civilization and culture around the world whose roots come from a Eurasia. Western art refers to art from these cultural backgrounds.

       Are Cubans and other Latinos considered non whites? People from Argentina Cuba Puerto Rico Venezuela etc have "white features" like button noses, blonde hair, light eyes. Some Latino/white people look more white than pure white people, what's the basis of white vs not white?

       European DNA is the basis of "whiteness". You're right that many people in Latin america have majority European DNA, but they are but a small minority, and i'd venture to say they will cease to exist in some generations due to race mixing. The thing about many European genetic traits (at least the ones you can see), is that they are recessive so they can be easily bred out of existence, unlike races who have dominant traits like dark hair, dark eyes, etc.

       Ah, finally someone thinking!
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, you're absolutely right.  And here's how a typical scenario works.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see a picture of two white people with a white baby.  How do you label it?  "Couple with baby."  Race just never comes up - because white is the default.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you see a picture of two white people with a black baby.  Now you label it, "White couple with black baby."  Or you see a picture of a black couple with a white baby - you label it "Black couple with white baby".
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you search for "white couple with baby" those last two pictures come up - but the first one does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heh, I'm going to repost this explanation at the top.

       IMO, this is odd considering the image search for white couple with baby shows blacks couples with white babies. I thought that's what you were pointing out. The other options you suggested, too, showed mainly dark faces except for an occasional Hitler pic. So, I think its odd. To put it lightly.

       Years ago, after watching some clips and reading a few articles about inventions created by black men throughout history, I compared "black men inventions" vs. "White men inventions" as google searches and the BMI was positive and informative while the WMI search came up with articles about lynching, Nazi/supremacist, genocide, etc. That why I said, "not new."

       No. I knew about it at least 2 or 3 years ago, except I was googling "white man and white woman" to show my friends how they manipulate us. EVERY couple was interracial. I'm sure this is just the tip of the iceberg, the real threat are those minute suggestions that we don't really register on the conscious level.

       Now do you think they are racist? Maybe a little too much the other way, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it like this? No white person is going to call their image "white person with white baby", only cases where it is strange for the baby or parents to be white will mention the race of the baby in the title or article.

Super short and sweetly put we're over populating the earth and the gov knows about this. Thus "creating" poverty, and pushing same sex agenda. But we're left out of the loop.

       You see a picture of two white people with a white baby. How do you label it? "Couple with baby." Race just never comes up - because white is the default.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you see a picture of two white people with a black baby. Now you label it, "White couple with black baby." Or you see a picture of a black couple with a white baby - you label it "Black couple with white baby".
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you search for "white couple with baby" those last two pictures are more likely to come up with the first.

       Most search engines (including google) do not try to interpret your query from a semantic pov, your query is simply a set of unordered words. That means "white couple with baby" is equivalent to "couple baby white with", or "couple with white baby". This means that "black couple with white baby" would match your query. A photo of white parents and white baby likely would not include the word "white" so that one would match only 75% of the query.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try googling just "couple with baby". With no mention of color, the responses are predominantly same-race families.

       PS I have no explanation for "American Inventors". I mean obviously "African American Inventors" is a solid match to that but there are very few white faces on that one so i dunno.

       What's wrong with the "American inventors" one? They're all American inventors.
      </p>

       Maybe they're trying to make a point about how black peoples' contributions have been ignored in America.

      <p>
       Without looking at the "american inventors" list, can you name a black inventor other than George Washington Carver? How about the inventor of the filament lightbulb? Nope, not Edison. Guess again.

       Agreed, but when you ask people to name a black inventor they almost always say George Washington Carver.

       I feel really sorry for all the idiots that can't stomach that their wife cheated on them with a black man, and they're raising his kid, when they asked this question and received this answer. No doubt, some of the men who came up with this answer were told the same thing by their wives when they saw THEIR black baby in the delivery room. It's a "miracle baby".

       Can you have a black baby if both parents are white?
It certainly seems possible for two white people to have a black baby even if the baby's grandparents appear white as well. Even though the genetics behind all of this are really poorly understood, there are lots of stories where white parents have black babies.

       Years ago, after watching some clips and reading a few articles about inventions created by black men throughout history, I compared "black men inventions" vs. "White men inventions" as google searches and the BMI was positive and informative while the WMI search came up with articles about lynching, Nazi/supremacist, genocide, etc. That why I said, "not new."
