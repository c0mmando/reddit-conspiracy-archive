       No, this is not an infomercial.  This is the reality of how the US government contracts with defense corporations.  The "cost plus award fee" contract is just that type of "spend yourself rich" invitation for the corporate elite.  The "cost plus" portion means for every dollar a defense contractor spends developing a new weapon they get a dollar.  The "award fee" is the profit they get on top of that, typically 10% to 20%. The more they spend.  The more they make.
      </p>
      <p>
       As if that is not enough incentive to fail, then there is the whipped cream and a cherry which is the "cancellation fee."  If a defense contractor does such a bad job developing the weapon that the government decides it has to be cancelled, they typically get about 10% of the total value of the contract in this cancellation fee.  It's a huge profit windfall.  I've covered some examples of how much profit can be made this way here (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55ojx8/the_defense_money_game_big_cah_from_cancelled/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55ojx8/the_defense_money_game_big_cah_from_cancelled/

       ) though it doesn't seem to be getting much notice.

       We are spending on defense at a rate near that of the peak spending levels of the Cold War and getting far less for our money.  Under Regan we had a 600 ship navy.  Now the same money can't float 300 ships.  In those days we had a new airplane being fielded every year.  Now we can only have one airplane development program at a time and typically they last anywhere from 15 to 25 years when the same types of planes took 5 to 7 years in the 1980s.  Instead of expecting more bang for our buck we have become conditioned to expect less.

       Definitely true. I think we are poised to reemerge stronger than ever right now if we are willing to seize the opportunity. We do less with more than any American generation. If we turn that around imagine the possibilities.

       That's exactly what it is!  These corporations make money with no risk.  All of the risk is assumed by the US taxpayer.  They make nothing but profit, and if they can get the program cancelled they make nothing but profit even faster.

       The vast majority of government employees are honest just like the majority of Americans. The defense contractors buy those at the top. The person living in the White House being their best and most consistent ally. The president could fix this procurement system with the stroke of a pen if he wasn't already bought and paid for.

       America's defense system is like it's health care system; you can dump money into it until the coffers are bled dry. It doesn't mean it's going to be any better or more effective if all of that money is lost to corruption.
