       I have some Jewish friends but they don't really know the background of their worship.

       Lucifer doesn't even exist in Jewish mythology. So that's all kinds of stupid off the bat. If you're curious about the origins of Judaism and therefore Christianity, the Hebrews split from the Babylonians ~2000 bc because they believed the Babylonian God of Storms was the most powerful and were outcast because of it. Thus Yahweh was born and Judaism with it.

       No, this is false. There's really no evidence that Ashenazis are "Khazars." No, Ashkenazi Jews have no more biological connection to Palestine than you or I do - most of the are from Ukraine, Poland and Russia.

       Jews,  a race, although usually not in any way connected to the biblical people, are many different people, and many of them oppose the atrocities of Isreal and the zionism. Zionism is a very serious concern, it's a dangerous political movement that seeks to not only violently subjugate and expel Palestinians, but also undermine foreign governments to do their bidding. As we all know our politicians are paid by lobbyists for corporations to do their bidding. Likewise Israel pays our politicians to fight their wars, and lavish them with our latest military tech free of charge and billions in foreign aid. We need not focus attention on any race. It is the violent, oppressive methods that are the problem. Zionism is a political movement and always has been, the religion itself is never the problem. Can't be an idea only, you must deny certain immoral actions, and at very best not condone or contribute as our government does. Hate for a race is stupid. You know I'm white, because my parents are white and they fucked, damn that's divine I isn't it.

       How are they not a race?  There are Atheists Jews, Gnostic Jews, Orthodox jews, Christian Jews. You are jew by Wether you mother was Jewish or not. That is how your Jewish identity is gained. Not through any religion. They are people of eastern European ancestry, Israel is a racial homeland, not religious one.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are all Jews Satanists or Luciferians?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are two types of jews–Talmudic and Torahic jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem stems from the fact that the word Jew/Judaism has multiple meanings, but most people don't realize this. This confusion was brought about intentionally. The word Jew was invented a couple centuries ago in English translations of the Bible as a shortened form of the word Judean. This refers to the province of Judea, which at the time of the New Testament was a multi-racial, multicultural area, whose capital city was Jerusalem, which was controlled by the Pharisees. Jesus and most of His disciples did not come from Judea–they came from Galilee–and therefore were not Jews by the Biblical definition. Judea was originally inhabited by the Israeli tribe of Judah, but by this point was quite mixed. Whereas Galilee was inhabited only by the Israeli tribe of Benjamin. The only disciple that was a Jew was Judas, who betrayed Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pharisees were the evil Talmudists who Jesus opposed, and who ultimately got Jesus killed for daring to disagree with them. Later, Jerusalem was destroyed, and some Pharisees survived and became rootless nomads. Along the way they mixed with more people who converted to Talmudism. Then, after the invention of the English word Jew, the Talmudists started calling themselves Jews, and renamed their religion Judaism. They started claiming that they’re the people who lived in ancient Israel, and that they’re the “chosen people” spoken of in the Bible. In reality, their religion completely contradicts the Old Testament–even the Torah–and they know it, but they’ll never admit it. They brought about such a deliberate conflation and confusion of the word Jew that today people now use a definition of Jew that is expanded to include everyone in ancient Israel when that’s not at all what Jew meant originally. They also like to conflate Judaism with Hebrewism, but the religion of the Pharisees (Talmudism) only began after they returned from captivity in Babylon, and the Old Testament religion of the Hebrew people before that was quite different. Today, only a tiny minority of people who call themselves “Jews” don’t follow the Talmud.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern confusion comes from the fact that most people–even most Christians–don’t realize this linguistic and historical deception. This is especially true of the English-speaking world (Protestants, foremost), due to modern, bastardized, heretical translations of the Bible, plus a divorce from the true traditions of the original Christian church. They’ve totally forgotten how the Jews persecuted Christians endlessly before Christians eventually gained power through the Roman Empire and started dishing it right back to them. Just like a nation becomes ruined when it forgets its own history, the same is true of a religion. In fact, the same arguments used to claim that Christianity is inherently weak because it has now been subverted can be used to say that Western nations are inherently weak because they have been subverted, or that white people are inherently weak because a genocide is being committed upon them thanks to their altruism. It’s just not a good argument at all.

      <p>
       Yes. Moloch (Remphan, Satan, Ba’al, etc.) is the jewish god.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is this why the Israeli flag is a pentagram?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A pentagram has five sides (upside down regular star). The star of remphan (not David; jews themselves attest it isn’t David’s) is on their flag, absolutely. The Bible and several other contemporary works mention a six pointed star as being used for such.

       Jew = Zionist = Jew. Torah = Zionist. Talmud = Zionist. It's all part of the same ideology.

       The most famous Jewish prayer is "Next year in Jerusalem" - a Zionist prayer.

       Now hang on a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the Talmud is a commentary on the Torah which most modern Jews follow to some extent, and have for many centuries. Part of it (the Mishnah) is an oral tradition which is said to have been transmitted from Moses at the same time as the Torah and is therefore contemporaneous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the Pharisees were a sect of Judaism, but so too were the Sadducees, and the Essenes. To claim as you do that the Pharisees aren't "real" Jews is as absurd as claiming that Protestants aren't real Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish people are indeed not referred to as "Jews" in the Torah, but as Am Yisrael (Israelites), or descendants of the forefather Jacob (also called Israel). Israel split into two kingdoms in the 9th century BC, called Israel and Judah. The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians (well documented by Assyrian sources) and its people deported and dispersed. These are the so-called Ten Lost Tribes. Thus, the only remaining heirs to the Jewish religious traditions and blood line was the kingdom of Judah, (which became a vassal of the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and then Romans).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Judaeans were the only "Jews" for at least 700 years before the birth of Jesus. Your semantic game that Jesus was not "Judaean" because he was from the Galilee is therefore a rather bizarre statement, and not even within a stone's throw of being historically accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I give you points for trying, but your version of history is laughably inaccurate. Certainly, anyone who cites a Youtube video as a source ought to be laughed off the internet.

        No - Torah Jews ARE Zionist.

       So they reject zionism for what reason? Because they explicitly do.

       <p>
        Judaism is based on the Talmud - if a Jew doesn’t accept the Talmud, it's not a Jew.

       Torahic jews exist.

       I want every single last one of them dead–torah and talmud. I don’t care what they believe; they all have to fucking burn. I’m not going to sit around and let someone like you fucking lie about them, though. You’re not going to get away with hiding some of them on a “technicality”.

        You are just too cowardly to criticize the Jewish ideology.

       You’re going to want to try the fuck again.
