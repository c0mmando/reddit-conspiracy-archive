        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So after watching the VAXXED documentary that was posted here earlier, I decided to do some personal research into glyphosate. What I found revealed a DEEP rabbit hole that I have only begun to explore. Great thanks go out to <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1389">Dr. Stephanie Seneff</a> who is single-handedly leading the frontier on glyphosate research. Her background in artificial intelligence allows her to scan thousands of research articles and make connections that few others are able to make. I truly believe this is the future of scholarship as an interdisciplinary approach to knowledge is the next step for human progress. I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in neuroscience, which has helped me to understand the studies I have read, but I do not claim to be an expert. I would love to collaborate with anyone who has an interest in the issue of glyphosate.</p>

<p>TL;DR version: Glyphosate causes deficiencies of things we need and accumulation of things we don&#39;t like.</p>

<p><strong>Intro:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate">Glyphosate</a> is the active chemical used in the herbicide Roundup, created by Monsanto in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Franz">1970</a>. Glyphosate works by inhibiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikimate_pathway">shikimate pathway</a> which produces the essential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_amino_acids">aromatic amino acids</a> tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine. Without these, plants die. <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption.aspx#.U6fueajjn5I">About 90%</a> of GMO crops are modified to be resistant to glyphosate, so that the entire field can be sprayed without affecting the crops. <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/glyphosate/pages/what-is-a-surfactant.aspx">Surfactants are used</a> to increase glyphosate&#39;s ability to penetrate plant&#39;s cell wall, meaning that washing your produce will not remove glyphosate.</p>

<p><strong>How glyphosate might harm you:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inhibition of Shikimate Pathway:</strong></p>

<p>Humans also need tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine, but because we don&#39;t have the Shikimate Pathway, we must get them from our diet. Our gut microbes have the Shikimate Pathway, and are once source for these amino acids. It is unclear from my research how much of these amino acids come directly from the diet and how much comes from our gut microbes. Any help here would be great. In any case, glyphosate can inhibit the shikimate pathway in gut microbes, lowering our amount of aromatic amino acids, particularly tryptophan. Tryptophan is very important because it is the precursor to serotonin and melatonin. <a href="http://library.au.dk/fileadmin/www.bibliotek.au.dk/fagsider/jordbrug/Specialer/Master_Thesis_final.pdf">Gut microbes have been shown to be affected</a> at concentrations of .001 mg/ml while <a href="http://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/detection-of-glyphosate-residues-in-animals-and-humans-2161-0525.1000210.pdf">glyphosate has been been detected in humans</a> at levels up to .071 mg/ml. </p>

<p><strong>Inhibition of CYPs:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450#P450s_in_humans">Cytochrome P450 enzymes</a> (CYPs) are crucial for a number of reasons. They synthesize and metabolize hormones, maintaining homeostasis. They synthesize cholesterol. They metabolize vitamin D. And most importantly, they also metabolize potentially toxic compounds. <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416">Glyphosate has been shown to inhibit CYPs.</a> Without CYPs the many toxic compounds we encounter on a daily basis can not be broken down and will accumulate.</p>

<p><strong>Inhibition of serum sulfate transport:</strong></p>

<p>Sulfate is critical to the body for several reasons. Sulfate is needed for bile acid synthesis, lysosome function, and joint tissue function. Both sulfate and glyphosate are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmotropic">kosmotropes</a>, with glyphosate having stronger kosmotropic properties. Kosmotropes promote water-water interactions, making water more viscous as well as making other compounds, such as proteins, less soluble. This is called &quot;salting out&quot; and it is not something you want too much of because when compounds are insoluble in the blood, they are not available to the body.  Fortunately sulfate alone is not too bad. However, in the presence of glyphosate, a strong kosmotrope, the gut does not want to put sulfate into the blood because it will aggravate the problem that glyphosate is causing. Instead one thing it can do is to oxidize aromatic amino acids, such as tryptophan, into various phenolic compounds that can bind to sulfate and take it into the blood in a non-kosmotropic form (this is another potential cause of tryptophan depletion). Once the sulfate has been transported to its destination it detaches from the phenol. These phenols are toxic as they can breakdown phospholipid bilayers and DNA.  </p>

<p><strong>Accidental insertion into proteins in place of glycine (this one is only theoretical):</strong></p>

<p>Glyphosate is a synthetic form of glycine. Its chemical name is actually N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. The only difference is that glyphosate has a phosphonomethyl group attached to it. Because of this it is possible that during the process of protein synthesis glyphosate is mistaken for glycine and inserted into the polypeptide chain. Glycine is one of the most important amino acids. It serves roles in active sites and it also provides flexibility in proteins as occurs in ligament tissue. The phosphonomethyl group would prevent both of those activities. When faulty proteins are created, they must be broken down by the cell causing oxidative stress. In addition, glyphosate&#39;s inhibition of CYPs reduces the cells ability to break down these faulty proteins causing accumulation which can cause cell death. While this accidental insertion has not been proven, Monsanto&#39;s own long term studies showed that animals were <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/DC2016/AnthonySamsel_DC2016.pdf">exhaling the radioactive C-14</a> (pg. 9) that they put into the glyphosate that was given to animals, suggesting that it is being metabolized and utilized in vivo.</p>

<p><strong>Transport of heavy metals, such as aluminium, across the blood brain barrier (BBB):</strong></p>

<p>The structure of <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glyphosate#section=Top">glyphosate</a> and <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Aluminum_citrate#section=Top">citrate</a> are similar in that they both have 3 OH groups (citrate has 3 carbonyl groups, while glyphosate has 1 carbonyl group and 1 phosphonyl group). These OH groups allow citrate to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation">chelate</a> aluminium and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1987654">carry it across the blood brain barrier.</a> Al citrate is the most prominent form of Al in the brain. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1978.tb01162.x/abstract">Aluminium chloride has been shown to inactivate glyphosate</a>, indicating that Al is also chelated by glyphosate. Because glyphosate is so similar to glycine, it can cross the BBB carrying the aluminium with it. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678255">Glyphosate also opens up the gut barrier</a>, allowing more of the heavy metals we encounter to enter the bloodstream, along with many other toxins. Although the brain gets rid of Al citrate faster than it takes it up (I assume the same is true for Al glyphosate) a fraction of the aluminium separates from the citrate and is retained, leading to accumulation(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10612065">source1</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12426115">source2</a>). </p>

<p><a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/1707/attachments/original/1473092174/312_Honeycutt__Zen_Glyphosate_10_Samples_Version_1.2.pdf?1473092174">Glyphosate has been detected in vaccines.</a> The highest bioaccumulation of glyphosate occurs in bone and bone marrow which is the source of gelatin. Gelatin is used to create vaccines, so this is likely the way glyphosate gets into vaccines.</p>

<p><strong>Possible fraud in current and future glyphosate studies:</strong></p>

<p>Typically the government does not accept studies that use the ELISA method of detecting glyphosate, so liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) is preferred. When researching this method I came across <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4743594/">this study</a> which claims to have developed the best method for detecting glyphosate with LC-MS. Two out of four researchers are Monsanto employees. Also in the acknowledgments the authors thank Monsanto and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covance">Covance</a> for method development and validation. So Monsanto told them how to do the study AND used its own labs to determine that the results were valid. This seemed pretty fishy to me. Unsurprisingly, three months later the same scientists (plus one more Monsanto employee) did <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27030536">another study</a> using this detection method to determine that glyphosate was NOT detected in breast milk. These studies were done earlier this year and I would not be surprised if this method is used more to show that glyphosate does not get into humans.</p>

<p>With the recent acquisition of Monsanto by Bayer there is <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2016/09/bayer-buys-monsanto-merger-more-than-meets-the-eye.html">concern that glyphosate could start showing up in our drinking water</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Laboratory rat feed is tainted with Roundup even for the control group.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a problem for public health because regulators use tests on animals fed on these diets to assess the safety of any one pesticide or GMO by looking at the difference between the exposed animal and the controls. If the treatment (exposed) and control groups are both eating an uncontrolled assortment of pesticides or GMOs, any actual toxic effect arising from the pesticide or GMO under test, unless the effect is massive in size, will be lost amid the “noise” caused by the jumble of potentially and known toxic substances.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Roundup contains surfactants such as POEA which are actually more toxic than glyphosate. This is the secret that Monsanto&#39;s PR and corporate science buffoons don&#39;t want you focusing on. POEA can increase glyphosate toxicity 100-fold, yet most &quot;Roundup&quot; studies look at glyphosate toxicity by itself which is cheating. This is why IARC recently labeled Roundup a class 2A carcinogen despite mass protests by Monsanto/EFSA.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Intratracheal instillations in rats resulted in much more toxic effects at much lower dose levels. Roundup at doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/animal caused 80% mortality at the low dose and 100% mortality at the two higher doses as well as an increase in lung weights. POEA, at the same dose levels, caused 20%, 70%, and 100% mortality as well as increases in lung weights, although the increases were less than those observed with Roundup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/pesticide/pdfs/Surfactants.pdf">Link</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>EFSA and national officials, on the other hand, had a narrower mandate. They were confined to EU pesticide legislation, in which only the declared “active substance” of the pesticide is considered, whereas the assessment of the toxicity of formulations is left to Member States. So EFSA and Member States barely acknowledged IARC&#39;s real-world exposure studies as the products at stake were not pure glyphosate.</p>

<p>This separate assessment in the EU regulation of the different compounds in pesticides is reductionist, and is a fundamental problem. In fact, the final product combines these different compounds to obtain a synergistic effect (greater than the sum of its parts), and as a consequence the health impact of commercial formulations escape assessment at the EU level. For example, Germany had earlier banned a common Roundup adjuvant known as POEA.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dose does not always make the poison. A study in 2009 found that glyphosate based herbicides may cause endocrine disruption in humans.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also checked androgen to estrogen conversion by aromatase activity and mRNA. All parameters were disrupted at sub-agricultural doses with all formulations within 24h. These effects were more dependent on the formulation than on the glyphosate concentration. First, we observed a human cell endocrine disruption from 0.5 ppm on the androgen receptor in MDA-MB453-kb2 cells for the most active formulation (R400), then from 2 ppm the transcriptional activities on both estrogen receptors were also inhibited on HepG2. Aromatase transcription and activity were disrupted from 10 ppm. Cytotoxic effects started at 10 ppm with Alamar Blue assay (the most sensitive), and DNA damages at 5 ppm. A real cell impact of glyphosate-based herbicides residues in food, feed or in the environment has thus to be considered, and their classifications as carcinogens/mutagens/reprotoxics is discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glyphosate is being found EVERYWHERE. It&#39;s used as a desiccant, sprayed on malt barley just before harvest, so it ends up in beer. Glyphosate is used on GMO cotton, so it ends up in cotton products such as tampons. It has also been found in women&#39;s breast milk and 99% of German men&#39;s urine.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eighty-five percent of all samples tested positive for glyphosate and 62 percent for AMPA, which is the environmental metabolite, but in the case of cotton and sterile cotton gauze the figure was 100 percent.</p>

<p>In terms of concentrations, what we saw is that in raw cotton AMPA dominates (39 parts per billion, or PPB, and 13 PPB of glyphosate), while the gauze is absent of AMPA, but contained glyphosate at 17 PPB.</p>

<p>Most of the cotton production in the country is GM [genetically modified] cotton that is resistant to glyphosate. It is sprayed when the bud is open and the glyphosate is condensed and goes straight into the product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most malts are produced from barley, and in the U.S. the barley crop is among the most polluted crops contaminated with glyphosate. Grown in colder climates where farmers typically “desiccate” their crops of grains right before harvest, the barley crop in the U.S. has such high levels of glyphosate, that the EPA has had to continually raise their limits of allowable glyphosate residue.</p>

<p>A new study shows that 99.6% of Germans are contaminated with the herbicide glyphosate, writes Nicole Sagener. The news comes as the EU puts off a crucial decision on whether to re-authorise the chemical, described by IARC as ‘probably carcinogenic’, until 2031. All but 0.4% of the German population have been contaminated by the controversial herbicide glyphosate, according to a study carried out by the Heinrich Böll Foundation. The study analysed glyphosate residue in urine and concludes that 75% of the target group displayed levels that were five times higher than the legal limit of drinking water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the first ever testing on glyphosate herbicide in the breast milk of American women, Moms Across America and Sustainable Pulse have found ‘high’ levels in 3 out of the 10 samples tested. The shocking results point to glyphosate levels building up in women’s bodies over a period of time, which has until now been refuted by both global regulatory authorities and the biotech industry.</p>

<p>The levels found in the breast milk testing of 76 ug/l to 166 ug/l are 760 to 1600 times higher than the European Drinking Water Directive allows for individual pesticides (Glyphosate is both a pesticide and herbicide). They are however less than the 700 ug/l maximum contaminant level (MCL) for glyphosate in the U.S., which was decided upon by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on the now seemingly false premise that glyphosate was not bio-accumulative.</p>

<p>There is a political and corporate agenda, backed by massive lobbying, cooperation of member states and shady ass regulations made behind revolving doors, to keep glyphosate and other agrochem inventions on the market at all costs. You will run into their useful idiots here on Reddit too. Our entire food system has been hijacked and polluted by this cheap mass produced GMO processed junk food shit - look at ingredients in the food you buy and there is most likely GMO fillers such as canola, soybean or corn added. How about some farm raised salmon where they have added red coloring, synthesized from petrochemicals in a lab, to the fish feed so that it looks more like salmon? By the way that fish feed also contains corn gluten, soybean and GMO yeast. Or how about some cellulose in your grated Parmesan cheese? It&#39;s cheaper to produce, technically &quot;edible&quot; and &quot;you can&#39;t tell a difference anyway&quot;. <em>Feel free to eat what we feed you, sheeple.</em></p>

<p>You should know that many of these studies and facts have come under heavy fire from Monsanto and their ilk, so be prepared and remain skeptical. Especially the Seralini studies, of which one was retracted from a journal due to pressure from Monsanto. I&#39;ve debunked that retraction in full elsewhere. They also really fucking hate Seneff, Huber, Shiva, Pusztai (remember the Flavr Savr? lol), and any other scientists or activists looking for negative health effects in their products.</p>

<p>They will put a lot of science and authority behind their rebuttal, but if you keep researching, you&#39;ll find that they are just playing PR and blowing smoke up your ass. It&#39;s all sleight of hand with them. Debate one of their buffoons for a while and you&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah if you&#39;re eating &quot;grated&quot; Parmesan cheese, like in those popular green Kraft tubes you get in the pasta aisle, chances are you are eating wood. Some of those products contain no real Parmesan cheese at all. That is why I always buy the block Parmesan and grate it myself.</p>

<p>If they can make it taste like Parmesan, and it doesn&#39;t make you sick, they get to call it food and stock grocery stores with it and the consumer is none the wiser. But it&#39;s not really food, and I don&#39;t know a single person who would request wood instead of Parmesan. They constantly push the margin with this &quot;barely food&quot; shit to boost profits even higher, until someone calls them out on it. Food Babe has done a tremendous job investigating these ingredients and calling out manufacturers for using them. They hate her for it. The system shouldn&#39;t be backwards like that though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can help a little bit here with how ubiquitous glyphosate use is, what foods it may be found in, and a disease that it causes. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid. <strong>In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties.</strong> These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate&#39;s toxicity to humans. </p>

<p>The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. <strong>The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>And here is an excerpt from a German study on glyphosate desiccation: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this information. The whole desiccation thing is really important because it means even non-GMO crops are being exposed, as another commenter has mentioned. My research is now focusing on where exposure is worst (hint: wheat and soy) and how to best avoid it. Also focusing on some really important nutrients that can help to negate the effects of the glyphosate we can&#39;t avoid. Also I&#39;m just learning about the interaction of GcMAF and nagalase, which seems like another deep rabbit hole. Hopefully I will have another post soon on what I find. I&#39;m looking for someone to help me make an infographic as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried researching GcMAF and nagalase, but the topic is usually a bit over my head. Jeff Bradstreet was doing trials of GcMAF treatment, and he was found in a lake suicided by gunshot to the head. His lab was raided by the FDA a week before his death. He had a son who was autistic that he blames on a vaccination given to the boy at 15 months of age.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bradstreet#Personal_life_and_death">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bradstreet#Personal_life_and_death</a></p>

<p>12 doctors died within 90 days of each other while studying GcMAF / nagalese. There is a strange conspiracy surrounding GcMAF, nagalese, vaccines and missing doctors.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sott.net/article/312619-Dead-doctors-nagalase-and-vaccines-Whats-the-connection">https://www.sott.net/article/312619-Dead-doctors-nagalase-and-vaccines-Whats-the-connection</a></p>

<p>And there&#39;s the story of the UCLA professor William Klug who was killed by his own student/partner Mainak Sarkar (I&#39;m skeptical of this, I doubt he killed his professor). Together, the two did some profound research into bacteriophage DNA packaging, which is very similar to CRISPR, if not the same thing. There were prospects of curing cancer with this tech. But now they are both dead and CRISPR is taking the biotech industry by storm, Monsanto being first in line to use the tech. It&#39;s fucking crazy man.</p>

<p>I think the cautionary principle is extremely important today because of the situation where corporations do the research and pay off the institutions that are supposed to safeguard. Be very suspicious of food and drugs/vaccines. Don’t eat anything your grandmother would not have been able to buy. Understand that if the same people owns the food and drug companies, health damaging foods and drugs will be regarded as beneficial. Especially if those people are neocons and eugenicists</p>

<p>This is why these days you have to find out who funded the study and where the people involved work at, and if there are any Monsanto ties, you can toss the study out as biased, because these fuckers twist and manipulate everything they can so it shows them in a positive light while hiding or lying about the glyphosate connection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. Leaky gut is a co-factor with a lot of really bad diseases. I need to do more research on zonulin, which is produced by bad gut microbes and breaks down the tight junctions lining the digestive tract.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you for this, saved and I agree with RMFN: This should be stickied.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth nothing, also, that non-GMO crops like wheat and sugarcane get a heavy, heavy dose as it&#39;s sprayed on them to uniformly dry them at harvest. So anyone avoiding GMOs isn&#39;t safe from it - it&#39;s in our wheat (and worth a look for culpability re:gluten sensitivity issues) and sugar. And very much in waterways as a result (so much that a species of neurotoxic cyanobacteria found in midwestern/Canadian lakes and Florida waterways has evolved to thrive on it). </p>

<p>The EPA released a report a few months ago that actually listed how much is used for each crop in the US - and quickly removed it (although it was a positive for Moonsanto, their PR folks quickly touted it). Ecowatch or one of the other sites actually grabbed a copy before it was yanked back down - but I can&#39;t find it now (if anyone does, can you link it for us?) - it was really helpful because it did show how much was used per crop type, kind of a helpful guide on what to avoid to minimize your exposure. It sucks, because all we can do is minimize, it&#39;s impossible to restrict it completely.</p>

<p>ANH has done their own testing, though, and it&#39;s <a href="http://www.anh-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ANHUSA-glyphosate-breakfast-study-FINAL.pdf">worth checking as a guide to possible exposure(PDF)</a>.</p>

Unfortunately all the material is in French, but it seems to work, does on me anyway, if it&#39;s real, medicine, at least as far as infections are concerned, can be much much simpler, but less profitable hehe.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t steal your fire here, it&#39;s well deserved. I want to add that some comments have gone towards:</p>

<ul>
<li>reference to Seneff</li>
<li>anti vaccine</li>
<li>food based results</li>
</ul>

<p>1) Stephanie Seneff is a wonderful person who&#39;s position and passion has allowed her to continuously discover new elements relating to glyphosate. In person she&#39;s passionate and wonderful to speak with. Very genuine and caring on how glyphosate is contributing to the health epidemic in the USA and around the world follow her on FB, she&#39;s not a quack as some will label her. </p>

<p>2) it&#39;s not about to vaccinate or not but more about what&#39;s in them. Again Seneff and another VT researcher tested a number of scheduled vaccines in the spring of 2016 and confirmed that they contain glyphosate. The MMR being a three vaccine in one contained the most. </p>

<p>3) many foods and products we use and wear are plant based. They&#39;ll contain glyphosate as well. Your skin is an organ. Consuming treated food products can affect the gut, liver and brain as it can bind to and carry aluminum across the brain barrier. </p>

<p>Yes it can be chelated and in studies / tests on average glyphosate passes through the body in 9-12 hours. Charcoal and humid acid. This has been shown in cattle. The damage is in the amounts you consume and while its in your body. </p>

<p>I can attest to some of these attributes through my own travels. My son has ASD and after lots of testing we established a baseline (including glyphosate - he&#39;s at 2.7) we&#39;ve adopted a organic juice, organic chicken strict gf/cf/sf diet. With the help of supplements and retesting regularly we&#39;ve made some extreme progress in his cognition, speech, weight, and overall  where he lags behind. Our family for the most part has adopted this lifestyle too and also see the benefits across the board. </p>

<p>And yes, it&#39;s damn hard to find clean food. </p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;m sure there are other threads to beat this about but I also need to mention cannabis. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve tried oils and RSO&#39;s to some mild help. The real benefit we see is juicing the whole plant minus the flower. Cold pressed, 2oz a day (organic of course) added to juices. It&#39;s cbd target the gut and liver.  Since we&#39;ve started this we&#39;ve seen some real progress. </p>

<p>All kinda makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right to focus on glyphosate. Since 90% of all GMO crops are round-up ready crops, when people complain about GMO, they are really complaining about round-up ready. However, there are some serious flaws in your scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>First, your suggestion that glyphosate could incorporate into proteins where glycine should go seems extremely unlikely. Saying the only difference between glycine and glyphosate is the phosphonate is like saying that the only difference between glycine and alanine is the methyl group, or that the only difference between phenylalanine and tyrosine is the hydroxyl group. These amino acids are much more similar to each other than glycine and glyphosate, but do not get confused by the protein synthesis machinery. More importantly, the phosphonate group isn&#39;t even attached the correct part of the molecule to act as a good amino acid substitute. It&#39;s a bulky group, that probably becomes negatively charged at physiological pH, further decreasing its similarity to glycine and its compatibility with protein synthesis. The fact that radiolabled glyphosate can cause C-14 to be exhaled only indicates that the glyphosate is metabolized, not that it gets incorporated into proteins.</p>

<p>Second, you discuss the use of LC-MS assays to detect glyphosate. You begin that paragraph by stating that the government does not accept studies that use ELISA to detect glyphosate. The government does not decide what papers get published, that&#39;s up to publishers. I have seen papers that use ELISA to detect glyphosate, so someone is accepting them. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540105.2011.553799?scroll=top&amp;amp;needAccess=true">This paper claims a 2ppb limit of detection</a>. Anyway, LC-MS is generally regarded as an excellent analytical method, and if done correctly should be much more quantitative than ELISA, which relies on enzymatic amplification to detect small amounts of analyte. But this same amplification can lead to quantitation issues. It shouldn&#39;t surprise us to see that Monsanto publishes their own LC-MS method to detect glyphosate, they make glyphosate, they need a method to assay the product and do quality control. It&#39;s also normal to follow up a method publication with other papers that use the method. This is how labs increase their publication rate. </p>

<p>There is a lot of bad &quot;science&quot; floating around the internet. It dilutes real science about radiation safety, pesticide safety, climate change, etc. It is our responsibility as scientists to promote good science and give accurate information to the public. I encourage you keep studying glyphosate, but please don&#39;t forget your scientific training. If you have access to a lab, feel free to test some of these hypotheses yourself, after all, glyphosate is cheap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. This is the kind of response I was hoping for. Like I said, I don&#39;t claim to be an expert, and I&#39;m sure there is a lot that I am missing. I would rather be proven wrong and get closer to the truth, than get no response at all.</p>

<p>On your first point, you&#39;re right that the incorporation of glyphosate into proteins is the most speculative mechanism of action I described. You&#39;re right that the phosphonate group is much more bulky than the hydroxyl group that separates phenylalanine from tyrosine making it seem far less likely that it would be misincorporated. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272508000162">This study</a> contains the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of studies have systematically compared the specificity of a series of amino acid analogues for purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and have demonstrated a remarkable lack of specificity in the binding of amino acid analogues to purified tRNA synthetases (reviewed in Igloi et al., 1978) Many of the aminoacyl-tRNA sythetases examined could be activated by a range of analogues (Richmond, 1962).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t talk about glyphosate at all, and the analogues they do talk about don&#39;t have side chains as bulky as phosphonate, but it does show that misincorporation can and does occur frequently.</p>

<p>The other evidence for glyphosate misincorporation, outside of the C-14, is that the long term Monsanto study on rats found interstitial disease in organs, such as COPD and basement membrane destruction, glycine being the key amino acid to these connective tissues. This is of course totally indirect and in no way proves anything, but there is at least some rationale here.</p>

<p>On your second point, I know that the government can not decide what gets published, only what it will accept when it makes policy decisions. It would seem odd to me that Monsanto is only just now publishing their own method of detection for quality control, considering it was invented 46 years ago. Maybe it&#39;s just me and that makes perfect sense, idk.</p>

<p>I really wish I had access to a lab with LC-MS capabilities. I would love to test the theory of glyphosate misincorporation as well, but I don&#39;t have the means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow really cool study! How annoying that they use UAA to mean unnatural amino acids when UAA is also one of the stop codons they discuss. The thought of creating aaR synthetases that recognize codon quadruplets is mind blowing, and the implications for protein therapy is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>And yes it does seem very difficult to get fake amino acids into proteins, although it&#39;s not <em>exactly</em> the same as accidental incorporation. Also this is for prokaryotes, not eukaryotes. The study I linked earlier had this to say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To date, there is no evidence for the existence of equivalent proof-reading mechanisms for the ribosomal system. In other words, an amino acid analogue that can bypass the initial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase proof-reading step could potentially be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain without inducing termination of the translation process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phosphonate chain pokes out to the side, so I don&#39;t see why it would have a problem inserting into the peptide chain, assuming it got past the synthetase.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah, I just connected some dots.</p>

<p>Monsanto makes Roundup Ready corn. I&#39;m sure plenty of this corn is used to make the high-fructose corn syrup that we see in everything from soft drinks to ketchup.</p>

<p>Roundup Cola, anyone? Roundup <em>everything</em> made with HFCS?</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d like to relate a shilling experience I had last month in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/50eh5h/feds_declare_war_on_herb_touted_as_a_solution_to/d74k1rr">this thread</a>. I held my own pretty well against him just explaining things in detail and using common sense, but he got the lion&#39;s share of the scientific ethos with his relating of studies, and also leveraged some common sense with the argument that the Celiac&#39;s is just due to kids being fed a diet of processed grains.</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange, because I recalled him citing studies defending himself, but instead he just cites a study connecting glyphosate to Celiac&#39;s and claims that it&#39;s been &quot;debunked many times&quot;. I guess I was just busy or off kilter because  normally I would have caught that and called him out. He does exactly what shills are trained to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Splitting up the argument into multiple branches so that it&#39;s more difficult to make a specific point in arguing against it, and making the concept too complicated for normal people to follow and/or care about</li>
<li>Making appeals to authority that portray the poster as highly informed and  knowledgeable of what they&#39;re talking about, along with a summary history of  the topic they&#39;ve been paid to defend to give them some credit.</li>
<li>Underplaying data that are difficult to quantize as in his favor, such as human negligance and error (citing regulations and saying that everyone follows them: &quot;RoundUp and other formulations of Glyphosate are only labeled to be sprayed at least 14 days before harvest, this is rarely done regardless.&quot; This makes the difficult-to-disprove assumption that most farmers are competent in following these guidelines and that this is happening. You can&#39;t just find a study showing such a statistic (I don&#39;t think?)</li>
<li>Using the anti-science trope to make their opponent look foolish.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m kind of embarrassed that I didn&#39;t dissect him. Honestly, I think my situation was what he hoped: that I didn&#39;t have the time to delve deeply into the argument he made to point out its flaws.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people less clever and with less time than I that get confronted with people like this, and anyone who is trying to make up their minds will immediately dismiss the dissenter when such a confrontation plays out.</p>

<p>Dopamine, Serotonin can&#39;t cross the blood brain barrier, and can only be created in the brain (pineal gland). Do some research on the pineal gland and you&#39;ll find out why the govt. wants to badly to suppress it&#39;s powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, deficiency of neurotransmitters due to amino acid deficiencies is a really important aspect at play here. The pineal gland is super important and I love it, but you&#39;re slightly off. Serotonin is produced in the Raphei Nuclei with tryptophan as a precursor. Later, serotonin can be turned into melatonin in the pineal gland.</p>

<p>I think this is the reason so many people seem to suddenly have difficulty digesting wheat, compared to human history. The practice of post-harvest desiccation, which kills the chaff and makes it easier to remove from the wheat but likely leaves residue on the wheat that is then digested. The practice of desiccation has exploded in the last 15 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family used to have major health issues. My mom got diagnosed with Celiac disease and my dad with Chron&#39;s disease, and my mom was straight up on the verge of dying about 4-5 years ago. We cut out gluten because of my mom&#39;s diagnosis and for awhile that helped us (presumably because of the way conventional wheat is harvested, being doused in pesticides), but eventually we relapsed back into problems. We kept cutting things out and would get better then worse again. Our diets became so restrictive that we had to find the root of the problem, and we tried doing organic. After a few months we slowly got better (conversely, when we&#39;d accidentally eat something conventional we would get extremely sick). We recently (within the past year or so) decided to finally reintroduce wheat (as my mom was diagnosed with Celiac disease she was scared to try gluten because of how sick she used to be) into our organic diet and had no problems at all. I don&#39;t give a shit what anyone says against organic diets, I know for a fact that they saved my mom&#39;s life and gave us all much better health.</p>

I think the central question here is whether or not POEA can cross the gut barrier and get into the blood. I can&#39;t find anything directly saying that it can or can&#39;t. There are 2 things that make me think it could be possible, but they could both be wrong. Since POEA destroys the plasma membrane, I could see it destroying the cells that make up the tight junctions of the gut barrier. Also since glyphosate opens the gut barrier, it could allow POEA in. I need to do more research on zonulin to have more understanding when I say glyphosate opens the gut barrier.</p>

<p>why do they need a surfactant?  2 reasons - #1, to reduce the contact angle of the water mist they are spraying it with on the plant (look up contact angle), and #2 to increase the solubility of glyophosate.  </p>

<p>Citrate is highly soluble in water because it carries 3 negative charges.  Glyphosate will only have one partial negative charge.  The best chelators are things like EDTA (4 oxygens with available electrons), or citrate (3 oxygens with available electrons).  </p>

<p>Aluminum carries a 3+ charge.  citrate = -3.  They go together like big magnets.  Glyphosate does not have it.  </p>

<p>I believe glyphosate is bad for a whole host of reasons, but certainly not those two.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the evidence for glyphosate chelation of Al is not for sure, and I think I focused on the wrong thing in that section. I think what is more important is that glyphosate opens up the gut barrier causing more Al to get into the blood stream. Citrate does a perfectly fine job on its own bringing Al into the brain.</p>

<p>BTW, as a chemist/biologist what do you think of the part about aluminium chloride inactivating glyphosate in that study? Does that indicate that Al binds to or is chelated by glyphosate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a nice article, thank you. I&#39;ve actually been looking into chlorella and burdock root on my own recently. The realm of nutrition is so much more complex than understanding the mechanisms of one single chemical, that I can&#39;t pretend to give you advice. I will only tell you about the things I am looking into and am considering using myself.</p>

<p>Alkalinity seems to be important, both for foods and water. Water with a negative ORP seems good. Probiotics and synbiotics seem important for a healthy gut biome. Trace minerals like manganese, sulfur, molybdenum, and silver seem important to get. Regular sunlight for vitamin D and just an overall happy outlook on life can do wonders for your well-being. Even some of the &quot;out there&quot; methods I&#39;ve looked into like colloidal silver and GcMAF are at least interesting in their own right. Chelation therapy is another thing I&#39;ve ready about recently. </p>

<p>Inhibition strength and what range of enzymes(CYP is a large family of several enzymes) that are inhibited is important to make any sense of this. If you actually want to produce actually useful data you have to consider this. If you just want to be alarmist then you can also write articles about the horrible CYP inhibiting effects of grapefruit juice, Licorice and chamomille tea and half of all the drugs on the market. And then you can do the same for CYP inducers as the CYP enzyme system doesn&#39;t just break down harmful compounds, it also creates some harmful secondary metabolites.</p>
