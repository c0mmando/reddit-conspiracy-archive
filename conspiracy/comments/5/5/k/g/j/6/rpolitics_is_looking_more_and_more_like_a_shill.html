       Every top post in the past few months have been bashing Trump. I get it and I agree with it, but to make every single post like that would just make you wonder what motivations do the mods have. Am I wrong to assume that the mods are in on something with Clinton? I was even banned from r/politics and I don't even know why. Am I wrong to be assuming these things and does it frustrate anyone els?

       There are a few myths you have to get past before the realization that Reddit is full of shills hits you.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Read through the information at the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=itt9mw1q&amp;amp;sh=b8c9eeea">
        Astroturfing Information megathread
       </a>
       , which is a catalogue of all kinds of information, including links specific to Reddit. Shills exist and it is a fact that they are interested in Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Motivation. Why would shills be interested in Reddit? They are interested because the top Reddit posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       can reach a million people
       <strong>
        per post
       </strong>
       . That is the same size audience as television news. If you accept that television news contains propaganda and advertisements, it becomes obvious that Reddit is also compromised. Check the view count on imgur if you see a top post on
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       or something. A post uploaded and posted to Reddit can hit a million views within 4-6 hours. A youtube video or article may reach a slightly smaller amount of people because of the time investment, but it's still a lot of people. You can also check the traffic stats on subreddits, like worldnews, which receives
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/about/traffic/">
        400,000 unique IP addresses per day.
       </a>
       Also, I believe Reddit has something like 250 million unique users.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) What parts of Reddit will they normally congregate? As I said, the top posts can get a million hits. Besides submitting content, they also post comments. They will hang out around the top section of the comments because most people don't read much past the first few conversations. The same thing happens with google. Most people don't read past the first page of a search and there are actually
       <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-04-30/do-reputation-management-services-work-businessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">
        companies you can hire to slide negative results off the first page of a search.
       </a>
       Medium sized subs can also reach 10 thousand or more people on the top post.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.5) Be aware of keyword alert services. There are many of them out there. A PR firm can get a notification that their company or some phrase has been mentioned on reddit and they can be in the comments responding within minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) How many shills are there? There must be quite a lot of them because Reddit's audience is huge. The only thing I want to mention is that a single thread can be made to appear to have 10 or 50 shills, but all of those accounts may be controlled by one person. A single person can do a lot of damage on this site. If they are paid for an 8 or 10 hour day, that is a lot of propaganda or advertising. I think this would actually be cheaper than buying a billboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have any time, please spread the link I gave you to the megathread. Not enough people are aware of this information and shilling is actually becoming automated. If you think the problem is bad now, wait 1 or 2 years.

       I year or so, maybe two, there was a post here in which someone was caught posting and responding as the same person with different accounts.  They had maybe four accounts and they would post as different accounts with the exact same responses in different subs.  Like copy and paste responses to common arguments.  I wish I'd have saved that post.

       Don't remember honestly, its been a while.  I'm 75% it was a self post with the word shill in the title.  Which might make it easier.  No sooner than maybe 9 months ago.  No later than maybe 2 or so years ago.

       Have you ever seen the advertisements in the comment threads of politico and mediate and salon? They say something like "Get paid $3000 a week to work from home!" Try clicking on one and following it down the rabbit hole. Those are ads for 10 cents a post shill jobs.

       Maybe the CTR people are so stupid that all the attention they're focusing on trump is bolstering his image. Probably why clone murder bitch ain't ahead. You know what they say, no publicity is bad publicity, in a way it's like a reverse psychology endorsement.
