They switched the flavor up, which everyone hated. By the time it switched back (same year 1985) Coca Cola switched from actual cane sugar to corn syrup and no one noticed. Interesting theory I thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve suspected that New Coke was a planned failure for a long time.  It was popular at the time and there was no reason to screw with it other than changing the original formula without people knowing it.  If you instantly did it, people would taste the difference.  But take it away for a while, and their taste buds forget specifics about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation is in the book - blink by Malcolm Gladwell. He explains that coke felt pressure from blind taste test Pepsi challenge, in that 2 out of 3 people preferred Pepsi to coke. So new coke beat Pepsi in the blind taste test 2 out of 3 times. What they failed to realize is that one preferred sip of soda does not make a good soda. Nor does changing something people have already linked memories to. New coke was actually just an exercise in the blind leading the blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a good deal more to the story.  Ironically, New Coke was actually performing quite well in markets.  However that was only as long as &#39;old coke&#39; or &#39;classic&#39; was being sold side by side with it.  As the stock of &#39;classic&#39; started to run out, people were being pressured to buy &#39;new coke&#39; and...well while the sales still stayed above the expected profit margins, there was a massive publicity backlash.  Long story short, that publicity backlash prompted Coca-Cola to have to retool things and start pushing &#39;classic&#39; back out onto shelves, before things could get any worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a strict replacement for naural cane sugar, you are absolutely incorrectly. </p>

<p>Almost everyone I know only drinks soda in strict moderation, and ONLY if it&#39;s got cane sugar as it&#39;s primary sweetener.  HFCS or &quot;corn sugar&quot; as those stupid fucks tried is pure garbage.  It was rolled out to make Americans fat, dumb, and docile.  Just like the fluoridation of their water.   Remember, fluoride has ONLY been shown to be slightly effective when TOPICALLY APPLIED.  When consumed, it&#39;s a known neurotoxin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not quite sold on this as I remember when this happened and people were switching to Pepsi, even die hard fans.<br/>
My best friend at the time had many 2-liter bottles in his house at any given time, I have never seen someone so obsessed with food like that.<br/>
Anyway, I recall so many people at school stating how the new coke sucks and that Pepsi was &#39;radical&#39; and they will be a Pepsi drinker from then on.  I don&#39;t know how many went back when Coke went back but I know my buddy stuck with Pepsi, he may have been a tad more emotional about this than others.<br/>
EDIT: Forgot to add, If this was planned by Coke then it was a good, not great, plan by them.  Think about it, they basically &quot;bought time&quot; from people comparing the taste from the original sugar coke to the new cheaper shitty corn syrup.<br/>
If they switched overnight then people would notice a change in taste.<br/>
If they were able to wait a while between the switch then the taste difference is nearly absent.<br/>
They bought time my introducing shitty new coke and also they saw how many people were upset over this and I lived it, all over sugar water, or, corn syrup water</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t really unknown anymore...it happened.  It didn&#39;t work out as well as Coca-Cola hoped, but yes...the New Coke was introduced to buy time to get the sugar-based Coke cleared out of shelves (&amp; palates) so no one would taste the two side-by-side and cause a scandal in beverages returned for tasting &quot;off&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or worse.  Then &quot;Classic Coke&quot; was reintroduce under the new name (denoting a substantial change in the formula).</p>

<p>Personally, I stopped drinking Coke not long after this, for other reasons probably...but I remember traveling in Mexico and having a Coke and instantly saying to my buddy &quot;this tastes like what I remember Coke tasting like as a kid.&quot;  A few months later he found an article saying that Coca Cola was looking to switch to HFCS in Mexico like they had done in the US.  I don&#39;t know if this actually happened, but evidently the company gave up trying to bait &amp; switch their consumers after the US debacle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cialdini talks about this in his book Influence. Not sure how much he&#39;s trustable, but he says Coke was afraid of Pepsi cause they were rising in popularity and the blind taste test was favorable to Pepsi. So the New Coke was made specifically to win the blind taste tests.</p>

<p>Thing is, you only take a sip in the blind taste tests. When you take a whole can, you prefer the classic coke than Pepsi or the &quot;new coke&quot;. Pepsi was actually getting kinda popular due to their propaganda and Michael Jackson. Coke lost too much money on this new coke shenanigan for it to be a conspiracy, IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mexico and the United States have long been engaged in a trade war over sugar. Sugar is big business in Mexico, as it is in many parts of the world. In an effort to protect its sugar industry, Mexico has repeatedly tried to inhibit imports of high-fructose corn syrup, which the U.S. had been exporting to Mexico and was being used in place of Mexican sugar to make Coke as well as other products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did New Coke use HFCS too? Maybe the idea was to switch to HFCS, call it New Coke, and just go with that. I&#39;d say it&#39;s possible that they didn&#39;t plan on it being hated, but when it failed, they reworked the HFCS formula to be closer to the original. It&#39;s still deceptive, but they didn&#39;t necessarily need to PLAN for New Coke to fail. </p>
