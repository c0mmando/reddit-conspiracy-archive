<p>Frankly I couldn&#39;t give a hoot if they ever legalize pot. Quite personally I&#39;d rather not see them start selling &quot;pot cigarettes&quot; in corner stores because that&#39;s the real problem: the commodification of the sacred (not that pot is sacred, but in the sense of a tremendum)</p>

<p>I just think it&#39;s crazy they&#39;re still arresting people for pot and promoting the drug war mentality. Like how is this really happening, and when I die will I finally be free of it , or will I just be born into the same situation again , just a different time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pot isn&#39;t sacred if you&#39;re a 16 yr old playing video games on it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really just a tool.  You still have to do all the work by getting in the right frame of mind. I&#39;m ok with them commodifying it.  I mean commodification is good if the commodification makes people, culture, thought, spirituality, heath, rights, freedoms improved or better in some way.  Problem is, it typicaly does the opposite of that, because one group gets too much power and wants to maintain (philip morris)</p>

<p>The worst thing about the drug war thing you&#39;re talking about is the hypocrisy.  People on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> know that the CIA,  EIIR, Pope are the biggest drug dealers on the planet, that they are basically managing the whole biz.  Remember fast and furious with &#39;gunwalking&#39;?  They are &#39;drugwalking&#39; in order to catch blacks and commodify them as slaves in jail.  The drug war is basically a big psyop dragnet to catch mostly blacks and poor people and enslave them in private prisons to make various discounted products for the public sector like license plates.</p>
