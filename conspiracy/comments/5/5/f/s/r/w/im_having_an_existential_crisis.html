       When I first heard about the Simulation Theory, I was very intrigued.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the more I think about it the more it seems to be the likely answer to our existence. It's far more plausible than any other explanation that I've heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how far video games have come when you compare the first Mario to some of the recent open world games. Such a drastic difference in &lt;50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest hurdle to realism at the moment is AI. With 4k slowly becoming the norm and eventually 8k, I can imagine extremely convincing lifelike visuals within 50 years(but probably much sooner). AI tech will probably take longer to master than the visual aspect but granted humanity survives another 1000 years, I'm confident we will have exponentially more advanced tech by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspend your disbelief for a bit and imagine you are someone living in the year 1000 AD. If someone from that time period started talking about flying machines, smart phones, and various other tech we have nowadays, people would have thought they were insane. You know this is true but look at us now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that some of the tech in the year 3000 AD will be concepts that we can't even imagine nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a stripped down version of some of the requirements for a believable universe simulation:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        believable visuals
       </li>
       <li>
        extremely advanced adaptable AI
       </li>
       <li>
        advanced procedural generation
       </li>
       <li>
        functions &amp; variables (time, emotions, any bodily function, DNA etc. The list would be massive)
       </li>
       <li>
        extremely advanced and reliable hardware
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Nowadays, we understand computers as a mechanical device that process 1's and 0's to perform useful functions. Computers can also create simulated worlds in the form of video games.
      </p>
      <p>
       So imagine that in the year 3000 AD, computers are no longer mechanical and we've moved onto unlimited energy sources. This may seen like crazy talk right now but so would the idea of planes in the year 1000. We also need to understand that humanity will advance at a much more rapid pace from 2000 - 3000 than it did from 1000 - 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if the simulation theory is correct, there is a chance that the creators of the simulation do intend to reveal that our existence is a simulation someday. This would be difficult for us to grasp without understanding the concepts of computers and programming. Therefore, it is possible that it was revealed in the past but we didn't have the ability to understand it. We can use the 1000 AD example here again because such an explanation would have flew over someone's head back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the simulation theory is correct, computers and video games are more than what they seem as they are helping us understand how we were created.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to stop here for now because I could go on for hours but I'm interested to hear other people's perspectives on the simulation theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; Universe = Simulation, Consciousness = AI, God(s) = beings that exist outside the simulation/created the simulation.

       The crisis part is that if this is correct then there truly is no point to our existence. I already thought that there doesn't seem to be a point to our existence because even when I was Catholic I didn't ACTUALLY believe there was existence after death.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain why the PTB are so "evil" and have no regard for any human life. You can't possibly believe that the highest ranks of the PTB believe ANY of the religions sold to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very possible that the PTB already know the truth about our existence and if that truth is a simulation then every evil thing that they are doing would be justified. Especially if you definitively know that there is no possibility of existence post-death as you have nothing to worry about repercussion-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the known NWO conspirators are living into their 90's and so on and do seem to be concerned with figuring out how to extend their human lives. If you knew and believed that paradise(heaven) awaits then why try to extend your human life?
      </p>

       Further to this, the global control structure would collapse in 24 hours if Islam and Christianity were proven to be the farces that they are.

       How does simulation theory show there is no existence after death?  Maybe we just go from one simulation to another.  One dimension to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't understand why you think that simulation theory means none of this would be possible, or that religion is not true.  In my opinion it strengthens the argument for those kinds of things.  And besides, in the practical sense, whether or not this is all a simulation is irrelevant.  It doesn't make anything any less real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but I guess I just don't understand the conclusions that you've jumped to.

       One doesn’t lead from the other necessarily.  That’s like Homer Simpson finding out he’s a cartoon and saying that there’s, therefore, no point to his existence - completely ignoring the fact that there is a SERIOUS point to his existence that has benefited a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of people and that Homer Simpson himself is nothing but Matt Groening by virtue of the fact that Homer’s a
       <em>
        creation
       </em>
       of Matt Groening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       just simulations created by other more advanced intelligences, that doesn’t mean that our creation is a pointless exercise in nothingness.  There’s nothing saying that our existence doesn’t serve a higher purpose - if even it’s just the temporary alleviation of a state of boredom that the Creator(s) are currently experiencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we’re nothing but a figment in the imagination of The Creator…then you have to realize…that makes you (us/everyone)
       <em>
        The Creator Itself.
       </em>
       It’s the same as any character you make up in your imagination or that you create in a script or a play or a movie or whatever.  You
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       that character, so that character is YOU, and once that character “dies” or you “delete” it or wake up or whatever, it doesn’t matter because it’s not like YOU die after the character is no more.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as you were created by something, you ARE that something, and no sooner do you perish than you go back
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       that Greater Something from which you came in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will “die” and then wake up to realize that you had a dream where you were a little creation (i.e. the you
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       ), but, after discarding the physical you now, you’ll realize you’re something/someone else altogether.

      <p>
       There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an existence after death because there actually isn’t any death in the first place.  There is no death.  There is only the continuation of energy similar to what happens when you, again, wake up from sleeping in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       You go to sleep at night and you dream, and while you dream, you usually don’t realize you’re dreaming.  Sometimes you’re even a completely different identity in the dream than what you are in waking consciousness.  You just assume what’s happening in the dream is
       <em>
        real life
       </em>
       , however and take it for granted.  Then you wake up, however, and realize that you’re in a different place again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happens in what we call “death”.  You just wake up and realize you’re somewhere else - and possibly
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       else.

       Listen, bro.  Just because “paradise/heaven” might not/doesn’t exist after death, it doesn’t mean that there is

       after death.  There’s a

       I'm sorry if my rant came off as anything more than theoretical speculation. I'm just trying to say we currently have a decent understanding of most of the concepts it would take to create a living simulation but we don't necessarily have the technology yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone believes in God, they should ask HOW the universe was created. It might use concepts or contraptions that we don't understand yet but it was programmed. Don't think of the word "programmed" too literally.

       Don’t “believe” anything.  Do research.  Investigate.  Don’t “believe”.
       <em>
        Know

       .  Have a good, valid understanding of the existence of a thing one way or the other.  Then you won’t have to rely on something as abstract as mere “belief”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent of this, many people do and
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       asked how the universe was created, so I agree that one would do well to ask those kinds of questions and investigate the possible answers.

      <p>
       It doesn’t matter if existence was “programmed” or not actually.  Again, you have to realize that a program itself is still a
       <em>
        creation
       </em>
       .  Therefore, regardless of whether things were “programmed” one way or the other or not, it was still
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       by something - whether it was a creation by intelligent design or random chance or whatever…it was still
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       .

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Don't think of the word "programmed" too literally.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well how is it that you mean the word “programmed”?  I’m not really taking it too literally at all actually.  I’m just assessing it on the basis of what the word means - both literally and metaphorically.

       The game hasn't changed - you have a choice of living your life as though it matters, or checking out. You can bet the elite sociopaths are playing to win for winnings sake, and aren't suffering an existential crisis, so bear that in mind. You can also live your life as though

       The Matrix is a metafor for the lies and the psyops that tptb peddles like 9/11, the lunar landings or that we have a fair monetary system. The simulation theory is a part of the Matrix. It's a psyop deigned to make us doubt this reality, our own senses and sound reasoning.

       Then you should agree that the sun very well could be conscious right? The sun is made up of billions of chaotic electromagnetic feedback loops. I personally think that if consciousness really is this emergent phenomenon you get when you have an organised system then there are arguments that pretty much anything has a kernel of conciousness within it. Although it's important to remember that it's definitely not cut and dry that brain activity = conciousness.

       What created the simulation is existing as us at this moment.  It's existing as everything.
      </p>

       The creator of the simulation is currently existing through and

       the creation It created.

      </p>

       Similarly, we are a figment in the imagination of whoever/whatever created us.  After we "die", what created us will still continue existing.

       This is a question for religious people.

       How do you think your "God" created this universe? Did he wave his magic wand or use his imagination?

       Even for creationists, the simulation theory is the most plausible answer.

       Everything has a scientific answer even if we haven't figured it out yet. Physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, math and so much more are all evidence that our universe was programmed rather than imagined.

       Magic wand?  Is that what you think?  Such an arrogant fool...
      </p>
      <p>
       Simulation theory does not disprove God in any way...  God is the creator, remember???  If something programmed this universe (and I'm not talking about some fat guy sitting on a computer as we know them) as a simulation, then that's God, obviously.  And it's entirely possible that he did it in 7 days!  And it's entirely possible that he "programmed" an afterlife for the beings he created.  So pat yourself on the back some more for your science, that came round-about to the same conclusion that people did thousands of years ago!  You sure showed them!

       Regardless, even if that
       <em>

       the case (which it isn’t, by the way), then the point is still that the universe is absolutely intelligent since it contains at the very least PORTIONS OF ITSELF that are intelligent.

       That’s a good question.  I don’t know the answer to it.  I don’t know who if anyone on this planet does.  However, the fact of the matter is that since we can definitely prove that there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in fact intelligent design existing in at least a PORTION of the universe, and since we can also prove that
       <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=the%20universe%20is%20holographic">
        the universe itself is holographic
       </a>
       , then this strongly indicates that our own intelligence proves that the universe (or the “simulation” or whatever one wants to call it) is itself intelligent also.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, since the universe is holographic, then that means that we are a character in the simulation being dreamt by The Greater Self.

      <p>
       And
       <em>
        this

       means that once this
       <del>
        life
       </del>
       “dream” is over, the energy that created this specific life in particular will continue on…to whatever/wherever else.

       These are indeed very important and powerful question.  I’m not sure we can answer them at this point.  I don’t know that we have the proper requisites

       answer those questions from this vantage as human beings at this time, honestly.

       We can definitely speculate and ask questions, but I don’t know what the specific answer is.

       My other theory is that we are to the universe what cells are to a body, therefore, we are cells of a much larger organism.

       That is how i see it, as the Omniverse ! Something like fractal theory and for me this kind of view explains a lot of things.

       What's the difference between the mind of God and a computer powerful enough to create this simulation?
