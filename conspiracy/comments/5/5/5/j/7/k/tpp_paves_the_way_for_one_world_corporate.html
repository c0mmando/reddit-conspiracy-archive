        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some people on my FB feed were arguing for the TPP because of the economic benefits of globalization etc. I left this comment on the thread, and I&#39;m wondering if yall agree or disagree, or if there&#39;s a way I could make it clearer or more accurate in the future. Comment:</p>

<p>I think you can make a strong economic case for globalization and for a lot of the policies in the TPP, as well as the similar but less-well-known TISA and TTIP agreements. Some of the provisions are a little alarming like the new IP rules and ISDS rules; but that&#39;s not what I find scary about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried that we&#39;re enabling the creation of a corporate deathstar of sorts-- a bloc of international corporations which are above the laws of any country they operate within, which through merger and acquisition are centralizing the means of production into a very small number of private hands. We&#39;re being lured with the promise of economic prosperity, but the real goal is to further consolidate power outside of any nation&#39;s ability to challenge it.</p>

<p>The TPP promises to strengthen labor protections, but will those provisions actually be enforced? I seem to recall that NAFTA passed with labor protections which went largely unenforced, because they represent a barrier to corporate profit which is the essential purpose of the trade deal. The corporate bloc will pick and choose which provisions of the TPP it cares to honor, and will pick it&#39;s own profitability over individual rights in any country.</p>

<p>Over the long term I foresee this entire corporate bloc being consolidated under singular ownership (what national government could prevent this monopoly?) and wielding immense power over all national governments which will be dependent on its services. That&#39;s what NAFTA and the TPP really pave the way for: the subjugation of all national governments to a single trans-national economic power which is not accountable to anyone. Once this power center exists, it will be nearly impossible to oppose, as countries will use their armies and police forces to do its bidding under threat of being excluded from international trade.</p>

<p>I know globalization is the future and we are destined to transcend national borders, but I think we should all strive for a much more democratic vision of future world government. The new world government is going to BE a corporation if we&#39;re not careful here, and it will set about squeezing every last drop of economic value from each of us to furnish its owners with unfathomable riches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPP is a fucking dystopian nightmare in the making. It allows corporations to literally make people their slaves, &quot;legally&quot;, as you and many millions of others have correctly intuited. Thus the mass widespread hatred of it.</p>

<p>Any &quot;labor protections&quot; might as well not exist, because other superior clauses contradict and override them. They are merely a red herring for those fooled by such.</p>

<p>Anyone who defends it is either a globalist shill or a completely brainwashed lobotomized fucktarded tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have legitimately seen users defending it on this fucking congregation of the brainless, spineless, and the amoral masses called reddit. Now, it was on a very large AMA thread about the TPP; which leads me to believe that these highly-upvoted comments were bought and paid for, but even so... how in the flying fuck can any conscious individual who calls himself a human being actually think this is a good idea? In what universe do these people come from? Have they no eyes to see? Are people really this stupid? I mean, I would fucking hope that if you asked me 2 years ago before I was an awake individual, if I thought it was a good idea to surpass governmental sovereignty to create a world-wide federation of corporations that have the power to surpass any laws, I would have told you FUCK NO. But, that&#39;s the thing, that&#39;s not how it&#39;s being sold; it&#39;s being sold as something some super helpful legislation that will lower prices or some fucking bullshit. I can&#39;t keep up with the propaganda, but I honestly want to find some miserable prick who really believes this and deck him in the jaw for being so damned naive and so damned brainwashed. Why am I surrounded by fucking zombies, lord, why? Why can&#39;t anybody see through the lies? Nobody besides the occasional fellow on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> understands what it&#39;s like to be surrounded by the fucking walking dead, siphoning up the propaganda and the media lies as they happily walk through their days, unmolested by pesky concepts like truth or objective reality. Have we really all been so lobotomized?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually how the discussion came up on my FB feed. Some liberals were arguing about Gary Johnson&#39;s platform, and a few of them started talking about why TPP is such a positive thing for the international economy and helps lift people in other countries out of poverty and blah blah. Then they started talking shit about people who oppose the TPP. so you know, this post happened.</p>
