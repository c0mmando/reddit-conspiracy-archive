    <div class="md"><p>There is no plan.  Your sites will still be up and running. Do you not understand what is happening?  The internet isn&#39;t going to end.  Instead of the US holding control over the Domain Name System. You know, the system that allows you to type <a href="http://www.reddit.com">www.reddit.com</a> instead of 151.101.57.140, the world will be able to have control. This can lead to newer protocols and technologies including the up and coming &#39;internet of things.&#39;  Your whole title explains that you don&#39;t understand technology, let alone the internet and it&#39;s inner workings.  But, you know how to type and go to a website and scare yourself because you&#39;re ignorant.</p>

<p>Wanna test this for yourself? Open up Command Prompt, type without quotes, &#39;tracert <a href="http://www.reddit.com">www.reddit.com</a>&#39;.  You&#39;ll see how your internet traffic is routed and you&#39;ll be able to enjoy the luxury of not having to type in an IP address.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The system will stay the same.  It&#39;s just handing over control of the system itself.  The UK will still have .co.uk. Poland will still have .pl, everything will still have .org, .com, .biz, etc.  The Domain Name System is literally allowing you to type in text instead of having to remember sets of numbers for websites and other network based addresses.  I understand that there could be fear of other governments doing what they want, etc.  But there are bodies of people that work with this technology to create standards.  Like the IEEE for example.  </p>

<p>Using your caller ID reference. It would be like having your caller ID service move from a local state side company like ATT or Comcast and have it go to an international body.  You still have your caller ID, you&#39;re still able to see the phone number and name of the person calling you. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be that much of a problem.  If you would only be honest, what you are really upset about, is the fact that it won&#39;t be white &#39;Murricans who are exclusively in control of the Internet any more; not because censorship will necessarily automatically occur.  If you are really worried about the health of the Internet, I would encourage you to ensure that Comcast, Verizon, Google, and Facebook receive none of your money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible that I am not as aware of white supremacy in this sub as you are, but that doesn&#39;t mean this specific post is racist. I&#39;m not trying to insult you personally.  I just know that before I educated myself on the matter, I too was concerned that the Internet could be censored or taken away entirely.  But that was the extent of my concern.  </p>

<p>For that matter, you may be right that OP is racist, but it&#39;s equally possible that he/she isn&#39;t.  I just feel that invoking -isms where there may not be one lessens legitimacy when actual -isms take place.  </p>

<p>An example of this is the new feminists who argue that something is sexist when it clearly isn&#39;t.  Accusation slinging causes others who might truly care about actual sexism to completely dismiss any real issues, because the source is seen as unreliable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ready please, Mr. Music.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQoRXhS7vlU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQoRXhS7vlU</a></p>

<p>Basically Stallman tried to claim that UNIX&#39;s history more or less in general was exclusively his autobiography.  The BSDs and various other inconvenient details got shoved aside.  He also tried to minimise the value of Linus&#39; contribution to &quot;GNU,&quot; with the &quot;Linux is just a kernel,&quot; rebuff.  You might remember that George W. Bush once downplayed the importance of the American Constitution in a similar manner, by referring to it as a &quot;God damned piece of paper.&quot;</p>

<p>If you look at the man pages for most of the GNU applications, you will also see the name of someone who you never hear about anywhere else; Roland McGrath.  Like Paul Allen in the case of Microsoft, McGrath did a lot of the programming-related heavy lifting where the GNU project was concerned, and then apparently just quietly disappeared, at least for the most part.</p>

<p>Also, we can forget about the fact that UNIX was first ported to the x86 by Lynne and William Jolitz, who I tend to view as computer science&#39;s answer to the Curies; that work was very long and hard, but it is, after all, a minor detail.  We can also forget about Keith Bostik&#39;s work on creating the Berkeley Fast Filesystem, before Linux&#39;s ext2 or 3 filesystems were a gleam in anyone&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also little gems like <a href="http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-announce/2001/msg00000.html">this</a>.  Scroll down to, &quot;and now for some not so nice things,&quot; for the relevant paragraphs.  Insider information, which lends credibility to my suspicion that McGrath probably got treated similarly, after his usefulness had come to an end.</p>

<p>Stallman is a lot like Barrack Obama, in one key respect.  On the surface, he exhibits near-Utopian charisma, and can make himself appear heroic.  Every so often, and ever so slightly, however, the mask slips; and what lies beneath is <strong><em>not</em></strong> pleasant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the fact that this sub is infested with white supremacists.  Said infestation is not quite as chronic as 4chan, perhaps; but it&#39;s there.  It also wasn&#39;t a last resort.  It was part of my initial comment.</p>

<p>As for &quot;people like me,&quot; I am not on either side of the argument.  I dislike white nationalists and the microaggressions demographic to almost the same degree; although the one saving grace that the Klansmen do have, is the fact that if I disagree with them, they will still permit me to speak.  The social justice crowd will not.  I&#39;ve also spent most of my life alone, at least partly as a consequence of feminism.  So while the Right do regularly annoy me by spouting stupid shit, they still haven&#39;t negatively impacted my existence on a practical level, to anywhere near the same degree as the Left.</p>

<p>I guess that means that I <strong><em>have</em></strong> picked a side after all.  Oh well.  #Trump2016, mothertruckers! ;)</p>

<p>In a recent book, Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. &quot;Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,&quot; argues Sunstein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I can get on board...&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled &quot;Conspiracy Theories,&quot; dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from &quot;cascades&quot; of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, &quot;The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the governmentâ€™s antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.&quot; They go on to propose that, &quot;the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups&quot;,[35] where they suggest, among other tactics, &quot;Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.&quot;[35] They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as &quot;extremist groups.&quot;</p>

<p>The authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: &quot;We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.&quot; However, the authors advocate that each &quot;instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The system will stay the same.  It&#39;s just handing over control of the system itself.  The UK will still have .co.uk. Poland will still have .pl, everything will still have .org, .com, .biz, etc.  The Domain Name System is literally allowing you to type in text instead of having to remember sets of numbers for websites and other network based addresses.  I understand that there could be fear of other governments doing what they want, etc.  But there are bodies of people that work with this technology to create standards.  Like the IEEE for example.  </p>

<p>Using your caller ID reference. It would be like having your caller ID service move from a local state side company like ATT or Comcast and have it go to an international body.  You still have your caller ID, you&#39;re still able to see the phone number and name of the person calling you. :)</p>
