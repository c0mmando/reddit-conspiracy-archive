       Look, America is fucked. No other way to say it. They founded IS and other groups of such intent. They give them weapons of mass destruction. They use false flags to scare their own people. Why fuck up your country, your people? NWO maybe I don't know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is actually helping. Yes ACTUALLY fighting such terror groups. Putin taking lead and actually tryna save the world from the stupid USA. Don't listen to mainstream media. All they do is bullshit. Putin isn't a 'bad guy'. He ain't a hero but he is definitely talking the right steps.

       I don't subscribe to the whole "Good Guy" vs "Bad Guy" dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Russians had a chance, they'd try and push things as far as they could go. Same goes for China and whoever else. It's human nature. Whenever one group of people get the upper hand, they tend to turn into assholes and lord it over everybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the US seems to have the upper hand. The Russians look like good guys because of a couple of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       One, they're pushing back against some of the more unpleasant things the US is doing right now. (e.g. Bombing the crap out of Al Nusra and ISIS and whoever else the US is supporting in Syria.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, as a geopolitical opponent, you can depend on Russian media to tell you stuff about the US and cover stories the Western media won't touch. But they aren't telling us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They're giving us certain information because it serves their own purposes to do so.

       Yeah I see a lot of stuff posted in this sub from Russian news sources which sheds light on some stuff the American MSM would never be allowed to touch, but that doesn't mean everything they spit out is true. They're still a government with their own interests in controlling the narrative.

       I agree.  It seems that too many people who are going down the rabbit hole will deny anything that goes against their current view, no matter the evidence.  I said Hillary Clinton was winning the election right now in another thread.  I got attacked and called a shill.  I even posted the real clear politics polls.  There were about 20 polls it was showing.  But still I was a pro Hillary shill.  Even when I said I hated her, I was still a shill.  They just wouldn't accept that she was ahead because they don't want her to be.  So I was an idiot and a shill.  It's very sad.

       Russia and USA are in the same scam bro, To make a shit load of money through the military industrial complex system. Fake a cold war to force Congress  to spend on miltiary Contracts. I guarantee you Russia and usa won go to war. It's more profitible to do a RED SCARE than actual war.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the cold war was a nuclear standoff?  It was another scam to  make trillions. Same with Vietnam but this time had boots on the ground inorder to overthrow rebelious leaders who were against USA currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin's knows he can't afford to arms up through nukes since that industry has flatbed hard in russia. So the next industry is the tried and true aero and ballistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all of the ammo and gun contracts.

       If Putin is a good guy, he wouldn't want war with the US. That means he wouldn't want a US president in who wants war with Russia. Clinton wants war with Russia ergo Putin doesn't want a Clinton presidency. Clinton's emails were there for all to see so Russian intelligence has them as well as many others. Putin could obliterate Clinton by releasing that and other corruption but he doesn't.... why?

       Russia is being practical and exerting self interest without justifying it by an ideology.    Their proximity to the effects of destabilization have made them weary of US interventionism.    That doesn't make them morally pious or good.    The Russians have only been in Syria for 12 months.    The death toll is yet small compared to the US,  but lets not fool ourselves that Russia has humanitarian motives here.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand,  the US is deceptive about its reasons for intervention in the Middle East,  a liar,  and a cheat.   And it does not benefit US citizens,  on the contrary,  it harms them.   It only benefits the power and money hungry elite.    So,  the US leadership is clearly depraved and psychopathic.

       Bruuh look at Russia's past few elections. It's always been Putin. Even if the theories are right and America only has a illusion of choice. Russia's system seems openely rigged.

       Tell that to Russian citizens who don't enjoy freedom one bit. Russia is being positioned as the hero. In reality you're your own hero.

       I hear from a lot of Russians through the various forums I frequent and they aren't complaining about a lack of freedom. They are complaining about U.S. arrogance and aggressive imperialism.

       I agree.  It seems that too many people who are going down the rabbit hole will deny anything that goes against their current view, no matter the evidence.  I said Hillary Clinton was winning the election right now in another thread.  I got attacked and called a shill.  I even posted the real clear politics polls.  There were about 20 polls it was showing.  But still I was a pro Hillary shill.  Even when I said I hated her, I was still a shill.  They just wouldn't accept that she was ahead because they don't want her to be.  So I was an idiot and a shill.  It's very sad.
