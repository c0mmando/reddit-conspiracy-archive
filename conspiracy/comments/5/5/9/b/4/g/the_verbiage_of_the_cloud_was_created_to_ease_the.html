       "The cloud" is just another name for an off site server. It sounds much nicer when you say "the cloud" than saying "multiple servers in an off site server farm".

       Thin client computing was tried in the 70s, and abandoned because it was rightly recognised at the time as a moronic idea.  One of society's biggest problems is that we have people who not only believe deceptive marketing jargon, but fiercely and angrily defend not only the right to use it, but to create more.  Bill Hicks was correct when he once told a marketer in his audience to commit suicide.

       The problem with Stallman is not that he is wrong.  It's that he is an ego-driven megalomaniac who insists on taking credit for things that do not belong to him.  Large parts of the entire "GNU/Linux," narrative are lies, but unless you know as much about UNIX's history as I do, you're not going to know that.  I spent years on Slashdot fighting members of Stallman's cult.  They are usually well-intentioned people, but they are also deeply deceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stallman doesn't do what he does out of altruism.  He does it because he is trying to promote another control structure, with himself at the top of it.

       Where the free and open source software scene is concerned, I used to mentally compare Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman with Charles Xavier and Magneto of the X-Men comics, respectively.  Raymond always advocated co-existence with corporations, and while he initially agreed with Stallman in many respects, he did so for mainly pragmatic reasons.  He has since largely sold out, and it is true that where he has, Stallman has not.

       Good analogy, I wonder if they'd found a middle ground and worked together Linux would have had it's 'year of the desktop' yet? Probably not as they don't have the corporate teeth and absolute lack of morality that Microsoft used so well. It's still slowly growing though and shows no sign of ever going away, I noticed the other day a Adobe Creative Suite now exists for Linux so things have certainly come a
       <em>
        long

       Systemd has killed Linux.  It will continue to grow in popularity, yes; but it no longer has the integrity of earlier UNIX, in engineering terms.  It will probably achieve mainstream success, but that is very different to Stallman's objectives, and ESR's earlier ones, too.

       I've heard the arguments against and they do make a fair point but ultimately if it works for the vast majority of end users and it's already been implemented arguing against it seems a bit pointless now. There are still a few distros not using it for the purists and dissenters.

       This is true.  It is to be understood that simplicity is a pre-requisite of freedom or self-determination, and this is because the simpler something is, the less it is likely to rely on an external third party for maintenance, operation, or existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I only use Microsoft Windows, then I am reliant on Microsoft to continue to sell it, to maintain it, and so on.  If I can use a simpler operating system however, which, though I may not have written it myself, I can still completely modify and understand, then I have no reliance on anyone who is not myself for it; I can maintain it indefinitely.  Simplicity and transparency...that leading to comprehension of the mechanism in question...are therefore the parents of freedom.

       Um, no. It wasn't. It was Marketing people using a term they thought sounded cool but didn't understand. The term has been used for decades to describe a standard feature on a network diagram. A complex network structure such as the Internet or an MPLS circuit that doesn't directly pertain to the subject of the diagram (and is often managed by someone else) is depicted as a cloud. When talking about network flows, network engineers would often say things like "don't worry about that, it happens over here in the cloud."
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of such a marketing term in making people use the system is certain. It's Marketing 101.
