       <em>
        "Drugwalking"
       </em>
       is a term I made up that is analagous to

         the ATF Gunwalking Scandal
        </a>
       </em>
       , used to describe the vertically-integrated drug activities of the Fed.  Just to remind you, the gunwalking scandal involved putting out illegal firearms and seeing where they ended up, letting the illegal arms act as a kind of radiological tracer used in medicine.  By finding these illegal arms, the feds were able to 'map out' the criminal organizations.
      </p>

       <em>
        Drugwalking
       </em>
       is similar to
       <em>
        gunwalking
       </em>
       in some ways and dissimilar in others.  It's similar to gunwalking in that it's an entrapment-like ploy to capture some people.  But it's different from gunwalking in that it does not hope to entirely eliminate drug networks, rather it aims to maintain, optimize and manage drug networks.

       We know that the CIA, Queen Elizabeth II, and the Pope are all involved in narcotrafficking.  If you don't know this, then you have tried very hard to keep yourself in a state of complete ignorance.  The history you received in public school is that England ran an Opium War against the Chinese and then that was over.

       on our own, as Britian was 2000 yrs ahead of us in drug revenue and money wins wars.  No, this was the creation of a subsidiary.  An affiliate making program.   The only reason we became 'so called sovereign' is "they" let it happen.   Just like most wars, lots of people died in order for a good show for the history books.  Apologies in advance if this opinion makes you mad at me---to propose that the US is still a subsidiary of the British Empire.  I believe it is.  But we can't have that conversation now.

       Still I can tell you why I feel this way for several reasons. Primarily, that Drug mercantilism did not die with the burning of templars.  After reading several books on the government and clergy-run narcotrafficking this much has become perfectly clear.

       If these drugs were legal, then we wouldn't have any reason to complain about the authorities simply creating a vertically-integrated network of goods and services.  But we complain because they've made these substances illegal, while also selling them.  They are illegal because of the drug schedules promoted within the

       The UN is steered mostly by the US as a faux-ideology hangout and plausible deniability engine.  In other words, they created a fake international organization to act as a scapegoat for crafting policies that would be difficult to retract, simply because they've contractually-obligated all participatory governments in adhering to those policies.  Difficultly-in-retraction simply means, you can't reneg if you yourself created the guidelines, because reneging on these agreements would make the US look indecisive, foolish, fickle, and untrustworthy ("you're going to tell me what to do but can't hold yourself to the same standards").

       This Janus-face of hypocrisy is what people find intolerable, now that we all pretty much know who is at the top of the pyramid.  They push they push psychological garbage tropes of 'drugs are bad', 'drugs are immoral', 'we are losing the drug war' as a form of social control, to create a means of distinction: the 'good people' and the 'bad people'.  To foist judgmentalism of "the drug user trope" on everyone.  By creating the drug-addled trainwreck of the Charlie Sheen trope, they necessarily and implicitly create his social opposite: the 'normal person'.  Don't be like Charlie Sheen.  Be a normal person.  Keep calm, go to work, fuck your wife 3 times a year, and above all stop asking questions--that only hurts

       Back to the UN: what have they done with their little blue hats to stop drugs?  What has INTERPOL done?  I think they set cartel boundaries to keep "normals" from getting hurt...because that gives justification for retaliation and lawsuits...I think that's all they do because they cannot 'win' the drug war when they are being run from the same parent org that is selling the drugs.    It would make as much sense to think that pro-breastfeeding groups are being run by infant formula manufacturers.

        Drugwalking
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's become very obvious that the only reason to keep drugs illegal is to extort taxes from the public in order to enhance a government run paramilitary militia of drug agents (DEA)
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4y3z2x/dea_vs_isis_oops_looks_like_i_got_them_mixed_up/">
        that look strangely like ISIS
       </a>
       .  Yet, the very same government is bringing in these illegal drugs through cartels; brainwashing the public into thinking they are fighting a war on drugs, winning/losing it, and constantly need our taxes to do it; and using the DEA to bust the occasional hippies to remind you who the "normal people" are, and all's under kontrol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless of course you're black.  Or poor.  The two employees / consumers.  These two groups end up in jail more often than others.  I guess they didn't get the memo on how to be a "normal person" and they went the Charlie Sheen route.  Of course, if meth weren't available to them, white people also woudn't end up in jail. Because meth is the new crack but for whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're a good gang member, you don't do things that undermine the money train, like yourself getting addicted.  If you do: jail.  If you steal money, then you get busted.  If you think you're going up the chain rapidly, jail.  If you think you're going to go off script and run your own thing: jail.  Like Carlin said, the Government hates competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's helpful to point out that our prison system has become privatized so now the government doesn't have to deal with pesky regulations like keeping prisoners alive or healthy or safe.  Prisoners are paid a miniscule fraction of the minimum wage for their labor in manufacturing deep-discounted public-sphere items.  This is essentially slavery.

       Basically, when a government manages the worlds illegal substances as 'regional interests'--ie: you get your cocaine from s. america, your meth from mexico, your opiates from afghanistan and s.e. asia--and then imports these substances, and then polices people regarding these substances, and then outsources the results of their policing, they are basically engaged in

       Our country loves to keep all the best drugs available at a super low rate (except maybe pot), just high enough that they persist as actually extant within culture, and can be utilized for the urban legend psycholgoical 'stayaway' of the 'LSD jumping from building person'.  The psychedelics are extremely rare.  I am by no means an expert, but in college mushrooms were the hardest to get, then acid, then everything else.  EDIT: DMT is so incredibly scarce I've never known anyone to actually get their hands on it.  It seems like a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very telling that meth, crack, heroin, painkillers and cocaine are widely available, so much so even than really good pot or hashish in states where it's not recreation-legal now.  Basically, the drugs that kill you quickly are the ones that are most widely available.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Abusable Plants that will kill you right away are also 100% legal.  For example, datura, henbane, belladonna, brugmansia, all the tropanes that hundreds of floridian kids have died from in the absence of 100% safe marijuana as alternative to their curiousity.  Note also these are plants used in witchcraft.  Sayin'.

       Isn't that interesting?  It would seem at first that those authorities making these available would want the users to be dead.  So why aren't they all dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is there will always be users, because drug using is a type of self-medication for spriritual and mental disorders--although the classic 'narcotics' only make the situation worse and that's by design.  You've heard of addictive personalities?  If drug use is a mental disorder, and not simply "angry, stigmatic judgmentalism" against people, then when we stigmatize and berate drug users, we're basically doing the same thing as harassing / bullying a schizophrenic person online, or yelling "you're stupid" at a mentally-retarded person. It's mean. It's unhelpful.  You create criminals by creating users and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're blaming the victims.  Have we ever considered asking the question: who is creating and maintaining and managing the victims?  No we don't. Why not?  Because we know the answer already, and nothing ever changes.  We don't want to ask this question because if we did, then we'd become immediately and fully aware that we have no power to stop it.  Since we don't like being tied down and raped repeatedly by our government, we choose instead to love them and align with this.  This is the essence of Cultural Stockholm Syndrome.  I recommend you stop sympathizing with your rapists.

       Thank you. And you are right: they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       understand.  They don't read these types of books.  Instead they read the same jason bourne / jack reacher plot where names and places and tropes are switched around, and this book does nothing but further reinforce them as 'the good guy'.  They believe this fiction as truth, and that's why they are all quick to defend the establishment in contradiction to the facts... and then even reject the facts.  Even reject--the people telling them the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I feel that people who do this are sinking into lower forms of consciousness and they're creating deep karmic forces for themselves later.  Because we tried to tell them these things and instead of listening, they persecute us.  After a few lifetimes of this they are going to end up at the robot basement that is hell and they'll be undifferentiated from the demons that plague us as trolls on social media.

       Now there is something stronger than fentanyl that is being mixed with heroin- carfentanil. It's a hundred times stronger than fentanyl and is killing opiate users in alarming numbers. Commercially it's used as an elephant tranquilizer.

       Yep, Coexist stickers are part of the frankfurt school --- pushing the 'moral relativism' agenda to make everything the same.  Ultimately, they'll get you to a world religion that is gnostic.  They're already prepping us with freemasonry-borne pseudognostic cult religions the mormon church (the moron-i's) and the scientologists and the bahai faiths, gaia / goddess worship and new age, to some extent neopaganism (wicca) and sufism.  New age generally isn't really a religion but it's got gnostic features  (the world is an illusion, run by a demon, spychopaths are people inhabited by demons/reptiles/djinn/faeries/mind-parasites etc).  South park basically has called these things out, years ago.  My god I love south park so much.  TP and MS are genii

       As for these strange religious creations, I agree with you completely. They're trying to dissolve all barriers between people so they can exploit them more. I'm taking a second look at your webbrain now. This Knigge character seems fascinating...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the more I read about the Moroni's the more I think the religion is based around exploitation of women and children.

       I must admit, I don't know much about the Jesuits. I'd like to learn though! Have you posted about them before? I think I know the answer to that...

       Basically the Jesuits or whoever are behind the jesuits (steering them) have a type of ideology of entitlement that make them think they can run revolutions, assassinations, wars,etc. As a way to keep people from getting too much power that they threaten the pope.  Basically, the pope created the templars to protect christian pilgrims to jerusalem, but when they got too powerful, he burned them at the stake to show the world what happens when you get cocky and start to think you have power.  Now keep in mind, the Jesuits are the group that exercise that power....
      </p>
      <p>
       Others argue with me here in this sub, a short list, that say 'no it's the jews, the jews were behind the jesuits, jews jews'  I mean yes it might have been originally a jewish thing, but fast forward, and now it's a jesuit thing.  There are jesuits that are not jews and jews that are not jesuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are  not jews like down the street from you are that have sworn an oath to divide groups, to cause neighbor to fight neigbor, to kill people with poison, rope or knife, to dash non catholic babies against the wall. This is  not to say that there aren't freemasons, mormons, scientologists, luciferians / illuminati witches (Clinton), wiccans (neopagans), quakers, jehovahs witness, russians, chinese triad, yakuza, italian mafia or other mafias that are also vying to dominate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the difference between 1920 and now, is that the mafia all seem to be coordinatng against all humans that are not affiliated with an in-network gang

       I also see this happening in Aus. A few small 'hippie' towns l used to frequent, to hang with pot smokers and drop a few shrooms, had heroin introduced, which altered that towns psyche. Smack was then taken over by the ice pilots (meth), more law enFORCEment was established/funded and today these places are avoided, like the plague.

       But what's the end goal for the system? What's the point of a mind rinsed apathetic populace? Power? Ego?

       You hit on a very big point of all this.  They want to keep us dumbed down.  So when they say they want to be the tide that raises all the ships, they are full of crap and you should point that out to them.  That the when properly dosed and used, psychedelics--highly taboo and extremely illegal--are making some people much better at their jobs, esp knowledge workers.  Did you know for example, that

       Orwellianism.  A well-oiled technocracy.  They want to have people out of the way for a hybrid of man and machine.  Here is a list of trends.  I'm not sure the ultimate end goal but you can

       The thing is, he teaches

       What's your take on the DEA's ban on kratom? The world's best kept secret for treaing opioid dependence is now undergoing emergency scheduling as they are now hilariously claiming it to be a threat to public health. Thankfully the public became so outraged by this it seems that the DEA now has their backs to the wall with this unexpected reaction while we all continue to fight it. It makes me hopeful that America is waking up and this is sending a messege to the DEA that it's time for them to cut the shit already.

       On the one hand, I think the DEA is desperate to be relevant and/or want more funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, it's something that helps people wean themselves off a terrible opium addiction.  Can't have that!  Must.remain.addicted.  I ama opium taking robot.  Robot eat opium for fuel.  Robot has 20% chance of dying every time robot eats.   Sorry to make light of the subject.  It's not actually a funny sitution.  But if I don't try to make light though, I'll get mad and depressed again.

       You are correct that the UK is still in control. The UK wants to rest in the shadows of the US so that the US has to do the dirty work now and the US gets all the blame, but the City is still where the real money is. The US is just a colony that is used by the 1% to do their bidding when they need a military attack. Don't let your children die for them.

       I was mostly with you up until psychedelics being the key to beating the system.  DMT, LSD, and psilocybin are all easy to come by in my corner of the USA.  Shit I was exposed to DMT long before coke or LSD, I can assure you it is not a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore there's no reason not to suspect that these psychedelics play just as a big of a role as cocaine/meth/heroin in any potential drug-based social control conspiracy.  In fact I've read a few compelling pieces that suggested that the psychedelic revolution was carefully tailored by CIA and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last note about psychedelics; from what I have seen and experienced use of such drugs frequently leads to the use of much "harder" stuff like heroin and ketamine, so I would argue with your assertion that they are any less inherently dangerous than your standard street drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, good post, I might pick up one or two of the books you mention.

       It absolutely was tailored by CIA, it was part of MKULTRA.  If you want to get the full story go to gnosticmedia.com or gnosticmedia on youtube and look at Jan Irvin's research.  It is very good.  He maps out all the players and makes an argument not just for the CIA but for the CIA + EIIR (England) to have coordinated to subvert any kind of antiwar counterculture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Because they wanted to keep selling their drugs, and they need to have a reason to go to where the drugs are produced to get them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be one of those people who says, "oh lsd / psychedelics must be bad because the CIA used them to start the countercultural movement".  They didn't start that movement, they appropriated it by injecting drugs into it and then caused it to fracture.  They put in provocateurs that were drug dealers and drug managers.  Timothy Leary.  Possibly (but unproven, but likely) Terence McKenna.  Their words are not all wholly invalid--there is wisdom to be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       But basically what happened was that the CIA imported some 3000 nazi scientists post WW2 into our military intelligence agencies (operation paperclip), started operation artichoke to focus on mind control, rolled that project into MKULTRA which was a massive, widescale, multiagency, illegal human experimentation project. It encompassed such projects as operation midnight climax in which cia agents raped female prostitutes they dosed with high amounts of lsd...for weeks...to see if they could abuse them to the extent they were useful as agent-consorts.  They were trying to induse dissociative identity disorder (further DID).   They also tried to bring about DID through ritual abuse, torture, various drugs, shocking, drowning, repetitive stress, the occult (yes -- mkoften), electricity, magnetics, etc, and did this on volunteer soldiers who were not given a thorough explanation of what would be involved.  They screwed those people's minds up permanently.
      </p>
      <p>
       MKULTRA was expanded to inject LSD into UC Berkeley, southern California, the bay area and the crowd that constellated a few key figures (leary and the merry prankster people...the laurel canyon crowd).   Part of it was they had basically procured a large quantity of sandoz lsd that was going to be procured by russia, believed in the then paranoid climate of the us military to be used in poisoning the water supply.  They needed then to get rid of it, like it's toxic waste--so best to make their money back selling it to the damn hippies who want us all to go away anyway (speaking from perspective of veterans).  The other purpose was to derail the anti-war movement.  You see, in the vietnam war, Nixon was actually going to drop a nuclear bomb on Vietnam.  You dont'

        Now what they didn't know was the lsd defeated mind control and created a bunch of questioners, who then started ideations of the human potential movement that lasted squarely until 1983 at which point something happened that we dont' know (I'm still investigating this now), that was essentially a reset button pressed by maybe space aliens, that literally reasserted the mind control an bodysnatched people back into the 1980s culture.  Basically turned the hips into preps at the stroke of midnight some day in 1983.  Trying to figure out what this 1977-1983 era is about is the subject of my ongoing research into alchemy and magick.

       Back to vietnam.  It's worthy to note that the areas that were sprayed with agent orange (defoliant) were also those areas in south east asia in the war zone that were producing opiates, the so called golden triangle.  I believe we were trying to stop the communist aligned vietnamese from taking over the heroin business

       (ie: russians taking over the drug trade in vietnam), so as a last ditch, we sprayed some monsanto over there, destroying their crops.  Then we moved our based of operations to the golden triangle where it could be better managed in a country that had much less technological innovation and therefore less ability to resist an outside force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's history as I see it.  Could be wrong, but once you use a 'drug dealing model of the world' instead of the garbage they give us, suddenly all your questions answer themselves and all those annoying contradictions are resolved.

       Some interesting points, but I think you may be over-prescribing the  influence of government drug-dealing.  Yes, they experimented on some fringe shit to keep pace with the Soviets and they ran a little blow to fund some shady operations, but it's hard to say how much influence drugs and drug dealing really have in international politics today.

       Also, curious as to what you mean by the "reset" in 83.  What cultural shifts are you referring to?

       about the link.  interesting stuff, but the official stories are just as believable as what the UNDOC office in Pakistan has to say.  the UN admits the numbers are based largely on assumptions and estimates, so it's hard to pin down exact trends.  reports from countries in the region will almost always skew numbers and propose motives that paint the US in a negative light, so that has to be taken into account.  the whole truth is not going to be available to globalresearch.ca (although they do interesting work, no doubt),
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, this could be strong case for "correlation not implying causation."  i just don't but the motive.  there are much cheaper and more effective ways to control the drug cultivation and processing industry of a region without invading the country, just look as S America.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't get me wrong, this is an interesting take on developments in the region that no doubt has some grain of truth to it, but to my mind it does not "explain everything."

       Very interesting.  It almost supports my 'they are trying to kill blacks and poor people' idea.  Maybe they are trying to shift the demand for heroin to a demand for pills because they are 'safer'...trying to create the 'pharma user' out of the heroin addict

       Your theory ties in very neatly with the idea that the hippie movement of the late 1960s was subverted from the SF/Berkley political/peace and love to the addiction to hard drugs advertised by the Hollywood scene.

       Then you also have the rumblings of "The Secret Meeting that Changed Rap Music and Destroyed a Generation" that may be a real whistleblower, or a psyop, or just a fake. As a long time listener to hip hop music myself, I remember the era, and in retrospect, the afrocentric artists were not given the same advertising pushes that gangsta rap was. But it may be confirmation bias on my personal part.

       You may enjoy Jan Irvin's gnosticmedia research on MKULTRA where he basically proved that fascist, monarchic ideologues / eugenicists in British, Canadian and US intelligence and particularly affiliated with Aldous Huxley, Leary and R Gordon Wasson worked with the CIA and FBI to create provocateur networks or as I call them control grid operators during the countercultural movement.  I am betting but cannot prove that hunter s thompson was probably an agent that had gone rogue and knowing what he did was why he drowned himself in drugs by the end decades of his life.  I think he felt responsible in some way for 9/11 and then called out the US gov and told the world our trajectory...basically said the fascists are going to take everything and of course he was right, a decade ahead of time.

       They are all addicts in indigenous populations according to our definitions.  The trick is though, they chew a leaf all day and live to be 90s with very good health.  So, how bad
       <em>
        are these substances really
       </em>
       ?  I mean coca leaf is probably as addictive as coffee when it's in its raw leaf form.  And of course you have Thailand, Laos, Cambodia where they chew betel nut and leaf and lime and spit red shite everywhere...it does give them cancer about as readily as chewing tobacco.  You have yanomamo blasting DMT snuff into each others faces (which is really stupid btw), you have ayahuasceros who are the most emotionally stable with the lowest rates of mental health disorders in the world--of course they go 'clinicially insane' every 2 weeks or so in ceremony.  You very likely had some version of the same in ancient hellenic egypt--a type of

       using dmt-containing acacia (not gum arabic but one that grows along the nile) and syrian rue MAOI to activate--according to my speculations on lay archeology, masonic study and esocteric symbology.  Finally, you had the pan bavarian and siberian amanita mushroom shamanism, in which nordic shamanism was the origin of modern day witchcraft.  And likely the oldest form of drug use is the psychedelic mushrooms in equatorial pastoralism, since it grows on ruminant feces.

       These things were used in tribalism for tens of thousands of years are were not dangerous. It was only when white men forcibly procured it, built plantations around it, concentrated it, forced it on populations (England aiming cannons at China forcing them to take their opium...this actually happened), that it became a problem.  They've basically ruined it for everyone.  I don't want to sound like a self hating white person but there is something seriously wrong with some white people.  I'ts possible there are psychopaths at the head of every racial outlet but damn if the white ones arent' the very worst because they're so dishonest about it, tricking you into loving what they do. What's up with that?

       Europeans pretty much only use alcohol and tobacco, which is a consciousness-limited drug that creates plebs, feudal serfs and warriors.  Then things really went crazy when they unlocked sugar, cocoa and coffee.  Oh mah god.  Intoxicated women, high on caffeinated mocha lattes started showing 2" of their legs in Vienna and then it was all over from there.

       Did they smoke a lot of cannabis in europe?  I bet they did.  I bet history books whitewash the green away.

       From what i gather cigarettes didnt really hit Eastern Europe until the first World War. Here we are 100 years later and Eastern Euros smoke like chimneys and have ridiculous rates of heart disease. They are barely now catching on to the cannabis wave, i know some countries have been cultivating cannabis for centuries, i think Estonia makes some special cannabutter that is considered a national delicacy but yeah Europe could def benefit greatly from cannabis culture.

       Some interesting points, but I think you may be over-prescribing the  influence of government drug-dealing.  Yes, they experimented on some fringe shit to keep pace with the Soviets and they ran a little blow to fund some shady operations, but it's hard to say how much influence drugs and drug dealing really have in international politics today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, curious as to what you mean by the "reset" in 83.  What cultural shifts are you referring to?

       then why post about it?  19A0s?  please enlighten me.
      </p>
      <p>
       about the link.  interesting stuff, but the official stories are just as believable as what the UNDOC office in Pakistan has to say.  the UN admits the numbers are based largely on assumptions and estimates, so it's hard to pin down exact trends.  reports from countries in the region will almost always skew numbers and propose motives that paint the US in a negative light, so that has to be taken into account.  the whole truth is not going to be available to globalresearch.ca (although they do interesting work, no doubt),
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, this could be strong case for "correlation not implying causation."  i just don't but the motive.  there are much cheaper and more effective ways to control the drug cultivation and processing industry of a region without invading the country, just look as S America.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't get me wrong, this is an interesting take on developments in the region that no doubt has some grain of truth to it, but to my mind it does not "explain everything."

       The thing is, he teaches
       <em>
        history
       </em>
       , and he seems quite well-read, so you can only conclude that he's at least
       <em>
        aware
       </em>
       of the connection.

       Perhaps he means it as a metaphor? He doesn't seem to push any pedo stuff (that I've seen)
