    <div class="md"><p>So if I can extrapolate what you are saying correctly...if the entire political world is nothing but a stage show, and ruling entities of every single country are nothing but fiction, then who would be the mysterious puppet master controlling all of it? Beyond that, what would be the point of creating such elaborate fiction? Any one person or group with that much power could get away with whatever they want. A convoluted worldwide political soap opera of fiction would seem pointless if someone possessed as much control as you seem to be suggesting. 
Don&#39;t get me wrong, politicians lie and cheat all the time...but to imagine a scenario that all politicians are lying and cheating in the same way, under various flags, and all with the same goal, seems to be a conspiracy of such epic complexity that it could never be fully controlled, let alone successfully implemented.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m cut from a different grade. Not only do I think that it&#39;s happening but, I know it&#39;s happening. I am the truth. I know the truth. You&#39;re all here for spiritual growth and this is a huge level of learning. If we are all part of Gods creation then the biggest thing you must conquer is being one with everyone else. This world is divided, one day you&#39;ll see a massive division. Many people will get to the next level. Many more won&#39;t. The level of deception is immaculate. I&#39;ll just leave you with this, if you believe it not to be possible. <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth">www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth</a></p>

<p>They aren&#39;t aliens. They are us in another form. There is some significance to why we&#39;re here I&#39;ll tell you that much. Biblical end times are really happening, people will either fall into heaven or fall into hell. It&#39;s fate. Mainly because just like I have woken up and it&#39;s likely my job to pave the path for others, you must choose the path at your own free will. I followed truth because I knew truth and knowing was the path I wanted to take. Others wish to take ignorance. The whole world is a deception seeing how much separation it will take to make you want to change sides. All the people in favor of the government will soon see the facts, 500 million get to live in the new world order. (According to them, I&#39;ll give you a hint it&#39;s not true) If people are actually willing to go along with that and kill the rest of humanity for their own gain then they don&#39;t deserve it and deserve to be punished extensively. That&#39;s my perspective at least. We are immortals in human bodies.</p>

<p>A lot of crazy claims, you can write it off as insanity. I just know myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes sir you got that right. I&#39;ll tell ya. If you really want to dive deep you gotta realize things. There is no such thing as a good guy in the world. Top scientists are all jokes so you know science is a well put together lie. Politics obviously a stage show. Opposition is also a stage show. Spiritual warfare is strong because everything in this world is made to pull you down. There are secrets hidden within religion but I don&#39;t suggest you become religious just spiritual. Magic mushrooms are growing everywhere right now. Identify the good ones and have a good trip.</p>
