       Nothing critically damaging has been leaked or exposed by wikileaks.  Embarassing yes.  Shameful yes.  But nothing huge.

       And Snowden, again, wow NSA is monitoring everyone with mass surveillance?  And snowden got it shut down?  Yay good guys?

      <p>
       Nope.  Just wants the masses to think its shut down.  It's not.

       Why would the media, or to be exact the same media that supported crime, death and destruction around the world support something if they are here for real? If they are for real why the government just does not assassinate snowden/assange? Get through this and you can be sure that they are illegitimate; Snowden is a CIA stooge while assange is a Putin lackey.

       So if I can extrapolate what you are saying correctly...if the entire political world is nothing but a stage show, and ruling entities of every single country are nothing but fiction, then who would be the mysterious puppet master controlling all of it? Beyond that, what would be the point of creating such elaborate fiction? Any one person or group with that much power could get away with whatever they want. A convoluted worldwide political soap opera of fiction would seem pointless if someone possessed as much control as you seem to be suggesting. 
Don't get me wrong, politicians lie and cheat all the time...but to imagine a scenario that all politicians are lying and cheating in the same way, under various flags, and all with the same goal, seems to be a conspiracy of such epic complexity that it could never be fully controlled, let alone successfully implemented.

       Yeah. I'm cut from a different grade. Not only do I think that it's happening but, I know it's happening. I am the truth. I know the truth. You're all here for spiritual growth and this is a huge level of learning. If we are all part of Gods creation then the biggest thing you must conquer is being one with everyone else. This world is divided, one day you'll see a massive division. Many people will get to the next level. Many more won't. The level of deception is immaculate. I'll just leave you with this, if you believe it not to be possible.

       They aren't aliens. They are us in another form. There is some significance to why we're here I'll tell you that much. Biblical end times are really happening, people will either fall into heaven or fall into hell. It's fate. Mainly because just like I have woken up and it's likely my job to pave the path for others, you must choose the path at your own free will. I followed truth because I knew truth and knowing was the path I wanted to take. Others wish to take ignorance. The whole world is a deception seeing how much separation it will take to make you want to change sides. All the people in favor of the government will soon see the facts, 500 million get to live in the new world order. (According to them, I'll give you a hint it's not true) If people are actually willing to go along with that and kill the rest of humanity for their own gain then they don't deserve it and deserve to be punished extensively. That's my perspective at least. We are immortals in human bodies.

       Hmmm...You claim "I am the truth". Then you link an article from the known British tabloid rag The Express

       I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that maybe "the truth" and you are not on the same page. 
As for the "scientist" in the article. you linked...He's not exactly well-respected by his peers and is generally thought of as a crank.

       Basing your beliefs on ghost stories, superstitions and things you see while you're high isn't exactly a very convincing argument for what is the "truth". 
Believe what you want, but when you lack even a modicum of verifiable evidence to back it up, you might end up looking the fool.

       Information is key. What we do with that information is up to us. America just wants to sit back and let the country fix itself. It doesn't work like that. The only people I see protesting at all lately are BLM and the native Americans. And those protests are weak at best. We need to protest like other countries protests. Flood the capitals with a few hundred thousand people. But even that won't really do anything. Change is only going to come when war comes home to the USA.

       Didn't 5 people lose their positions at the DMV. That's something that wouldn't have happened with out then. And if there is not "BOMBSHELL" before the election then we will know even more they weren't that useful.

       Yes sir you got that right. I'll tell ya. If you really want to dive deep you gotta realize things. There is no such thing as a good guy in the world. Top scientists are all jokes so you know science is a well put together lie. Politics obviously a stage show. Opposition is also a stage show. Spiritual warfare is strong because everything in this world is made to pull you down. There are secrets hidden within religion but I don't suggest you become religious just spiritual. Magic mushrooms are growing everywhere right now. Identify the good ones and have a good trip.
