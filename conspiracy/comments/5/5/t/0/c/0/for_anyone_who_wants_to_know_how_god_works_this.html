       No religious shit just watch this video. This is real. I know because I did it without knowing what I was doing. I swear to God I can alternate our physical reality. It works stronger in groups. If you are one who can also do what this man is talking about PM me. I would love to test it and see what it's truly capable of.

       You suggested I watch this. I enjoyed the content. But this isn't news to me. I understand very deeply the power of emotion and taking hold of your desired metaphysical plane. But I still would like an unbiased and reputable news source to emerge. One on the lookout for humanity. Maybe if I care about it enough, it will emerge or begin to exist. Therefore, I ask you: what emotions or energies are you channeling? Are you letting yourself be taken by fear? Or are you existing in a state of love and acceptance? Focus on that. You don't have to answer this now. Just keep that question in your mind. Realize that we are mediums through which energy can and will be channelled, whether it be positive or negative. Energy that has existed since way before us.

       I hope this pushes you in the right direction.

       I am only here to help you guys fix the world. The world is pointless I've always known. I know what I am. My 3rd eye is already open. I already defeated my lower chakras. I ain't normal nigga. I will eat down votes and hate but this is exactly where the truth is. If I figure it out and learn what the special feeling is inside the heart I will be able to start doing things. I have studied the occult and magic and such already to some point. I see through lies like america eats mcdonalds french fries. I am not normal people are going to hate but I will add something here to show you how there is an equal amount of people hating and loving this. I believe what you are saying is merely the minor capabilities. I think if you know the true keys like Thoth and others it may be possible to move mountains by saying "Mountain Move."
      </p>
      <p>
       When I went to bed I said I went from +9 to +15 karma. Well now I'm at +25 and still no movement I'm at 0 points. Clearly shills at work. I am too smart to let others bring me down it's the power of the third eye. Will start replying to PM's ppl have sent me now. This is true human potential. Probably has something to do with a clean body too.

       We're all creators.  The ability to manifest reality is inherent in all of us.  Generally we're confined to the patterns of manifestation that we've been taught and this is how we as humans can be programmed.  You can learn how to consciously control this faculty and that's what deep spiritual practices teach.  Unfortunately, they've been stripped from mass consumption religion.

       I now believe kids are born with super natural powers and it is possible. They just somehow got the grace of the matrix to show them how, or somehow figured it out themselves. Everything today wonks our consciousness and thoughts out of what they are naturally so that we can't obtain the true powers of this. This is the super natural force all over the earth. I have seen videos of monks chanting and watching cancer disappear on a woman. Didn't know if I should believe it but I see it now. Time to learn the matrix people. We are going to become God. The kingdom of heaven is in us and God has chosen the worthy. All we need to do is step up, learn how it works, and start to use it. In no time we will be able to bring the world the leaders they deserve.

       if you want to access powers, you need to master one pointed concentration, and start opening up the inner channels/chakras and then they will emerge/manifest. Many paths teach how to do this.

       Also there are false gods, demiurges/demigod. There is, however a true absolute reality....

       I Spend my time trying to invite you guys into the true one reality but no one believes me. You gotta get invited. I already saw the blank slate. After you get to the entire blank slate of reality you realize you are above it, just like I am. You guys obviously can't see it. The difference between me and them is I want to figure it out and I will go to any length to learn it. Maybe what Jesus is talking about is how he used this. Who knows what the capabilities are. "Duplicate bread" "duplicate bread" Who the hell knows what Jesus is talking about. Look up chanting videos 3 monks cure cancer by chanting.

       There are no flaws. Look around. It's all bullshit. You are saying your belief is right. Trust me I've spent a shitload of hours trying to find ONE credible source. None to be found. I've spent my time on numerous occasions looking at like 10 videos sent by other people trying to disprove me. You're all fucking wrong but you guys lack the critical thinking to see it's all false proof filled with fish eye lenses, wonky bs facts and then a huge bunch of "science" that doesn't back up anything because it's using the fake facts in the first place.

       I don't have a "belief". I merely view the evidence that exists around the world, and find the "evidence" that you provide is the only bullshit here. You can't even explain photos showing stars moving over the last 30 years - instead you just ignore the evidence and run away like the coward you are.

       Just like you call that proof what a joke. Stars could exist if the earth was flat too ever think of that? lmfao it's like laughable you are stuck inside this reality where, IF ITS W V X Y Z, ANY OF THE 5, THEN IT'S GOTTA BE A ROUND EARTH. Cool there are fucking stars whoopie fucking doo. Cool they get displaced slightly some of them, big fucking deal. For all you know the pyramids are holding the stars up and the other pyramids holding the stars up are just buried. You guys lack critical thinking majorly. You don't entertain any other thoughts and never leave your retarded ass paradigm you were taught in school.

       You claim they are facts, but you've provided nothing to prove that they are. And you have yet to prove any evidence I've provided (or the mountains of it that exists elsewhere) is fake. Instead, you just point at it and say "fake", and expect that to be enough.

       You've "studied" it, but only enough to make wild claims that you refuse to back up with evidence, and run away from any inconvenient facts. As I said before, you're as predictable as you are pathetic. Have fun shouting into the wilderness, because nobody here is taking you seriously.

If you suck the balls of every ball earther until you can see no other possibility you're obviously going to never look at the other side. Have a good day I'm not replying.

       So now you're resorting to strawman arguments? Just because I follow the science behind globe earth that means I must believe everything? You still have yet to back up your bullshit claims with science. You say your claims are "facts", and then expect me to take your word for it. Guess what? Your word is worth exactly nothing until you can provide evidence of it.
      </p>

       You claimed that the sun changes size over the course of the day. If it does, you should be able to provide easy evidence of such. You haven't.

      <p>
       You claimed that "Sun spinning doesn't make sense it curves like a C any point on earth." - Aside from not even being proper english, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Would you like to try and rephrase this nonsense, or are you going to claim again that it's a "fact" and doesn't need support?

       I'm already transcended I know the true one absolute reality. It's called deleting all thoughts except the truth. You guys are not capable because you don't see how the flat earth is possible. I am in the reality you don't get it. I transcended already to my 3rd eye. People will hate and I did write all this after I was up for like 24 hours. I only sent one video but I watched like 5, I've seen things before chanting to remove cancer from people. It's all about the feeling in the heart. This is the path it totally is. When you smoke DMT people say you see words pop up in 7 different languages. What do you think you are seeing? People literally down vote into oblivion. But just like yesterday when someone posted a alex jones/bill hicks video, the shills are all over it. This is how the world works.

       Soon as you said that, you've stepped away from absolute reality, entered duality, took on a relative position, and the decided to roll with flat earth illusion.

       When there is 0 proof of the sphere earth what makes you believe. Flat earth is the gate keeper. Truth destroys lies and believe me I am transcended. It does not bother me what you people say on Reddit. I truly want to help and fix the world. You guys aren't helping by holding onto false beliefs. Enjoy the tilted sphere earth at 66.6 lol.

       I think the psyop here is that flat earth is actually real but they have been priming people for hundreds of years with jokes like "HE STILL THINKS THE EARTH IS FLAT!" or "THAT WAS BACK WHEN PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT THE EARTH WAS FLAT!".
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes someone sound absurd to even suggest the earth is flat, and that's where the psyop is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why nasa lies about space. To keep up their biggest lie, flat earth. They are getting so grandiose with their lies with comet landers and shit, it's all gonna come crumbling down.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we get is CGI pictures. I used to think flat earth was a psyop. The more I looked into it, and realized we are actually deceived at such a grand scale, it's true.

       Yeah well for me, all I had to do is hang out with my Science Professor neighbor who tied a go-pro camera to a massive silver weather balloon he had access and permits for near where I live. We all gathered for the event and launched it into the very high end of the Atmosphere as close to the border as space as possible, and took pics, and you can see the roundness of the earth from your own experiments and know once and for all that flat earth is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know, have fun with that. I gave the flat earther stuff a look, and I guess it would make sense if you just no longer believe in science and don;t have the ability to do some simple budget friendly DIY experiments.

       Yea. Go pros have a fish eye lense.

      <p>
       So yea. That's why you saw a curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see many videos of non fish eye lense and they show level.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS:
      </p>
      <p>
       The video you posted is a fish eye lense, of course there will be a false curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers mate. No need to get testy. You just need to research more. You'll figure out the truth sooner or later.

       But it clearly is. It's why the earth appears stationary, the sat is in orbit around it. You know, because it was designed that way by people who spent decades in school studying this stuff and collect fat checks using skills you can barely comprehend.

       So are all the other planets flat too, or just earth? Because anyone with a telescope can see the other planets are spherical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the sphere is the principle organizanizing shape for self-attracting particles in 3D space. I can go more in depth if you're interested, but essentially:
      </p>
      <p>
       -if gravity exists (it does)
      </p>
      <p>
       -if all matter has mass (it does)
      </p>
      <p>
       -if, for all practical purposes, the spatial universe has 3 dimensions
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the default configuration for all bodies beyond a certain scale is spherical due to self-attraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the videos from balloons only show curvature because of fisheye, why aren't the videos distorted on the ground? Do the lenses magically get swapped mid-flight by the sky demon? Consider this: if
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       video was using a fisheye lense couldn't you and your merry band of meth addled compatriots send a non-fisheye camera up and break the world-wide Million+ person conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, go get a camera with no fisheye + high altitude balloon and let it go. Total cost maybe $500. That's nothing to change the world! You could even kickstart it. Then you could finally "prove" your idea and be famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       But oddly enough, no one has ever done this. The biggest conspiracy ever you can prove for &lt;$500 and no one has ever tried to catch them! Crazy!

       My up votes are going wonky for submitted posts. It's obvious people are up voting this and it's being tinkered with by Reddit. Copy the video and relate it to anything you can find. I know I can alternate it myself to some extent because I have before. I thought it was God. Turns out it is, but it's me too. God listens but there are the rules to the game. If you know this work start something and invite me I will share what I know.Discord or anything, skype if you know something don't be shy we can figure it out. It's all about chanting and wanting. Magic mushrooms are useful now, I understand why. It deletes all your baggage so magic mushrooms are really magic. They remove negative emotion so you can do miracles easier. Makes you wonder if the people on mushrooms were hallucinating or if they really did pull off miracles. Obviously a combination of both but I'd love to try to recreate it with anyone. Down with the old world we will manifest anything according to our will.

       Another thought, the pyramids are incomplete. Chant the correct words at the pyramid and they will re complete themselves??

       ARE YOU UNDERSTANDING YET? How the fuck do you think Jesus came back from the dead??? Don't believe me ask any spirit you talk to and half of them will tell you yes! Ask the occult sub reddit! God obviously loved Jesus so much he resurrected him according to Jesus' will.

       Yea. Go pros have a fish eye lense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea. That's why you saw a curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see many videos of non fish eye lense and they show level.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS:
      </p>
      <p>
       The video you posted is a fish eye lense, of course there will be a false curve.

       Cheers mate. No need to get testy. You just need to research more. You'll figure out the truth sooner or later.
