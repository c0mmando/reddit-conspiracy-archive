    <div class="md"><p>Actually, judging by what happened in Charlotte, OP isn&#39;t entirely wrong. </p>

<p>The agitation didn&#39;t work. I live in Charlotte. And I can tell you 100% that the national media only showed the violence from that Wednesday night (in which 70% of the rioters arrested were from out of state), but the next 4 days were quite peaceful with no one buying into violence or agitation, and nary a media outlet showed it. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t show the hundreds of white and black people marching shoulder to shoulder. They didn&#39;t show white cops talking to black people, or the black cops talking to white people. All they showed was the race bait bullshit. </p>

<p>Folks like me (middle class), black and white alike, are by and large not buying the race bait, and I&#39;m noticing more people beginning to realize we are being poked and prodded. People are sick of injustice and inequality. </p>

<p>I appreciate your points, and you are right as well in that people tend to be naive and easily led, and that the elite are more well organized than we could imagine. But something feels different...I work with the community everyday, and I&#39;m here to tell you that most of the lower middle class/poverty stricken people I deal with are all of the same opinion; it has nothing to do with white against black. And everything to do with 1 against 99. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not even an issue of money.  There is a class war going on, but there are plenty of 1%er&#39;s who are going to lose a lot if civil war breaks out.  Its actually those who consider themselves &quot;leet&quot; and superior to the rest of humanity.  That&#39;s the real class war.  We&#39;ve already seen the &quot;rich&quot; vs &quot;poor&quot; narrative played out in Soviet Russia, and that did not work out to well.</p>

<p>You&#39;re playing their game. I don&#39;t give a shit about the rest of what you said, this says it all. You are seeking a boogey man, still. You are looking at the things they want you to. I&#39;m from royalty and have some connections, very estranged, and not influential these days, but, yeah... You are not seeing the bigger picture. These people are light years ahead of you.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, thanks for the kind words. I don&#39;t mean to come off as a dick or something. I just see this sentiment all over. Overly optimistic about things. I want peace in the world, truly, but I know it&#39;s not possible (not the point of this reality). Humans are humans, and we are all different (which is beautiful and unique - see the animal kingdom). </p>

<p>Trying to make us &quot;one&quot; is their plan. You wont believe me, but this is their plan. Remove all differences. </p>

<p>Every Race and Culture is beautiful and should be celebrated. One should not be superior over the others, though. Their goal is to rob us of this, just like they have robbed us of our true history (We do not spawn from apes - Darwinism stems from the elites). Knowledge is power. I&#39;ll stick up for a Black, but I&#39;m not one with him (I&#39;m a White Slav).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you are asking for in regards to reading material though... I&#39;m kind of all over the place...</p>

<p>Intelligent black folk? There really are not that many. Half of American blacks have an IQ below 85. Sure, individual blacks can be bright, but what success do they have in shaping the actions of their race? Look at sub-Saharan Africa for the answer. No roads. No ships. No monuments. No great cities. No science. No written languages. Not even the wheel. Everything of value the blacks of Africa have, they got from whites.</p>
