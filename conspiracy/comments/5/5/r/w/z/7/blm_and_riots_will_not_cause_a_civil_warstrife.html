       Because Obama was not successful in implementing gun control and the internet is disrupting the narrative, the attempts by Soros and other agitators will not result in mass race riots and civil strife.  There will be no justification for martial law.  I'm betting that the protests and riots we are seeing will be no worse than the 1992 Los Angeles riots.  Level heads are prevailing and the agitation is not working.

       Not by themselves, as they are merely the how of it; but the end of the petrodollar almost certainly will, and that is the why of it. As things tighten up, welfare and institutionalized racial discrimination in employment are already going away along with the jobs; ends are increasingly not meeting anymore on Main Street, and that's real, palpable fear you can burn down a republic and build an empire with.

       Good point.  Stirring up racial tensions might just be a softening of the "target".  While it may not actually create division it does create some "cracks" that could be exploited later.

       You underestimate the stupidity of the masses and the brilliance behind the organization of the elites. That being said, SJW censorship is fine as well, with them... Plan A, B, C, or D. You gotta play 4D chess...

       Actually, judging by what happened in Charlotte, OP isn't entirely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agitation didn't work. I live in Charlotte. And I can tell you 100% that the national media only showed the violence from that Wednesday night (in which 70% of the rioters arrested were from out of state), but the next 4 days were quite peaceful with no one buying into violence or agitation, and nary a media outlet showed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't show the hundreds of white and black people marching shoulder to shoulder. They didn't show white cops talking to black people, or the black cops talking to white people. All they showed was the race bait bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks like me (middle class), black and white alike, are by and large not buying the race bait, and I'm noticing more people beginning to realize we are being poked and prodded. People are sick of injustice and inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your points, and you are right as well in that people tend to be naive and easily led, and that the elite are more well organized than we could imagine. But something feels different...I work with the community everyday, and I'm here to tell you that most of the lower middle class/poverty stricken people I deal with are all of the same opinion; it has nothing to do with white against black. And everything to do with 1 against 99.

       And it's not even an issue of money.  There is a class war going on, but there are plenty of 1%er's who are going to lose a lot if civil war breaks out.  Its actually those who consider themselves "leet" and superior to the rest of humanity.  That's the real class war.  We've already seen the "rich" vs "poor" narrative played out in Soviet Russia, and that did not work out to well.

       You're playing their game. I don't give a shit about the rest of what you said, this says it all. You are seeking a boogey man, still. You are looking at the things they want you to. I'm from royalty and have some connections, very estranged, and not influential these days, but, yeah... You are not seeing the bigger picture. These people are light years ahead of you. Think outside of the box and what is happening... It's not organic.

       Care to elaborate on the outside the box statement? Maybe some links? Or some search suggestions? I'm not at all against gaining knowledge and altering my opinion/view/perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I will say that judging my complete mindset based off of the 1 v 99 comment I made is a little presumptuous. I may not be as advanced in my thinking/opinions as you are (yet), but I am also not blind to the fuckery in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm legit not trolling you or being sarcastic, either. I actually really enjoy your comments in this sub and appreciate very much what you bring to the table with your intelligence and opinions/views. I would genuinely appreciate being pointed down more avenues to pursue knowledge and a greater understanding of the world as it really is.

       Well, thanks for the kind words. I don't mean to come off as a dick or something. I just see this sentiment all over. Overly optimistic about things. I want peace in the world, truly, but I know it's not possible (not the point of this reality). Humans are humans, and we are all different (which is beautiful and unique - see the animal kingdom).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to make us "one" is their plan. You wont believe me, but this is their plan. Remove all differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every Race and Culture is beautiful and should be celebrated. One should not be superior over the others, though. Their goal is to rob us of this, just like they have robbed us of our true history (We do not spawn from apes - Darwinism stems from the elites). Knowledge is power. I'll stick up for a Black, but I'm not one with him (I'm a White Slav).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you are asking for in regards to reading material though... I'm kind of all over the place...

       Freedom of discourse and provoking thoughts is all I seek. I'm not trying to change people's minds, but have them think. I've seen your comments around here (responded to many), I agree and disagree. That is the beauty of this all. Cheers, and carry on. I'd welcome you in, as well.

       There are a lot of bozo's that will fall for the BLM tripe, but there's also a lot of intelligent black folk who are countering the fake narrative and are putting things in their proper context.  Those who fall for the BLM narrative will cause problems, but not nearly as bad a problem as to cause martial law.

       As far as plan B,C,D, etc.  Yes, these power hungry "globalists" will never stop, but at least they are held in check for the moment.

       Intelligent black folk? There really are not that many. Half of American blacks have an IQ below 85. Sure, individual blacks can be bright, but what success do they have in shaping the actions of their race? Look at sub-Saharan Africa for the answer. No roads. No ships. No monuments. No great cities. No science. No written languages. Not even the wheel. Everything of value the blacks of Africa have, they got from whites.

       We white folk are stupid when compared to the average Asian and Ashkenazi Jews.  So does that mean we can't figure out when we're being manipulated?  Drop the "blacks are inferior" vibe.  We don't need more division at this point.

       I would say their agenda is going pretty much according to plan...they get what they want...if there are no riots it is because that wasn't part of the plan.

       Care to elaborate on the outside the box statement? Maybe some links? Or some search suggestions? I'm not at all against gaining knowledge and altering my opinion/view/perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I will say that judging my complete mindset based off of the 1 v 99 comment I made is a little presumptuous. I may not be as advanced in my thinking/opinions as you are (yet), but I am also not blind to the fuckery in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm legit not trolling you or being sarcastic, either. I actually really enjoy your comments in this sub and appreciate very much what you bring to the table with your intelligence and opinions/views. I would genuinely appreciate being pointed down more avenues to pursue knowledge and a greater understanding of the world as it really is.
