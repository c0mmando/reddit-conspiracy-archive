        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m far from the only one, but sometimes it feels like it. There are just so many things wrong with everything. Our economy is screwed, this housing bubble is insane, student debt is predatory and insane and financially crippling an entire generation, these never-ending aggressive wars to expand the empire on our tax dollars, these lies the media tell and are allowed to tell, the rigging of regulatory bodies by the corporations who are supposed to be being regulated and the abuse of that to reinforce monopolies, the buying out of congress, the judicial system, and the legal system. Everything is being rewritten by billionaires, for billionaires. Everyone sees it. I don&#39;t know how people can talk about anything else. Talking about Brad Pitt&#39;s breakup or whatever just seems so impossibly trite in comparison to the societal decay that surrounds us. There is moral decay, financial decay, socio-economic decay. The middle class is dying out. Jobs are hard to find. Everything keeps getting more expensive, but wages don&#39;t ever go up. Money keeps inflating. Everyone is forced to rent, and not building equity. There are twenty-two empty homes in the US for every homeless person. The market is not balancing itself because it is rigged as a one-way ratchet, and the middle class is bearing the brunt of ensuring that happens. </p>

<p>Media is bullshit, modern movies are bullshit propaganda made by organizations who abuse the legal system for profit. Music is the same. News is a joke, everything is handed down from AP and Reuters, who are owned by the same people. There is no investigative journalism on MSM anymore, those people are fired. </p>

<p>Why do I open my mailbox and 9/10ths of my mail is advertisements? Why do they get to send mail for free? Oh right because they rigged it for their benefit. </p>

<p>Why are the people at the top getting away with <em>everything</em> and the people at the bottom are raked over the coals over <em>nothing</em>? Like a kid gets caught with a joint: 10 years in the slammer. Hillary repeatedly lies to congress and the FBI while under oath? Eh, they recommend no action at this time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about connections and power. It&#39;s disgusting that we&#39;ve let our society become so focused on this hierarchy of power, devoting our lives to working, to generate just enough money to lightly indulge in the consumerism our society constantly flaunts in our face as the highest virtue. </p>

<p>Clip from Mr. Robot [1 minute]:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNfzbPAD8FE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNfzbPAD8FE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I wish people would stop playing these stupid games and get real. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the MSM or the government actually reflected the values of the populace? Wouldn&#39;t it be great if society actually had a moral compass that we held in high esteem, rather than this dog-eat-dog profit-seeking nonsense. Constant manipulation from every angle, to get you to behave and think and spend in ways that empower the machinery of the status quo. </p>

<p>If we want it to change, we <em>must</em> change ourselves. We must view culture not as an information system, but a trick being played on us. Mainstream culture does not organically arise from the views and preferences of the populace, as the MSM would love you to believe, but instead is carefully crafted and honed not only for what people like, but what narrative they wish to push. By selectively paying attention to and carefully ignoring other things, they craft a picture of the world that leads ones to draw certain conclusions. Conclusions you draw, by design, because of the bias inherent in the data being presented. You &quot;figure it out&quot; for yourself, and thus believe it more and see the ideology as your own. It&#39;s the main idea in the movie Inception. This trick, of tricking you in to thinking you came up with your ideology on your own, is a way they control you. You think you&#39;re making an unbiased judgement based on the data you have, when in fact the data is secretly selected to have an inherent bias that pushes an agenda.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all been doing this since the day we were born in to this mess. Some of us have learned these tricks. Other people have not, and fall for them hook, line, and sinker. Other people are caught in the middle, with the feeling something isn&#39;t right, but are too afraid or haven&#39;t seen enough information to make the conclusion that this system is there to abuse them, not to be their friend.</p>

<p>We must make our own culture. We must talk to each other about our opinions and ideas so that we can grow. <em>We</em> need to be driving the national conversation, not the MSM. We have completely put the cart before the horse by letting the MSM run the conversation over the last hundred years. The internet is our chance to wake up and empower each other, and they&#39;re trying their best to clamp down on that. But luckily we have places like this, where we can post the unvarnished ugly truth and not have an immediate censorship response by the &quot;immune system&quot; of these ideologies. </p>

<p>Just let it go. The way to make it go away is to build something else, something new, that is better and simply makes the old way obsolete. The more we make our own micro-cultures, and have the discussions some people aren&#39;t willing to have, the more everyone grows and learns outside the pre-made mental barriers given to us by the MSM. </p>

<p>The best analysis would be to come up with a plan for a global revolution that takes down the 1%&#39;ers and redistributes their wealth into a some sort of fair and balanced set or redistribution programs via Basic Universal Income, while also doing a global debt forgiveness (loans/mortgage/education) and restarting the global monetary system into something super basic and fool proof/block chain tech, transparency, renewable energy models, elitist/globalist live tribunals and incarceration, destruction of all monopolies, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is that when there is a serious upset in the economy (currency collapses and so on), the justified public anger needs to be directed at the people who are actually responsible, instead of scapegoats as they will try to make it be. And the only way that will happen is if people are educated and unified about the truth, despite what the media says.</p>

<p>So I think the most important thing is to inform people who want to be informed, but simply have not come across the information yet. </p>

<p>If we want to build a nice wall, the best way is to focus on laying one perfect brick at a time. I think until the public is educated on these issues and <em>cares</em> about being educated on those issues, nothing else matters because we will revert back in to this same oligarchy situation as people are easily manipulated. </p>

<p>No small group of people is going to fix this, so I think it&#39;s more about disseminating the truth about what the problem is, than coming up with solutions. The solution is to get rid of the people causing the problem, in most cases. This isn&#39;t a matter of clever policy design, it&#39;s a matter of the public not giving a crap. They only get away with it when the masses don&#39;t care. That is the key thing that needs to be addressed, people need to see clearly what is happening and why it matters. In my opinion, once this happens, the problem will mostly solve itself. </p>

<p>Perkins: Well, in my opinion the biggest catalyst that needs to go forward to change this is we’ve got to change the corporations. We’ve got to move from that goal that was stated by Milton Friedman in the 1970s, that the only responsibility of corporations is to maximize profits regardless of social and environmental costs.</p>

<p>We change the big corporations by telling them we’re not going to buy from you anymore unless you change your goal. No longer should your goal be to maximize profits regardless of social and environmental costs. Make a decent rate of return for your investors, but serve us, we the people, or we’re not buying from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would take a lot of effort on the part of the consumer, it would take a big change in world culture to have a shift where something like that was taken seriously by the majority, but it is possible I suppose. </p>

<p>I see more the businesses shooting themselves in the foot by draining the middle class by paying low wages and manipulating congress and the legal system, which then leaves no one to buy their products! How can we have a consumer economy if no one has any money to consume with? I think this is what will really make it fall apart, at least in the short term.

<p>Less jobs, more automation, more crime, more immigration for cheap labor. Its all downhill from here on besides a few hubs where the tech companies and rich folk are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! People seem to forget that the &quot;boss&quot; of the corporations is <em>the consumer.</em></p>

<p>It has been made more difficult to do more than simply buy from another company (such as see them prosecuted for fraud or corporate malfeasance), but that is because our government sold them their power... the power that originally was ours!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget people... corporations do not have armies and if they seem menacing to you, it is because they are in bed with the government—a government <strong>which you would be justified in seeing as menacing</strong> as we have relinquished all civil liberties in the last 60-80 years (mostly out of fear) with the Patriot Act, AUMF and complete surveillance since 9/11 being their coup d&#39; gras.</p>

<p>This thread seems to be very anti-capitalism, but our current system is not capitalism but a meritocracy-imbued crony capitalism, which is a result of a weak and ignorant populace more than anything. What the OP is explaining is how it has become so easy to become weak and ignorant... Capitalism is not perfect, but if unfettered except for some dangerous areas (such as the glass-steagall act&#39;s original intent), and of course full prosecution of corporations for all criminal misconduct (which they never receive), then it would be a entirely different world right now.</p>

<p>If you want to see a very fast natural progression of the free markets at play in a basic model without cronyism, just play some Monopoly... for a few hours... and you will see what happens.. one winner at the expense of every other player losing...

    <div class="md"><p>there is no simple solution to such a complex issue, but it would be based around incorporating a social economic model that focuses on; cooperation not competition, technocratic efficiency not inefficiency, more automation and less human labor, abundance not scarcity, sustainability not mass consumer consumption, natural laws not man made laws, access to resources and not ownership, power and ecoconomic equality spread horizontally amongst all the people and not vertically to a minority of people.</p>

<p>These are of course all ideals that would result in the best well being for all of humanity world wide, however, there are transitional steps to get to this of course... universal basic income, jeremy rifkins idea of The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things and the Collaborative Commons, Steady State Economy, Natural Law Resource based economy, etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither have really been tried anywhere else; at least without interference. </p>

<p>The root of the problem is our debt-based, fiat currency. Period. You don&#39;t start there you are doomed from the outset. It is really a simple problem that can be fixed in a short period of time. If people actually understood how money was brought into existence, really understood how it worked, there would be a revolution tomorrow. Think of it like this: every dollar you have and every dollar we all have is a dollar owed to someone else. It&#39;s literally a debt. If you were toeliminate all debt you would literally eliminate all currency. Think about that for a second. To remove the chains of debt is to destroy the monetary system as it stands now. Why do you think we have a consumer (spend, spend, spend) driven mentality implanted into all of us at as young and age as possible and the merits of saving money or paying down debt is secondary? </p>

<p>Debt is how they keep you enslaved. Interest is how they destroy all of your gains. Interest is the reason for inflation. Period. Why else would inflation exist? You can actually see the curve begin it&#39;s steady climb starting the same year the Federal Reserve was chartered for the 6TH TIME in this country, 1913. The slow move upward has, in the last 40 years or so gone vertical.  If you want an explanation and solution I&#39;d be happy to give it (IMHO of course). I don&#39;t know how much people on here know and this thread actually got me to sign up an account so this is my cherry post. </p>

<p>correction; If you were toeliminate all debt you would literally eliminate all currency, PLUS, still have 97% debt being owed with no currency left to pay it back with... </p>

<p>I agree, it is a financial trap to keep people enslaved... but that&#39;s not hte only thing, so is a system based where you need to earn currency to make a living and pay for you to survive with; That type of thinking is still very crude, in a way that it hinders the maximum potential of human creativity and development. We could have hte means of production to provide every human being on this planet a very good living, but it will never happen under a materialistic, monetary and competitive society, one where people still have to work have physical labor to work jobs that are brain numbing and ones that can be automated and be accomplished by a machine...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>socialism/communism are inherently flawed as well... anything with an &#39;ism&#39;, being based off capitlaism, is inherently not the ideal solution to strive towards.. </p>

<p>Capitalism, in essence, is already a lot healthier than communism ever was, at least in all the examples we have had play out in reality... The reason why this is so is because all the power in communism was focused vertically to benefit a small minority of oligarchs (what came to be after wards), but in capitalism the economic power was spread a lot more horizontally amongst more individuals... however, if you progress capitalism for long enough it will likely result in the same poor economic conditions that resulted in communism, as the exchange of the hand will result in more and more economic power being spread vertically not horizontally. </p>

<p>This progression of capitalism into similar environmental conditions to that of communism, is currently happening in the western world right now, particularly the States where capitalism has had a greater length of time to progress where the divide of the poor and the rich is greatly increasing with each coming year. You can say everything that was feared and criticized about communism in the past, is now happening to current-day capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in that sense where the power is spread horizontally and not vertically, it would be a lot more ethical... however, socialism still cannot deal with the many problems we are seeing in the world today such as; over consumption of global resources where we&#39;re having a huge species die off and shortage of resources for goods, it will still be based on promoting scarcity and not abundance, will still have levels of inequality just not as bad as before, would still be based on inefficiency to attain higher profits and not sustainability which would hurt profits, human passage to other countries would still be restricted, etc etc...</p>

<p>Of course it would be a step in the right direction to make things more equal than they are now, and that&#39;s good enough of a reason to change to it even if it&#39;s not the most ideal solution for now... just so long as people only see this as a temporary means of operating society, where the end goal still is an environment that deals with more pressing issues than what Socialism can handle.</p>

There&#39;s just a lot of examples in history of people who clearly identified a problem, but then had what ends up being a &quot;the road to hell is paved with good intentions&quot; type of solution, like Marx&#39;s Das Kapital.

    <div class="md"><p>good intentions definitely sounds pretty vague. One persons good intentions acted towards another person could be considered violent in the receiving persons reality... ie, Person a) Here, let me help you out with your sexual frustrations by raping you, it will make you feel appreciated for sure. Person b)  Stop!!!.</p>

<p>I am not sure if that is what you meant, but yes all the problems we have are problems that particular specialists in their respective fields should tackle... often it is a technical / engineering problem, where in todays society we address such problems with political solutions instead... the rationality behind this is insane...   </p>

<p>problem i) Too many people living in a country, lowers the living standards of those that live there... (Solution) should be to increase the efficiency of housing, utilities and transportation by improving infrastructure or topical layouts with engineers and creative thinking.... instead, the political solution is to invent magical borders, trespassing laws, and kill people trying to cross them (despite the country&#39;s claiming to be the most free country of the world, it&#39;s funny how we try to kill people trying to get to it in North America).</p>

<p>Problem ii) shortage of water.  (Practical Solution) have engineers upgrade the water recycling treatment plants with new technology.  (Political solution) might be to write laws preventing usage of water in particular ways,  or increase the price of water for all... </p>

<p>problem iii) Two world nuclear powers want to fight each other for resources around the world. (practical solution) would be to abolish competition based socieities and implement cooperative and share the world resources together in smart and intelligent ways.  (political solution) Both Nuclear powers fight each other clandestinely, publicly, and monetarily... make treaties with other nations, build weapons, blow each other up while at the same time wasting even more resources in the process to acquire new resources, rinse and repeat... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nobody doing anything will hurt everyone equally in this society... if you want to trigger a collapse in our current society, just focus on self sufficiency... </p>

<p>Ie, creating your own goods and services and not relying on the state or markets... In fact any efficiency you can come up with will hurt the state and it&#39;s hierarchical systems... so for example if you can supply your self with your own; renewable energy, water and waste system, agriculture, non-monetary entertainment, higher education, etc etc that use the least amount of monetary resources as possible... You will then be proactively contributing to the collapse of the state, the banking sectors, the monolithic corporations, etc etc... to bring about a post capitalist society hopefully... </p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s only one way of transitioning, there are other ways too, and in my opinion people should be putting in effort to play a part in multiple transitional methods to assure we have a smooth transition and not a violent one...  Or worse, a revolution without an evolution, ie... a repeat of an economic crash that simply results in the monetary system being reset without any conditions in the environment being changed... only for the system to crash another century or couple down the road again, over and over continually... </p>

<p>No I don&#39;t. I suggest some sort of hybrid of the best aspects of all systems combined, decentralization, balance, ecology, free time to pursue passions, etc. Certainly some elements of Marxism are not themselves marxist.</p>

<p>Why does that have to penalized. If I have a day off from work, I can choose to be lazy. I have saved up from jobs and quit them in order to spend a year or two being lazy. Nothing wrong with that. The beautiful thing about laziness is that it has its own kill switch, in that eventually being lazy gets boring and you desire to do things again.</p>

<p>This change is coming regardless:</p>

<p>Nope, I merely entertain possibilities and since I know my own nature as that of a humanitarian and more loving instead of a selfish ego, I know that just like within me is the potential to do good and help others, it also exists and can be awakened in others and together we can create something Awesome here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the zeitgeist stuff is ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never linked zeitgeist. I just linked an article on how the current crapitalist system is in its death throes:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/31/capitalism-age-of-free-internet-of-things-economic-shift">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/31/capitalism-age-of-free-internet-of-things-economic-shift</a></p>

<p>We all feel it intuitively that the current system models are fucking shit dinosaur enslavement models. This is why so many people voted for Bernie, are disenfranchised, why decentralized tech like cryptocurrency, indie labels, diy movements, 3d printing are exploding in popularity because we are entering a new paradigm right before your very eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we change into a do nothing society we will be concurred</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are already conquered by a false system. The do nothing society will slowly evolve into a global phenomenon, just give it time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia china and soon india will take our spot in a second when we show weakness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is normal. However the fucking sharks that ruined America are entering into those countries to destroy them from within as well. We had our time and are now on the decline, and they are on the rise. These are normal/natural cycles</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way we can embrace this futurology stuff is massive simultaneous worldwide change. Thats a dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it will slowly evolve into that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>almost all the industrial jobs were automated and moved to service.. and now, with the advance of technology and automation/mechanization, 95-98% of jobs are at risk of being automated by machines... So when there is no more income, or a universal basic income, how can you provide for your family or even have a thriving healthy society?? It&#39;s impossible.. </p>

<p>Technology will likely keep on progressing, so we can either accommodate and adapt our society to thrive on such advances, or we will see the majority of humanity living in the greatest state of poverty ever to be witnessed, as the factory and industry owners will possess almost all the resources on this planet on their own. UBI or BUI is a necessity, baby steps required towards something even better as technology progresses faster.</p>

<p>Human beings are creative of such incredible creativity, why squander our potential on meaningless jobs that 90% of humanity absolutely hates... and a society built on violent, manipulation, slavery, human trafficking, war, poverty, inequality... It doesn&#39;t take a lot of logic to see how our way of being is fucken hell already, please.. don&#39;t be promoting the continuation of this human slavery for longer...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the NWO want is a centralization of all world powers into a small, cliche network of private owners.. a minority... we are talking about the largest hierarchical and &#39;centralization&#39; of world powers into the hands of the few, or their own benefit instead of the benefit for the people....</p>

<p>The difference is what I am proposing is the exact opposite, the decentralization of all powers horizonally amongst all the people to eliminate the vast inequality of resources we already currently have.</p>

<p>If you are curious about first steps, UBI / or guaranteed basic income could be some good first steps right there. Research it in depth, the science is already well developed, and it works greatly... perhaps it works too well, particularly for people that have low to medium income, to that point that GDP is increasing very fast, which creates more problems with world resources being depleted even faster...</p>

<p>Also, no one is talking about &#39;utopia&#39;. By definition, utopia is perfection, and humans can never achieve a society of perfection ever... But the goal is not perfection, the goal is to keep making strives towards a better life for all, to continually keep reshaping society to the best knowledge we have at the time... That knowledge will always increase, as does with everything else we do in life... </p>

<p>Yep. It&#39;s basically like a nation wide Bystander Effect. And I can&#39;t lie, I feel it in myself as well and I think everyone else does to some extent as well. </p>

<p>Another way to explain how I feel often and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one is the show Hoarders. All of us have basically just let our houses go, we didn&#39;t clean regularly and eventually the situation gets so enormous that we don&#39;t even know where to start and we know we can&#39;t do it alone. Only difference is, no one&#39;s going to come help us clean up our own mess.</p>

<p>Everybody is waiting for someone else to make the first move and that thought is so depressing to me because I do it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I really wish humans didn&#39;t act this way because it just makes everything 100% harder. </p>

<p>Until a lot more of us lose either the roof over our heads or the food in our bellies, most people will just keep telling themselves &quot;It could be worse&quot; for what could be a long time. </p>

<p>Especially since, and I assume most others were raised this way like I was, we&#39;re taught to not complain and to be grateful for what we have because (as my mom would always say) &quot;Think of all the starving kids in China and Africa, it could be worse!&quot; </p>

<p>Interestingly, the way studies found to combat the bystander effect is for one person to take charge and start commanding specific individuals to perform certain actions. (&quot;You in the blue hat, call 911. You in the red, hold the victim&#39;s head upright.&quot;) Perhaps the same solution can be applied to the nation-wide Bystander Effect? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely an interesting idea!</p>

<p>The only real issue I can think of is that most coordination efforts would have to start online, unless the internet ends up getting blocked. I have no idea if the same thing could work while not being face to face. </p>

<p>It could come down to anonymity I think. If you&#39;re physically with a group of people during an emergency and someone gave you orders, maybe part of the reason you&#39;re willing to listen is because you wouldn&#39;t want to look like a coward in front of a lot of people. </p>

<p>If it was through the Internet though, its much easier to just be like &quot;Nah, someone else will do it.&quot;</p>

<p>I definitely think it would work face to face though, say at a protest or something. But I think all of this depends on exactly how bad things are at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten that line so many damn times. I made a political status on Facebook. A friend commented and we ended up agreeing by the end of it (I made her look like an idiot to the point she didn&#39;t even realize that she was agreeing with me and went back and deleted all her comments). She started off saying something along the lines of yea I agree with you but blah blah blah. And then went into the usual &quot;sheepal talk&quot; (as I like to call it when someone starts to talk as if their still under the blue pill effect). </p>

<p>I think the easiest way to wake up a nation would have to be to play the same game the government plays. Which is the Fear card. Control the media and control the mass population. Start big and then dissect America until it&#39;s been &quot;purged&quot; ,I guess you could say. If a virus was sent out to every major news network capable of interfering what is being broadcasted and was able to show what&#39;s really happening that would start getting people&#39;s attention. Then start targeting major corporations in the political game. Bringing them down. All you&#39;d need is one video and one major corporation (like a big pharmaceutical company, oil company etc. And just watch it spread like wild fire across the nation. 
To me that&#39;s how it would wake people up. </p>

<p>Like when I&#39;m having a nightmare. The only way I wake up is if something scarier comes along and I tell myself to wake up before it&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>People do know what&#39;s wrong.  It&#39;s their worsening economic situation.  However, they do not know what is causing it and cannot understand it when they are told.  The MSM is there to misdirect and confuse the people so that they will never spot the problem.  Even the once who are for what seems like positive change, are in reality enemies of the solution. </p>

<p>The problem is the wizard behind the curtain that controls people, economy, politicians, etc.  The wizard&#39;s power is everywhere and no individual or a country can escape it.  Not even nuclear powers like Russia and China.  This power does not hide and everyone know it.  It is the <strong>private</strong> Fractional Reserve Banking.  To understand this power and to understand that the solution was written into the US Constitution, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Sboh-_w43W8">The Secret of Oz</a>. </p>

<p>This is a well intentioned mantra that many in history have taken to perverse ends.  If people are unreceptive to the truth, you need to find a new way to tell them.  The idea that we should just throw people away seems to directly contradict the sentiment of your message.</p>

<p>If someone came to you and said, &quot;Dude, the government put a chip in your butt!&quot; you&#39;d react with skepticism (I hope) because it&#39;s a pretty extreme claim based on your understanding of the world.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I feel you. It will stabilize. I bet people felt the same right before WW2 or WW1. It&#39;s grim but it&#39;s not like all humanity is going to suffer for the rest of time. Things cannot just get worse forever, it&#39;s literally not possible. </p>

<p>Things may get real ugly for a few years, and then things will finally start getting sorted out and there will be an era of prosperity, hopefully in our lifetimes. Seems to be the pattern of humanity throughout all history, and I have no doubts the same thing will happen here. It&#39;s just a nasty time in history right now and we are as unfortunate as the people alive in the 1930s in the US or Germany. But like the 1970s were pretty sweet in the US, and Germany was pretty sweet in the 90s. It comes back around, we just have to help guide it there with our words and actions. </p>

Something about knowing it&#39;s going to happen but not knowing when invokes this feeling of vulnerability... like at anytime everything could come crashing down. Now, how many Americans are on medications that they need everyday? What if the power went out for just a few months? Imagine the millions of heroin addicts who wouldn&#39;t have their fix. You&#39;d be hearing windows breaking in the middle of the night, junkies breaking into houses looking through their medicine cabinets. CVS would have a trash-can thrown through its window night-time. Can you imagine the chaos? If the banks completely shut down because of something like Deutche Bank causing a systemic shutdown of the entire country? There would be mayhem, and the cities would tear themselves apart.

<p>Thankfully if I don&#39;t have my medicine I won&#39;t die, but I might wish I had as well as being totally useless for a week or two in the event I&#39;d have to run or fight.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been clean from heroin for over a year now, but I did it with Suboxone. The good thing is, I&#39;m not on heroin or morphine anymore, but the bad thing is that I&#39;m just as dependent on the Subs.</p>

<p>The worry that something could happen and I&#39;d have to go through some massive withdrawal during a period when being sick would be a liability is exactly the reason why I&#39;m getting my Dr to start tapering me down so that I won&#39;t need any medications if shit hits the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human society:</p>

<p>Our brains have the ability to track at most about 140 people.  We are designed to form power hierarchies in small groups around that number.  Starting with women, people orient around the most powerful and sociopathic tribe members (people willing to constantly lie without remorse even order people to their deaths).  This forms a power structure based on emotion and passion and enforced with brutal social pressure.</p>

<p>Local leaders are among the most ruthless corrupt liars, because they are the chiefs.</p>

<p>Chiefs form their own hierarchies.</p>

<p>Always, any bureaucracy, office, political network, there are about 100 people in a clear hierarchy.</p>

<p>Modern technology has allows these groups to merge and coordinate (communication technology, modern weapons, modern ideology and propaganda).</p>

<p>The &quot;nation&quot; is an imaginary abstraction to appeal to the tribal instinct.  When we think of our nation of 300 million we&#39;re actually subconsciously conceiving of it as we would a group of 100 people.  This affects our voting habits as well.  Racial minorities are represents by 5-10 people we know in person or from media and our racism is in fact shunning of them.  If not the pure dehumanizing of outsiders.</p>

<p>This is how all politics actually is.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s corrupt and violent at all levels everywhere.  For all history.</p>

<p>Some people, in a given high school cafeteria, are sociopathic bullies, and the rest bow to them.  And if they weren&#39;t little kids they&#39;d get away with murder.</p>

<p>Human society is a disaster.  Unless you&#39;re in the top 30% but not top 5%.  Then you have a good life, believe the lies, and ruthlessly demand punishment for rockers of the boat of privilege.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the key. Forget it, ignore it, shun it. What you focus on is given power. Pay attention to the MSM? You are literally paying with your attention. Turn towards creating your own culture. Stop consuming so much and begin to create. Uphold respect, kindness, compassion. Be an example, it will inspire more than you know. We all have the power to contribute something, so get started. It is important to be aware of the negative, but to focus on the positive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. By believing in an ideology like Christianity, or Patriotism, or whatever, I am giving away my ideological autonomy. I am out-sourcing my thinking, so I don&#39;t have to do it and instead have an authority to point at who can explain for me, and belonging to a group also makes me feel validated through social approval. </p>

<p>When I got wise to that whole game, I became very careful about what ideologies and ideas I allow myself to hold. People tell you what you want to hear to get control over the rest of what you think. I am very much not a fan of these &quot;group package&quot; ideologies that seem everywhere in modern society. Freeing yourself from these is one of the first steps in freeing yourself from the mess humanity finds itself in, imo. </p>

<p>Compassion is the key. Compassion not only to others, but to yourself as well. We are all in this boat together, and it&#39;s easy to forget that when we start falling in to the mindset of &quot;my team vs their team&quot; which is common with ideological packages. </p>

<p>All we have to do is take off the training wheels and truly think for ourselves. Then the whole world opens up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! You are so astute. Be independent, question all that you consume. To be on your own team yet remember we are all connected whether we like it or not. Unity through compassion. Understanding breeds empathy. Sports teams, religions, patriotism as you said creates a divide. While this is not necessarily a negative thing by itself, what creates the negative effect is lack of <em>awareness</em>. Humanity has an ego problem and doesn&#39;t even know it. The ego is a piece of the puzzle necessary for the entire picture, but it must be kept in its place :) Ego education is what humans need in my opinion. Once you become aware of it, and how it can drive you, it will no longer rule you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wise words, couldn&#39;t agree more. I think you could make an addendum that there&#39;s a problem with IQ vs EQ. EQ is basically neglected in our society and the lack of emotional health makes us emotionally blind, which causes a lot of problems with egoism and so on as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that sums it up much better. Embracing emotions, learning to be aware of them and processing them, embracing the entire spectrum.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it seems in our society emotions are only valued insofar as they drive people&#39;s consumerism, pride of over-working, and promote their passivity toward the powerful (national pride, etc).

    <div class="md"><p>My 20&#39;s happened in the late 1970&#39;s - 1980&#39;s. I graduated high school, got a pell grant that paid for college and books (part time student but it could have paid for full time) and a 30-40 hour a week job at a local pet shop. Anyone who slacked enough that they couldn&#39;t get a full grant and had to resort to student loans got them at 1.3% interest rate.</p>

<p>I made around $150.00 per week and at 18 rented a very cute little apartment in a decent area with nice landscaping, a pool and clubhouse- on a signature. My rent was $140.00 per month and they paid gas.</p>

<p>No one never heard of &#39;credit checks&#39; to rent a place. The idea that anyone working any kind of job couldn&#39;t afford a place to live was ridiculous. When you put your money in a savings account it actually accrued interest, rather than costing you.</p>

<p>No one went into debt unless they absolutely had to - like when I bought my first home at age 28 with a $5k down on a $40K house. Monthly payment- around $180. Being in debt outside of home ownership was considered a moral failure, and something to be avoided. If you had a credit card it was pretty much for emergency use only. If banks had dared to charge people for <em>not</em> using their credit card- a lot of cards would have ended up in the trash-bin.</p>

<p>I was never paid less than $11 an hour - working at privately owned, Main St. businesses. I paid around $10 a month for full Blue Cross. (Deductible on insurance? What the hell is that?)</p>

<p>The reason for the pay/benefit scale was that there were 4 manufacturers within 20-30 miles that paid union wages ($17-$20/hr) and so everyone had money to support the local businesses. In return those businesses paid workers enough to stay competitive with the union wages in order to keep good people.</p>

<p>And now everyone is imprisoned by the banks, being convinced that not having a &#39;good credit rating&#39; is a moral failure. The cost of everything has been driven so sky-high (by bank and government collusion) that people get locked into debt, paying interest to the banks, from the moment they graduate high school. </p>

<p>Houses that were $30k in the 90&#39;s are $350k now. The reason? All of that extra interest going into bank coffers. </p>

<p>You see, it&#39;s about feeding the Beast on every purchase you make. The MSM encourages this by convincing people that they <em>have</em> to wear certain styles or have a certain new car or they are worthless scum. Paid off politicians allow the banking system to remain unregulated so that they can screw you at every opportunity.</p>

<p>The only real way to break free from the cycle of poverty and despair, en mass, is to refuse to feed the beast. </p>

<p>The only reason protesting worked in the &#39;60s/70s was because of the regular, raise hell and block roads protesting was having an <strong>impact on business</strong> across the country. Not because so many people were unhappy. They piss on your unhappiness. </p>

<p>So #Vacate the system rather than #Occupy. </p>

<p>Cut up the credit cards, refuse to be enslaved to a &#39;credit rating&#39;. Move your money to a credit union. </p>

<p>Cut the cable tv cord. </p>

<p><em>If you can</em> - sell your car and use alternate transportation. I have lost 15lbs and saved around $4k a year for the past 3 years.</p>

<p>Make friends with Craigslist/local adverts. Buy thrift, buy local, buy used through private purchases- and use cash.</p>

<p>Treat the &#39;Mall&#39; as if it is ground zero for the zombie outbreak.</p>

<p>Find local gardening clubs/outlets and chicken keepers. Buy as much from them as you can. I get 2doz eggs for $4 - free range and no chemicals.</p>

<p>Refuse to watch advertisements. Totally tune them out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many people would be willing to do these things. But if enough do, if that beast starts going hungry, things would start to change. If not, then everyone will just continue to eat shit and I see debtors prisons on the horizon. Yes it can get that bad again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s headed down a bad path. I view this as a golden period in human history for open communication even though things are on a bad path, like we have to be in this subreddit instead of the main ones. We&#39;re at the end of the decade or two before they figured out how to control the internet, that&#39;s powerful stuff. I say talk while we can, this 20 years could be the only good open spot for centuries to come, who knows. This could be the pivot point that changes humanity and wakes enough people up to start a tidal wave</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely agree. Just take a look at the current election, your vote doesn&#39;t matter and whoever becomes president doesn&#39;t REALLY matter. We don&#39;t want to realize that its the top 1% that really control what goes on. Thus, we have what&#39;s going on now, the drama between 2 idiots and their election where we comment on how they look, how they talk, what arguments and propositions they come up with and so on - it doesn&#39;t matter, end of story.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made a few comments like this one on the r/politics discussions but they all get downvoted and labeled as hyperbole or bonkers. Say what you want, but this is the truth and if we, the young generation, don&#39;t act, this bullshit will continue.</p>

<p>A system that&#39;s corrupt and broken at its root won&#39;t be fixed by a president, but by the people who act together not to vote, but to act alone, together.</p>

<p>Ofcourse you have your &quot;educated&quot; middle-aged man or woman on reddit thats going to lecture me on how I&#39;m wrong when they can&#39;t be fucked to go on wikileaks or on the darknet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If academics, historians, economists, political commentators, &quot;journalists&quot;, scientists, NGO workers etc don&#39;t incorporate Wikileaks&#39; revelations, Snowden documents, Operation Mockingbird, the Church Committee and other factually proven conspiracies into their work and their worldview then they are selling pure snake-oil.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post, I like the summary at the end: </p>

<hr/>

<p>(d) The stages of the rise and fall of great
nations seem to be:</p>

<p>The Age of Pioneers (outburst)</p>

<p>The Age of Conquests</p>

<p>The Age of Commerce</p>

<p>The Age of Affluence</p>

<p>The Age of Intellect</p>

<p>The Age of Decadence.</p>

<p>(e) Decadence is marked by:</p>

<p>Defensiveness</p>

<p>Pessimism</p>

<p>Materialism</p>

<p>Frivolity</p>

<p>An influx of foreigners</p>

<p>The Welfare State</p>

<p>A weakening of religion.</p>

<p>(f) Decadence is due to:</p>

<p>Too long a period of wealth and power</p>

<p>Selfishness</p>

<p>Love of money</p>

<p>The loss of a sense of duty. </p>

Scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have found that when just 10 percent of the population holds an unshakable belief, their belief will always be adopted by the majority of the society. - See more at: <a href="http://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/2902#sthash.Q2nhWCoY.dpuf">http://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/2902#sthash.Q2nhWCoY.dpuf</a></p>

<p>We can&#39;t be too far off 10% and anyone who opens their eyes and minds to the evidence will agree. Lack of direction for actions is an issue. I think we need the unshakable belief that it is time for American Revolution 2.0.</p>

It&#39;s nice to see you take out so much time to articulate, very well I might add, what myself and I hope other see in the world. I myself am rundown from saying these things almost my whole life. When you say the things you , myself, and others say people say you unamerican or crazy or whatever while you watch them blindly follow the lies we are fed everyday. I hope others are now seeing these things because if we don&#39;t find a way to change things our children will all be slaves. In this election I vote to REVOLT by whatever means necessary.

<p>I&#39;ve found that, even with my own family, that people have been so brainwashed by the neo-liberal left that they can&#39;t even muster the ability to try and see things from the conservative side anymore. The conserved civilization that allowed them to build great nations and culture and architecture and art and music that today has turned into a comercialist, modern, cheap cesspool. A ghetto of strip malls and bad neighbourhoods and people with different goals. I&#39;m not saying it was perfect, but it was at least an attempt to be guided by social morality. A morality that&#39;s built into us as a social species genetically. Everything promoted today goes against our instincts. And it&#39;s all in the name of creating a disruption in society and to divide people and make them at odds with each other instead of with the establishment that concentrates on these trivial matters in order to mask their underlying agenda to take everything from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally understand and I&#39;m 100% with you. The back and forth nonsense about the elections makes it more nauseating than usual. I&#39;ve grown tired of listening to people argue about the douche and the turd. I&#39;m tired of being a slave to a system that will gladly use my bones as mortar for their &quot;civilization.&quot; I&#39;m sick of listening to people pretend that if we just get the right guy in office and if we all &quot;make our voices heard&quot; through voting, everything will be fine and all we have to do is trust in the system. I&#39;m disgusted by the bullshit media manipulating our opinion and making us think those in power are fair and balanced and have our best interests in mind. Worst of all, I&#39;m fucking pissed off that I can&#39;t do a goddamn thing about it. At best, all I can do is keep myself informed and exchange information with friends that don&#39;t have the wool pulled over their eyes. Even then, that&#39;s not enough. We need action NOW but the manipulation and deceit are too pervasive and we&#39;re too comfortable to act. One can&#39;t help but to feel trapped. Despite all this, I&#39;d rather be aware than blissfully ignorant. I may not be able to do anything about it now but might as well preserve information as best as possible, since that information may no longer be available one day, for a generation of people that has the will to fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every waking day.<br/>
I tell myself to work on my &quot;soul&quot; in the hopes that maybe things in the next life may be better.  Perhaps it&#39;s a bullshit coping mechanism (I&#39;m not a Christian--just place my hope in some type of reincarnation).</p>

<p>On the other side, the Zack de la Rocha School of Through: &quot;Your Anger is a Gift.&quot;  Doesn&#39;t just have to be overthrowing the government--you can use that anger to promote some type of change or drive in your life or an other&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Poetry and reading fiction helps me cope, too.  So does spending time with nature and my dog, or animals in general.  Jack London and James Wright encapsulate all three if you&#39;re looking somewhere to start.  I used to use addiction to cope, sex and alcohol--but I wasn&#39;t making myself better for a next life, so having a spiritual awakening helped.  I do like life, so that&#39;s why I think I like animals so much.  Their innocence and purity.  All humans are guilty of not doing enough (myself more so than others).  People are hard to deal with.  You want to help them, but ignorance and cogitative dissonance are a bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure this topic has been flooded by now with statements to either support what you are saying or support you. This message is for you. You are right, everything in society fills like a wet dream. How could so many people sleep when their house is on fire? Right? Well it&#39;s simply because people are apathetic, afraid, or ignorant. You have to remember, even though your eyes are open, you are still humam, and still susceptible to a new video game, a new movie, or a new song. And where as the maimstream has sort of used up every original idea, i can attest that the undergroumd has not. Would you believe me if i told you there was a resurgence of funk music popping up in local bars, and music festivals? Or a rapper could be more lyrically able then Shakespeare? Well it exists, it&#39;s just not reflected in the mainstream. My point is that we live in a world right now with answers to the compromised main stream. We have independent gaming companies, record studios, and movie studios who are putting out quality products with the help of steam, netflix, and soundcloud.</p>

<p>Why it is important to focus on the avenues of entertainment first is because it is what connects us socially. You are more likely to see someone more &quot;awake&quot; when they&#39;ve taken the time to resist the garbage fed to them on the radio, and are 1 of the 8000 people who might of listened to Spacelords, Aesop Rock, Holly Miss Molly, or The Werks they&#39;re more then likely to have ideas to help change the status quo. You are apart of something bigger and while there seems like no hope now; you are already seeing the change taking place. Keep a positive attitude, and know that you are better then all this garbage l, be a trend setter and make it cool to care.</p>

Every single person on TV and politics is a liar and a crook, and it&#39;s possible alt.media (lionel) is full of a bunch of jesuitical, psychopathic controlgrid people also.  I feel like Thomas Sheridan and James Corbett are our last holdouts and that makes me sad (because we need more of these two).  I even have good reasons to doubt Daniel Sheehan and Jay Weidner.  And that makes me sad aslo.  I actually had to ease back on redditing because I was getting personal attacks &quot;bodysnatchers, you good bro?&quot; on cst, a post that was removed by the mods and the offenders kickbanned for harassing me by constantly saying I was schizophrenic--which I can assure you through over 2 decades of wasting my time with psychologists is not the diagnosis I have received, but rather bpd and I&#39;m actually very happy with this diagnosis and consider it final.  Also, I&#39;m proud I have it, because it means I&#39;m in no way like &#39;them&#39; (sockpuppets).  So as an &#39;attack&#39; (you need to seek help bro), it&#39;s not a very good one because I&#39;ve been there done that and came out a warlock with tiger blood but on the opposite team from sheen.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re really not alone at all. Almost every normal American feels that there is something majorly wrong with our country. Whether it be the economy, social issues, security, any topic really, most Americans will agree that something isn&#39;t right, that everything shouldn&#39;t be this bad. The problem is that no one can agree what&#39;s wrong, just that something is wrong. The narrative that&#39;s been developed by the media basically controls people into thinking that there is only 2 sides to any issue, and that you must hate whatever side opposes yours. They&#39;ve kept most Americans that know something is wrong convinced that the problems embracing our country are very limited in scope and therefore the conversation is limited and controlled. The difficulty is showing people the big picture, how everything that is wrong in our country and essentially the world is all interconnected. How money can be traced through all problems and if you follow it long enough you realize that it points the source of the problem as being a few select people. Until we can get people to realize that there&#39;s more to the topics of problems than just 2 sides that are presented through the media, we won&#39;t ever begin to start the change we so desperately need to fix the problems that a few people have caused for all of us regular citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>organize and fight the power. </p>

<p>if it weren&#39;t for organized protests, we still would have child workers, women can&#39;t vote, segregation, no labor laws, no weekends, etc. and that&#39;s all before the internet. </p>

<p>now you see that things are being taken back again by the elites. unions are being destroyed and they&#39;re privatizing anything they can. </p>

<p>we have to organize locally and demand changes. look how vilified black lives matter is in the news. see how fight for $15 is basically getting zero airtime. yet you bet your ass they&#39;ll let you know something insignificant as brad pitt getting divorced. the elites know organized protest is powerful and they will do anything to distract and make you feel powerless. </p>

<p>What America needs more than anything else is some old time religion. I&#39;m not talking about the ranting southern preachers and their con games, I&#39;m talking about a code of morality that is universal and accepted as both good and necessary for the well-being of society. We need truth. We need justice. We need a return to the American way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have built what I propose is a simple technical solution to a large part of the problem: <a href="http://TruthSift.com">http://TruthSift.com</a></p>

<p>As you point out, we are surrounded in BS. We all live largely in a propaganda bubble. We are lied to from birth. So you should realize you could be mistaken about anything.
TruthSift allows users to generate and challenge proof trees, so you not only can see what can actually be established, but how, and if you have any rational objection to any step of the proof, you can challenge and see the rating of the conclusion reflect your challenge. </p>

<p>Think of it like Snopes, except instead of a moderator, you have a transparent, crowd sourced, interactive, point by point debate where you can inspect every part of the argument and challenge anything you don&#39;t like, and the rating automatically reflects your challenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deep down, people have allowed themselves to fall into apathy.  The upper echelon has manipulated how people are fed information and bias in order to breed apathy.  This apathy, in turn, allows for the ruling caste to be exempt from the rules that they impose on the populace. If the peasantry is divided, there will be no one to stand up and call for revolution.  This is very evident in how the MSM is portraying race relations and verbally segregating people by economic status in the US.  It is all a tool to divide a country to keep from having the real perpetrators be accountable for their crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty simple.</p>

<p>What is fascism? It&#39;s the combination of state and corporate power under a single authoritarian body.</p>

<p>The US officially became a fascist state back in 1913 when the federal reserve act was passed. The Federal Reserve, a private bank, prints money and loans it to the government with interest.</p>

<p>So the debt will always be higher than the amount of $ in circulation. Your federal income tax goes towards paying the interest aka to the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The thing with this arrangement is that it incentivizes the Fed to lend as much money as they can because the more they lend the more they make in interest. We&#39;re basically slaves to the Fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I wish everyone was as knowledgable as me.&quot; - You.</p>

<p>Is that what you&#39;d really want, though? I used to lament similar things in a similar way to how you have, above, but the more I think about it, the more I realize what a profound opportunity society in its present state confers upon the freethinking man of good presentation and sound intellect.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>So easy to completely avoid law enforcement</li>
<li>No one assumes you&#39;re up to no good if you&#39;re white and well presented</li>
<li>Many of the best things in life remain undiscovered by the kinds of people who might otherwise ruin it</li>
<li>People being sheeple and slack about privacy makes working in marketing easier</li>
<li>The laws and regulations according to which the government operates are so convoluted and ill-considered that it remains (happily) quite ineffectual on most fronts, which is reassuring.</li>
<li>The busybodies of the world are completely distracted by nonsense; e.g., trying to stop the climate from changing, thereby preventing them from interfering in some other equally stupid but far more effectual – and thereby damaging – manner</li>
<li>Books, movies and music are abundant and come free of charge if you need</li>
<li>Pornography</li>
<li>I can buy any recreational drug on the internet and have the postman deliver it to my door at prices that would have felt cheap in the 90s</li>
<li>Any level of education is attainable almost completely free of charge via torrenting textbooks and all the other free lectures and resources available online.</li>
<li>Online dating</li>
<li>Far fewer delinquent teenagers cruising around looking for people to bash – now they&#39;re all gamers or something; they&#39;re inside at least, doing god knows what, leaving the glorious outdoors unmolested for my private enjoyment.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know, really. I remember when I first got hooked up to the internet in 1994 or something, and since that day, every day, I&#39;ve been milking it for all its wisdom. I had always assumed that so, too, was everyone else, so it came as something of a surprise to find that dumbshits will always remain dumbshits, even in this new land of infinite opportunity.</p>

<p>So, yes, they&#39;re being manipulated far more comprehensively than they had been before, but that&#39;s because those who actually do wish to get ahead in today&#39;s society have better and more accessible resources than ever before.</p>

<p>The key is simply to strive to get ahead. You&#39;ll never actually manage to change someone who doesn&#39;t want to know into someone who does. I&#39;ve tried that too many times already. No help but self help. Really, I recommend that you refocus inward and continue to improve yourself. Fly your freak flag high and you might just attract some likeminded fellows. Those hordes chasing virtual pokemon were always there, they just weren&#39;t all running in the same direction, so you didn&#39;t notice them before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, true. I feel like the American public has gotten away with basically being in denial about stuff for at least 50 years now. It literally worked, for several decades, because everything was going so well. Now it&#39;s not working, and people who have over-committed to the blinders are in for a rude awakening. And there&#39;s <em>such</em> a large amount of the population indulging in this mindset because it&#39;s been so long since people <em>needed</em> to care. That&#39;s how I think it came about, anyway</p>

<p>Yep. It&#39;s basically like a nation wide Bystander Effect. And I can&#39;t lie, I feel it in myself as well and I think everyone else does to some extent as well. </p>

<p>Another way to explain how I feel often and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one is the show Hoarders. All of us have basically just let our houses go, we didn&#39;t clean regularly and eventually the situation gets so enormous that we don&#39;t even know where to start and we know we can&#39;t do it alone. Only difference is, no one&#39;s going to come help us clean up our own mess.</p>

<p>Everybody is waiting for someone else to make the first move and that thought is so depressing to me because I do it too.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the way studies found to combat the bystander effect is for one person to take charge and start commanding specific individuals to perform certain actions. (&quot;You in the blue hat, call 911. You in the red, hold the victim&#39;s head upright.&quot;) Perhaps the same solution can be applied to the nation-wide Bystander Effect? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s headed down a bad path. I view this as a golden period in human history for open communication even though things are on a bad path, like we have to be in this subreddit instead of the main ones. We&#39;re at the end of the decade or two before they figured out how to control the internet, that&#39;s powerful stuff. I say talk while we can, this 20 years could be the only good open spot for centuries to come, who knows. This could be the pivot point that changes humanity and wakes enough people up to start a tidal wave</p>

<p>They just don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People do know what&#39;s wrong.  It&#39;s their worsening economic situation.  However, they do not know what is causing it and cannot understand it when they are told.  The MSM is there to misdirect and confuse the people so that they will never spot the problem.  Even the once who are for what seems like positive change, are in reality enemies of the solution. </p>

<p>The problem is the wizard behind the curtain that controls people, economy, politicians, etc.  The wizard&#39;s power is everywhere and no individual or a country can escape it.  Not even nuclear powers like Russia and China.  This power does not hide and everyone know it.  It is the <strong>private</strong> Fractional Reserve Banking.  To understand this power and to understand that the solution was written into the US Constitution, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Sboh-_w43W8">The Secret of Oz</a>. </p>

<p>US Constitution, Section 8: <strong>The Congress shall have Power ... To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin</strong></p>
