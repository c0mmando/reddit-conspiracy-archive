       Interesting how Russia built underground shelters for its citizens in case of a nuclear attack. America built  them too.... for a handful of billionaires.

       I constantly read on Reddit about hiding under desks in school in the US.  Which is mildly confusing because in the Soviet Union we had WMD shelters under each school, military barrack, many office buldings, etc.  Plus shelters throughout the city, with signs on buildings directing to them (we still have them (signs) today where I live, even though the shelter is not maintained anymore).  So, we did not hide under desks.

       The closest thing to me that would qualify as a nuke bunker would be Mammoth Cave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would NOT want to be in a cave during a nuke, no matter how stable it is. I feel like dying in pitch black darkness being crushed to death would be much more terrifying than seeing the flash and the incoming doom similar to the nuke scene in The Wolverine.

       Eventually yes.  Mutually Assured Destruction is a batshit insane ideology, that will eventually fail as soon as you get someone in charge of nukes that doesn't care about their own destruction.  As technology marches on, it means these kinds of weapons become more available to more people, and eventually something has got to give.

       Our (humanities) competitive nature will be our downfall. If people would learn to cooperate and work together we could have something wonderful, but people would rather bicker and fight so they can try to have more for themselves than their neighbor.  Stupid monkeys at the end of the day.

       I have a hard time believing they would build one of their points of light ( new trade center ) only to destroy it.
      </p>

       The prophecy or blueprint they follow states they points of light ( 100 I think? ) Are to be built across the globe.

       BRICS is the acronym for an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Russia &amp; China now villainized in the press. Brazil now has a

       . South Africa is facing economic stagnation, reduced mining output/operations, and the Space-x Amos-6 satellite was to bring satellite based internet access to large swaths of the country (not just SA, but a lot of underdeveloped countries in Africa). I would keep my eye on any BRICS nation for signs of outside influence/sabotage/possible propaganda- we can't have countries off the petro-dollar can we?

       If you look into the RAND corporation they were the minds of our whole Cold War mentality, they invented game theory stating everyone is out for themselves which is still our ruling mindset and one of their most prominent members Herman Kahn (who invented mutually assured destruction) asserted that as long as a third of the human population survives then we win. He "jokingly" advocated that we link a supercomputer to hundreds of nukes and when the computer senses imminent danger it would blanket the world in radiation.

       Won't happen depending on how "deep" you're into this stuff. With "1" being the most wonky/deep and "3" being closer to public perception. If you're more into the "1" camp, then you'll realize that there will be no nuclear war because 'they' will not permit it.

       I cannot claim that what I say is correct as I am just a pleb in this society. I simply just look for patterns and try to connect them. With that said, there are recurring themes for the "1" camp. Regardless of whether you believe in Greys, Reptilians, Giant species, Argatha, or anything of that nature, you will realise there is a inner-Earth aspect to the subject matter above. A nuclear war would be so powerful to cause impact upon this "inner" world. I am not saying the Earth is completely hollow, but there is no denying that there is some sort of inner-Earth dwelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for depopulation, I agree that is real. But I think that would be more man-agenda as opposed to alien-agenda. And although depopulation will probably continue to some extent, nothing on the level of a nuclear war.

       I agree. I think the 1 idea is way too strong. UFO's are all around and if you watch videos you can see them mess with rockets right out of the air. On top of reports like

        this,

       I am willing to bet we have some "friends" that will come help us one day soon. Things will be very rough until then but I would honestly bet on it. If not then looks like the world is on our shoulders ladies and gents. Just like the News is a bunch of fear mongering I think the entire world is just fear mongering, bad things obviously happen but maybe it's all according to their wishes. There's obviously something stopping them from destroying Assange because Hillary put 10 mill on him and he's still breathin.

       Your post instantly caught my eye because I recognise those themes   from my own journey down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the 'aliens' - those are inter/multidimesional entities, rather than physical space craft. I've seen that video before, and you do make a good point about 'them' not allowing a nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the planet - yes, it's not what we have been told, but it must be strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast because it has done before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting theories, thanks for posting.

       Also, in every encoded 10/4, it has eluded to a nuclear event.

       Well Russia seems keen on using tactical nukes (smaller yield) on US or NATO troops in an attempt to push back and send as a warning. That would be the first strike and we would all know about it. It would then give everyone a chance to rationalise the situation and decide if we want to go all out. I doubt a nuclear war would start with a first strike on civilians.

       No, because I honestly believe nukes are a hoax, with the purpose to instill fear and obedience. Look it up and you might come to the same conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides fact checking Hiroshima and A-tests I think the most telling evidence is that nukes have never exploded in an accident or false flag. Tptb are without scruples poisoning and killing all over, and yet has this never happened.

       Not like you are envisioning. There may be some limited nuclear exchanges, but the bulk of it will come from nuclear power plant accidents in failed states which have been devastated by economic, and possibly biological warfare.

       What people forget, is that nukes are insanely powerful now. The first nukes are fire crackers compared to the nukes we have now, which are even more powerful than Russia's largest nuke during WWII. The russian scientists all agreed that it would be an absurd idea to test that nuke at it's full 100megaton strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we have thousands of these, some even more powerful than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nuke from Hiroshima and Nagasaki both used half a handful's worth of uranium and plutonium for the destruction they caused. The ones we have now, I guarantee, are MUCH more efficient than that. I don't think it would be crazy to say that a single nuke over Indianapolis or New York could annihilate the entire city, surrounding towns, and then some.

       What if I told you, it wasn't a nuclear device, but knowledge being dropped of equal fallout (metaphorically, speaking)? I've heard whispers. That is all I will say...

       If it makes you feel any better... I've had a really hard DMT trip, met inter-dimentional entities that are just lovely and are waiting for us upon our death.

       I agree. I think the 1 idea is way too strong. UFO's are all around and if you watch videos you can see them mess with rockets right out of the air. On top of reports like

       I am willing to bet we have some "friends" that will come help us one day soon. Things will be very rough until then but I would honestly bet on it. If not then looks like the world is on our shoulders ladies and gents. Just like the News is a bunch of fear mongering I think the entire world is just fear mongering, bad things obviously happen but maybe it's all according to their wishes. There's obviously something stopping them from destroying Assange because Hillary put 10 mill on him and he's still breathin.

       Your post instantly caught my eye because I recognise those themes   from my own journey down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the 'aliens' - those are inter/multidimesional entities, rather than physical space craft. I've seen that video before, and you do make a good point about 'them' not allowing a nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the planet - yes, it's not what we have been told, but it must be strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast because it has done before.
      </p>

       Interesting theories, thanks for posting.
