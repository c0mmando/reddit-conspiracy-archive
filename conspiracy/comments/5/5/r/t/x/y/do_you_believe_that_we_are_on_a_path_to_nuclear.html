    <div class="md"><p>I constantly read on Reddit about hiding under desks in school in the US.  Which is mildly confusing because in the Soviet Union we had WMD shelters under each school, military barrack, many office buldings, etc.  Plus shelters throughout the city, with signs on buildings directing to them (we still have them (signs) today where I live, even though the shelter is not maintained anymore).  So, we did not hide under desks.</p>

<p>I would NOT want to be in a cave during a nuke, no matter how stable it is. I feel like dying in pitch black darkness being crushed to death would be much more terrifying than seeing the flash and the incoming doom similar to the nuke scene in The Wolverine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eventually yes.  Mutually Assured Destruction is a batshit insane ideology, that will eventually fail as soon as you get someone in charge of nukes that doesn&#39;t care about their own destruction.  As technology marches on, it means these kinds of weapons become more available to more people, and eventually something has got to give.  </p>

<p>Our (humanities) competitive nature will be our downfall. If people would learn to cooperate and work together we could have something wonderful, but people would rather bicker and fight so they can try to have more for themselves than their neighbor.  Stupid monkeys at the end of the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BRICS is the acronym for an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Russia &amp; China now villainized in the press. Brazil now has a <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/342933-temer-us-brazil-spying/">CIA puppet president</a>. South Africa is facing economic stagnation, reduced mining output/operations, and the Space-x Amos-6 satellite was to bring satellite based internet access to large swaths of the country (not just SA, but a lot of underdeveloped countries in Africa). I would keep my eye on any BRICS nation for signs of outside influence/sabotage/possible propaganda- we can&#39;t have countries off the petro-dollar can we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot claim that what I say is correct as I am just a pleb in this society. I simply just look for patterns and try to connect them. With that said, there are recurring themes for the &quot;1&quot; camp. Regardless of whether you believe in Greys, Reptilians, Giant species, Argatha, or anything of that nature, you will realise there is a inner-Earth aspect to the subject matter above. A nuclear war would be so powerful to cause impact upon this &quot;inner&quot; world. I am not saying the Earth is completely hollow, but there is no denying that there is some sort of inner-Earth dwelling. </p>

<p>As for depopulation, I agree that is real. But I think that would be more man-agenda as opposed to alien-agenda. And although depopulation will probably continue to some extent, nothing on the level of a nuclear war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think the 1 idea is way too strong. UFO&#39;s are all around and if you watch videos you can see them mess with rockets right out of the air. On top of reports like <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth">this,</a> I am willing to bet we have some &quot;friends&quot; that will come help us one day soon. Things will be very rough until then but I would honestly bet on it. If not then looks like the world is on our shoulders ladies and gents. Just like the News is a bunch of fear mongering I think the entire world is just fear mongering, bad things obviously happen but maybe it&#39;s all according to their wishes. There&#39;s obviously something stopping them from destroying Assange because Hillary put 10 mill on him and he&#39;s still breathin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post instantly caught my eye because I recognise those themes   from my own journey down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>In regards to the &#39;aliens&#39; - those are inter/multidimesional entities, rather than physical space craft. I&#39;ve seen that video before, and you do make a good point about &#39;them&#39; not allowing a nuclear war. </p>

<p>About the planet - yes, it&#39;s not what we have been told, but it must be strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast because it has done before.</p>

<p>Interesting theories, thanks for posting. </p>

<p>Feast of the trumpets.</p>

<p>10/4</p>

<p>88 days left in the year.</p>

<p>88 generals admire Trump(ets)</p>

<p>Assange all of a sudden is giving this announcement on 10/4, a day predicted along with 9/11 for DECADES by the powers that be.</p>

<p>Assange known to be limited hangout.</p>

<p>All the hype all of a sudden about fall out shelters up 700%.. the propaganda running wild.</p>

<p>Idk, seems like quite a few coincidences.</p>

<p>Also, in every encoded 10/4, it has eluded to a nuclear event.</p>

<p>Not to mention the 40 million russians going into bunkers tomorrow for a nuclear drill... Ahem.</p>

<p>And Mekell telling people to prepare for a war.</p>

<p>Clinton is a war monger who will send us to even more war, guaranteed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Russia seems keen on using tactical nukes (smaller yield) on US or NATO troops in an attempt to push back and send as a warning. That would be the first strike and we would all know about it. It would then give everyone a chance to rationalise the situation and decide if we want to go all out. I doubt a nuclear war would start with a first strike on civilians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because I honestly believe nukes are a hoax, with the purpose to instill fear and obedience. Look it up and you might come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Besides fact checking Hiroshima and A-tests I think the most telling evidence is that nukes have never exploded in an accident or false flag. Tptb are without scruples poisoning and killing all over, and yet has this never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people forget, is that nukes are insanely powerful now. The first nukes are fire crackers compared to the nukes we have now, which are even more powerful than Russia&#39;s largest nuke during WWII. The russian scientists all agreed that it would be an absurd idea to test that nuke at it&#39;s full 100megaton strength.</p>

<p>And now we have thousands of these, some even more powerful than that.</p>

<p>The nuke from Hiroshima and Nagasaki both used half a handful&#39;s worth of uranium and plutonium for the destruction they caused. The ones we have now, I guarantee, are MUCH more efficient than that. I don&#39;t think it would be crazy to say that a single nuke over Indianapolis or New York could annihilate the entire city, surrounding towns, and then some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think the 1 idea is way too strong. UFO&#39;s are all around and if you watch videos you can see them mess with rockets right out of the air. On top of reports like <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth">this,</a> I am willing to bet we have some &quot;friends&quot; that will come help us one day soon. Things will be very rough until then but I would honestly bet on it. If not then looks like the world is on our shoulders ladies and gents. Just like the News is a bunch of fear mongering I think the entire world is just fear mongering, bad things obviously happen but maybe it&#39;s all according to their wishes. There&#39;s obviously something stopping them from destroying Assange because Hillary put 10 mill on him and he&#39;s still breathin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post instantly caught my eye because I recognise those themes   from my own journey down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>In regards to the &#39;aliens&#39; - those are inter/multidimesional entities, rather than physical space craft. I&#39;ve seen that video before, and you do make a good point about &#39;them&#39; not allowing a nuclear war. </p>

<p>About the planet - yes, it&#39;s not what we have been told, but it must be strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast because it has done before.</p>

<p>Interesting theories, thanks for posting. </p>
