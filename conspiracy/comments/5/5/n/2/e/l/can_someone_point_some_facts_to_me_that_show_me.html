       Trump has a neocon as VP (handler). He's also supported by Cheney and Rumsfeld. He wants to torture and kill Assange, Snowden and other "terrorists". He wants more surveillance and more censorship on the internet. He's a fervent supporter of Israel, and his daughter converted to orthodox judaism after marrying an orthodox jew. He's a notorious liar who was for the Iraq war (despite claiming he wasn't), and he's said he intends to wage war on Iran -- on behalf of Israel. He loves debt and Wall Street banksters, and doesn't want to audit the Fed.

       Trump ran for President after his good friend Bill Clinton told him to.

       I'm not gonna waste time digging up sources for all of this when Google is just a click away for you as well. I've done it in other discussions about Trump, but I'm tired of doing it.

       Assange is probably controlled opposition to a certain extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the reason Trump hates him and wants him dead, is that Assange, according to Trump, is a "terrorist" or a "traitor" or something like that.

       I have my doubts about him, but I suspect he's controlled opposition. His fight against the West is probably genuine enough, but there's a group of people -- the "globalists" if you will -- ultimately controlling both the East and the West, pulling the strings of Putin as well as the Western leaders. That group wants to provoke a war between East and West, to consolidate its own power, ushering in a New World Order. For various reasons, I think 2023 will be the year that NWO emerges.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this theory might be totally wrong, of course.

       I have this discussion with this one guy at my work all the time: How soon or far off is NWO from emerging, is there any one reason you hold above others that it'll be in 2023?
      </p>

       Sometimes with the tensions worldwide and our (US) rampant militarization of police I think its close but things always more or less bottom out..

       ok, im not really sure where to start. i dont really know who you are fighting for, or against, honestly.
       <br/>
       he has bashed the shit out of obama for handing over control of the internet, which is one of the biggest mistakes in modern history.
he spoke against the iraq war 20 times, and 1 time on howard stern, he said he wasnt really sure.
hillary has over 20 wall street corporations supporting her. trump has 1.
he loves debt? who gives a shit? what kind of argument is this? you do know that our country is nearly 20 Trillion in debt, right? 
continue being a sheep

       I think he means that anyone following either hillary or trump is a blind follower. Hillary covers the most shallow brainwashing, trump covers the brainwashing for those who can take some time to read up on what is going on. Then all the sheep play in the two room pen.

       I don't support Hillary. I'm a Jill Stein supporter. And I'm not American. I'm against Hillary and Trump because they're dangerous. They bring war, not peace. That may not harm America, but it harms the rest of the world.

       I can't really find anything good. He donated some money and was friendly, but that was basically a part of his job so that could be either surface friendship or not, I can't tell.
If their daughters are friends, then that's pretty big but I've seen one comment on that.

       Sure, turn on your TV.  The media doesn't agree with r/conspiracy at all.  Of course it's also irrevocably biased and broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, go to r/ politics. That place is so loaded with CTR you'll find plenty of stuff to hate about him.  Of course not all of THAT is true either.
      </p>
      <p>
       On second thought maybe just learn to be ok with never being certain what the truth is.  Thanks Obama.

       I'm ok with not knowing the truth, doesn't stop me from casually drilling for it in my spare time anyway. Beats making trains when you don't really have the technology in your home to make them fight each other.

       That's really my point.  The truth is so "spun" you can't easily know it, or know it's what you're getting when you read something.  Even facts are placed in "bias soup" to get you thinking about the author's point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great example happening right now:  I've read two articles about Trump's tax returns yesterday.  One talks about how he paid 102$ Million to charity in 5 years; the other was about his making use of tax breaks.  Both from same source- his actual tax forms.
      </p>

       I do hope you find some reputable info.

       I've found some and I think I can kiiiind of guess what's going on.
These people plan 50 years ahead and stay completely incognito on channels we'll never hear about so I have no idea where it's headed.
hope the asian elite steps up with some different directions soon.

        Trump and Clinton phone call before primary
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Former president Bill Clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality-television star was nearing a decision to run for the White House, according to associates of both men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that Clinton encouraged Trump’s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and offered his own views of the political landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton’s personal office in New York confirmed that the call occurred in late May, but an aide to Clinton said the 2016 race was never specifically discussed and that it was only a casual chat."

       No it is actually quite reliable, the people who claim it is unreliable are those who feel uncomfortable with some of the things it exposes since they are used to getting their misinformation from Breitbart.

       Assange is probably controlled opposition to a certain extent.

       But the reason Trump hates him and wants him dead, is that Assange, according to Trump, is a "terrorist" or a "traitor" or something like that.

       I think he means that anyone following either hillary or trump is a blind follower. Hillary covers the most shallow brainwashing, trump covers the brainwashing for those who can take some time to read up on what is going on. Then all the sheep play in the two room pen.
