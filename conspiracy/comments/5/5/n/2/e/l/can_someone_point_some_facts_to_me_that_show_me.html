    <div class="md"><p>Trump has a neocon as VP (handler). He&#39;s also supported by Cheney and Rumsfeld. He wants to torture and kill Assange, Snowden and other &quot;terrorists&quot;. He wants more surveillance and more censorship on the internet. He&#39;s a fervent supporter of Israel, and his daughter converted to orthodox judaism after marrying an orthodox jew. He&#39;s a notorious liar who was for the Iraq war (despite claiming he wasn&#39;t), and he&#39;s said he intends to wage war on Iran -- on behalf of Israel. He loves debt and Wall Street banksters, and doesn&#39;t want to audit the Fed. </p>

<p>Trump ran for President after his good friend Bill Clinton told him to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my doubts about him, but I suspect he&#39;s controlled opposition. His fight against the West is probably genuine enough, but there&#39;s a group of people -- the &quot;globalists&quot; if you will -- ultimately controlling both the East and the West, pulling the strings of Putin as well as the Western leaders. That group wants to provoke a war between East and West, to consolidate its own power, ushering in a New World Order. For various reasons, I think 2023 will be the year that NWO emerges. </p>

<p>But this theory might be totally wrong, of course. </p>

he has bashed the shit out of obama for handing over control of the internet, which is one of the biggest mistakes in modern history.
he spoke against the iraq war 20 times, and 1 time on howard stern, he said he wasnt really sure.
hillary has over 20 wall street corporations supporting her. trump has 1.
he loves debt? who gives a shit? what kind of argument is this? you do know that our country is nearly 20 Trillion in debt, right?

<p>A great example happening right now:  I&#39;ve read two articles about Trump&#39;s tax returns yesterday.  One talks about how he paid 102$ Million to charity in 5 years; the other was about his making use of tax breaks.  Both from same source- his actual tax forms.</p>

<p>&quot;Former president Bill Clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality-television star was nearing a decision to run for the White House, according to associates of both men.</p>

<p>Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that Clinton encouraged Trump’s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and offered his own views of the political landscape.</p>

<p>Clinton’s personal office in New York confirmed that the call occurred in late May, but an aide to Clinton said the 2016 race was never specifically discussed and that it was only a casual chat.&quot;</p>
