        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ledankmememan.html">ledankmememan</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just something I thought about the other day.  In the past, when the United States went to war, most of the nation supported it and knew the implications of what would happen.  They were blind to the atrocities we committed, but they were still aware of where we were fighting and it was the most divisive topic in politics.  Even when we armed proxy soldiers in Central America and the Middle East, and never actually went to war with those countries, Americans knew what their government was doing and what was happening in the world.  When the gulf war happened, it was covered like a sporting event instead of a war.  Nonstop media attention, and most people watched it and talked about it like they were just rooting for their country to win like their favorite sports team.  </p>

<p>Then, with Iraq and Afghanistan, it seemed like it was the main topic of the news almost every single day.  The news just reported the war like it was part of our daily routine, just like when they reported on a traffic jam or a thunderstorm.  The terrible wars were just another normal part of our lives.  Everyone gradually got used to being at war constantly.  And it makes sense, because when we bombed Libya, the public&#39;s reaction was just &quot;meh, whatever, we just bombed another country.&quot;  Constant war was just becoming a normal part of living in our society.  After the US troops left Iraq in 2011, we thought there would be less involvement, but it only got worse.    </p>

<p>War has become so normalized in American society, we&#39;re at war in four countries and most people haven&#39;t even noticed.  Look at what&#39;s happening now.  We&#39;ve bombed Syria, and bombed Iraq and Libya again, and have deployed more ground troops to all of those countries, even though the Pentagon said we wouldn&#39;t have more boots on the ground.  Remember when Barrack Obama proposed invading Syria a few years back?  Remember when 90% of Americans were against it?  What happened?  We&#39;ve killed civilians in Syria with airstrikes so where&#39;s the outrage over that?  Has the mainstream media even reported the new wars in Iraq and Syria and Libya?  The American people are so blind that we can go to war and they don&#39;t even notice.  The military could invade Iran tomorrow and all the idiots here wouldn&#39;t even pay attention to it.  George Orwell&#39;s dystopia had endless war, and the citizens knew that they were always at war, but Americans are so ignorant that they don&#39;t even know we&#39;re at war.  I guarantee you, if you go to a shopping mall and ask the people there if they know about the surge of troops in the Middle East, you&#39;ll just get blank stares and dumb looks, or if you&#39;re lucky they&#39;ll say &quot;Really?  I didn&#39;t know that.&quot;  </p>

<p>2016 isn&#39;t as bad as 1984.  It&#39;s fucking worse.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are seeing a cultural and spiritual war as well, don&#39;t forget that.</p>

<p>The government and the SJW minions promote LGBT agenda, pedophillia, degenrate sex education and all sorts of marxism everywhere, including the internet (Which they are now working to neutralize since their first success in Gamergate), universities and mainstream media. The ready made Alt-right opponents and the public go against them. This is called war, although not a physical war, is a spiritual and cultural war.</p>

<p>In Europe, Refugees are mass introduced like a gate of hades and became a PLAGUE, with ex east germany agents like Angela Merkel and Anneta Kahane, communists like Hollande and the EU censoring everything against them and their beloved immigrants and supposed &quot;Anti-semitism&quot; in social media, AKA. anything that tries to stop their supremacy against the puny, armless pesants of Europe. Along with them were the Alt-right and Islamophobic shills that are supposedly waging war against islam but are producing misinformation that muslims are evil instead of the true evil; the luciferian khazarian jewish tribe behind us. This is called war. A spiritual and cultural war. As well as a war that trials the conscience of the Europe populace.</p>

<p>In Hong Kong we are seeing all major government and legislation seats as well as media being occupied by CIA/Mossad/MI6 agents pretending them to be &quot;Localists&quot;, with the US and Israel doing whatever they can do to promote these people to high levels and trying to seperate Hong Kong from China using these people in order to mass collapse Hong Kong as they know perfectly Hong Kong cannot survive without China and trying to plug off HK from China will result in mass depopulation which is their goal there. The media promotes these people as gods every day and single day all the while they show themselves as the obnoxious criminals they actually are. This is called &quot;War&quot;. A spiritual war and a war that trials our sense of looming danger.</p>

<p>So, a war, and to be exact a spiritual war is waging all over the world. It is a spiritual war that puts our humanity, freedom and ability to sense danger into trial. The upcoming world war iii is just a death knell; This is the real war, and if we don&#39;t win this war....It&#39;s too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too many people in the US rely on mainstream media. They don&#39;t cover that for the sake of keeping people blind. It&#39;s not their fault they don&#39;t know any better. We&#39;ve stopped reporting war, and journalists are being killed. The only real means of news is around here. Something many people have no idea exists </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US is not at war.  The armed services are at war.  The population is oblivious and if they knew they don&#39;t care.  As long as their life isn&#39;t effected an it is just brown people thousands of miles away getting killed, who cares? The important thing is to have cool sanitized video of American military power dropping bombs and kicking ass.  It&#39;s entertainment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America has <strong>NOT</strong> been at war for 17 years total. or like 7% of the time it has been a thing. WW3 has been quite a let down these last few decades, considering the megapixels on the cameras on the drones themselves. They realised long ago that the war reporting, as spun as they can make it, has nothing on the Punch and Judy show they do for the prodigiously milked cattle at home. </p>

<p>It is not even that you are not meant to know, you are just so overfed as not to care. Like cattle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying I hate the entire material world is probably the only way to describe it.</p>

<p>The US invades anywhere, imports heroin from the countries to mess up the minds of unsuspecting victims.</p>

<p>They lie about everything and smear the truth with massive shill tactics.</p>

<p>They have lowered the standard of the average person and the way they act down to literally nothing. Don&#39;t get caught doing anything illegal though or else you&#39;ll get thrown into the lower tier and used as a prison slave.</p>

<p>2016 is far worse than 1984. To make it even worse people don&#39;t care at all.</p>

<p>They make everything to break and convince people it&#39;s for money and marketing. It makes me so sad.</p>

<p>All of our food is poisoned and laced with things that make us dumb and docile. Trying to convince anyone who doesn&#39;t figure it out for themselves is very very hard.</p>

<p>Even on this forum where you&#39;d think free thinkers would unite, if you say a word like flat earth you are automatically deemed crazy. No one looks at the evidence or considers it might be the truth, even when you look at everything else.</p>

<p>Our government commits atrocities on their own citizens to give them means to invade other places.</p>

<p>They burn all the tax money and do nothing.</p>

<p>They give everyone this false hope and false reality where things are actually good right now.</p>

<p>People screw each other over in the name of money all the time.</p>

<p>They have divided all the races to the point where each have their own unique culture. They each condemn each other in their own ways.</p>

<p>Parents vs children all the time. It&#39;s obvious everything taught in school is just garbage or a lie. It makes me sick all these children who don&#39;t know how to express themselves. It sucks even more because kids wouldn&#39;t be able to carry the burden of knowing the truth now so you can&#39;t really liberate them either.</p>

<p>The control system is everywhere around us and people still say we&#39;re &quot;free.&quot; </p>

<p>Here are synonyms of depression.</p>

<p>synonyms:   unhappiness, sadness, melancholy, melancholia, misery, sorrow, woe, gloom, despondency, low spirits, a heavy heart, despair, desolation, hopelessness</p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t know God was real then I would have all of these. Now I&#39;m just mainly frustrated. It&#39;s sad wishing every day for DOOM. Of all things. I want DOOM. What a fucking world we live in where the good souls have to hope for something bad to happen to hopefully save us. It&#39;s terrible and it makes me sad thinking about it :(</p>
