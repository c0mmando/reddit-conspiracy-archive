       I don't feel like I understand to the degree that it is corrupt. My friend told me that the presidency is only an illusion orchestrated by the establishment. That political powers don't matter because it's not the politicians controlling it anyways. Can someone elaborate and expand on this? Edit: Damn guys, these wikileaks emails really show that you all were right. Kinda makes me angry.

       There is a big black box on the right side of the screen. Right below it is a link to the YouTube video. I would strongly suggest watching JFK to 9/11 Everything is a Rich Man's Trick. I showed it to my friend who was in the same boat as you and now he's awake. I watch it now and then just to remind myself of the things the world powers and the US govt have done. Some would tell you to watch it in chunks, and I agree. It is a long presentation, but well worth it. Now as you watch it, take notes of things you would care to research and look it up for yourself. Dont take everything you hear as verbatim. YOU have to extrapolate the answers for yourself. This video is just a good start. Good luck!

       It is all theatre, they are all bad actors. Everything is an inversion, there is no rule of law. They are pirates. They rape children. They poison your food and water. Music, Hollyweird, military industrial complex all one beast. Money is worthless, it's all a giant ponzi scheme. We are free ranged slaves. It is not a coincidence and it is not a mistake: it is on purpose and our entire reality is constructed by psychopaths.

       All of the above. The real power belongs to people who never have to run for office. They are always there.They approve or disapprove of politicians who do run and hold something over each ones head that is used to control what they do and say. You can't even run until  you're approved by these powers that always be.

       The French revolution created a sea change in how the wealthy would manage the peasantry, but it's not at all as you're taught in school. Democracy is a fable. The wealthiest have more power than you can imagine and to keep you ignorant of how much they control your life, we have the facade of elections and representative government.

       At the national level, I'd say it's mostly corrupt. Most politicians are at least partly under the control of the ruling class. Only a tiny handful (Ron and Rand Paul, Bernie Sanders a few years ago), are truly thinking and voting independently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go read/watch videos from Chris Hedges, Ralph Nader, and Noam Chomsky, who all discuss the nature and extent of the corruption. Lawrence Lessig has a great TED talk showing how the elites control primary elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a tight-knight conspiracy. It's basically informal control by a class of elites that probably numbers many thousands, and controls actual POLICY decisions. It doesn't matter that much which team gets elected, it's the policy wonks and think tanks that decide what the elected officials do.

       They spend an enormous amount of time and energy creating a media that tries to convince you that
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Your vote counts when it does not.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        If the supreme court case Bush v Gore didn't do it
       </li>
       <li>
        Then the electoral college will
       </li>
       <li>
        Where electors (like blm), delegates are bought
       </li>
       <li>
        Where superdelegates are bought, and use their powers to warp the elections in various ways (ex: wasserman-shultz)
       </li>
       <li>
        Where there is cheating and vote manipulation in the primaries
       </li>
       <li>
        Where there is collusion and oligarchism in the caucuses and conventions to choose electors that are people that rich people know through a trickle down network.
       </li>
       <li>
        Where media reports realtime results which themselves influence the elections, and sometimes they misreport...
       </li>
       <li>
        Where the president himself breaks all manners and supports the successor candidate, which ought to be illegal since it's well beyond bad form and presents an ethical quandry
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       2) Even if it were democratic elections, the CIA and other players in intelligence have been exposed many times to have gamed, distorted, miscounted by omission of certain groups the votes in many elections at ALL levels.  This has been exposed in the book
       <em>
        Votescam
       </em>
       , but also by other more recent works.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) People like us here have been a personal witness to voting fraud. As an IT expert I was asked by a friend on the georgia grand jury to evaluate the security on a voting database on a diabold voting kiosk.  My assessment was that a 12 yr old could hack it and then get access to all the votes and change them.  It was like microsoft access or jet database or something.  It was lame and made me realize the dearth of competence and security in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       4) These things are a tip of the iceberg..this is elections. The system itself is totally warped by lobbying, which creates oligarchism and a plutocracy.  Alllowing money in politcs is a way to ensure there is no "democracy" of any sort.  Keep in mind, America has never been a democracy but a democratically elected republic, but the electoral college makes that less true. It's too complicated for most people to understand and it's really just a cheap way for the rich to give the illusion of choice to the underclasses.

       It wasn't even about that.  It was about how microsoft itself is so poorly designed that you can open a password-protected access database in another program that doesn't implement the password checking and voila, there's the database.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with a locked-down kiosk mode, you have access to both programs as a poll worker, so you can straight up open the database and flip some votes.  I was able to demonstrate this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's what will really piss you off.  We had open source linux distros widely available then with industrial security on them.  We had centos, and we had mysql database that has MUCH better security than damn access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Access is a toy database that's easy to use.  It's for like lawyers and secretaries or for tracking hundreds and maybe a few thousand clients.  It's an enhanced spreadsheet with a customizable database and easier reportage than excel. It's not appropriate to use in ANY voting situation.   Access can't handle more than say 5000 entries before it has to be 'rebuilt'
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally there is a feature in access that if it fucks up, you can tell it to free up memory.  That's how bad their stupid micorsoft stuff it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now don't get me wrong. I love acces.  It's a good little program that is easy to learn and use but for the governmetn to accept a contract where the deliverable is a microsoft windows 95 in kiosk mode with an access database on it...reveals that they really didn't spend ANY time evaluating ANY other system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It suggests that they've had longstanding and collusive relationships with Diabold, because Johnny's comp parts would have given them a true, locked down, ultrasecure linux machine with a perl based web page frontend to a mysql database that's secured and basically read only with secure admin-only access.
      </p>
      <p>
       In linux it's easy to lock down hardware--just don't do anything and it won't work.  (that's a linux joke on how hard it is to get linux stuff to work.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They'd have done it either for free (just to get future contracts) or at a fraction of the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of government giving crap contracts to their friends who deliver them a wholly unacceptable piece of garbage is why everything is terrible.

       What would you do if you could make yourself infinite money?  Trillions of dollars?  Really take time to think about it, when you're lying in bed maybe, what the ramifications of that would be.  Sure you might buy a fancy house and do some fun things at first, but eventually you'd get more ambitious, eventually you'd realize the need to protect and hide your power.  I bet you could concoct a lot of nefarious schemes.  If you couldn't, you could pay extremely smart people to give you clever ideas, and help you plan and carry out your schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine what a group of "bankers" operating behind the Federal Reserve could do issuing themselves the world's most valuable fiat currency, because that's exactly what has happened over the last century and is happening today.  All their actions are meant to keep and expand the power of their free money (free to them, not to you).  They've basically created a breakaway civilization, living lifestyles you can't ever hope to acheive working at a "job".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say they're completely evil.  Some of their choices have been really positive.  Things could be a LOT worse.  But too many people are being held back by their corrupt system now, too much talent and potential being smothered.  It won't end by their choice, we have to collectively migrate to local currencies and slowly wither away their influence.

       Well, just think of this current election.  You really the people have a choice about Hillary Clinton?  She's been a career politician, and this is just the next step in the establishment selecting the president.  You can see how the media is just a propaganda arm of the current system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is some group of people wearing black cloaks sitting around a table controlling everything.  I just think the government is corrupt and wants to perpetuate itself and grow larger, so they game the system to take more money and power (corrupt FBI, DOJ, DNC rigging primaries, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to fix it is to have enough of We The People wake up and force change.  Too many people believe the media stories, so they are trained to buy the government establishment story in all cases.

       They don't have cloaks but they do meet.   In suits.  At international ngos, at board rooms of large international corporations.   They meet at bohemian grove and have sex with each other.  Then they meet at the CIFR.  Bilderberg conference.  At the UN.  The list goes on.

       Yes there is a conspiracy. The idea that these things are 'emergent properties of a system that has gone insane'  has itself been disproven because we here at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       actually know how to read history, connect the dots and use tools that coincidentarians don't use.  But the people who use our tools are also called police detectives, and we are using that same methodology.  Treating these things like crimes.  Finding means/motive/opportunity, and then building networks.  It's not rocket science.  The failing is the public actually looking at the work we do.  They have cognitive dissonance and willfull blindness from media programming that inhibits them from even looking at our work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The naysayers are a product of their own lack of critical thinking skills, mental rigor and the ability to manage complexity.

      <p>
       So yes we've already figured out 9/11, thousands of times over.  We've looked at the other side of it "what if I'm wrong"....  We've tried to debunk ourselves.  It doesn't work.  It turns out, we're right about 9/11 and we can prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem: prove it to whom? The other guys aren't listening.  They act like they are so far gone you don't care--'15 yrs ago get over it', they say.   No.  We don't get over it and we don't get over JFK.  We want justice. And we'll get it. Or we'll burn this whole ship down in the process.

       The proven lies and false flags are key.   Anyone who would lie to and kill their own citizens,  cover it up,  and maintain the myths would also not hesitate to commit any treason,  criminality,  or corruption.   There is no point trying to differentiate between the political actors and the corporate actors,  they have proven to be interchangeable.

       Whenever you want answers don't look too far or trust words. I mean, am I a robot? What if my account suddenly started spamming "RETURN ERROR: 505". Is it a bot,  am I a chat Ai? Don't laugh, have you ever seen the sub r/subredditsimulator?  It's dedicated to testing out chat algorithms to simulate real online conversations. Imagine pumping infinite funding into something like that, and then quietly launch it on all the subs behind the scenes. Just create an entire AI mesh on the whole site and you can use it to influence the narrative every where and influence their beliefs. That's what our matrix of communication is, I guess. I dunno if you're a bot either.

       That has been demonstrated many times over to be something very easy to do.  Iirc you can get a copy of 2600 magazine and they have a long make-like article on how to make one yourself.  I think badbios and hacking is a sub discussing these kinds of things, could be wrong. It's not a common hangout for me
