       Every single argument I've seen or read from the Flat Earth movement involves oversimplified thought experiments that have nothing to do with real science. "Well imagine if I were spinning on a merry-go-round really fast and...", no. Just no.

       I've spent many hours investigating the question of whether the Earth is convex, concave, of flat, and the evidence still weighs in favor of a bumpy spheroid (i.e. mainstream science).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying mainstream science is right on everything. But the shape of the Earth can and has been measured.

       Sorry but you lose, the Sagnac experiment is absolute proof of the aether and the Michelson &amp; Morley experiment is absolute proof the Earth is not in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the Earth measures flat, tests flat and looks flat. The best evidence and realistically the only evidence you've got is the Coriolis effect and I can blow all sorts of holes in that.

       Sorry but you're a fool, Eratosthenes' experiment proves the Earth is a flat plane with a small Sun circling 3,000 miles overhead. The fact there's two possible interpretations of the experiment is a little fact they like to ignore when claiming the ancients knew it was round.

       As for the shadow on the Moon during an eclipse that's caused by a 3rd celestial object in the sky known as the Black Sun.

       The ancients (modern Greeks not included) all knew the Earth was a flat motionless plane, including the ancient Greeks befor this fascism bullshit.

       Can you provide any proof of the existence of this "3rd celestial object"? Or is it invisible except (conveniently!) for when it causes eclipses?

       You're not interested in the truth or whether there's a massive conspiracy to make everybody believe we're on a spinning ball. You're just interested in baiting me into making celestial arguments where information is limited and chances of me making some loose arguments to fill any gaps in the FE model are great. You're pissing but there's no contest here.

       It's known as a 'Selenelion', both the Sun and the Moon are seen above the horizon during a lunar eclipse. They are rather common, there was one as recently as 2014.

       Eratosthenes' experiment was not designed to prove that the earth is flat or round. This was proven long before Eratosthenes.

       Eratosthenes simply wanted to

       the circumference of the earth, but he already knew it was a sphere from many different proofs.

       The black sun? The theory has too many assumptions. That's not good science, I'm not doubting you, the Earth very well may be flat, or a dome or whatever. But why are all the other planets round, is ours the only flat one? You can use a good set of binoculars and see Jupiter from here, or Venus. How come those planets are round? You can literally see Jupiter rotating on it's axis as one Jupiter day is about 12 hours.

       Look again the other planets aren't spheres. Actually even if they were they would still appear 2d from your perspective so I know you're full of shit.

       There's a video of Carl Sagan out there where he proves the math in Eratosthenes' experiment and shows the Earth can be flat or round. So yes it does, and Carl Sagan can prove it to you mathematically from beyond the grave in a slick video production.

       Flat or round. In the previously mentioned video Sagan chose the absolutely insane and ridiculous idea that the Earth is a spinning ball with an impossibly large Sun 93 million miles away and promoted it as the correct choice.

       Flat basterd, I'm with you.

       I used to think my friend was nuts for pushing flat earth.

      <p>
       Once you realize NASA is deceptive bullshit and you need to be 33rd degree mason to go to space, it all starts to unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all bullshit.

      <p>
       Cheers for getting the truth out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       People, like on this forum, just don't like to admit they have been so grandly deceived. They like to think they are smarter than that. They have been primed their whole life by hearing things like "he probably still thinks the earth is flat" and associating it with the highest levels of stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will never admit when they are wrong. They no longer trust their senses and take the word of NASA, who was caught deceiving too many times to count.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all part of the divide and conquer methodology our rulers follow. In the end, it really doesnt matter if the earth is flat, or an oblate pear shaped spheroid like NDT says. We all live in this deceptive giant biological animal encloser together, might as well get along.

       Ok, I'll bite. What motivation is there to lie about the shape of the earth? Whether it is flat or round is pretty inconsequential to most people in their daily lives is it not? I don't see how it's something worth conspiring about.

       Well... That's the million dollar question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be that they are hiding land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could also be that animals don't act natural when they know they are enclosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be that they want to monopolize space and maybe something is going on up there they don't want us to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they deceive us on "space".
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to know as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know it isn't what they tell us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth wasn't a sphere and we couldn't access space, we wouldn't give billions to space agencies yearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also has some implications in the origins and meaning of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I started looking into this I was a militant atheist... Now it's all up in the air for me. I'm now leaning towards the idea that we live in an advanced biological habitat that could very well be controlled by a more advanced being. The sun definately isn't as far away from us as they would deceive us to believe. The moon is also not as far away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your indoctrinated since kindergarten when you go into class and they have the spinning globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucks that we all have to start fresh with our understanding of where we are and what life is, but now that it's proven that deceivers have taught us everything we know, we have to be skeptical of everything they taught us or tell us going forward.

       You may get downvoted to oblivion but at least you question the mainstream garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people on this forum are grossly uneducated, even in a mainstream brainwashing kind of way. Thus they are incapable of reasoning beyond their programming because they do not possess the intellectual capability to discern lies from truth. I'm not saying you are correct, but at least you are thinking beyond the brainwashing.

       For instance, the bullshit explanation of how rainbows are formed. Traditional physics teaches that light from the sun will actually reflect inside of raindrops three or even four times and come back out in the direction it entered, chromatically abberated. The problem is that a prism can either refract light and split it into its various colors, or reflect it as it is. But it can't do both! Refraction does not just occur at surfaces: it is an interaction with the medium itself. So a raindrop can either receive light on one end and have it exit out dispersed and bent like a prism, or reflect it. But it cannot dispersed it, then reflect this dispersed light twice and have it coming back the direction it entered as Descartes theorized.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this mean? It means rainbows form because the light from the sun is already polarized. It has already been refracted by passing through a glass medium and is merely cast upon raindrops like a projection screen. This explains the dark band between double rainbows as hailing from the Coronis around the sun. Rainbows are literally a projection of the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is literally glass in the sky. Which means globe earth theory is completely invalidated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any trolls have actually read this far, before you downvote, go ahead and ask me for the footage of Hillary Clinton blatantly rubbing it in everyone's faces that there is glass in the sky. You might just learn something.

       From my research the "glass" you refer to is a gold colour oxide coating on a nickel-iron extra-long grain Damascus type steel. This highly reflective surface coats an electrically polarized dome that has a ceiling of about 3,000 miles. Beyond the dome there's evidence of there being almost 100% pure water.

       The glass sky is 100km in altitude. This is why the Schumann resonance, aurora borialis, ionosphere, lightning sprites, and radar reflection all occur at 100km. This is also where the thermosphere begins, because the glass literally traps heat just like a car windshield.

       Be aware of posters saying things like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is a great sub and all, but this is the kind of post that makes
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       look bad".  And then seeing five other comments saying something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes this is true, with a blatantly retarded article posted to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  But sometimes this tactic is used by shills to discredit a post.
      </p>
      <p>
       A specific case happening right now is that CTR shills seem to have broken through and got some traction on the posts about the rigged debate.

       Good note of red flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another red flag is when they trot out the trusty ol' smear "conspiracy theorist," even though the CIA was outed for encouraging their media shills to use it as a weapon, when their 1967 CIA Document 1035-960 entitled "Countering Criticism of the Warren Report" was declassified.

       Media shills have obediently parroted it ever since.

       I'm one of the posters questioning what those image galleries purport to show in the debates. And, I'm guilty of saying what you reference early in your post: essentially, shitty posts bring this sub down. Without derailing the topic of this thread by getting into what's going on in the others, I wanted to say I can understand how my behavior might come off as suspicious to some of the more paranoid folks around here. That said, I really do try to focus on the evidence and not the overall sentiment i.e. I agree that HRC does some shady things but I don't necessarily think everything submitted as evidence on this sub is indicative of her nefarious behavior. It would be great if I could call bullshit if I find something to be bullshit without being characterized as a shill or someone who's trying to push some kind of agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only agenda I have is to think critically and skeptically. My natural reaction is to think about how something might not be true. Isn't that the whole point of this sub? Or is that one too many layers of meta? :) At any rate, I appreciate your point of view on the subject and for my part, I'll do my best to be clearer as to what I am dissenting (content not sentiment) when I submit a controversial opinion.

       The fact that people are downvoting you is amazing to me. It's like if you don't accept 100% of every single conspiracy theory no matter how batshit crazy it gets you're labeled a shill. And if you try to have a discussion to provide more insight like you have here, they don't want to hear any of it just downvote you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been labeled a conspiracy theorist throughout high school and college, I finally find a cool place to actually discuss this stuff and now I'm constantly labeled a shill lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like how in the real world tump supporters think I'm a raging hippie and liberals think I'm an ignorant Ron Paul libertarian. If you're not 100% lock step with how they think you should be you're not one of them, you're an "other", a shill.

       It's nice to know I'm not the only one who's experienced this. I just don't know how the reality so many people here live in is so black and white: you're 100% on board with every issue or you're a shill. I want to keep coming back to this sub because some of the stuff is really interesting. Like that guy who noticed Ted Kaczinski was removed from a Wikipedia description of MK Ultra and that the experiment's name was removed from his Wiki. Interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, with this incursion of rabid Trump supporters, those posts get drowned out by 6 or 7 front page posts about the presidential debates and how HRC is cheating because her podium had a light on and Trump's didn't. It's a shame, really. I know this is likely just temporary while the election season is in full swing but I worry it's going to further demonize a group of skeptics who have already been relegated to the fringes with generalizing, dismissive characterizations of all the subscribers being moon denying, flat-earther-lizard-people-fearing tin foil hatters who stay in their parents' basement all day watching reruns of bigfoot sightings and the JFK assassination and eating cheetos and drinking Monster Energy Drinks.

       This is great. I don't know why you're downvoted. Most anti-Trump talk is based on misinformation, wrong context, or just straight out name calling.

      <p>
       If anyone thinks otherwise, please explain why without simply labeling Trump as crazy or racist or calling his supporters idiots.

       I'm not endorsing Trump with this. I'm just saying the talk about him is extremely irrational.

       I wish I could come to this sub and read about alternative views on science and philosophy and spirituality.
Instead we get sensationalist bullshit politics.
I swear the content used to be better here. there was more depth then a sewerage puddle that we have now.

       I like to call it The Election Infiltration. I just hope that once it's over, subversives will leave, too, but I doubt it. The powers that be are everywhere. It's hard to be free and truth is elusive but it's out there. I think it will go back to conspiracies instead of political corruption but both sides have dogs racing right now and their people are here. Some will stay, most will go. My guess is the pros will stay and continue to spread lies here.

       There arent as many "shills" as you claim. Its the exaggerting paranoia and misleading titles that are undoing the work this sub is trying to accomplish. Everyday there are reasonable people on here who point out the b.s. and everyone is so thinned skinned, and no one wants to be wrong, that it just totally derails any possible conversation or attempts at shedding light on good posts. The good posts in the new qeue get buried because everyone is so freaking paranoid! Like it was pointed out the other day...sometimes we look like babbling mongoloids when this stuff happens.

       Man, this happens to me on this sub with some frequency. It seems like I can't point out inconsistencies or ask questions that don't go along with the general feeling the post was designed to invoke. I've gotten so many accusatory replies that I am starting to wonder what the point of the sub really is. Is it to seriously discuss conspiracies? Because, when I look at some of the highly upvoted posts on the front page, they frequently come off as hurried, shoddy attempts to rouse people to outrage over misunderstandings of information or poorly-cobbled-together internet detective work. Then, if I ask questions in the comments section or try to consider alternative explanations, it's like I've taken a shit in their punch bowl and I get called a shill. It seems extremely difficult to have an objective argument with someone in here these days. Some people seem to feel so passionately about their beliefs that they've effectively insulated themselves from any kind of logical, objective discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said it before in this sub and I'll say it again: the standard for what qualifies as evidence is
       <em>
        so low
       </em>
       for so many in this sub that it shouldn't come as a surprise when we get characterized as tin-foil-hat-wearing flat earthers. I actually almost submitted a meta post about this very issue but decided against it because I didn't want to sift through the multitudinous dismissals of my opinion as that of a "shill."
      </p>
      <p>
       And CHRIST is that word over used now. Shill has taken on so many new definitions. Shill now seems to define anyone who doesn't agree with the masses within a particular thread. Free thinkers, indeed...

       Don't fall for that trap of thinking that they are always obvious.  There are different shills of different skill levels, and they are deployed depending on the importance of the story.  To think that you are smarter than everyone else out there is a failure of imagination.

       Thank you. I'm frequently asking "where's the evidence?" with regards to a lot of topics here, mainly occult, religion, flat/growing/hollow earth. I get called a shill for it. Sorry, I just need evidence before I accept what someone is pushing as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11? Evidence of USG fuckery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Boston, Sandy Hook, and many other events. Same with the election (fuck hillary and trump).
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth? No evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       God told you that everyone else is a demon? Sorry no evidence.

       On the flip side, I also think that people meant to discredit this sub call everyone who disagrees with them a shill. Rustles Jimmies and follows the "hurrdurr r/conspiracy thinks everyone's a shill"

       normal people are unknowingly being recruited as shills, and
       <strong>
        do they feel informed!!
       </strong>
       we're in the age of requiring our responses to be prepackaged for us, where laziness rules, and once we've been told what to say we're convinced the thought was our own. truly scary times to be alive.

       Some idiot called me a CTR shill. I've been posting in

       for years. And am definitely not voting Hillary.

       There are almost certainly shills. But there is also unreasonable paranoia of shilling. It's wasted effort.

      <p>
       I'm of the view - and I get a lot of hate for this - That a conspiracy theory should have evidence. If you, or someone else thinks up a conspiracy without evidence, then don't act surprised when someone dismisses it with or even without any evidence to the contrary.

       But what's the harm with posting bumfluff? It pushes other, evidence based posts down /new and out of sight.

       Please do provide links to this documentation! I've had repeated flat-earthers make this claim, and not one of them has actually been able to back up this claim with evidence.

       The moon is in front of the sun during a solar eclipse, so of course they're both "in the sky together" ...

       In terms of lunar eclipses, you are simply lying.
