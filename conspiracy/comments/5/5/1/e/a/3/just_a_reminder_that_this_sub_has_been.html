<p>Also not sure why you brought up Venus, but here&#39;s a photo I took of a crescent Venus.  I&#39;m not certain you&#39;ll be able to see it unfortunately, as it seems you&#39;re either blind or simply oblivious.  At least one thing is certain, and that is that you&#39;re a liar:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a video of Carl Sagan out there where he proves the math in Eratosthenes&#39; experiment and shows the Earth can be flat or round. So yes it does, and Carl Sagan can prove it to you mathematically from beyond the grave in a slick video production.</p>

<p>Flat or round. In the previously mentioned video Sagan chose the absolutely insane and ridiculous idea that the Earth is a spinning ball with an impossibly large Sun 93 million miles away and promoted it as the correct choice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all bullshit.</p>

<p>Cheers for getting the truth out there.</p>

<p>People, like on this forum, just don&#39;t like to admit they have been so grandly deceived. They like to think they are smarter than that. They have been primed their whole life by hearing things like &quot;he probably still thinks the earth is flat&quot; and associating it with the highest levels of stupidity.</p>

<p>Some people will never admit when they are wrong. They no longer trust their senses and take the word of NASA, who was caught deceiving too many times to count.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all part of the divide and conquer methodology our rulers follow. In the end, it really doesnt matter if the earth is flat, or an oblate pear shaped spheroid like NDT says. We all live in this deceptive giant biological animal encloser together, might as well get along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... That&#39;s the million dollar question.</p>

<p>Could be that they are hiding land.</p>

<p>Could also be that animals don&#39;t act natural when they know they are enclosed.</p>

<p>Could be that they want to monopolize space and maybe something is going on up there they don&#39;t want us to see.</p>

<p>Why do they deceive us on &quot;space&quot;.</p>

<p>I would like to know as well. </p>

<p>I do know it isn&#39;t what they tell us.</p>

<p>If the earth wasn&#39;t a sphere and we couldn&#39;t access space, we wouldn&#39;t give billions to space agencies yearly.</p>

<p>It also has some implications in the origins and meaning of life.</p>

<p>Before I started looking into this I was a militant atheist... Now it&#39;s all up in the air for me. I&#39;m now leaning towards the idea that we live in an advanced biological habitat that could very well be controlled by a more advanced being. The sun definately isn&#39;t as far away from us as they would deceive us to believe. The moon is also not as far away.</p>

<p>Your indoctrinated since kindergarten when you go into class and they have the spinning globe.</p>

<p>Sucks that we all have to start fresh with our understanding of where we are and what life is, but now that it&#39;s proven that deceivers have taught us everything we know, we have to be skeptical of everything they taught us or tell us going forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may get downvoted to oblivion but at least you question the mainstream garbage.</p>

<p>Many people on this forum are grossly uneducated, even in a mainstream brainwashing kind of way. Thus they are incapable of reasoning beyond their programming because they do not possess the intellectual capability to discern lies from truth. I&#39;m not saying you are correct, but at least you are thinking beyond the brainwashing.</p>

<p>For instance, the bullshit explanation of how rainbows are formed. Traditional physics teaches that light from the sun will actually reflect inside of raindrops three or even four times and come back out in the direction it entered, chromatically abberated. The problem is that a prism can either refract light and split it into its various colors, or reflect it as it is. But it can&#39;t do both! Refraction does not just occur at surfaces: it is an interaction with the medium itself. So a raindrop can either receive light on one end and have it exit out dispersed and bent like a prism, or reflect it. But it cannot dispersed it, then reflect this dispersed light twice and have it coming back the direction it entered as Descartes theorized.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means rainbows form because the light from the sun is already polarized. It has already been refracted by passing through a glass medium and is merely cast upon raindrops like a projection screen. This explains the dark band between double rainbows as hailing from the Coronis around the sun. Rainbows are literally a projection of the sun. </p>

<p>So there is literally glass in the sky. Which means globe earth theory is completely invalidated.</p>

<p>If any trolls have actually read this far, before you downvote, go ahead and ask me for the footage of Hillary Clinton blatantly rubbing it in everyone&#39;s faces that there is glass in the sky. You might just learn something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m one of the posters questioning what those image galleries purport to show in the debates. And, I&#39;m guilty of saying what you reference early in your post: essentially, shitty posts bring this sub down. Without derailing the topic of this thread by getting into what&#39;s going on in the others, I wanted to say I can understand how my behavior might come off as suspicious to some of the more paranoid folks around here. That said, I really do try to focus on the evidence and not the overall sentiment i.e. I agree that HRC does some shady things but I don&#39;t necessarily think everything submitted as evidence on this sub is indicative of her nefarious behavior. It would be great if I could call bullshit if I find something to be bullshit without being characterized as a shill or someone who&#39;s trying to push some kind of agenda. </p>

<p>The only agenda I have is to think critically and skeptically. My natural reaction is to think about how something might not be true. Isn&#39;t that the whole point of this sub? Or is that one too many layers of meta? :) At any rate, I appreciate your point of view on the subject and for my part, I&#39;ll do my best to be clearer as to what I am dissenting (content not sentiment) when I submit a controversial opinion.</p>

I just don&#39;t know how the reality so many people here live in is so black and white: you&#39;re 100% on board with every issue or you&#39;re a shill. I want to keep coming back to this sub because some of the stuff is really interesting. Like that guy who noticed Ted Kaczinski was removed from a Wikipedia description of MK Ultra and that the experiment&#39;s name was removed from his Wiki. Interesting stuff. </p>

<p>But, with this incursion of rabid Trump supporters, those posts get drowned out by 6 or 7 front page posts about the presidential debates and how HRC is cheating because her podium had a light on and Trump&#39;s didn&#39;t. It&#39;s a shame, really. I know this is likely just temporary while the election season is in full swing but I worry it&#39;s going to further demonize a group of skeptics who have already been relegated to the fringes with generalizing, dismissive characterizations of all the subscribers being moon denying, flat-earther-lizard-people-fearing tin foil hatters who stay in their parents&#39; basement all day watching reruns of bigfoot sightings and the JFK assassination and eating cheetos and drinking Monster Energy Drinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this happens to me on this sub with some frequency. It seems like I can&#39;t point out inconsistencies or ask questions that don&#39;t go along with the general feeling the post was designed to invoke. I&#39;ve gotten so many accusatory replies that I am starting to wonder what the point of the sub really is. Is it to seriously discuss conspiracies? Because, when I look at some of the highly upvoted posts on the front page, they frequently come off as hurried, shoddy attempts to rouse people to outrage over misunderstandings of information or poorly-cobbled-together internet detective work. Then, if I ask questions in the comments section or try to consider alternative explanations, it&#39;s like I&#39;ve taken a shit in their punch bowl and I get called a shill. It seems extremely difficult to have an objective argument with someone in here these days. Some people seem to feel so passionately about their beliefs that they&#39;ve effectively insulated themselves from any kind of logical, objective discourse. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before in this sub and I&#39;ll say it again: the standard for what qualifies as evidence is <em>so low</em> for so many in this sub that it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise when we get characterized as tin-foil-hat-wearing flat earthers. I actually almost submitted a meta post about this very issue but decided against it because I didn&#39;t want to sift through the multitudinous dismissals of my opinion as that of a &quot;shill.&quot; </p>

<p>And CHRIST is that word over used now. Shill has taken on so many new definitions. Shill now seems to define anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with the masses within a particular thread. Free thinkers, indeed...</p>

<p>9/11? Evidence of USG fuckery.</p>

<p>Same with Boston, Sandy Hook, and many other events. Same with the election (fuck hillary and trump).</p>

<p>Flat earth? No evidence.</p>

<p>God told you that everyone else is a demon? Sorry no evidence.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m of the view - and I get a lot of hate for this - That a conspiracy theory should have evidence. If you, or someone else thinks up a conspiracy without evidence, then don&#39;t act surprised when someone dismisses it with or even without any evidence to the contrary. </p>

<hr/>

<p>But what&#39;s the harm with posting bumfluff? It pushes other, evidence based posts down /new and out of sight. </p>
