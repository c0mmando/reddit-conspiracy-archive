    <div class="md"><p>Welp, the old school regime of using gods to scare people into your political agendas doesn&#39;t work so well in the this modern technology age.  They will need to turn up the anti-christ or christ returning levels to get back control.  They did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ofYRHe1cFM">TNG episode</a> about this.  An alien exploits a plant&#39;s dogma to take over their world via earthquakes, fire and brimstone, etc....  Brilliant strategy, if you can pull it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ is a tool utilized by Jews over the last 2,000 years to destroy Gentile Empires by bringing them under the Jewish yoke.</p>

<p>The Jews have been able to do this by convincing Gentiles that a stick-figure representing Jewish history is a real Man-God whose suffering and death, like the suffering and death of the Jewish people themselves, represented the only hope for Divine intervention in the lives and destinies of the poorly governed Gentile Races.</p>

<p>The problem which Jews have always had in controlled empires hundreds of times more populated that their own obscure tribal insufficiency has been to contain the Gentiles’ exuberance of worship so that it would not interfere with Jewish aims and ideals. To do this, they have invented two major religions—Christianity and Islam—as well as hundreds of socialist centrist-governing camps dedicated to the same aims as the new bastardized proto-Jewish faiths which they have created for our amusement—e.g., communism, socialism, anarchism, the new Democratic Party of the USA, the Republican-Democratic megalith, unionism, media monopolization, banking, world wars, Freudianism, Zionism, the anti-Semitic/anti-majority schemata, the hate misidentification and obscuration industry, courtism (by which Jewish lawyers and judges dish out legislation against the wishes of the majority peoples via court fiat), immigration to destroy the host mass, integration to destroy the host mass, open borders, and the destruction of national will to survive.</p>

<p>To do this, the Jews have had to control the writing and publication of books which most recently translated into the monopoly ownership not only of traditional paper publishing but of other emerging mass media types including film, video, TV, radio, cable, satellite, and internet, all of which are solidly in Jewish ownership hands. Without the control of religion, media, and mass political movements, the Jews would still be insignificant. With the control of these entities in Jewish hands, however, the denizens of all nations are able to act freely, hidden, and sometimes openly to destroy their host masses. In addition, most of the references of knowledge to which non-Jews must research to oppose prevailing ideas are written and controlled by the Judeo-Bolshevik publications owners so that the outcomes of most research assuredly achieve outcomes that are soundly rooted only in Judeo-Bolshevist thoughts.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is the embodiment of Judaism whose entire history is played out and then worshipped in the mythical biography of a fictional religious stick-figure character. His original followers were Judeo-Bolsheviks who sold all of their property, gave it to the central Christian authority, and became a penniless follower of his every whim and order. Anyone not showing complete obedience was removed, but none of his money was ever returned.</p>

<p>There was no Jesus Christ, because both names were prefabricated long after the supposed events surrounding his fictional life. The word &quot;Jesus&quot; means &quot;out of the root of Jesse&quot; and refers to the genealogy of anyone who is related by descent from Jesse, the parental line from which King David of Judah and the North Kingdom of Israel was born and descended. The word &quot;Christ&quot; is Greek, and it means &quot;Messiah.&quot; Christ is a word that would not have been used as the name of the supposed &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; as no citizen of Judah would know its meaning.</p>

<p>The Judeans were engulfed and culturally demolished by the occupation of Roman Legions in their own nation. Their King Herod was a non-Judean who was elevated to power by influence and corruption. Herod’s rule over the Jews and his ascendancy to the leadership of its religion by de facto powers imposed by Rome on his behalf including the Roman treasury of Judean taxation which allowed him to rebuild an imposing Temple in Jerusalem to the dead Judean God, gave him influence and power among the people.</p>

<p>The Judeans themselves, however, were at a loss, because it was Roman power and influence that merely &quot;granted&quot; them the right to worship in what had once been their own country and which was now merely a Roman Province, making them mere provincials where once they held supreme power to rule their nation’s destiny.</p>

<p>Their answer came when Constantine elevated Christianity to the official religion of Rome. This momentous event gave the Judeans mastery over the Roman world as long as they could effectively manipulate the Church and Emperors alike, working each against the other.</p>

<p>Although the Empire and Christianity both considered Jews openly to be outcasts, nonetheless in the background they allowed them to control the currency which regulated all of the economies of the various nations within the Empire, because it had been written into the Bible that only Jews could do this and only for non-Jews. Anyone controlling the currency and banking through which it is funneled is truly the master of those nations.</p>

<p>Since the Bible said the Jews could practice usury only against non-Jews, eventually the Jews, protected from usury, became wealthy and powerful far beyond their numbers, and their hatred of the people of Rome for having destroyed their nation was thus revenged over and over for hundreds of years at their hands which continues to happen in the modern world where Jews still control these nations through banking and their monopoly over currency speculations, banking, securities trading, and other forms of exchange through which they control and profit from all of the channels of trade between Empires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of what you say is true and I can see that you&#39;re highly intelligent. However:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Although the religion of Christianity has long been infiltrated, co-opted and taken over, it originated organically out of the followers of a young preacher named Yeshua ben Yosef.</p></li>
<li><p>His followers posed a threat to the Romans, so after 3 centuries of killing them and seeing more and more rise to take their place, they finally had the brilliant idea to take it over. Constantine.</p></li>
<li><p>The name Jesus means IeSous, which in Greek means Hail Zeus (letter J is only 400 years old). Zeus is non other than &quot;sun god&quot; Ra, the &quot;light bearer&quot; - Lucifer. Satan. Christ means Christos of Helios Kristos fame. Helios of course is also Ra. Jesus Christ is still pronounced Iesous Christos in Russian to this day for instance. Amen means Amon Ra. The people who killed him changed his name to honor their &quot;god.&quot; They did not invent Yeshua, nor the real God.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>People wouldn&#39;t believe the extent we are influenced by outside forces. It goes even into our minds. We all have a foreign installation inside all our minds. It&#39;s been there for thousands of years, tempting us toward a way of life of pure competition, selfishness, survival and fear. The group it comes from feeds on suffering and fear. Thinking and acting in pure competition leads to suffering and fear. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to fall for these temptations, which appear to be our own thoughts. Most people reject them most of the time. Some think the input of the foreign mind is great advice on how to dominate and control others for personal benefit. This is the essence of the dark path, self-serving behavior even at the expense of others.</p>

<p>Others gently nudge us toward behaviors that are within integrity for the whole. They represent the creative force. To create is to build and maintain, to nourish. To live in integrity builds and maintains. It leads toward a virtually unending existence for the whole.</p>

<p>The dark is parasitic and does not produce value. It copies, corrupts, deceives, steals and enslaves. It is destructive and thus more temporary in nature. It seeks to control others while the lighter path seeks to have others control themselves. The dark is less varied and creative and more predictable. The dark controls others dark through understanding of their perceived prospects for gain and loss. The end goal of the ancient darkness, to have us adopt their way of life and be assimilated by their many years of experience in it.</p>

<p>It appears there is a tenuous peace between the two ways. Elder beings from both ways of existence give us their ideas and we freely decide what we will. This is what some see free will as being. Some say this planet is experiencing a controlled interaction between these two ways. </p>

<p>The dark also likes to pretend to be light. It sets us up for failure and then when we fail it capitalizes on our fear and guilt. It poses as God, angels, benevolent ETs, and anything else people trust, so that it can be seen as the legitimate punisher of misdeeds.  This yields great fear and suffering, the food of elder dark beings. You have to know them by the fruit they bear, fear, suffering, subservience, and disintegrity. The lighter path bears fruit of love, joy, self-determination, integrity and self-control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally feel the the &quot;Christ deception&quot; as you call it, which is unrelated to the spiritual heart from which it derives its name and identity, has shifted over the last few hundred years  to a new materialist and science based power structure. This science is both data driven science as a tool and ideological &quot;scientism&quot; as a belief system. The adherents of this belief system ridicule anyone who works to move the locus of authority to the individual&#39;s will and conscience and what these are able to directly connect to using spiritual means. If this fails I guess they could institute the same drift that Christianity underwent of (eventually) allowing people to connect to a spiritual force and then shifting the referent from the experienced spiritual reality to an external system of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may want to check out Peter Levenda&#39;s videos where he discusses &quot;the nine&quot;. I think he goes into it somewhat in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBelUmWuLOE">Secret Space Program</a> video, which is a good intro if you haven&#39;t followed him down his particular rabbit hole before.</p>

<p>&quot;Professionals&quot; are quick to &quot;debunk&quot; them as glyphs inscribed over other glyphs to kind of whitewash the amazing find.</p>

<p>These same professionals deny previous past advanced civilizations so I believe their credibility goes out the window. </p>

<p>As always, wildly speculative theories of how these happen to have come about are allowed to stand as fact on Wikipedia as long as they are in service of the linear progress status quo materialist narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed :)</p>

<p>Also look into Egyptians in the grand canyon. Some guy figured out the &quot;monuments&quot; are ancient temples and just as the Giza pyramids align with Orion&#39;s belt, the monuments of the grand canyon in North America align perfectly with the stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s beyond me how anyone believes in religion these days. If everyone snapped out of it before the alien deception then we might be fine but I fear it&#39;s coming soon though. The election in the US is chaotic for a reason. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if we can blame believers though because I&#39;ve heard many times that its directly correlated to intelligence. Dumb people just can&#39;t imagine their precious religions being a control mechanism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep :(</p>

<p>They get insulted. On top of that, there are people that claim they are &quot;woke&quot; yet believe &quot;revelations&quot; to be the word of God. This also creates a weak person. They are so amazed that revelations and end times are coming without realizing it&#39;s all manufactured and has been for thousands of years.</p>
