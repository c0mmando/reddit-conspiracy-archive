<p>This is far from the only thing NASA have faked/lied about. The deception is on a grand scale and the evidence is overwhelming. I highly recommend that people research it for themselves.</p>

<p>Ask yourselves - if NASA would fake such an important event of human history, then what else have they lied about? The answer to that question becomes obvious when you just look for yourself. </p>

<p>This is one of the conspiracies that TPTB really <strong>don&#39;t</strong> want people looking into.....</p>

<p>Remember: It was all the imported Nazi scientists that got NASA off the ground. I surely don&#39;t know for sure, but I sometimes wonder if the root of America&#39;s cancer can be traced to NASA, most specifically it&#39;s threads back into the Pentagon.</p>

<p>All the weird shit starts happening around 1945-47. Nukes go off, Roswell &amp; other UFO sightings take off, Dead Sea Scrolls discovered, CIA, U.N. &amp; Israel all formed; more too, if you Google.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s the root of all the deception about our origins and the world we live in. This just might be the mother of all conspiracies. The indoctrination is incredibly clever and they teach NASA&#39;s lies to children in schools so there is a knee-jerk reaction of dismissal and ridicule to anybody who is critical of the glaringly obvious contradictions in what we have been brainwashed into believing. </p>

<p>This rabbit hole goes deep. </p>

<p>Care to expand on this? I understand the political motivation to fake the moon landing given the context, but what else has NASA done since then? I&#39;ll agree with you that NASA is an incredibly powerful R&amp;D tool that has the potential to be abused, but to insist that the institution itself lies to the public about its discoveries seems a bit ignorant to me... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believing NASA in regards to what? Their involvement with the military? Sure, I&#39;ll take that human element of the equation with a grain of salt, as should we all. </p>

<p>If youre questioning the strides they&#39;ve made towards space exploration and understanding our place the universe, I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s resulting from a glib understanding of physics in general. I cant say I&#39;ve swallowed up anything they&#39;ve published without asking 10 more questions, and guess what, they have 10 answers for me that all make sense according to physics. Every Time. Not to mention 100 more questions that not even they can answer yet. A large portion of the things NASA does are first theorized by physicists, searched for, and then directly observed and studied further. Its hard to fake that when you have millions of young/amateur scientists trying to make their mark in the scientific community. Unless you want to believe they are all in on it too, I guess.</p>

<p>But after watching I&#39;m not convinced. I think the first part of the space race was real and that men can be in lower orbit. But then US faked the moon landings and made some deals with Russia so they would keep silent </p>

<blockquote>
<p>microasteroids etc. </p>

<p>By the mid-60s, unmanned lunar probe missions were mostly successful.  You&#39;ll see that from 1964-1968 only two US probes failed. 16 succeeded. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>probably mostly because of frequent microasteroids</p>

<p>The two that failed in that period failed because they crashed into the moon.</p>

<p>Most of the earlier probes either failed to reach orbit (usually blew up on the launch pad) or missed the moon and contact was lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how come 6 out of 7 moon missions was successful and not a single life lost? </p>

<p>Because they spent a lot of time and money figuring it out. Those two failed apollo missions nonwithstanding.</p>

<p>Why? Their exposure was limited. </p>

<p>I like how anyone who disagree with you is a shill, but you&#39;re completely unable to actually explain why other than diverting to childishness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all but a lot of the theories presented in the documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085910/">Room 237</a> align with what you&#39;re speaking of. The amount of moon/apollo mission/occult symbolic things in The Shining is undeniable once you see it. Even the cover on the IMDB page is a shot that has to do with the moon landing being faked if I remember right.</p>

<p>That doc is on Netflix if you want to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. A few weeks ago I would have laughed at claims of moon landing fakery . Then I read Wagging the moondoggie because a friend says it was funny. But when you fact check it becomes evident.
