       A free and autonomous world where everyone gets their necessities met and free to pursue their passions? Nobody is under control of anybody anymore.

       Is that what they are afraid of? Losing power? Losing wealth differences? Losing class? Why can't they just live along everyone else in a happy world? Ruling and enslaving give them happiness? Why not sharing and cooperating?

       They're afraid of the people learning the truth about our spiritual nature and origins. Nobody would be slaving away for money if they knew the truth, and the invisible prison we are all enslaved into would crumble along with all their power structures.

       I think a mass awakening has already started and the political corruption being exposed is just the veil lifting. This is the beginning of a turning point in mankind and I think TPTB know this.

       ^ Seconded. Dunno if all, but there are a lot of pedophiles and rapists and incestuous freaks (and incestuous pedophile rapists) who would not be able to enjoy the fruits of corrupt leadership if they shared the stage with those they presume to be lesser mortals.

       They're afraid of their slaves finally saying, "No." .....and God DAMN, that would be the easiest thing for us to do. Really. It would take..........literally........nothing. Absolutely no effort. Collectively, we would say, "Things are going to change." They would say, "No." ....then we say, "Okay. We're boycotting EVERYTHING and staying home. Talk to you tomorrow." .....next day comes, "Things are GOING to change." "...no." "Okay. We're boycotting EVERYTHING and staying home. Talk to you tomorrow." ...........GET IT? IT WOULD TAKE LESS THAN A WEEK TO CHANGE THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. AND IT WOULD TAKE EXACTLY "NO EFFORT". WOW. CRAZY, RIGHT???

       In a way, they are all enslaved.  Some just figuratively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, everyone who is not the primary figurehead either reaches a point where they can be fully exploited (submitting to a dominating force, usually through blackmail), or hovers in proximity to the actual moving parts as a more expendable and less dependable "agent".
      </p>
      <p>
       How each individual comes to be a pawn, or something higher (never the king), is through a display of loyalty or what I would call a
       <em>
        willful descent
       </em>
       .  Those who choose the fall and even speed it along with their own efforts are given higher positions but, again, going back to the blackmail aspect, this is where you see some really weird, dark evil stuff way up at the higher tier levels of the self-selected elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, people are fuck-ups because they have stupefying desires.  They end up making mistakes, usually some potential sex scandal at the lower level of politics, which puts them under the power of someone above them, working this way up the pyramid until there's that weird disconnect (look at your money) I just mentioned about the fall and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could look at that disconnect like an event horizon.  Once you're past that point, there's really no going back, and at that point you're probably not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       doing whatever you're told without question, but you're actively trying to work your way up the ranks as quickly as possible, perhaps even thinking that there's going to be something waiting on the other side of death that could require good favoring in an evil sort of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pyramid of slaves who have all willingly chained and locked themselves into the service of something really horrible, with a subset of them being the "favored" for having done so with both prior knowledge and with consent for the "consequences" of what that really means for them in a universal, karmic sort of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "agents" I mentioned are basically anyone who can't be exploited but still serve as a useful channel for doing what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who isn't usable is basically an enemy to this network to whatever degree they actively resist its efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think: Stars in the grand theft auto games.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, Michael Hastings probably was at about
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oShTJ90fC34">
        four stars
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL,DR:
       </strong>
       They're being controlled by their own desires (themselves), by someone else, by some
       <em>
        thing
       </em>
       else, or some combination therefrom.

       The sole form of emotional gratification that is available to psychopaths, is the ability to view themselves as superior to others; and for that they need material difference to exist between themselves and others, which they can then use as justification.  Egalitarianism means the end of that.

       They fear being treated like everyone else. When they lose their money or are going to be locked up, many of them commit suicide. As far as why they do the things they do, I am convinced they get sexual gratification from making people suffer and die.
