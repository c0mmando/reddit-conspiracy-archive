<p>I think a mass awakening has already started and the political corruption being exposed is just the veil lifting. This is the beginning of a turning point in mankind and I think TPTB know this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way, they are all enslaved.  Some just figuratively.</p>

<p>Ultimately, everyone who is not the primary figurehead either reaches a point where they can be fully exploited (submitting to a dominating force, usually through blackmail), or hovers in proximity to the actual moving parts as a more expendable and less dependable &quot;agent&quot;.</p>

<p>How each individual comes to be a pawn, or something higher (never the king), is through a display of loyalty or what I would call a <em>willful descent</em>.  Those who choose the fall and even speed it along with their own efforts are given higher positions but, again, going back to the blackmail aspect, this is where you see some really weird, dark evil stuff way up at the higher tier levels of the self-selected elite.</p>

<p>Basically, people are fuck-ups because they have stupefying desires.  They end up making mistakes, usually some potential sex scandal at the lower level of politics, which puts them under the power of someone above them, working this way up the pyramid until there&#39;s that weird disconnect (look at your money) I just mentioned about the fall and all that.</p>

<p>You could look at that disconnect like an event horizon.  Once you&#39;re past that point, there&#39;s really no going back, and at that point you&#39;re probably not <em>just</em> doing whatever you&#39;re told without question, but you&#39;re actively trying to work your way up the ranks as quickly as possible, perhaps even thinking that there&#39;s going to be something waiting on the other side of death that could require good favoring in an evil sort of sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pyramid of slaves who have all willingly chained and locked themselves into the service of something really horrible, with a subset of them being the &quot;favored&quot; for having done so with both prior knowledge and with consent for the &quot;consequences&quot; of what that really means for them in a universal, karmic sort of sense.</p>

<p>The &quot;agents&quot; I mentioned are basically anyone who can&#39;t be exploited but still serve as a useful channel for doing what they want.</p>

<p>Anyone who isn&#39;t usable is basically an enemy to this network to whatever degree they actively resist its efforts.  </p>

<p>Think: Stars in the grand theft auto games.</p>

<p>For instance, Michael Hastings probably was at about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oShTJ90fC34">four stars</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TL,DR:</strong> They&#39;re being controlled by their own desires (themselves), by someone else, by some<em>thing</em> else, or some combination therefrom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being elite.</p>

<p>The sole form of emotional gratification that is available to psychopaths, is the ability to view themselves as superior to others; and for that they need material difference to exist between themselves and others, which they can then use as justification.  Egalitarianism means the end of that.</p>
