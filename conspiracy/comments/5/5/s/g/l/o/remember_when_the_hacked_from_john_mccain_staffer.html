    <div class="md"><p>This is some OC I did a while back about these beheadings:</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to leave out the AJWS connection to this too! Here is an old post about these &quot;beheadings&quot; I made a long time ago:</p>

<p>I was just researching this Steven Sotloff.</p>

<p>His father is a ghost. His name is Arthur Sotloff. He appeared to found Arthur Sotloff Enterprises in the early 80s out of his home. I can find no mention of what it was that he actually did for employment. Be assured though that Arthur was making big enough money to send Steven to a ritzy private school in New Hampshire called Kimball Union Academy which has a current annual tuition of over $50k.</p>

<p>The girl who has been coming out talking about Steven is named Danielle Berrin. <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/03/two-huge-secrets-about-steven-sotloffs-life-and-faith-emerge-after-his-execution">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/03/two-huge-secrets-about-steven-sotloffs-life-and-faith-emerge-after-his-execution</a></p>

<p>Danielle Berrin, who writes for the Los Angeles Jewish Journal, knew Sotloff since first grade and had corresponded with him in recent years.</p>

<p>She is is @hollywoodjew on twitter. She published this article on August 25th talking about how great zionism is and how thankful that the jews in hollywood stick up for Israel. <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/for_hollywood_protest_letters_are_the_new_black">http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/for_hollywood_protest_letters_are_the_new_black</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;it&#39;s comforting to know that at least 200 Hollywood leaders care about Israel&#39;s welfare. But the Zionist hero of the summer is Kavanaugh, grandchild of Holocaust survivors, who didnâ€™t require groupthink to use his mind.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&#39;s deal with Danielle Berrin for now. She is vouching for Steven. She may well know him, but I haven&#39;t seen any pictures or evidence of a friendship or that she has been contacting him as she has claimed. Furthermore, we don&#39;t really know the nature of what they would talk about.</p>

<p>The connection we have is that she works with the American Jewish World Service. <a href="http://ajws.org/what_we_do/service_and_travel_opportunities/global_justice_fellowship/los_angeles/2013_bios/danielle_berrin.html">http://ajws.org/what_we_do/service_and_travel_opportunities/global_justice_fellowship/los_angeles/2013_bios/danielle_berrin.html</a></p>

<p>This was an organization founded by Ruth Messinger. <a href="http://ajws.org/who_we_are/executive_team/ruth_messinger.html">http://ajws.org/who_we_are/executive_team/ruth_messinger.html</a></p>

<p>She had Nick Berg, the original man to be &quot;beheaded&quot;, to her home shortly before he left for Israel, then Iraq! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/us/a-family-tries-to-remember-a-son-killed-in-iraq-and-his-style.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/us/a-family-tries-to-remember-a-son-killed-in-iraq-and-his-style.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ms. Messinger, who opened her home to Mr. Berg and other volunteers for a gathering last summer, said that much of Mr. Berg&#39;s work with the service stemmed from a desire to get closer to his Jewish heritage, particularly the Hebrew concept of &#39;&#39;Tikkun Olam&#39;&#39; or helping to heal or repair the world.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is it that this zionist organization is so close to two people who were &quot;randomly&quot; captured and &quot;beheaded&quot;?</p>

<p>We have to further the question with the evidence of Nick Berg&#39;s &quot;random encounter&quot; with the terrorist named Moussaoui. We are supposed to believe he let this guy borrow his computer on a bus to check his email? We are supposed to further believe that this guy had wifi/satellite back in the 90s/early 2000s on a bus? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/">http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At one point during the bus ride, Berg said, the man sitting next to his son asked if he could use Nick&#39;s laptop computer. &quot;It turned out this guy was a terrorist and that he, you know, used my son&#39;s e-mail, amongst many other people&#39;s e-mail who he did the same thing to,&quot; Berg said.</p>

<p>Government sources said Berg gave the man his password, which was later used by Moussaoui, the sources said.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean seriously.... how much &quot;random coincidence&quot; hyperbole are we supposed to believe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah- That&#39;s what we&#39;ve all been using so far to keep this information intact- Our noggins spread far and wide. </p>

<p>I guess what I meant to say is that taking the information out of everyone&#39;s noggins and reorganizing it is the only way the bigger picture will reveal itself- and when a whole community contributes to the process, it will reveal itself that much faster. </p>

<p>Also, in my opinion, organizing those thoughts with pictures and visuals helps the effort even more so! I guess I wondered if there was any useful tools out there that we could use. </p>

<p>or if you really want to do it right, use <a href="https://freenetproject.org/"><em>freenet</em></a> a cross platform (java) censorship-resistant crypto darknet for use by journalists but is also used by pedos.  The fact it&#39;s used by pedos and satanic snuff peddlers (politicians/intelligence agency/clergy/royalty/athletic coaches) is how you know it not only works, but it won&#39;t be going away any time soon.</p>
