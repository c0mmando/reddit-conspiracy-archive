    <div class="md"><p>As a Canadian, all I hear on the radio and news is how evil trump is for wanting to tighten the border but Hillary gets a free pass on all her evil which, pardon the pun, trumps Donald.</p>

<p>I listen to the radio every morning and try to get past all the morning talk garbage from these old liberals on my classic rock stations (K97 in Edmonton) and I can&#39;t escape it. It&#39;s just one anti-trump joke after another and they aren&#39;t even funny. And it&#39;s every radio station because liberals tend to dominate broadcasting.</p>

<p>I turn on the news and it&#39;s some fluff piece about how Trump is a racist or says something stupid while Hillary is completely ignored or praised for nothing more than being with vagina.</p>

<p>Honestly, I just hope Trump wins, not because he&#39;s a good prospect, but because it will devastate all these uneducated, hippy know-it-alls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a weird thought I had about Trump.</p>

<p>Look at regular people (not born rich) who win the lottery and the children of rich people, both groups have a pretty high probability of losing their shit to money, getting drug addicted and ruining the potential future that easy access to money affords.</p>

<p>Trump could be a billionaire drug addicted bachelor forever if he wanted to, he could have done that easy.  His brother did do that. </p>

<p>So all this talk about handling responsibilities like the dreaded nuke button that doesn&#39;t really exist, is ridiculous.  He has already handled more responsibility when nobody is watching, than most of us will ever wield.  He HAS done good things for his communities, when he had no political point to win.  He isn&#39;t going to be driven mad by power or he would have already done it.</p>

<p>Why do all these liberals think that he suddenly won&#39;t be able to handle having power?  It&#39;s absurd.</p>

<p>Clinton on the other hand has had power already and misused it, abused it, been driven mad by it.  Why is she suddenly the Savior, that can keep the country out of the wrong hands.  She is proven to be the wrong hands...</p>

<p>It makes no God damn sense.</p>

<p>So Trump is mouthy, he says shit and doesn&#39;t drone on and on like a highly polished public servant.  He sounds like a dude at the pub, but he knows how high society &quot;ruling class&quot; shit works.</p>

<p>Fuck it, Trump is the better man for the job.  There is no doubt in my mind.</p>

<p>If anyone on the Republican ticket worries me it&#39;s Pence who has had to kiss ass all the way to the top.  How many favors does he owe? And to who?</p>

<p>Kaine on the other hand is balls deep in the DNC politician factory... Fuck everything about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow Canadian, thought in Alberta it&#39;d be a lil more conservative on the radio (but I guess Hillary is fairly conservative)... out on the west coast it&#39;s pretty much the same, although we&#39;re all NDP out here so there&#39;s also a lot of lamenting on &#39;what could have been&#39; with Bernie... you done screwed up &#39;merica!
I can&#39;t hope for a trump presidency, even if it meant the whole charade might implode around him... it&#39;d be devastating to us all. Nope, vote for that evil bitch Hilary Americans! Get some slow progress, at least on social issues, get those women&#39;s rights forwarded, get some centerist judges on the court instead of some batshit right wingers trump would install, and just try to block her from taking you to war... I seriously think it&#39;ll be tough.
And I know she doesn&#39;t do press conferences and only takes scripted questions, but can someone just get her to say &quot;if I&#39;m president, ttp will not happen. I promise&quot; because none of us believe her.</p>

<p>How? America is already devastating to the planet and has been under both D and R presidents for a long long time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Social issues? You mean that worthless fluff that she uses to reel in the minority votes? She&#39;s a warmonger and responsible for countless deaths. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less about gays, feminists, retards, immigrants and welfare addicts at this point. They contribute to the weakness/decay of society and do nothing but elect career politicians who exploit them for votes.</p>

<p>There are real problems out there and they need to be solved. Maybe you should start thinking about the democracy and not the malcontents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there is some truth to this, Hannibal&#39;s ultimate defeat was brought about by his own people&#39;s weakness for luxury, wealth, and ease as much as by the Roman refusal to surrender after Cannae. There is no doubt, as Bradford also notes, that had Hannibal &quot;been fighting against any other nation in the ancient world...his overwhelming victories would have brought them to their knees and to an early capitulation&quot; (210) but the cause of Hannibal&#39;s defeat was just as much the fault of the Carthaginian elite who refused to support the general and his troops who were fighting for their cause. No records exist of  Carthage awarding Hannibal any recognition for his service in Italy and he was honored more by Scipio&#39;s pardon and defense than by any actions on the part of his country. Even so, he continued to do his best for his people throughout his life and remained true to the vow he had taken when young; to the end, he remained an enemy of Rome and his name would be remembered as Rome&#39;s greatest adversary for generations - and even to the present day. </p>

<p>I just read yesterday on Twitter that the US will move 1600 (!) military vehicles to The Netherlands due to tensions in Europe.</p>

<p>The whole reporting on Syria is extremely one-sided. We&#39;re being told that both Assad and Russia are very evil, very bad people. At the same time the USA supports Al Qaeda (through Al Nusra) in Syria. Most of the &#39;rebel&#39; groups in Syria seem to be formed from people from outside Syria and as such this should not really be called a civil war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s . . . bigotry?</p>

<p>The man who sued to get blacks and Jews into his club is a &quot;bigot&quot;?</p>

<p>The man who flew a sick Jewish child to a hospital (when all the commercial airlines refused him, due to his cumbersome equipment) is a . . . bigot?</p>

<p>As a Hispanic, I decided to vote for Trump when I saw an article on his outrage about the H1-J visa program, where foreign youths were given access to business and political leaders as interns to help give them a leg up in the job market. Trump said, &quot; Why aren&#39;t these positions being given to our inner city kids?&quot;</p>

<p>Hardly the statement you&#39;d expect to be coming from a &quot;bigot&quot;.</p>

<p>Trump is a nationalist, not a racist.</p>

<p>The irony of the Trump-is-a-racist canard is that its proponents are holding up Hillary Clinton as a foil. The only problem? </p>

<p>She&#39;s got a long and well-documented history of racism that dwarfs anything Trump ever did or said. See a list of her gems here: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/g4GvnI.png">https://i.sli.mg/g4GvnI.png</a></p>

<p>Watch her (in her own words) call Gandhi a gas-station attendant: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1Mq8kOXV_E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1Mq8kOXV_E</a></p>

<p>Just a few months ago, she made a &quot;colored people time&quot; joke on stage with Bill DeBlasio: <a href="http://www.greaterunderstanding.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BILL_DE_BLASIO_HILLARY_CLINTON_CP_TIME_RACIST_COLORED_PEOPLE-400x242.jpg">http://www.greaterunderstanding.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BILL_DE_BLASIO_HILLARY_CLINTON_CP_TIME_RACIST_COLORED_PEOPLE-400x242.jpg</a></p>

<p>Watch college students here, freaked out that quotes they assumed came from Donald Trump <em>actually</em> came from Hillary Clinton: <a href="http://redalertpolitics.com/2016/06/22/millennials-shocked-racist-hillary-quotes-think-theyre-trump-video/">http://redalertpolitics.com/2016/06/22/millennials-shocked-racist-hillary-quotes-think-theyre-trump-video/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>For extra credit, watch Hillary try and condescend to blacks by telling them that she carries hot sauce in her purse: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q29F1jPvNk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q29F1jPvNk</a> And this, my friends, is why the media has a 6% approval rating. The people see the gross disparity in treatment between Hillary Clinton&#39;s real racism--and Donald Trump&#39;s nationalism. They&#39;re smart enough to know the distinction. And they&#39;re bright enough to know that, if the shoe was on the other foot, the media wouldn&#39;t be suppressing it [like they are for Hillary]. It would be wall-to-wall coverage if Trump had made a &quot;colored people time&quot; joke, or called Gandhi a gas station attendant. That&#39;s why Saturday Night Live&#39;s recent satire of the debate was so off-key. It tried to paint Trump as a racist, and Hillary as this classy non-racist--when the record couldn&#39;t be more clear. (When Leftists are losing an argument, the first tool they lunge for is the word &quot;racist&quot;. The sad fact is: In this campaign, they use it at their own peril, given the rich and well-documented racist history of their standard-bearer.) So their painting of the privileged, entitled, minority-hating Mrs. Clinton as a &quot;classy sophisticate&quot; falls flat. Classy sophisticates don&#39;t make &quot;colored-people time jokes&quot; or engage in backslapping saws about Gandhi being a gas-station attendant. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13238893_10208317908318222_6398942136814873933_n.jpg">http://www.snopes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13238893_10208317908318222_6398942136814873933_n.jpg</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I try to mention this to people as often as possible, the part about Trump not actually getting stuff done because of the strong opposition from both parties, but I&#39;m told it&#39;s shortsighted or that I&#39;m supporting bigotry (I&#39;m latino, so I basically get the &quot;Tio Tomas&quot; replies or that I&#39;m not latino enough). </p>

<p>The evil (corruption, propaganda, warmongering, globalism) Clinton pushes is so much worse, but it gets a pass because she&#39;s built such a strong network of connections (minority outreach, big donors, media, etc.). I&#39;m truly saddened. This year has really opened my eyes to how this country is run. I&#39;m glad I realized however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda is a real thing. Were actually pretty lucky we live in a time that it is exposed with clear evidence. What i do is show my peers the obvious corrupted media channels (all of them) so they can open their eyes and not let the media tell them what to think. This is possibly a good thing because now there is no dispute its happening, and will hopefully lead to more people to never trust big media again.</p>

And yet top news are trumps tax returns and not a whisper of the clinton foundation.  But nothing will change, still on a path of destruction, only venting on a great subreddit but part of the bigger corporate  entity. Organization is key </p>

<p>I just want a totally unbiased news source and it seems absolutely insane that you cannot find one. The Unfilter podcast is my go to for news because they actually call out <em>everyone</em> on their bullshit. </p>

<p>I used to listen to to NPR but I can&#39;t stand it anymore, except for Car Talk anyway. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no place to just get information on what&#39;s happening. Everything has a slant, preference, agenda, bias. It&#39;s mind boggling how much editorializing happens. </p>

<p>If Neil Postman were still alive today he could write an amazing follow-up to Amusing Ourselves to Death, not pointing out how TV <em>might</em> destroy public discourse but how it absolutely <em>has</em> destroyed it. It&#39;s all propaganda now. Telling us how we should think and feel instead of telling us the facts and letting us sort it out. It&#39;s sickening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t help but feel that Trump is the heel to Clinton&#39;s face. He&#39;s just ensuring that she wins. People assumed he&#39;d become more tame and center as the election progressed, and he hasn&#39;t changed at all. </p>

<p>Combine that with the fact that if he really were anti-establishment and a real threat, like say Ron Paul or Bernie Sanders, the media wouldn&#39;t cover him. 
It doesn&#39;t matter what he says, the media doesn&#39;t have any obligation to cover it- they control everything, so there&#39;s a reason he&#39;s had so much coverage, and subsequent popularity and success with the voters. Like he&#39;s being pushed on us. </p>

<p>I think Hillary will win, and I think the race is just a facade to maintain face, and to trick people into voting against their best interests.</p>

The Donald will be able to sign lots of really bad legislation because he will not be acting president just signing the required papers.  Little George was just acting like a president, Cheney had the power, the same will be true of the Donald.

    <div class="md"><p>A billionaire real estate mogul who has cozied up to politicians for years, has repeatedly been in bed with major networks to make money on pop entertainment, has often been a lobbyist, and who has had business dealings with other members of the elite class over the course of decades is pretty much the <em>definition</em> of &quot;the Establishment.&quot;</p>

<p>He releases books for major publishers, has his name on Manhattan buildings, has a long history of dinner and golf outings with people like the Clintons. The idea that he&#39;s anything <em>but</em> establishment is hilarious.</p>
