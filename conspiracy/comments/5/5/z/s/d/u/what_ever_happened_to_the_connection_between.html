<p>Apparently he was invited by the DNC and he&#39;s a member, but Hillary&#39;s staff denies it.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the president of Afghanistan. We went there on a false premise, spent billions $$$ and lost lives. His son committed the worst single act of terrorism on U.S. soil. Yet here he is, DNC member, pushing for Clinton as president. Fucking creeeeepy.</p>

<p>100%. I&#39;m guessing, but I think it&#39;s a good guess because if you consider these high ranking politicians have multiple security personnel around them at all of their planned public appearances, and don&#39;t forget we&#39;re talking Clinton here, then it would make sense the security personnel would have vetted everyone in her immediate vicinity, and would have kept a tight barrier between her inner circle and the public guests.</p>

<p>One does not simply go from nutty ass Youtuber and self-proclaimed president of Afghanistan, to father of a mass shooting ISIS terrorist, to insider at a Clinton rally. Not all in one life anyway. His mere relationship with Omar Mateen and devotion to radical foreign ideologies should have prompted security to keep him very far away from Clinton that day; so far away he&#39;s not even in the same state. But haven&#39;t you heard? Seddique Mateen is America&#39;s best pal!!!</p>

<p>Smells fuckin&#39; fishy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Omar Mateen - homosexual, mass murderer, America&#39;s worst enemy</li>
<li>Seddique Mateen - nutter, father of mass murderer, America&#39;s best friend</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did I say that? Pulse is already the topic at hand. The point I was trying to make with the terrorist statement was that if what the media said is true - his son committed the worst single act of terrorism on U.S. soil - then how is it that we just allow his father into our country at all, let alone sitting right behind Hillary Clinton, let alone allow him to say whatever he wants in the media to clear his conscience or whatever. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Shouldn&#39;t Seddique be in jail or at least heavily questioned and then kicked out of the U.S.? I don&#39;t get it, the father of a guy who killed Americans is our best friend?</p>

<p>And for the record I think both Sandy Hook and Pulse shootings were probably false flags. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;terror&quot; didn&#39;t happen those days. Terror happened. People were terrified. It also doesn&#39;t mean people weren&#39;t injured or killed. There are autopsy reports for 18 of the Pulse shooting victims.</p>

<p>But I do not think it was an ISIS terrorist who committed the massacre. No, let me correct myself. I do not think it was a Muslim terrorist, radicalized over the internet, who committed the massacre. The reason for that correction is I think it may still have been related to ISIS terrorism, but not in the pre-programmed spoonfed way. If you consider the U.S. is backing ISIS (which reports are suggesting), then you could also consider the Pulse shooting was a black op, outsourced by the U.S. to British contractor G4S, to get us hating ISIS some more, and they used Omar as their Muslim patsy, and the terror operation may have even been secret to Omar himself. He probably just thought he was on guard duty there. That is what G4S hired him for. His autopsy found blunt force trauma and no explanation for it. Maybe he fought for his life at some point against the true aggressors, but couldn&#39;t escape his patsy fate. Whoever orchestrated the Pulse shooting, if they did, are the real ISIS terrorists and they aren&#39;t Muslim nor did come from the Middle East.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the idea is to simultaneously demonize islamic terrorism and embrace mass immigration and diversity. It sounds contradictory because it is. I think they use terrorism as a their best fear mongering tool. They don&#39;t have much else these days. people just brush them off too easily.</p>

<p>Inviting his dad is open rejection of racism/islamaphobia showing we are a great nation. All that SJW hog wash. Its an election year why wouldn&#39;t they invite him?</p>

<p>I can think of several reasons why not to invite him, but only one reason why they would - to fuck with us. His son killed my fellow Americans, according to the official story. That earns his father a kick in the ass outta here. It&#39;s not racism or Islamophobia when you&#39;re just kicking one guy out. I get what you&#39;re saying though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying it serves dualistic purposes to dems and globalists. If there were more people awake we could stop it. I accepted everything put forth as truth only one year ago. Got r/redpilled then started looking around at what else wasn&#39;t true through alt right viewpoints and this sub. Probably the best thing we can do is keeping the internet unregulated and fighting back against braindead SJW&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 50 autopsy reports, but I don&#39;t know where they are. They used to be easy to find online, and I regret not downloading them when I saw them.</p>

<p>Did you see that of his 8 bullet wounds, there were only 2 that were straight on? For the others he was shot through the bottom of his feet three times, in the back of the leg, vertically through the middle of his chest and out the neck, and through the top of his head.</p>

<p>Whatever happened he wasn&#39;t killed in a final shootout like it was said. I don&#39;t know if he was pre selected to be a patsy or if he just happened to be there and they took 3 hours to find someone to be a patsy.</p>

<p>I used to think Sandy Hook was entirely fake, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense. Despite everyone&#39;s best efforts nobody has proved the school was closed, or that any of the victims are still alive.</p>

<p>What&#39;s disturbing and makes it more confusing is that there is deliberate disinformation. Somehow Peekay the &quot;alt media&quot; Youtube channel finds a link that &quot;proves&quot; Pulse was closed. I know it wasn&#39;t, there&#39;s video of people at the club that night.</p>
