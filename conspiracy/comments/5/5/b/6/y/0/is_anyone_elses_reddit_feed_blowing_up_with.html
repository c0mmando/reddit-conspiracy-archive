<p>The hearings going on in congress regarding her email scandal has shed light on how corrupt the DoJ is and how complacent the FBI has been with the powers that be in Washington; Trumps campaign caught fire for good reason; he has numerous flaws but I think most Americans just want someone who can&#39;t be bought...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a real shame Bernie got treated the way he did &amp;, imo, Democrat voters should not stand for it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we talking about the leaked audio of what sounds like a speech given at a fundraiser where she says a part of Sanders&#39; supporters are millennials who feel they&#39;ve been cheated by the system and didn&#39;t get the jobs they thought they would and live in their parents&#39; basements? If so, I really fail to see how anything she said on there is inflammatory in any way...</p>

<p>I hate the bitch and that whole &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy&quot; defense, but in this particular case the flak this audio is getting does seem like a witch hunt. I listened to the painfully boring audio waiting for her to say something outrageous and it just never happened. She described the archetype of the young adult without much of a decent job stuck living in their parents&#39; basement in a factual manner and didn&#39;t have a hint of malice in her voice.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a shit ton of stuff HRC can be attacked on; she&#39;s basically pure fucking evil. Why are people trying to make a scandal out of some boring piece of audio that anyone with any sort of objectivity left won&#39;t see as such?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s going on in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is complete insanity. Makes me feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills. At any given time for the last month and a half, the front page has been 95% anti-Trump propaganda.</p>

<p>I hate both Trump and Clinton and don&#39;t want either one of them to be president, but if you believe the content of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, Trump is a baby-eating pedophile monster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, there are. I think the guy sending me death threats was likely one of them, he was pro-Trump - he posts normal comments, and PMed a bunch of different people around the time he started threatening me - what was interesting was that when I asked him if he was compensated, he refused to answer. Like, he could tell me about my brains splattered on a wall, but could not come out and say he wasn&#39;t compensated. He can threaten graphically, but he can&#39;t lie and say he&#39;s not a paid shill? Creepy, scary stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a troll to me. There is no logic behind the idea that paid shills cannot admit to it. Similar to how there&#39;s no logic behind the idea that police always have to admit they&#39;re police. Edit: Although, i guess who is to say that there aren&#39;t a few shills paid to be especially idiotic and make the other shills look normal by comparison so that we are more apt to buying their bullshit. Can&#39;t trust anyone these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get - if they are being compensated, why not lie and say they aren&#39;t? If they&#39;re not being compensated, why not tell the truth and say they aren&#39;t? Instead, the cases I&#39;ve tried it on (one, a M00nsanto-moonbat and the other the threatening Trumpster) contorted themselves to avoid answering it straight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a lot of negative Trump news going on post debates. In the week before the debate he didn&#39;t say anything crazy so he dind&#39;t get negative coverage. But in this week he lost the debates, then the stories about him breaking the Cuban embargo, then him picking fights on twitter. Basically if you want to write an anti-Trump article right now there is plenty of material.</p>
