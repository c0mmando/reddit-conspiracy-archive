       I'm not for Trump or Clinton but ever since the debate I feel like there's a mad scramble to make Trump look as bad as possible. Did they finally realize Hillary might not have this election in the bag even after all the fraud and cheating? Somebody in the higher ups obviously is getting nervous that this whole election might have slipped from their control. Thoughts?

       I feel they're trying to flood feeds across the media spectrum as a distraction.

       The hearings going on in congress regarding her email scandal has shed light on how corrupt the DoJ is and how complacent the FBI has been with the powers that be in Washington; Trumps campaign caught fire for good reason; he has numerous flaws but I think most Americans just want someone who can't be bought...

       It's a real shame Bernie got treated the way he did &amp;, imo, Democrat voters should not stand for it...

       My guess is it's a combination of distraction from recent things that came out that could hurt Clinton. Along with probably CTR getting another wave of funding. They probably hoped the rigged debate would be enough to crash Trump but it wasn't so it's back to hardcore shilling.

        /r/politics

       about Ben Cohen of Ben &amp; Jerry's not endorsing Clinton and it got a bunch of upvotes right off - at about the 20 minute mark, it got slammed with downvotes, and a few snotty comments from users that obviously didn't read the article - and hilariously, the comments illustrate the
       <em>

       I made a post on r/politics on another account to test it an "anti-Hillary" article from politico, immediately downvoted and all my comments downvoted into oblivion. Then shills proceeded to either attack the post saying it's been posted many times already, or try to justify hillarys actions: in regard to what she said in the leaked audio recording.

       Are we talking about the leaked audio of what sounds like a speech given at a fundraiser where she says a part of Sanders' supporters are millennials who feel they've been cheated by the system and didn't get the jobs they thought they would and live in their parents' basements? If so, I really fail to see how anything she said on there is inflammatory in any way...
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the bitch and that whole "vast right-wing conspiracy" defense, but in this particular case the flak this audio is getting does seem like a witch hunt. I listened to the painfully boring audio waiting for her to say something outrageous and it just never happened. She described the archetype of the young adult without much of a decent job stuck living in their parents' basement in a factual manner and didn't have a hint of malice in her voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a shit ton of stuff HRC can be attacked on; she's basically pure fucking evil. Why are people trying to make a scandal out of some boring piece of audio that anyone with any sort of objectivity left won't see as such?

       Stop and frisk would get illegal guns off the street. Most pro gun people are in favor of getting them out of the hands of criminals, and the mentally ill. Where as Democrats use every shooting as a reason to try to disarm us all.

       the tpp promotes free trade to an extent, but it doesn't promote a free market. it is chock full of crony capitalism designed to give the top corporations even more power with less risk. in the end, i don't give a shit about free trade if it means less competition. plus there's things like suing governments over profits and corporate courts.

       Funny how the "smart" part combined with "bad" makes everything a hundred ties worse. I honestly would go with bad and dumb over bad and smart, but in this case "bad and dumb" is "bad and dumb" enough to start world war III by accident. I'm not saying that WWIII won't happen under HRC, but if it does, at least it'll be a calculated move.

       Maybe people are realizing we're a month away from the election and the front runners are the biggest douche and turd sandwich ever? They are finally awakening? Seems like kind of a long shot, though. People I know are doubling down on denial.

       It's probably more likely that we're in the final stages of the wrestling match, and getting close to where Trump really puts his back into throwing the match. He's been working hard at it so far, but it's been backfiring. It's now time to go all in to take a dive for his good buddies, the Clintons.

       Me, too. But it's mostly dumb or fake stuff. Which throws me because there are many, many legitimate attacks on Clinton that could be made - awhile back, I spent five minutes Googling and came up with like, 20 mainstream articles about pay-for-play and corruption in
       <em>
        just the last 5 years
       </em>
       - but mostly we just see stupid stuff that's a stretch and easily disproven.

       It's a circus, we're being peppered with propaganda on all sides, and I would not be surprised that all sides are the same side (but not surprised that a lot of participants in the propaganda-spewing don't realize that yet).

       how do we know there aren't shills for him just like there are for clinton? didn't that oculus guy get caught funding something like that? i mean, it's obvious that his subreddits are very controlled. any opposition to the narrative is deleted. for example, when they got rid of the "no racism" rule on the_donald, most of the users were pissed - but all of that dissent was deleted. they

       Oh, there are. I think the guy sending me death threats was likely one of them, he was pro-Trump - he posts normal comments, and PMed a bunch of different people around the time he started threatening me - what was interesting was that when I asked him if he was compensated, he refused to answer. Like, he could tell me about my brains splattered on a wall, but could not come out and say he wasn't compensated. He can threaten graphically, but he can't lie and say he's not a paid shill? Creepy, scary stuff.

       i can't even imagine the next few years. soon, they are going to have the tech to automate shilling. like that Tay bot. they will have the ability to manufacture consent at a level that is unprecedented.

       Sounds like a troll to me. There is no logic behind the idea that paid shills cannot admit to it. Similar to how there's no logic behind the idea that police always have to admit they're police. Edit: Although, i guess who is to say that there aren't a few shills paid to be especially idiotic and make the other shills look normal by comparison so that we are more apt to buying their bullshit. Can't trust anyone these days.

       That's what I don't get - if they are being compensated, why not lie and say they aren't? If they're not being compensated, why not tell the truth and say they aren't? Instead, the cases I've tried it on (one, a M00nsanto-moonbat and the other the threatening Trumpster) contorted themselves to avoid answering it straight.

       Oh I still do believe they are on the same side. But I feel like the original plan was for a Clinton presidency but more shit is coming out about Hillary than they thought

       There has been a lot of negative Trump news going on post debates. In the week before the debate he didn't say anything crazy so he dind't get negative coverage. But in this week he lost the debates, then the stories about him breaking the Cuban embargo, then him picking fights on twitter. Basically if you want to write an anti-Trump article right now there is plenty of material.

       If he doesn't want negative media attention then maybe he can try being less of an embarrassment to the GOP and to America. Even if you don't like Clinton, you can't deny that the Trump campaign has been nothing but a series of disasters of increasing magnitudes.

       Me, too. But it's mostly dumb or fake stuff. Which throws me because there are many, many legitimate attacks on Clinton that could be made - awhile back, I spent five minutes Googling and came up with like, 20 mainstream articles about pay-for-play and corruption in
       <em>
        just the last 5 years
       </em>
       - but mostly we just see stupid stuff that's a stretch and easily disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a circus, we're being peppered with propaganda on all sides, and I would not be surprised that all sides are the same side (but not surprised that a lot of participants in the propaganda-spewing don't realize that yet).
