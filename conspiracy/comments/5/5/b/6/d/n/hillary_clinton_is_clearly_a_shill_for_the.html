       I live in the Bay area and I was watching the local news a few weeks ago and they had a news story about how wealthy tech Republican women such as Meg Whitham are supporting Clinton in lieu of their Republican roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I instantly knew what was going on.  Since Trump isn't taking many campaign donations, he doesn't owe anyone anything unlike Clinton who has received millions of dollars from major corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then this story made it to the front page today:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/30/usa-today-thinks-trump-is-so-unfit-for-the-presidency-that-it-just-wrote-a-historic-anti-endorsement/">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/30/usa-today-thinks-trump-is-so-unfit-for-the-presidency-that-it-just-wrote-a-historic-anti-endorsement/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously a huge media bias against Trump since the only bias against Clinton is from alternative news sites, not the MSM.

       This.  You can't follow the money trails anymore because everything is filtered through proxy funds and PACs, none of which are legally obligated to say who donated to them, how much they donated to others or for what purpose.

       Trump will mostly want to help his own companies, but fortunately he doesn't make money from war, GMO's or vaccines, so he's a far better option than Hillary, as Hillary has to do favors for all that lot, whereas Trump will just do favors for Trump Hotels
      </p>
      <p>
       He also makes to make friends with Putin, whereas Hillary see Putin an the enemy which could well bring the start of WW3

       RAH RAH RAH VOTE FOR TRUMP RAH RAH RAH MAKE AMERICA AGIAN.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's you. Always on about Trump being Americas savior without being able to express the tangibilities of how such claims are to be achieved. And I love your refusal to comments on Trumps intentions to censor the Internet on behalf of Zionists, expand the already illegal reach of the NSA, resign the Patriot act, and whenever has brought up conspiracy always does it with disinfo e.g. "the dancing Saudis"  on 9/11 (surprise, they were Jewish Israeli, surprise Trump owes over 900 million dollars to Jews due to his failed pyramid schemes, surprise, he's a staunch Zionist and warmonger)
      </p>
      <p>
       Surprise, you won't address any of the above because that's not what the company who bought the account wanted you to use it for.
      </p>
      <p>
       P. S. Your  no bodysnatchers, polkadotgirl, poptart,  putin_loves_cats, jacks1000 or any other actual name here, you are just as much a nobody as me, and I do it intentionally because I don't want the Zio pedo creepers from topminds to stalk and harass me like they can have and would.

       Look at history.  Governments were kings and lords a.k.a. the rich.  Hell this government was created by a bunch of rich guys writing themselves a bunch of power over everyone else.   It's a way to control the peasants and democracy is a tool that allows it to hide behind the big lie of "we the people".    You support the power because you vote and you feel like you have a say and they've fooled you into thinking that if they don't have this power corporations will.

       Yeah its always been this way. It just seems as though wide-scale scandal and corruption is a more recent thing, but it is the mass of information now available due to technological advancement that generates greater lucidity. Now the fight is on to disinform on discourse and 'control' this mass of information.

       Welcome to the 1990's. Also, look into Robert Mercer and who he made Trump hire and then take another look at his campaign as a whole.

       You only need to look at their policies really. Clinton/Kaine are big TPP supporters. Hell Clinton's Husband signed NAFTA into law after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump on the other hand has been against TPP, dislikes NAFTA. And is in favor of using tarrifs, and cracking down on Chinese currency manipulation. For corporations that are making a killing under the current "free trade" environment he is their worst nightmare.

       Or a Trump presidency is too dangerous to fuck with. I take serious issue with your word "clearly." None of this shit is clear, it's all speculation from no data. If anything Trump is beholden to his own infantile whims and his other upper echelon friends. Don't call something clear without facts.

       The facts are right in front of us. Look at Clinton's donors and follow the money trail of those companies. They own everything.

       So you don't see the obvious anti-Trump bias on that toxic subreddit?

       I'm fairly certain that a good number of the US population doesn't like or trust Hillary but where are all those stories on
       <a href="/r/politics">

       ?

       But do you know how I'm fairly certain?  When I see this:
