        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in the Bay area and I was watching the local news a few weeks ago and they had a news story about how wealthy tech Republican women such as Meg Whitham are supporting Clinton in lieu of their Republican roots.  </p>

<p>I instantly knew what was going on.  Since Trump isn&#39;t taking many campaign donations, he doesn&#39;t owe anyone anything unlike Clinton who has received millions of dollars from major corporations.</p>

<p>But then this story made it to the front page today:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/30/usa-today-thinks-trump-is-so-unfit-for-the-presidency-that-it-just-wrote-a-historic-anti-endorsement/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/30/usa-today-thinks-trump-is-so-unfit-for-the-presidency-that-it-just-wrote-a-historic-anti-endorsement/</a></p>

<p>This is obviously a huge media bias against Trump since the only bias against Clinton is from alternative news sites, not the MSM.  </p>

<p>He also makes to make friends with Putin, whereas Hillary see Putin an the enemy which could well bring the start of WW3</p>

<p>That&#39;s you. Always on about Trump being Americas savior without being able to express the tangibilities of how such claims are to be achieved. And I love your refusal to comments on Trumps intentions to censor the Internet on behalf of Zionists, expand the already illegal reach of the NSA, resign the Patriot act, and whenever has brought up conspiracy always does it with disinfo e.g. &quot;the dancing Saudis&quot;  on 9/11 (surprise, they were Jewish Israeli, surprise Trump owes over 900 million dollars to Jews due to his failed pyramid schemes, surprise, he&#39;s a staunch Zionist and warmonger) </p>

<p>Surprise, you won&#39;t address any of the above because that&#39;s not what the company who bought the account wanted you to use it for.</p>

<p>P. S. Your  no bodysnatchers, polkadotgirl, poptart,  putin_loves_cats, jacks1000 or any other actual name here, you are just as much a nobody as me, and I do it intentionally because I don&#39;t want the Zio pedo creepers from topminds to stalk and harass me like they can have and would.</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t see the obvious anti-Trump bias on that toxic subreddit?</p>
