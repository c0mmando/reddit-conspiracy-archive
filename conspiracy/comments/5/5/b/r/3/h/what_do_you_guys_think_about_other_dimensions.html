    <div class="md"><p>Check out some Bashar videos on YouTue. There&#39;s people on earth right now that can channel extra dimensional beings. Science right now (quantum mechanics) is discovering right now, in the field of science, what has already been known through spiritual communities for centuries. Science got all technical about it but came back to basic spiritual understandings. Which is good because then you can use science to prove mediumship, the effect of how we create our own reality, the ability to use your intuition and tap into your gut feeling or sixth sense.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more to this world than can be seen. We are spirits that live forever. Satan doesn&#39;t exist. We can never die truly. Our physical bodies may die but our spirits or consciousness is energy and energy cannot be destroyed. We are all one. We are all god. Duality exists to teach us both spectrums of your actions and the choice to be positive or negative in nature. We are spiritual beings having a physical experience. The reality we experience is the reality we have created for ourselves through our thoughts, beliefs, actions, morals, etc.</p>

<p>You reap what you sow and the reason karma exists is because we are all one so if you hurt someone else you are hurting yourself because of us all being a part of all that is which is one. You love and nurture someone else you&#39;re loving and nurturing yourself in the process.</p>

<p>This world we live in is a gorgeous dance that many do not have the eyes to see or the minds to recognize or want to see right now. Many are waking up to the changes we are experiencing as a species. There is so much out there. Within us and outside us. We aren&#39;t alone and people are in contact right now with alien consciousness (Bashar, etc)</p>

<p>Long rant and multiple run on sentences but if you read all that I really really appreciate and love you and I&#39;m glad you read it. If you get the chance read the book conversations with God. It&#39;s free online as well. It&#39;s not a religious book it&#39;s a spiritual book. Religion preaches the opposite of the way we should live. Live your own truths, realize your own meanings, make your own connections. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you how to view the world and never let anyone put words in your mouth and shape your own opinion. Be the creator you are and create the reality you would prefer to live in. Shift to that parallel reality and make it a conscious choice and be that. I love Good resources:</p>

<p>Phoenix lights. 10,000 people saw a spaceship (it was just 1) and only a few recordings exist. We are one with our extra dimensional friends aliens and beings and they love and support us. They want open face contact. We are almost ready and are on the cusp of full truth. If they were to land right now a lot of people would go into psychotic shock because it would drastically alter their world view and suddenly shatter certain belief systems that would overload the individual. As much as certain people on earth and others want full contact to happen we must wait until 2020+ once we are past the tipping point in global consciousness or the collective consciousness.</p>

<p>I can go on and on but start with those and it will take you where you need to be. When the student is ready, the teacher appears.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always beneficial to keep an open mind. Use critical thinking and rational thought and apply logic when needed.</p>

<p>Do your own research and come to your own beliefs and truths and you will be amazed at the way you look and respect life differently afterwards.</p>

<p>Good luck on your spiritual journey brothers and I love you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is another thing not understood in the mainstream. How a person can channel another dimensional aspect of their reality.</p>

<p>Still others do actual personality exchanges with not just other-dimensional beings, but personalities from other areas of consciousness not expressed in dimensions.</p>

<p>Jane Roberts channeling Seth is an example. And more current is the <a href="http://www.eliasweb.org">Elias material</a> which is information about how reality is created and about concepts quantum science is trying to figure out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So i&#39;ve read all the content from your Law of One link. Man I&#39;m sorry but most of that stuff is nonsense. Its clearly written by a human pretending to be an alien god. The&quot;god&quot; references the &quot;Law of Karma&quot; which is fundamentally flawed.  Not every good intention will manifest as a good outcome. We all know this through our experiences while being alive as humans. Also, the &quot;god&quot; Ra constantly speaks things that are nonsensical. Do you really think a god would speak such cryptic nonsense that people like us would accept it as truth because we can&#39;t really understand it?. Yeah give me a break. All that nonsense about the ancient planet Marduk. So they detonated an H bomb and their souls traveled to Earth and manifest as proto-humans or something. Have you done the math on how enormous a hydrogen bomb it would be to turn a planet into an asteroid belt? Im gonna guess the bomb would be the size of Texas, really deep in the crust, to turn an entire planet to millions of boulders in space.  The energy it would take would be otherworldly. Don&#39;t be so quick to believe such tales dude. Use your head. You have the same brain it took for our species to go from hunter/ gatherer nomads to putting highly advanced computer chips into phones to make money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I used my head that&#39;s why I believe the law of one. I don&#39;t really know what to tell ya man. The law of one material you just read has been widely accepted by a lot of people. I really don&#39;t know what to tell you. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t wrap your head around it right now, because I will admit it&#39;s a tad strong material to jump into right off the bat, I sincerely recommend you start with a book called conversations with God written by Neale Daniel Walsh. It&#39;s even free online because it&#39;s such a powerful message.</p>

<p>Or even the Seth material by Jane Roberts, or check out Edgar cayce. I know it&#39;s hard to accept at first but once you start reading and researching into similar material it all starts to click together and make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s going on in the thread-header is a linguistic confusion. Yes, we speak of &#39;other dimensions&#39; or &#39;parallel dimensions&#39; as shorthand for other planes of existence (or however you want to phrase it). But that&#39;s different to the four dimensions of this universe (i.e., height, length, width, and duration).</p>

<p>The &#39;extra dimensions&#39; that are referred to in string theory belong with the &#39;dimensions of the universe&#39;. Hard to visualize, let alone explain.</p>

<p>According to physicists, various calculations need these extra physical dimensions (of the universe) to make the sums work out correctly. One of these sums involves the question of why gravity is such a weak force compared to e.g., magnetism. </p>

<p>The theory is that some of gravity&#39;s influence is leaking into these other physical dimensions (sort of &#39;getting lost down the back of the sofa&#39;, if you like).</p>

<p>The explanation for why we can&#39;t access those dimensions is that (for some reason) they collapsed during the first moments of the universe coming into existence, and are &#39;curled up&#39; at the atomic level. No-one has yet explained what &#39;curled up&#39; means in this context.</p>

<p>You might think that this theory about extra physical dimensions is utter hogwash, and who am I to argue with that.</p>

<p>However, there is no chance of anything unexpected visiting us from these curled-up extra dimensions of the universe. Whether or not there are other dimensions in the &#39;planes of existence&#39; sense (parallel universes etc) is another matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No chance? I can say with relative certainty that many of our myths, stories, fairy tales, &#39;gods&#39;, are interpretations of other-dimensional bleed through. </p>

<p>Other dimensions are accessed by us and we reconfigure that information into our dimensions blueprint.  And as the case with most ufo sightings, these are other dimensional bleed throughs as well. So i would say, yes, we do get unexpected visitation from other dimensions. Just ask the gov about recovered ufo wreckage...oh wait...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geez, you had to ask.</p>

<p>I do not care about theories or &#39;calculations&#39;. Quantum physics only bbbbbaarely touches on these subjects, all of which in my studies is quite simple to understand if you look at this through a less &#39;rational&#39; perspective.
Our conditions make it virtually impossible to grasp something so immensely simple. I would start out by reading a few choice books to get a more spiritual outlook.
Nature Spirits and Elemental Beings -Marko Pogaćnik</p>

<p>The book of the Hopi</p>

<p>These are good starting points for a delve into understanding the other dimensions of existance (which are very real). 
My personal belief is that there at least 7 dimensions, perhaps 8 if time  is considered a dimension in itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How weird?</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t get how there would be a limited or finite number of dimensions. Whatever the source of existence is, the magnitude of possibilities must be endless. Earth Is very dense and rich in complexity. With emotion and sexual aspects in the blueprint. Other dimensions could go into the more simple configurations of matter, others possibly into the abstract and unrecognizable versions from our perspective here. </p>

<p>Science has to catch up to metaphysics on this issue, imo. I think they did have a step ahead in one of the Philadelphia experiments where they bent the veil in an odd way. As usual there is more to it than what is released but they didn&#39;t understand really they were blinking in and out and in again between parallel dimensions. But in the reconfiguration is where they were put back together with that affect.</p>

<p>The idea is that all dimensions occupy the same space, only the caveat is the veil. Where you are sitting now, in your space there are also countless dimensions occupying it, only your perception creates a veil that encloses you in this dimension though simultaneously a perspective also shares your location and perceives an entirely different dimension. So another thing string is missing is the perceivers consciousness and how that is accessing other dimensions constantly through inner mechanisms of the imagination. </p>

<p>They know a particle is doing this blinking in and out, they don&#39;t know where it goes when it goes out. Imo, the answer is it goes everywhere simultaneously to being here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of other dimensions in existence should be close to infinite. Making them completely redundant.
You could even imagine that there is a dimension where we actually exist; and an infinite amount of dimensions where our universe does not even exist.
Redundant and does not even deserve our attention.
And if we can communicate with supposed beings from other dimensions only means that they ARE part of our dimension.
Romantic and poetic thinking that distracts us from our current dimensional human problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. What would be really interesting is if there is was another dimension in which all points in space were adjacent to each other. Being able to use that dimension as a shortcut to any point in 4D space would allow FTL travel. Hyperspace essentially. This was explored in Event Horizon, which is referenced in Stranger Things a couple of times. Most obviously when the science teacher pokes a pen through a folded piece of paper. The theory upon which that is based is much older than either work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a shot in the dark for you,</p>

<p>I wonder if CERN is able to use Mirror Reality technology to superimpose changes they&#39;ve made virtually to the current state of matter with the LHC (lots of energy would be required)? The whole Earth becomes a Start Trek like holodeck, only it&#39;s real and not holograms in a box once its projected by the LHC.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t like a past event? Model it, choose another possibility and project it overwriting the current state.</p>

<p>I may be taking a shot in the dark here but I&#39;m using a shotgun with tracer shot and I think I tagged something from an r/MandelaEffect post (I&#39;m shadowbanned from that sub BTW):</p>

<p>Their AI (a circumstantial connection to CERN) has issues passing the turing test; if you watch Moonraker Dolly&#39;s braces (now gone in all copies of the movie) are still visible through the beer glass.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>A custom full auto sawed-off Saiga-12 with a 60 round Dragons Breath clip would do nicely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other dimensions have been suggested as a reason why some people see &quot;things&quot; (aliens, demons, unexplained entities etc) during episodes of sleep paralysis. </p>

<p>I&#39;m one of these people. I should clarify that whilst I do believe in aliens and I&#39;m sure some people have been abducted by them, i don&#39;t believe i have. I&#39;m positive it&#39;s my imagination playing tricks on me. The thought that it could be something from another dimension is actually terrifying! </p>
