        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">49</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/BLOCK_WATCH.html">BLOCK_WATCH</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Cutting to the chase: After thinking about the event, I&#39;m very interested in something I initially dismissed while watching. The story of the man who was mistaken for someone else, abducted, questioned and who-knows what else and released (no kidding). This person&#39;s life was destroyed, 13 Americans are responsible (or at least are wanted by another government to face charges), and not a fucking thing will happen. This, after all - for me at least - was worth the press conference. I consider myself educated, but I did not know this story, and it&#39;s haunting.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Desiring the Big Reveal is the new normal. I think we as a community, should really examine (myself included) what we <em>need</em> versus what we <em>want</em> and to separate the two with clarity and reason and dare I say, some mercy.</p>

<p>The Candidate will never get charged. If we accept this, then if by some chance it does happen, then the outcome will still be the same. In other words, I think we already know what we need to about the Candidate - the cat is out of the bag, it&#39;s in the open: WE KNOW.</p>

<p>However, the Story of the Mistaken Man - this is the system at work. This system of downright horror in the name of - what? - security or whatever else.</p>

<p>I think we should show mercy (I mean in the general sense) toward the people, but show no mercy toward the system. I believe there is a difference.</p>

<p>A criticism of my point would be, &quot;No, we have to find evidence, we have to find ways to bring these people to justice. Show no mercy. And also, you&#39;re too soft on this shit - SHOW NO MERCY.&quot;</p>

<p>I too, get angry, but not anymore, because I don&#39;t want to be angry. Let them fall all over themselves.</p>

<p>The system requires players. For a long time, we&#39;ve submitted and been the players. But now, I don&#39;t want to play. And I don&#39;t think you (the ones here for fun and stories and ideas and the chance to be critical) do either.</p>

<p>In a game of thermonuclear war or Tic-tac-Toe, the only winning move is not to play. This is difficult, but I&#39;m more at peace than I have been in a long time, despite the burning walls that surround me. At least I&#39;m aware. And that&#39;s fine with me. All the while, I know I&#39;ll be ready (or at the very least, accepting) for whatever may come down the line.</p>

<p>But...the Story of the Mistaken Man. <em>quietly says this</em>: There must be so many. It&#39;s that story, which was told twice by two different people during the event, that has me deep in thought. Mercy on this man and mercy on the men responsible. Mercy on the men who sit far away from the world we live in and give commands and use nothing but force to carry out their will. All in the name of saving their ass for all time to come - if we can learn anything from the 1960s in this country, we should learn and remember during that time of social change/force/corruption/awareness that many of the so-called hippies against force and against oppression are now in power. And mercy to them.</p>

<p>You want to know something else? This should probably be another post, but I&#39;ll put it here anyway. Even if there are only 5 or 6 people that read this, that&#39;s fine. I know I&#39;m in good company.</p>

<p>The U.S. is in a big generational struggle. I think that&#39;s what it is at its base. And this is something we can use mathematics to at least get a grasp on the social implications.</p>

<p>Right now, there are about 80 million or so people born between 1945 and 1960. There are about 80 million people or so people born between 1980 and 1995. That&#39;s just about half the country in two very large generations. I am in the latter. I have a feeling that the PTB know that 80 young people, enough to really really change things, will vote them out, kick them out, and (not to gain power you understand) work to make things better. This scares the shit out of them. So what happens? The PTB - the ones with no sense of humor - try to co op &#39;movements&#39; because they are playing with a 1960s set of rules and measurements, and they do not know any other way than with force. Socially, all they know is force, oppression, and the like. It should be very clear to any reasonable person that the PTB are trying to start shit and divide us up and so on. 80 million people.</p>

<p>And me, as a young person, fed the 1960s diet all my life, what do I get? The people that I looked up to my whole life, that I learned from -- they call me part of the problem, they call me without morals or values, when deep down I think that I have nothing but strong convictions in truth and justice and fairness -- YOU ALL TAUGHT ME GROWING UP. What gives? <em>rhetorically</em> Why did so many of you turn to the dark side? I don&#39;t like money, and what it does to people. So I don&#39;t have very much. And I&#39;m fine with that. I see my contemporaries trap themselves in this system. Over and over it goes. And mercy to them, too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for these reasons that the word &#39;millennial&#39; should be a shameful word and for anyone that uses it. Because I certainly don&#39;t call my contemporaries &#39;millennials&#39; - only Time magazine does, only the NYT does, only other old guards do. And I used to look up to them, but they turned on me. (The New York Times, to my absolute astonishment, reeks of propaganda these days. Perhaps it always has, but I at least respected it.)</p>

<p>Facebook - do remember when Facebook was a tool for young people? I do. I was in college. My school was one of the first to &#39;get&#39; one. And it was a network of my contemporaries. And then they let anyone in, and our parents, and grandparents, and it has turned out to be this awful thing I have a hard time living without. And that is no good. So I distance myself from it. And I feel better. I should say: There is nothing wrong with having everyone in on Facebook. At all. But honestly, how can we trust it from now on? We can&#39;t, and that should be a problem that we seriously consider. And because of this, it leaves us vulnerable. To propaganda, to disinformation, to being easily disgusted with our neighbors and friends, and it divides us into groups. And it is strong enough of a force to corrupt people who abuse their life and think that all this is about is secrets. It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>I look around and I see people post here, &quot;What can we do?&quot;</p>

<p>I can assure you, even if there was a real answer, it would not satisfy, and moreover, it would leave us vulnerable to people who spy on ordinary people as a sport. In the name of who knows what.</p>

<p>Going back to an earlier point, I do not trust anyone who uses &#39;millennial&#39; in the media. I myself was guilty of labeling. &#39;Baby boomers,&#39; Gen X, the Silent Generation, and so on. Not anymore. I also don&#39;t trust anyone in power that has no sense of humor, and it quite frankly has allowed me to identify dark intentions in people just by that alone. (This is why &#39;elites&#39; do not understand people. They don&#39;t understand that people don&#39;t <em>need</em> education signifiers to be a part of our society, and why, I submit, they are perplexed by the Other Candidate&#39;s presence in this campaign; some people just have a sense about someone, and they don&#39;t need to be forced to believe otherwise.)</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to write all of this, and I know I&#39;ve got a &quot;wall of text!&quot; criticism coming. But I figure, out of all the places in reddit, it belongs here. Why? Because this is my neighborhood, that&#39;s why.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Second TL;DR: Let&#39;s ask ourselves, in all honesty: What more could we <em>really</em> need? I&#39;ve said this before, like a few others have here, but there is nothing that can be revealed that will be satisfactory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elites, why not evens of &quot;infidels&quot; like the superbowl or New Year&#39;s Ave? Any football game really. You could take out THOUSANDS of people and you don&#39;t need to spend months trying to steal a plane. Yet this never happens. Not on black friday, not on Christmas, not on the fourth of july. Why? Because the government makes too much money to have people scared to spend theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;generational change&quot; drivel has been put out since the beginning of time, <em>by every generation</em>, and <strong>nothing changes</strong>.
