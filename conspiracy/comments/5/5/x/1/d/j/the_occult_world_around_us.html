        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR; There is a cult of death worshipping psychopaths who have ruled society since its inception 5,000 years ago. They have limited your perception and convinced you that you aren&#39;t important. </p>

<p>The word occult means &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot; secret&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;occult&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to &quot;evil&quot;, and that&#39;s something that most of us have not figured out. In reality if some of these secret teachings and inventions would really benefit mankind, both physically and spiritually. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s examine some history. </p>

<p>Somewhere around 4000-3000 BC civilization sprung up out of nowhere. All the sudden, cities were built in the place of villages; agriculture, the domestication of animals, and irrigation were developed. I&#39;m not just talking about the Sumerian Civilization; but Egypt, India, China, The Inca, The Maya, and the Celts all developed at the same time. </p>

<p>What is the common denominator? </p>

<p>Well, isn&#39;t that the million dollar question. What strings together all of these &quot;loose ends&quot;? </p>

<p>And of course the answer is, the secret knowledge itself. </p>

<p>I call them the &quot;Priests&quot;. At some point the religious/political establishment became so corrupt that it allowed otherworldly entities (demons and Angels) into our physical plane. They lost control. The entities themselves began running the show, interbreeding with humans and spreading the disease of psychopathy across the entire world. </p>

<p>All of the afore mentioned civilizations practiced ritual human sacrifice in order to please their dark gods, who keep in mind could have just been powerful human magicians and alchemists, but could also be inter-dimensional or other worldly intelligences, or possibly a hybrid race. </p>

<p>Regardless of the specific origin of the &quot;Archons&quot; or the &quot;Illuminat&quot;, the fact remains, these secret socieities have passed down secret knowledge from age to age. Perhaps some of them were good some were evil; perhaps there is a greater purpose involved. I&#39;m not sure. </p>

<p>It started with the Babylonians and the Egyptians (unless you want to entertain speculation about Atlantis, Hyperborea or other legendary pre-Deluge civilizations). From there the Israelites were given the torch and they spread their ideas across the globe (eventually taking let in almost every conflict and Revolution from the age of Christ to the modern era). Then Pythagorus and the great Greek mathematicians and philosophers passed this knowledge on. The period of 100 BC - 100 AD is by far the most mysterious period in history. What exactly happened to the Jews at Masada and how did the Romans convince the most dangerous rebellion they had yet seen into submission through a pacifist guru? </p>

<p>Eventually the Christian Church took over this knowledge which mutated under the Knights Templar, 1000 years later, during the First Crusade. They found all kinds of secrets buried beneath the catacombs of Jerusalem. In 1307 the Templars were found to be practicing witchcraft and were massacred. The few survivors fled to Scotland where King Edward the Bruce allowed them important positions of power. These survivors founded the Freemasons, and eventually took control over the British Empire, unleashing a wave of genocide and violence upon the brown races of Man that would last to this day. </p>

<p>Moving on we have the Freemason foundation of America, it&#39;s blood stained destiny, to usher in a world wide Satanic Order; where there will be no genders, no families, and no religions; no freedom, no choice, and no thought. Only slavery awaits us in this physical prison.</p>

<p>This agenda is taking shape as we speak. </p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make to you people out there who are paying attention is, while I&#39;m not sure how deep or how spiritual this conundrum is; as in, I&#39;m not sure how much of this new age mumbo-jumbo is true or not; but one thing is for certain; that a cult of psychopaths has been in charge for a very long time. </p>

<p>That alone should shape anyone up. </p>

<p>The future will be interesting. Take part in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Satan brought Jesus to a high place where all the nations of the world could be seen, he told Christ that it had all been given to him and that he could give it to whomever he pleases (in this case, in exchange for Jesus worshiping him). </p>

<p>There is a spiritual element to all of this, and the evil ones are unknowingly fulfilling prophecies by attempting to bring humanity into the service of their master. They hide the evidence in plain sight through symbols. </p>

<p>In my opinion, the time is ripe for their messiah to come and I believe he will emerge out of Israel (because evil likes to spite God). Unfortunately, the religious Jews will mistake him for the true Messiah they missed centuries ago.</p>

<p>There is a whirlwind of events happening right now at such a speed we cannot process it all. I sense something big is about to happen and the world as we know it is about to change for all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2 Timothy 3 (KJV)</p>

<p>3 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their&#39;s also was.</p>

<p>There is a man named Rick Renner who has been studying Greek for 30 years. He says the &quot;Last days&quot; actually started at the &quot;Day of Pentecost&quot; Which is why people have been saying we are living in the last days for the last 2000 years. And this is what he interprets this one passage to mean after going through all the different meanings of the greek words used and the way they were compounded together. It really gives a much better insight than any english bible translation ever could. Makes me wonder what else the bible says that we don&#39;t know about.....And mind you, this passage is only one area of the N.T. talking about the last days. Jesus also talks about them being full of &quot;wars and rumors of wars&quot; Nature and animals dying ect... And that these are only the beginning of birth pains.....</p>

<p>Renner started giving this expounded version back in the 90&#39;s way before our obsession with violent video games and movies, the spread of anything goes crude and vulgar language and comedy, the massive spread of Pornography, the LGBTQI movement, social media, cell phones ect.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded</p>

<p>&quot;You emphatically must know what I am about to tell you! In the very part of the last days - at the very end of the age and at the very last of the last days, - periods of time will come that are hurtful, harmful, dangerous, unpredictable, uncomfortable, and high-risk. People will feel encumbered by it, like you are standing in the middle of it with prison bars around you and there is no way to escape it. Mankind at large will have misdirected love from godly love to being self-consumed, self-absorbed, self-focused and in love with themselves more than anyone else. As a result of this self-love, they will hoard money for themselves while spending very little to help others. These boasters are so committed to their own self-promotion and agenda that they are willing to exaggerate, overstate the facts, stretch the truth, embellish a story, and even lie if it will get them the position, advantage, or goal they desire. They will be arrogant, haughty, impudent, snooty, and insolent. They will never be satisfied and will never have enough. They disdain, mock, slander, and speak ill of anyone that stands in the way of their plans. Everything will be off the table, anything goes. They will think they have a right to everything and in this environment, parents will no longer be able to persuade, control, lead or exercise authority over their children. Although they were once thankful and appreciative, people will become void of gratitude and generally unappreciative of everything in the last time. As a result, impurity will seep into society and cause it to become unholy -- impure, ill-mannered, unclean, indecent, coarse, vulgar, offensive, crude, lewd and rude. Behaving and carrying on in a way that God would never sanction. Love and commitment for family will degenerate; divorce will become epidemic with irreconcilable differences being the major cause for separation; and the court system will be overwhelmed as people go overboard in their suing others and in being sued. People will turn savage, vicious, uncivilized, violent, ferocious, and inhuman.  A society where law is not primarily intended to protect the rights of good people but rather is used instead to protect and defend the rights of offenders. People will be preoccupied with and known for their obsession with violence. People will be lovers of pleasures and creature comforts more than lovers of God. Romantic with themselves, kissing themselves, showing deep profound affection for themselves, have a deep profound love for philosophy and wisdom while wanting to do everything they can to remove Truth (God laws) from their minds. Their doctrine will be that pleasure, comforts and happiness is the highest good; addiction to and obsession for pleasure as a way of life.&quot;</p>

<p>Renner said some of the Greek words used in this one passage were so rare that they are not used anywhere else in the New Testament.</p>

<p>And that being said The book of Daniel gives some insight on exactly where the Antichrist will come from.</p>

<p>Daniel makes it clear that he will come from the ten kingdoms of the revised Old Roman Empire Territory (Dan. 7:7-8, 23-24), and from the four divisions of the Grecian Empire, which are four of the ten, as in (Dan. 8:7-9, 20-23), but it also makes it clear that he will come from the Cyrian division of the four divisions of Greece, as plainly taught in (Dan. 11). The king of the north of this chapter is Syria, and the king of the south is Egypt. Wars between these two divisions of Greece are pictured in Dan. 11:5-34). 
Verses 35-45 portray war between these same two kingdoms &quot;AT THE TIME OF THE END,&quot; showing the result of the last war between them. </p>

<p>It states that the land of Egypt shall not escape the king of the north in this last war, thus identifying Syria as being the country from which the Antichrist must come. If the king of the north was Russia as many Bible students now teach, how could Daniel 11:44 be fulfilled? There are no countries north of Russia that could fight against her, as required by this verse? 
There are no countries north of Russia, thus proving that the king of the north could not be Russia. We must understand the reference to be the northern division of the Grecian Empire, Syria. The Antichrist comes from Syria and is called the king of the north who will fulfill all of Dan. 8:22-23; 11:35-45; 12:1-7).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this isn&#39;t exactly true because the bible says that the last days started at penecost and even in the bible there were scoffers saying &quot;where is the promise of His coming?&quot; Just like they are scoffing today. However if you study the greek there is a difference between the last days and the last last days or the end of the end if an age. Which is the point we are coming to now.</p>

<p>Prophecies have been coming to pass all throughout the bible in every age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan told Jesus that he would give it all to Him if He would just bow His knee and worship him. </p>

<p>This implies that Satan has the power and authority to almost literally &quot;rule the world&quot;. This also means (in my opinion) that luciferian elite (&quot;illuminati&quot; if you will) can pledge their lives to Satan in order to achieve prosperity/power in this world. </p>

<p>Hint: nothing - we all face oblivion in the end. An utter end to sensation and consciousness. If more humans could accept the fact that our short lifespans are all that we have, perhaps we would be less prone to violence.

We humans have been here for a very, very, very long time. Far longer than what academia wants you to think (Darwinism). I think you need to look more into pre-Deluge civilization. Civilization didn&#39;t just pop up out of nowhere. It was already established far before the Babylon and Mesopotamia. Researching that, will make a shit tonne more sense to you, to understand the forces we are up against. Remember, there were both good and evil survivors of the Deluge, and no I&#39;m not talking about Noah. That shit is a cover story.</p>

<p>Maybe they do need to reset it. </p>

<p>Edit: From knowledge I have gathered:</p>

<p>During astral projection, you see a white cord, I have never personally experienced this myself, but it has been spoken of by most experiences astral projectors.</p>

<p>666 means carbon, 6 electrons, protons, neutrons, and we are carbon beings.</p>

<p>Carbon could be the key to the matrix somehow possibly, through some quantum aspect we are yet to observe.</p>

<p>I also read up about archons, what I read was different, basically beings of vibration that are not like us, as the djinn shamans&#39; readings you can find all state a very subtle clue: We are creators. </p>

<p>What this means is that these beings may not have what we consider to be a &quot;soul&quot;, more of leech, stealing something off of different vibrational states, reincarnation makes sense in regards to human morality, a human, nurtured logic, but in regards to &quot;souls&quot;, it makes no sense, we are creators, we are one with something they are not, reincarnation could also be seen as resetting the batteries, you described resetting the actual system those batteries are housed in.</p>

<p>Basically, theory is: Astral, cut the cord, die, and upon death, you are released, and must learn to ascend to higher planes from there.
In the Tibetan book of the dead, they speak of lights, false lights, etc. It is possible through their meditation and balance, they were able to do something to that silver cord, forcibly stop the reincarnation process through their own personal ascension.</p>

<p>A few things I have read about satanism: Do not trust passed on information from mouth. Remember this, anyone who tells you anything verbally is lying. If it be information, their opinion, etc. This is a little confusing to me, but it is deep. They communicate through symbols, and other unknown means. </p>

<p>stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all good information. I understand your hypothesis but I wouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the term &quot;thought forms&quot; </p>

<p>This is what we&#39;re creating. This is why they want to control our perception more than anything, because we are creating this festering shit hole, planetary prison society every day at our negativity. </p>

<p>Not to say, to not be negative; there&#39;s a lot to be negative about. I mean I sure as hell didn&#39;t start any of this. But some of us have to rise above it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about anywhere when you see &quot;666&quot; synchronisticly. Things like numbers, symbols, ideas, etc aren&#39;t evil. They&#39;re tools. </p>

<p>The pentagram isn&#39;t evil, in ancient paganism it represented both the stars and the inner world of human consciousness. </p>

<p>Somewhere along the way they flipped the symbol, to a reverse pentagram; symbolising a goats head. Even this wasn&#39;t done out of wickedness; it was meant to go along with the constellation of Capricorn for certain magical rituals. </p>

<p>Eventually the Satanic, Moloch, Baal, and Dionysean cults starts using it, and they were/are wicked. Over time it became their symbol. Just like the nazis percertedthe swastika, which in ancient times simply represented &quot;life force&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According the bible Satan ruled the earth before the Ice age and all these other beings we are finding wete part of his old earthly kingdom before he tried to invade heaven. History repeates itself. If you actually believein Satan and the occult realize that the bible contains the birth of mythology.</p>

<p>I typically believe what science says about the earth and universe but only as far as to the explanation of how things work not how things got here. Even Graham Hancock questions the big bang and many things science is telling us. I see your starting to discover that there is way more things being found and hidden on the earth than what mainstream science wants you to know and I don’t really think it disagrees with the bible. I think it is manipulated and there are plenty of lies hidden within the truth. </p>

<p>I don’t believe that God is some universal nothingness floating around in nowhere. I don’t believe He is a universal mind, soul, spirit, conscience, ect. I believe he is Omnipresent but not in “body”.  in the bible He has only been in one place at a time in body. In many places it says God looked down upon the earth. Same with Jesus. I believe He is Omnipotent only in His own realm. There are certain spheres in which He cannot operate and some things he cannot do if people believe simple statements from the bible. He is limited in power within our “sphere” if you will. Or He has limited Himself in the way he deals with free will. He has laws whereby we should live and has made penalties for all sin and rewards for obedience.</p>

<p>So for example: According to the bible, God cannot lie, deny Himself, have respect of persons, change His eternal plan, save rebels who persist in rebellion ect…God limits Himself according to his own revelation of Himself but I don’t know whether by nature or by choice, He doesn’t say.</p>

<p>Another example: God’s compassion and love can be considered infinite and all comprehensive, yet He naturally seems to limit His love to those that will not conform to His plan. (Ex 20:5-6; John 3:16-18) God has had to punish people who He one time had compassion for.</p>

<p>People speak as though God’s long suffering is infinite, yet it has come to an end several times. He has even cursed people whom He had previously had mercy upon (Ex 15:13; 1 Cor 10:1-12) I also am not sure exactly how far God can see into the future or exactly how He limits Himself from doing so. It must be true right? Otherwise God would be creating beings that were doomed to go to hell and he did it anyways.
In many places God has “observed” His own creation. God was going to destroy the Israelites until Moses, God’s own creation, convinced God not to do it. His own creation reasoned with God and changed His mind.  God said He was sorry he even made man before He destroyed them in the second flood. I take statements like these very literal.</p>

<p>When David says things like “thou understandest my thought afar off” (Psalm 139) People use these things and act like God knew them from eternity. The verse says “afar off”. How can He know them before the existence of a person and before he has thoughts to know? Nothing is ever said of God knowing all persons and all their thoughts in all the dateless past, billions of years before they even came into existence.
In Jeremiah 1:4 it says “before I formed the in the belly I knew thee” the context of the verse continues to say “AND before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee” So God did all this at conception. Man takes things like this and adds their own interpretation.</p>

<p>I could go on and on with examples like this.God gives all sorts of details about the universe and his creation all throughout the bible. You just have to put them all together. People just go by the book of Genesis and assume that is exactly what happened. And for some reason people just assume that God was doing absolutely nothing before he created humans and the earth. Like the bible is the only thing God ever did. If God is God it is absolutely absurd to think he has not been creating other systems and beings his entire existence which is infinite. He has been doing things like this for billions of years and he will never stop. What God did in the eternal past that is not recorded in the bible. Nobody knows, He didn’t reveal it. And Jesus, Paul, Peter, they all teach of world before humans were created.</p>

<p>Deut 29:29 says The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. All we know is God existed from all eternity and sometime in the dateless past God brought into existence the heavens and earth and all it’s inhabitants. Psalm 90:2 shows how God has existed from all eternity. “2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” 93:2 says “Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.”</p>

<p>God did reveal some things that happened before Adam.“In the beginning” whenever that was, and as there is no date for the beginning, it must refer to some kind of dateless past. Anyone who sets a date for the beginning is simply coming up with his own idea or adding to the bible. If God wanted us to know when the beginning was, He would have told us. Since he didn’t, I leave it like it is. It could have been millions and billions of years ago or not. If geologist can prove the age of the earth to be as old as they claim it is, why disagree with it? Either way it does not contradict the bible, as it does not set any time element in the connection with original creation. One thing is certain according to the bible, the Earth is more than 6,000 years old. And there were inhabitants on the Earth before the days of Adam. </p>

<p>I have found that if the bible is contradicting itself then we must be interpreting it wrong.
Isaiah 45:18 says that God did not create the earth in vein or in waste and he created it to be inhabited. While Genesis 1:2 says the earth was Hebrew words “tofu &amp; bohu” which means waste and empty. So this would directly contradict Gen 1:2 if people don’t believe in a gap between the two verses. So it means the earth was made perfect and also inhabited in Genesis 1:1, the very beginning. And became a waste and empty land.The Heavens and Earth were created at separate times. The word “beginning” would refer to before he created anything we know of. Whether there was day and night or times and seasons where God lived before does not say. The word created in Hebrew is “bara” which means to bring into existence.</p>

<p>The bible says we can understand the invisible things by the visible things which are made. The bible says that he formed everything with his own hands in Gen 1:20-27; 2:7-25; Job 26:13; Psalm 8:3; 95:5; 1 Tim 2:13. It even says “the works of His fingers” in Ex 8:19 and Luke 11:20. In Isaiah 40:12 it says He measured the waters in the hollow of His hand , and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hill in a balance. Some of this could have been a figure of speech but I take it literal because in the context of it God is comparing the way He made things to the way Humans are making idols .He must have done all this IN IT’S OWN PERIOD OF TIME.</p>

<p>It says in Isaiah 45:7 that he FORMED both light and darkness. He did not do all this this in Gen 1:3-5. That would make no sense. He merely divided the light and darkness. God created everything we have now in Genesis 1:1. He created it perfect the first time. He did not create the earth void and without form or in a state of chaos. It BECAME that way from sin. Then he recreated (restored) the earth again in 6 days. Just like it says he is going to destroy and recreate the earth a 3rd time in Revelations. So judging how long God took during the 6 days of recreation to restore the earth. That was just one planet. The bible says he forms everything with His hands. So he speaks into existences the materials He uses to create things with then forms with His hands each sun, moon, star, planet, and each creature that inhabits the universe. God took one day to divide the light from the darkness on this little planet Earth. How much time He originally took to bring into existences all the darkness and light in the entire universe is not known, but I would say it took Him longer than a day. If God took six days to restore one little planet to a habitable state and form new inhabitants for the Earth, It would have taken thousands and thousands of years to originally create the vast universe with all of its billions of suns and planets along with whatever else inhabits them. It says God did all this for His own pleasure in Rev 4:11 So to put things in chronological order as I find them...</p>

</ol>

<p>This is when the spirit world was created including demons which were bit demons at first. There are many kinds of demon spirits, fallen angels and other spirit beings mentioned in scripture. It is certain they were not created wicked. They were originally created perfect and sinless and became fallen and unclean. Even the prince of demons is spoken of as being “perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, TILL iniquity was found in thee” (Ezek 28:11-17). God could not and did not created anything sinful. Everything in the spirit and human realms that is wicked and rebellious has become this way because of sin and because of free choice.</p>

<p>The fallen angels, demons and other beings are all rebels in connection with the planet Earth. They have sinned with the ORIGINAL rebellion on Earth under Lucifer, or they would not be confined in prisons under the Earth or be operating on the Earth now against God. That those below have sinned in connection with the Earth is clear from the fact that they are confined in the abyss underneath the Earth.</p>

<li>Creation of the Earth. The Earth made perfect the first time, not creating it in vein. (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-7; Isa. 45:18; Heb. 11:3). </li>
</ol>

<p>The sons of God shouted for joy and all the stars sang when God created earth. (Job 38:4-7) So this means they were made before hand. So I would assume logically that God created heaven…and then all its inhabitant and then God created Earth and all its in habitants in that order. </p>

<p>Everything God created was created perfect THE FIRST TIME. God does not create anything void waste and empty and in chaos. So earth was not created void and without form.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Creation of &quot;the world [kosmos, social order] that then was&quot; (2 Pet. 3:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; 45:18; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17).  </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer&#39;s reign over &quot;the world that then was&quot; (Isa. 14:12-14; Jer 4:23-26; Ezek 28:11-17; Col 1:15-18) The length of his rule unknown.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>2 Peter 3:6 is not talking about Noah&#39;s flood because that world did not &quot;Perish&quot; for Noah and his family survived. It is talking about 3 worlds. The world that then was, the world that is now and the world that is to come.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Other thrones, dominions, principalities and powers of the universe (Col. 1:15-18; Eph. 1:21; 3:10; 1 Pet. 3:22). </p></li>
<li><p>The Kingdom of God universal; God the Supreme moral governor of the universe, and all in harmony with Him (Job 38; Dan. 4:17, 25, 32, 35) Length of the rule of the universal harmonious kingdom, before Lucifer started his rebellion is unknown. </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer, the original ruler of the planet Earth, conceives the idea conceives the idea that he can get the co-operation of other angelic beings of the universe, dethrone God, come the exalted supreme ruler of the universe (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer carries out his plans and through pride falls and foments rebellion by slander and accusations against the Almighty. He causes his own earth-kingdom subjects and over one-third of God&#39;s angels (Rev. 12:7-12) to rebel against Him. The Earth enters its first sinful career (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). The length of the uprising is unknown. </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer instigates rebellion and persuades everyone possible to rebel. He openly breaks relations with God and His government, and leads his rebels from the appointed place of mobilization on Earth into Heaven to dethrone God; but he is met by Michael and the faithful angels, and is defeated and cast as lightning back to the Earth (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; Luke 10:18). </p></li>
<li><p>God completely destroys Lucifer&#39;s kingdom on Earth, judges the earth with Darkness, just as Darkness is used for judgment or evil throughout almost every other place in the bible (why would Gen 1:2 be any different) and curses the Earth by destroying every bird, animal, fish, city, inhabitant, and all vegetation. He then turns the Earth upside down and by means of a great flood makes it empty and a waste (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17; 2 Pet. 3:5-9). The length of the pre-Adamite flood on the Earth is unknown. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Jesus, Peter, Paul and John all teach the overthrow of the pre-Adamite world. (I can prove this if you ask)
Now here is Jeremiah </p>

<p>Jeremiah 4:23-26
 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
25 I beheld, and, lo, <em>there was no man</em>, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</p>

<p>He saw Genesis 1:2 and what else did he see there? He saw broken down cities, a wilderness, birds that were fled and <em>no man</em>. Which implies there was something inhabited on the earth at this time as well as animals and some kind of being that that built cities. Perhaps it&#39;s all our human ancestors that they keep finding to use for evidence of evolution. These are beings they are finding from before the ice age.</p>

<p>These had to be earthly subjects because God created the earth to be inhabited. They also built cities that could be broken down. These were not Human but man. Just like when someone take the mark they will no longer be human. The redemption period or trial period must have been like the angels. Nobody knows how long it lasted. They were made perfect and without sin though. God only makes perfect things. Just like in Noah&#39;s day they were destroyed after God&#39;s long suffering ran out. (Isa 45:18) It will always be inhabited with earthly subjects. Even after the Millennium. </p>

<p>Earth was in a state of judgment (Darkness) and broken down and destroyed by God&#39;s fierce anger. Darkness everywhere in the bible is referred to has judgment or evil. Just as in Gen 1:2 Because God is light and in Him there is no darkness.</p>

<p>So now you see Lucifer weekend these nations and tried to invade heaven ALREADY way before the war in revelations. This is why he fell and was in the garden when Adam was there.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 28:13-15: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold; the workmanship of they tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou are the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee”.</p>

<p>Lucifer was made perfect he was the most powerful being next to God and walked in a garden of eden on earth before Adams garden. UNTIL iniquity was found in him and he got filled with pride and went and trafficked all the land with his earthly subjects and deceived them. Then when he invaded Heaven his tail drew a third of the angels (rev 12:4) Which basically means he deceived them as well.</p>

<p>So when they &quot;ascended to heaven&quot;, it really makes you wonder if they had some incredible technology or if it was only the angels. Why would Satan need to deceive everyone on earth if they were not going to join him in a war? &quot;<em>just like he is doing again</em>&quot;  History repeats itself.</p>

<p>Now this verse is talking about two things as well as the antichrist if you read all the context. So you really have to connect Isaiah and Ezek together. And then just use some logic. His kingdom had to be on earth if he was going to ascend above the clouds and stars.</p>

<p>Rev 12:4 is talking about the war in heaven from the dateless past. As we already understand that 1/3 of the angels are ruling the earth now.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:5 we read this:
&#39;&#39;For unto the angels hath God not put in subjection the world to come of which we
speak.&quot; In other words, The World Tomorrow, the Kingdom of God, will not be under
subjection to angels. The present one is under subjection of fallen angels. The
demons, and the devil who is their head, rule this present earth and sway its
inhabitants. </p>

<p>but verse rev 12:15 is talking about the future war in heaven (rev 12:7 and 20:1-10)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are exciting times. We are to WATCH, PRAY AND EXPOSE these things to get people to repent and come to the Lord. God did not tell us these things to scare us but to prepare us. The only people all throughout the bible that were not protected from danger were people who refused to humble themselves and repent. </p>

<p>There are manybpeiple on the bible that were just as bad and worse as these government and occultist people. They burned babies alive as part of there worship. They commited mkultra style crimes. Yet when those people repented God spared there harsh judgment. The bible says there is nothing new under the sun. All these things have had and will continue to happen. This even means these things were going on in the ice age. Which is the reason why God destroyed and recreated the earth. And in the end God is going to burn the earth with fire. The bible says this planet is dying and groaning. Climate change is from sin. It has nothing to do with ehat humans are doing to the planet. </p>

<p>Bad things happen in the earth sinply because the planet is dying and also satan is the prince and power of the air. When people do not repent the Lord cannot protect them.</p>

<p>When Jesus rebuked the storm he was not undoing his Fathers work. That storm was from Satan.</p>

<p>When Job lost his family and all his land it was because he opened the door through fear. The bible says if you fear it opens the door to Satan and there is nothing he can do. Job said himself &quot;the very thing I feared came upon me&quot; and then Job made like 72 accusations against God out of ignorance. Job didn&#39;t even kow the devil existed he did not have the bible. Later he repented and God gave him back twice has much has he had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all good information. I understand your hypothesis but I wouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the term &quot;thought forms&quot; </p>

<p>This is what we&#39;re creating. This is why they want to control our perception more than anything, because we are creating this festering shit hole, planetary prison society every day at our negativity. </p>

<p>Not to say, to not be negative; there&#39;s a lot to be negative about. I mean I sure as hell didn&#39;t start any of this. But some of us have to rise above it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about anywhere when you see &quot;666&quot; synchronisticly. Things like numbers, symbols, ideas, etc aren&#39;t evil. They&#39;re tools. </p>

<p>The pentagram isn&#39;t evil, in ancient paganism it represented both the stars and the inner world of human consciousness. </p>

<p>Somewhere along the way they flipped the symbol, to a reverse pentagram; symbolising a goats head. Even this wasn&#39;t done out of wickedness; it was meant to go along with the constellation of Capricorn for certain magical rituals. </p>

<p>Eventually the Satanic, Moloch, Baal, and Dionysean cults starts using it, and they were/are wicked. Over time it became their symbol. Just like the nazis percertedthe swastika, which in ancient times simply represented &quot;life force&quot;</p>
