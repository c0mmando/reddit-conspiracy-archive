       What are the most important conspiracies I need to know and what is the proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Thankyou so very much for your answers. I somewhat believed in conspiracies prior to this thread but was unsure about their validity  due to apparent lack of evidence, which I now know to not be true. Your replies have sent me in the right direction and I am more certain now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mind has been full of ideas and preconceptions about conspiracy theorists and receiving replies from you all that have been written (mostly) politely and not in an a hostile manner. I am currently half way through high school and I am already noticing so many cracks in the education system and the broader society. I hope to take up activism as a career (well, not a career as I would receive little to no income for doing such work) and these replies have helped further propel me in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank-you for changing my perspective on this and opening my mind further

       Use the search function because there are already tons of these exact posts.  Not trying to be rude, just resourceful.  Tons of good discussions to look up too.

       There's a conspiracy for ya. Content like that is made by useful idiots who blindly believe other useful idiots and lying politicians, which in turn, convinces more useful idiots that 9/11 couldn't be an "inside job" because our government is too incompetent.

       Seriously though, if there's any "conspiracy theory" you should look into, it's 9/11. It is the root of all modern conspiracy and explains why things are currently so fucked up. Here's a great starting point which literally proves controlled demolition with some really good experiments:

       Yes very true. I feel like even if the huge majority knew about this stuff the media would still make sure that we can't let each other know that we both believe it because we are deceived into thinking we are alone.

       I know most of them do, but not all of them hence my point... i don't say wikipedia has no knowledge, but rather that it omits certain knowledge.

       Ahhh, the sword in the stone. I can't be bothered trying to prove it. You're probably just one of flytape's alts so you can prune anything that compromises you from the inside..

       That was quite silly though. You shit on Wikipedia, only to recommend links to Wikipedia. What a funny person you are.

       I don't mind people reading about them through a portal where they can realize there's some omitted for themselves. For example the wiki regarding the list of cia involvement in international political affairs/coups has been heavily pruned from what it used to be like a few years ago. If you sent someone to that now they'd never know unless they came through this website where I'd been made to realize that particular wiki entry had been heavily edited in the last few years.

       If that's the case, you are a shill then as you're everyone else in this site but me. Checkmate, shill!

       One that is coming and is very close, and is neglected by most people is a russia-china joint attack against the west to bring forth the new world order. It's being set to happen and can happen as fast as in the next year.
