        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What are the most important conspiracies I need to know and what is the proof?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thankyou so very much for your answers. I somewhat believed in conspiracies prior to this thread but was unsure about their validity  due to apparent lack of evidence, which I now know to not be true. Your replies have sent me in the right direction and I am more certain now. </p>

<p>My mind has been full of ideas and preconceptions about conspiracy theorists and receiving replies from you all that have been written (mostly) politely and not in an a hostile manner. I am currently half way through high school and I am already noticing so many cracks in the education system and the broader society. I hope to take up activism as a career (well, not a career as I would receive little to no income for doing such work) and these replies have helped further propel me in that direction.</p>

<p>Thank-you for changing my perspective on this and opening my mind further</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a conspiracy for ya. Content like that is made by useful idiots who blindly believe other useful idiots and lying politicians, which in turn, convinces more useful idiots that 9/11 couldn&#39;t be an &quot;inside job&quot; because our government is too incompetent. </p>

<p>I&#39;m over here like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zREMiV3.png">https://i.imgur.com/zREMiV3.png</a></p>

<p>Seriously though, if there&#39;s any &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; you should look into, it&#39;s 9/11. It is the root of all modern conspiracy and explains why things are currently so fucked up. Here&#39;s a great starting point which literally proves controlled demolition with some really good experiments: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJNzaMRsN00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJNzaMRsN00</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mind people reading about them through a portal where they can realize there&#39;s some omitted for themselves. For example the wiki regarding the list of cia involvement in international political affairs/coups has been heavily pruned from what it used to be like a few years ago. If you sent someone to that now they&#39;d never know unless they came through this website where I&#39;d been made to realize that particular wiki entry had been heavily edited in the last few years. </p>
