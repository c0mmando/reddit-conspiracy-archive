<p>Better the fetus is dealt with than a child born that nobody wanted or cares about, and has to suffer through life in a selfish society where they will get no help.  </p>

<p>People want to cry about abortion but these same people, in this thread, are against social policies that help disenfranchised people.  I call you hypocrites out for pretending to give a damn about these people before they are born, then turning your back and calling those who want social safety nets to help these disenfranchised people &quot;communists&quot;.  Fuck you, assholes.</p>

I could say the same about the people you are talking about having &quot;safety nets&quot;. You poor? Fuck it, might as well kill you. You sick and cannot afford healthcare? Fuck, let the state kill you. You have no chance? Fuck it. Let&#39;s kill you. The ignorance and hypocrisy in your words makes me sick to my stomach. It&#39;s not surprising though. Liberalism and progressivism is a sick and murderous mentality. I truly hope you don&#39;t end up infirmed, and the rest of us just say: &quot;Meh, fuck em, let&#39;s jut end there miserable life&quot;.... I hope you are under the age of 25, because you have not lived life nor has your brain fully developed. You murder sympathizer. Also, Commies killed ~50 million plus people.

    <div class="md"><p>Explain why women should have the ability to murder millions of innocents. Explain why you support child sacrifice to fucking moloch.</p>

<p>You HAVE no explanation. Thousands of years ago, babies were sacrificed (usually by being thrown into fire) to gods in order to appease them and gain power. As of today, around 50 million babies have been aborted. Have we really “progressed” as a nation? If these are the “progressive” policies, why are they so reminiscent of activities that almost all religious condemned millennia ago?</p>

<p>I make the case that abortion is “empowering” to women because it is little more than a baby sacrifice to the ideology (god) of female empowerment–feminism. If you think that liberalism is not a fanatical religion, you haven’t attended a slutwalk, gay pride parade, or pro-choice rally. There is a reason these people assemble to praise their god of liberalism. It’s not to change political policy–it’s just as primitive as ancient pagan rituals to hear them scream at the top of their lungs about how killing babies is a great thing. </p>

<p>This is why abortion is so key to them. If they lose that, all power is taken out of their religion. Abortion is a human sacrifice ritual–the most powerful known to exist. It was invented by eugenics operatives within the occultic elite to curry Satan’s favor while gaining his protection of their warmaking, usury, currency manipulation, and control over the minds of men.</p>

<p>Why is abortion the most powerful form of ritual human sacrifice? Because it entails the most defenseless victims conceivable–the unborn–being murdered by the very persons most duty-bound to love and protect them from harm–their own mothers and medical doctors who’ve sworn oaths to do no harm.</p>

<p>These ritual murders–which society misnames abortions–are, furthermore, carried out in a nonchalant and routinized fashion exclusively to facilitate hedonistic apathy, laziness, and convenience; symbolically placing ten seconds of vaginal pleasure above the value of a lifetime worth of a living, breathing human being’s consciousness.</p>

<p>In short, Satan loves abortion because it symbolizes evil within cruelty within evil. It proffers that a few seconds of vaginal contractions mean more than human life itself, and it does this using the greatest symbols of love and compassion (mothers and doctors), satanically inverted into spiritually numbed, unfeeling executioners.</p>

<p>So the next time you see a western woman screeching about her abortion rights on the steps of some state capitol, look into her empty eyes and know that you’re seeing more than a simple murderer. Look into her eyes and know that you’re seeing a demon, the very definition of evil. And know that the steady stream of death she inflicts on the unborn is what powers the elites’ satanic karma.</p>

<p>The human being exists inside the mother, that is a fact. Aborting it, is murder. Aborting is a newspeak term for killing. Just like a &quot;fetus&quot; is a newspeak word for a living, breathing, developing, human being. Think about what you are talking about. I hope you are tiggered out of your sick thoughts that this practice is just fine and dandy. You support death and murder, if you are pro-&quot;Choice&quot;, just so you know.</p>

<p>They brought in sacrifice that dates back to Mesopotamia and Babylon. They are correct. Do I agree 100% with what that user said? No. But it&#39;s the same practice, words and practice are just lost in translation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, the developing fetus receives all of the benefits of breathing, including oxygen, with help from the mother. </p>
