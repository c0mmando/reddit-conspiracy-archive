       There was like a 20 minute segment where all combined they must have said "Putin is a dictator" "Russia invaded Ukraine/Crimea" "Russia is being aggressive" like 30 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen this level of propaganda in such a short time frame since a few years ago when the war in Ukraine started. Do you think this brainwashing is preparing the public for a potential conflict with Russia that will escalate soon?

       I think they know their decades of subversion has left the USA without that many viable troops to fight a ground war. That's why their plan is Nuclear First Strike. They are just trying to get the sheep to accept the plan.

       It's just like the run up to war in Iraq back in '02-'03. Complete with total media participation.The Crimea bit is the best. Russia has always been there by contract since '92. Before that, the Soviets were there. All the Us propaganda is in support of old Soviet policy started when Khrushchev gave part of Russian territory to Ukraine, less Sevastapol in '54. 
Supporting old Soviet policy at the same time they accuse Putin of trying to revive the Soviet union is a new level of hypocrisy.

       I noticed that too, and how Putin is the enemy for defending Assad and fighting the rebels? The "rebels" are Isis, Putin fighting Isis makes him the good guy, unlike Obama and Hillary who give Isis weapons! They'll push this anti-russian crap because they are desperate. They are losing and they need an enemy.

      <p>
       I also like how Kain points his conspirscy finger at Trump, saying he has business deals with Russia, when Hillary is the one who sold 20% of our nations uranium to Russia! Talk about that business deal with Russia.

       At this point the media has villianized Russia so much that Pense would probably catch heat for sympathizing with the enemy. Be called anti-american etc. After watching that debate there's no question they would've made a fool out of him for trying to say anything outside of the mainstream narrative. All he can do is go along with it at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the field day CNN would have tomorrow if he'd said Russia wasn't to blame. I can see them painting him as incompetent or untrustworthy, replaying the same 5sec clip that proves "this is why you should vote Hillary"....

       They aren't our friends so much as they aren't the Globalist friends or at least Putin isn't. If I recall correctly, Putin kicked all of the oligarchs out of Russia and is attempting to get the Rothschild banks out of there too. He already had it so that Soros isn't allowed to step foot in Russia either, hence why the Global Elite are attempting to kill him and take over Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now does this mean he has the American citizen best interest at heart, no, he is doing what he can for his people and his people alone I'd wager. I'm sure he also wants Russia to return to prominence and keep and expand his resources. However, I'd wager he also would rather work something out with Trump so both Russia and America get something out of this new truce rather then get murdered and have his people deal with war on their doorstep with Hillary and by extension the Globalist.

       This is incorrect.  Putin is cleaning house but not of oligarchs, just oligarchs that he doesn't think will follow him.  That is an important distinction.  Russia's Oligarchs are looting Russia as much as ever.

       Everything you linked appears to support exactly what I said.  Putin is not kicking oligarchs out, he is just punishing any that might go against him.  There is no evidence that he is holding the oligarchs in check beyond maintaining his power, especially over the past 10 years.

       I doubt he could kick out the wealthiest people in his country by force though, it would be the equivalent of Trump removing Zuckerberg or Gates out of their own homes and taking all there possessions too, thus confirming a communist dictatorship.

      <p>
       Those who have acquired massive wealth shouldn't be punished, they shouldn't however get to write whatever laws they want and should have someone to keep them in line should they step out of it. It seems that Putin is doing that.

       Is it support or fear that he has something on them, he'll maybe some of these oligarchs agree that they also don't want foreign investors and competitors moving onto their turf or country and enslaving the people and country too. Who knows.

       We are not "forced" to pick anybody, really. The MSM presents the illusion of two choices, Repub or Democrat, and shames the American public for Vote Wasting for daring to even think about third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have been corralled like sheep into believing they are good Americans ONLY if they vote for an R or a D. Americans have been brainwashed into believing that third is the lunatic fringe, that they are crazy and not good for America. The establishment says this as they drive America into the biggest shit hole imaginable. It is the current establishment that is not good for America. They are corrupt, criminal corporate thugs and they are robbing the Americans blind and they will do it as long as people believe they are the only ones they are allowed to vote for if they want to be "good Americans".

       You had Sanders but the Democrats were allowed to steal that election. You could not vote for their chosen candidate if you really want to spite them though I think it makes no difference. Blue states will stay Blue always due to vote fraud it's why they oppose voter ID.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump whether you like him or not won the Republican nomination despite a great deal of resistance. Don't vote for him if you don't like him but understand that many many people do. It's tiring to hear people say that no one likes either of these candidates when it's only Clinton that is being propped up by the media, and her big donors.

       Stein/Johnson are not really a factor that's just how it is in the American political system.

       I really cany believe Pence aaid something ro the effect that if Syrian ( technically lawful goverment) is fighting ISIS and bombs Alleppo and kills children that the USA has a right to attack them. Frankly that is scarey. For one the USA has NO lawful right to conduct war against a sovereign goverment withouy declaration of war by Congress. Also, should the USA choose to attack the Syrian goverment we would automatically start WW3. Russia and Syria have mutual defense same as NATO. So if USA attacks Syria all of NATO does as well. If that happens Russia automatically declares war on USA and NATO. IIRC Iran is also a part of the deal. So USA and NATO vs Russia, Syria, and Iran. The intial war will be sold on the loss of life of Syrians but will end with full blown war against Russia and Iran. I also suspect that Pakistan would also get attackes as they area safe haven as msm says for terrorism. USA then uses Afghanistan as a base to fight both Iran and Pakistan. India will likely be recruited fight Pakistan since they are mortal enemies. Finally seeing how NATO plus India are alloes China has no choice but to join Russia and friends or else they become completely surrounded by USA and gang. Russia has enough resources and us close enough that Chinas factoriea can use its material vs ours. This is how WW3 Begins. Not sure how players in African and South America respond but Im sure wars will spill into those lands as well.

       We have been engaged in proxy war. There hasnt been a declaration of war. We bomb the isis areas, we have "accidentally" bombed russian and syrian forces. If we were to mount an invasion thats when it would happen. Russia and Syria are not going to go toe to tow when we are targeting there enemy.  Now the Free Syrian Army aka "moderate rebels" are actually fighting russia and syrian govt forces hence being a proxy war. Its funny how we claim that all nations should have the right to self determination yet we actively are supporting an insurgency in Syria. The Syrian conflict is a civil war. Its there fight not ours. Unless we are specifically asked to intervene we are technically being aggressors in the war. The USA could if they wanted provide weapon sales but no more. We should train these rebel forces to fight. If they want to make a regime change by force then they should do it alone. Dont get me wrong I do not want ISIS around but thats up to the peoples that country to deal with. We can actively prevent them from spreading to dofferent countries if asked for help but shouldnt just engage in war in other nations because we dont like there governance. If you actually look at whats happening its not that the USA wants to defeat isis, we want regime change in Syria. This is becuase the powera that be do not want Russia to have a warm water port. Thats why our foreign policy is based more on disrupting the area and supporting violent change. The same deal with Ukriane. This is part of a larger plan to islate Russia which has always been the goal.
