<p>What is your definition of a &quot;slab&quot; as you&#39;re using it in this story?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m primarily using the term &#39;slab&#39; because this is what they used to describe the town area and what the town area sits on.  Each town area was their own slab.</p>

<p>This is taken from the fact they the cave area was open and huge (maybe the size of Chicago? New York?)  and they divided it up and floored it off.</p>

<p>When they used it, it seems like that was the standard lingo.  So any here who know of these things, or those who have worked in these will know that &#39;I know&#39;.</p>

<p>3 football fields long, 6 football fields wide, was the size of the slab.</p>

<p>The whole opening was divided up into approximately 10 slabs.</p>

<p>This I will assume when taken into that is probably the size of Chicago/New York.  I&#39;ll be more specific, the size of Downtown Chicago including west loop, and the size of New York, New York.  Not including the other islands.</p>

<p>I mean you&#39;re using the term &quot;slab&quot;.  You keep saying that word.  Isn&#39;t that somewhat of a recognizable name that might identify you as someone who &quot;knows&quot; to anyone who might be looking to shut down anyone who might know information?</p>

<p>Yep, you are correct.  But they would also find out that I don&#39;t know anything that could truly disrupt/harm their project.</p>

<p>At worse I will receive a phone call.  Which if happens, no biggie, but at least I did my part.</p>

<p>If I was my father, or his friend, then I would be obfuscating quite a bit.  But since I&#39;m not, there&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve divulged thus far that brings me worry.</p>

<p>Yes, in speaking with my father, he has been to MANY. And some make the one I seen look like a bedroom closet.</p>

<p>Nope not at all.  My father told me stories when I was younger about the Natives who told them WHERE TO FIND CERTAIN OPENINGS!!!!!</p>

<p>So the american natives knew of many of these.  He stated that some of the natives said their ancestors went down into some of these tunnel to live out their days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of the caves outside Joliet, Illinois. I don&#39;t remember much, but some friends and I were fishing when we were kids. We started walking back to a friend&#39;s house and found a big hatch with an Army Corps of Engineers seal on it. It looked outrageously old and we were kids. We went and got flashlights and opened the hatch. We climbed down the ladder and ended up in a pitch black tunnel. We made it about 20 feet before lights came on and two soldiers came running at us screaming for us to hit the floor. They asked a million questions (mostly about who we were, where we came from, how we got in, who our parents were, where we went to school, where we&#39;d been in the &quot;complex,&quot; and what we&#39;d seen). They marched us out, single file, surrounded by at least a dozen soldiers. I couldn&#39;t see anything because the soldiers were surrounding us, but one tunnel we passed was lit brightly and I could see houses in the background like it opened up and there were houses underground. The tunnels actually looked like the hallways you see in sci-fi shows about bunkers...  almost exactly like the hallways of Cheyenne Mountain in Stargate SG-1.   Anyway...  We went up a few dozen flights of stairs followed by a ladder and ended up in the woods. The soldiers marched us all over in various directions for about half an hour and then left us down by the river.  The next time we were out that way, the hatch was gone, but it was obvious that it had been purposely removed because it was cleared out a little and there were some smaller trees that appeared to be freshly planted. Until I read this story, I&#39;d forgotten all about my own story. Weird how my mind just completely repressed this for 30+ years. </p>

<p>Was it repressed, or was something channeled in your life to repress it.  </p>

<p>If I were to talk about some of the tech my father use to let me see, most here wouldn&#39;t even believe it, so why bother.</p>

<p>But out in Joliet there is a military base, research center, huge prison for test subjects in the like.</p>

<p>Who gives a fuck about &quot;most&quot;?

<p>Okay, a block of some smashable, squeezeable soft machine.</p>

<p>My father brings in a block, some what translucent.  He puts a plate at the end of the table and says this block no matter what you do will keep moving to the plate.</p>

<p>Okay... so the block, slowly moves (no wheels, no legs) to this plate.  I smash it completely flat (it was soft), and it keeps moving.  I pick it up and roll it into a ball and then smash it some more.  put it back on the table, it formed a block, and kept moving.</p>

<p>From the consumer tech perspective there is absolutely no tech that a consumer can use to hide themselves.  The question becomes, more less how much of a threat you are.  And when I say threat, not only state level, but world level.</p>

<p>So TOR, VPNs etc., are actually great on the personal level.  Yes the FBI might not be able to find you behind a VPN, but if you are a high enough threat and you were at your home, behind 10 VPNS (exaggerating for effect) and TOR, YOU WILL BE FOUND IN AN INSTANT. </p>

<p>I know the above for a fact.</p>

<p>When you held it in your hand, did you <em>feel</em> any pull or agitation in the translucent block moving toward the plate?

<p>Wouldn’t doubt that for a moment.  If TPTB want you found…you’re getting <em>found</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway.  Sorry.  That was just a random interjection.  Moving on in what you’re saying.</p>

<p>Yep.  Don’t doubt any of this for a moment.</p>

<p>We human beings on planet Earth are minnows living in a tiny, very tightly monitored fish bowl.  Meanwhile, we’ve been convinced from birth by the powers who monitor that tiny fish bowl that we are in fact <a href="http://www.relatably.com/m/img/meme-faces-happy-crying/Happy-Crying-Face-Meme-01.png">“powerful and <em>freeee!</em> and we can do whatever we want!”</a></p>

<p>Yeah.  Right.</p>

<p>None of this is to say that we humans don’t have actual power.  We do, in fact.  However, we have to develop it and <em>exercise</em> it in order for that internal power we have within us to actually manifest.</p>

<p>and most of us are simply asleep…and have been made into unthinking drones.</p>

<p>TPTB do a <em>hella</em> good job of making sure and keeping us ignorant of the ability and potential we have/can have within us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was the entrance at a park in Joliet?  I remember finding a mysterious set of pitch black tunnels at a park in Joliet and don&#39;t remember the name.  I was fascinated.  We came back a few weeks later with flashlights to really explore it, but the entrance was filled in with cement.  My memory is hazy and I&#39;ve tried to Google it without luck.  Can&#39;t even remember which park it was in.  I think the entrance was kind of in an off the beaten path area and somewhat concealed by trees, but I think it was an archway opening on a small room, with dark hallways going off in different directions.  All plain cement from what I can remember.  I would really like to find out more about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure if it was in Joliet. I really don&#39;t think it was. I was only about 8 at the time.  10 at the most. I didn&#39;t live down there, but we&#39;d visit my mom&#39;s friends. All I remember is that we were fishing on a big river. After looking at a map just now, it would probably have been the west side of the desplaines river. We were fishing under a bridge. When we left, we went north up the hill of the riverbank and into a forest. From there, I don&#39;t know what direction we went, but the hatch was in the forest and not very far from the tree line. </p>

<p>Again, I was a kid, so I could be completely wrong on where I was, but I remember when going to my mom&#39;s friend&#39;s place, we&#39;d go over a river (I assume desplaines since all the signs around it were for Joliet) and I knew we were only 10 minutes away from being there. So, we could have been in crest hill, Joliet, channahon, or somewhere else pretty close. </p>

<p>In the end, it wasn&#39;t in a park. Just a cement square in the forest with a rusty round hatch door on the top. And now my memory is fucking with me. I originally (hours ago) remember the Army Corps badge being on the hatch door. Now I remember seeing it more as a small medallion inset into the cement next to the hatch door. Am I starting to remember more clearly or is my memory just a lump of Swiss cheese filling in holes to makes sense of this?</p>

<p>Not a early prep for that specifically, but they test the population all the time with fake scares and so forth.</p>

<p>They scare you here, so you can get the vaccine there.  They scare you there so you&#39;ll move here.  Some of it is real, but most of it is not.  And there is absolutely no way for you to know, unless you know what the tells are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty much unplugged from most of the happening in the world on a daily basis (radio/tv etc...)  I&#39;m on the internet of course all the time like most of us but I&#39;m very selective on what I view.</p>

<p>The populace has been controlled for a very long time and as such, if there is any downtown where lawlessness occurs, you best to believe to watch out for &#39;people&#39;.  They will act in ways that seem like their acting out movie characters than how humans should act.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not vague.  Maybe you want more information, but it is not vague.  What details you want?  Actual names? Actual locations?  That&#39;s just not going to happen.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t harm anyone.  As mentioned, at most a phone call.  How do I know this?  Because I know so I&#39;m not worried about anything more.  Why?  Because specifics weren&#39;t said and it&#39;s vague enough.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some spies here probably do, but once they look up who I am, my father, then look at what I posted.  Again, at most a phone call.</p>

<p>I run my own personal experiments to see how the populace reacts to certain stimuli. This time it is information about what I&#39;ve seen.  To gauge responses and general curiosity.  This, I put in my research.  </p>

<p>Why?  Just purely for the love of curiosity, for knowing.  And maybe, just maybe it may cause a chain of events.  </p>

<p>The reason I keep calling the area we were in a slab is because that&#39;s what they call it and that name stuck.</p>

<p>There were many slabs that had X amount of homes on it.</p>

<p>Outside of the home it was very spacious, wasn&#39;t cramped even slightly it was like being anywhere in the U.S. but just dark of course because you were underground.</p>

<p>One thing that was a little strange was that it was like your ears were hearing a &quot;hollowed&quot; out kinda sound.  Very strange and it is something you would have to experience.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t noise, or a sound, kinda like empty/filled air all around you.</p>

<p>Also, most of the homes were empty.  They were owned in full.  But it wasn&#39;t like people went there on family vacations to hang out.  We were only there because my dads friend needed him at the time. </p>

<p>did they mention/point out how they were supplying air and water? if something were to happen on the surface, they may not be able to rely on the air supply on the surface, so they&#39;d need to block air flow from the surface to them, and then have some sort of mechanism that would clean their air of any toxins. they could also have large gardens to convert co2 to o2 and other gases.</p>

<p>any kids walking around?</p>

<p>ive heard of large caverns like this being made with blasts from small nuclear devices.</p>

<p>were the walls of the cave slick, almost like they had been melted?</p>

<p>was there hospitals, military/police, court house, bank, grocery store, schools, play grounds, etc?</p>

<p>was this cave system with a slab connected to another cave system, under ground? like a tunnel? so its like, each cavern system is a town, and then you can drive to other towns?</p>

<p>you say you drove with your car down to the town, but, i&#39;d imagine car exhaust would be a BIG problem if many people were driving in to the underground town at one time, like when the world is ending. was there a parking lot area/space for everyones cars, or did they simply park them at their home? like a normal, above ground town?</p>

<p>though underground transportation would have to be heavily reliant on electricity, which was made from a clean source like a geothermal vent, that had a steam engine/steam generator built over it, to provide power to the town. possibly even a mini nuclear reactor, as they&#39;ve gotten safer and cleaner over the years. or even a few of those extremely hot reactors that are placed inside of space satellites for a constant flow of heat and electricity.</p>

<p>thx again for the info and your replies to other people. i try to take people at their word, especially when it comes to this topic.
do you have the feeling that if the world were ending, your dad&#39;s friend would be inviting your dad and his family (you) down to the cave system with him?</p>

<p>is there a leadership there? what is there long term planning like? are they planning, if an event were to occur that required they take shelter, to stay under ground for decades? for centuries? because one may be prepared for with enough stores of staples/food/water/medical equipment/etc, while the other would be prepared for differently with farms (hydroponic or aquaponic, as you want to make your farming situation as efficient as possible, both with its usage of water, and its output of crops), which also would mean there&#39;d need to be factories to make parts that fail/break over their normal usage/expected life span. as well as chemistry labs to create the various powders and chemicals needed, such as medicines and cleaning fluids, etc.</p>

<p>any response would be great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why you asked a bunch of questions!  Thank you, I will answer all in order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So each house is stocked with supplies or is there some sort of warehouse that everyone would contribute to as a community and then retreive supplies from when the time comes?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They had a central stock where over 100 years of stocked food was located.  Plus live-stock, plus farms that were in operation.</p>

<p>So if SHTF, I take it each resident would get a ration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was there light sources under ground that miniced the sun, to the point that you saw grass or trees? was there soil on the ground, or was it all slick rock like that you&#39;d find in a well worn cave? was the air damp?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no grass, there were trees but they had a weird color. Light a greenish/bluish. That could be from being under artificial lighting 24/7.  No soil.  We walked on cement.  The air was dry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>were there people walking around when you visited?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>did they mention/point out how they were supplying air and water? if something were to happen on the surface, they may not be able to rely on the air supply on the surface, so they&#39;d need to block air flow from the surface to them, and then have some sort of mechanism that would clean their air of any toxins. they could also have large gardens to convert co2 to o2 and other gases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I asked my father about this he stated the oxygen comes from below, not above.</p>

<p>They had over 300 years of stored water.  BUT they had access to water in underground systems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any kids walking around?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No kids</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ive heard of large caverns like this being made with blasts from small nuclear devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure on others, but this place was a naturally opening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>were the walls of the cave slick, almost like they had been melted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, normal cave walls in the areas you could get close enough to touch.  Some areas were fenced off. But also I didn&#39;t explore a lot because I was a guest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was there hospitals, military/police, court house, bank, grocery store, schools, play grounds, etc?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, none of the above, at least on the slab we were on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was this cave system with a slab connected to another cave system, under ground? like a tunnel? so its like, each cavern system is a town, and then you can drive to other towns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, in this cave opening there were a total of 10 slabs, so 10 towns.  Not sure exactly how you would get to them but there were around.  So literally how you may go to the next town over to visit family, same concept.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you say you drove with your car down to the town, but, i&#39;d imagine car exhaust would be a BIG problem if many people were driving in to the underground town at one time, like when the world is ending. was there a parking lot area/space for everyones cars, or did they simply park them at their home? like a normal, above ground town?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IF needed like we did, one could drive in and down.  BUT, before SHTF people would drive to a location, be picked up.  And the shuttle would take everyone down before everything was locked down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>though underground transportation would have to be heavily reliant on electricity, which was made from a clean source like a geothermal vent, that had a steam engine/steam generator built over it, to provide power to the town. possibly even a mini nuclear reactor, as they&#39;ve gotten safer and cleaner over the years. or even a few of those extremely hot reactors that are placed inside of space satellites for a constant flow of heat and electricity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was steam coming from vents in the wall throughout the tunnel going down.  Also in back of the homes steam was rising also.  They did have a rail system that I didn&#39;t see in action. But I&#39;m sure other things were there also.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thx again for the info and your replies to other people. i try to take people at their word, especially when it comes to this topic. do you have the feeling that if the world were ending, your dad&#39;s friend would be inviting your dad and his family (you) down to the cave system with him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be quite honest.  No, he wouldn&#39;t.  The way he is, the way the others are...</p>

<p>I would just say, In knowing some who truly hold secrets like this, they are a group of people that I wouldn&#39;t want to be around for a long time.  As in locked in a underground town type of time.</p>

<p>And your welcome, I thank you for your honest interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is there a leadership there? what is there long term planning like? are they planning, if an event were to occur that required they take shelter, to stay under ground for decades? for centuries? because one may be prepared for with enough stores of staples/food/water/medical equipment/etc, while the other would be prepared for differently with farms (hydroponic or aquaponic, as you want to make your farming situation as efficient as possible, both with its usage of water, and its output of crops), which also would mean there&#39;d need to be factories to make parts that fail/break over their normal usage/expected life span. as well as chemistry labs to create the various powders and chemicals needed, such as medicines and cleaning fluids, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure there would be leadership if SHTF.</p>

<p>Not sure on long term planning. But it is obvious they planned things out far in advance.  </p>

<p>They have the ability to stay underground for CENTURIES.  Probably till the point they would come out eventually looking something far from us today.</p>

<p>As far as the other comments, with how large it was/is, many people believe that you need huge factories to do this and that.  Really you don&#39;t.  Especially if these factories are running today when everything is fine and you just stock away all that you would ever need period.  If you need 100 years worth of parts, well store away 500 years.  It&#39;s not like it&#39;s costing them anything (government wise).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing I will also add is: </p>

<p>A few years ago you heard about people making homes outta old missile solos etc.  These people will indeed be dead or would wish they would have died if SHTF.  </p>

<p>Even though some of the missile silo homes are VERY equipped for what they are, it is just not feasible long term like the place I went to.  It was literally a town underground.  </p>

<p>For time period, this happened in 1994.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only myself, but even if I divulged everything the names I think would cause the most problem.</p>

<p>But obviously my father, his friend and their family&#39;s. </p>

<p>There is a reason why, with all the governments around the world, and with all those in high science jobs doing unethical things, YOU RARELY hear a peep.  Rarely see anyone coming forward &#39;exposing&#39; anything.</p>

<p>Secrecy is real, and it will get you killed. </p>

<p>Just think about it, when I seen the town in 1994 it was totally constructed and operational.  Think of how long it probably took for them to dig down there and dig it out, bring in materials etc.</p>

<p>I estimate it was actually constructed about 20 years before that.  So now we are at about 1974.  </p>

<p>Every major forum has some type of spy on it. These spies aren&#39;t even necessarily employed as such.  They are bound by secrecy, they see something they know should be kept secret.  They call their superior, it&#39;s escalated, that person&#39;s information is pulled (yes without a subpoena or even close to it), and then depended upon what they divulged a phone call would occur, a visit, or a disappearance.  </p>

<p>Majority of the time a phone call is more than enough.</p>

<p>Where?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will not be divulging any information on locale.  I was 16 at the time and didn&#39;t pay a lot of attention to exacts because I didn&#39;t even know we were going anywhere even close to that.  Just thought it was a quick family getaway.  BUT I will say, I have a general idea of where, give or take a few miles distance.  I&#39;ve actually plotted it out on a map on my wall since years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was the air purification system like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea.  The slab we were on was approximately 6 football fields wide and 3 long.  With the lighting I couldn&#39;t see the ceiling if that helps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did they manage waste?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, not sure, I was 16, I was just in space land literally going nuts on what I was seeing.  But everything worked as it would have in any home.  LITERALLY noticed no difference when it came to lights, flushing toilets, taking showers etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Water purification?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How could they see outside? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t.  We traveled at approximately a 20 degree decline for about 10-15 miles.</p>

<p>The tunnel system was totally man made.  But the town area was huge.  We live on the surface of the earth, so we look up at the sky and see layers of clouds until we can&#39;t see further.</p>

<p>Much different feeling when inside the earth and looking up.  You know a ceiling is up there, but it is so high up you can&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>The slabs that made the towns was materials brought in.  But the cave it self was a natural opening.</p>

<p>They had the ability to grow their own food (farms), they had live stock that were there and been there for a while because they had to get adjusted over a few generations to be viable over the long term.  The farms also were in full operation.</p>

<p>They had over 300 years of water functionality. And over 100 years of food storage.  As far as oxygen I know that the entrance can become completely sealed, and they did have some type of man made oxygen apparatus there.  But the cave system itself seem to supply the oxygen needed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually interesting you actually asked this.  Based on my research of this, it totally contradicts what I experienced first hand.  </p>

<p>It was a very pleasant 60-70 degrees. The slab and above to ceiling (that I couldn&#39;t even see) was huge so could they temp control the entire area, maybe.  But I didn&#39;t notice any type of easily recognizable hvac systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you are still answering questions!</p>

<p>I am an electrician with interests in botany and am curious about the lighting systems which nourished the farms in particular, and the &quot;outdoor&quot; lighting systems in general.</p>

<p>What type of lighting is it? Incandescent, fluorescent, LED, or something more advanced that would be unknown to me?</p>

<p>Is the lighting system attached to a framework that extends up from the slab, hanging from the ceiling of the cavern, or  some other support system I&#39;m not conceiving of?</p>

<p>How high above the slab was the lighting situated? Was the distance from light systems to the slab different between farm areas and residential areas? Was the same type of lighting used in different areas?</p>

<p>Are the food crops grown also odd colors, like the trees?</p>

<p>You say, &quot;no one was there&quot;.  Are those farms and livestock areas automated, or were you referring solely to the residences as being devoid of other people?</p>

<p>Are the crops grown in soil, hydroponic setups, etc.?</p>

<p>Is there anything else you wish to elaborate on about the farm or lighting systems that you thought was fascinating?</p>

<p>You say the event around 2020 will change the world in hours or minutes, but suggest the elite will have plenty of time to get situated underground. I perceive this in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A cosmological event is on it&#39;s way to us that the elite are aware of and are confident of when it will arrive. (Planet of The Crossing?)</p></li>
<li><p>The event will be catalyzed by the elite themselves.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Am I in the ballpark on one of these assumptions? If not, can you elaborate any more on your 2020 statements?</p>

<p>I am greatly enjoying your thread; thank you very much for your time and your patience with us.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>In 1994, it seemed to be Fluorescent.  And it DID NOT go all the way up to the ceiling because you couldn&#39;t see up there at all.  There was lighting on the streets and walkways like standard street post.  Now even thought it look like Fluorescent, could it have been more advanced?  Of course.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How high above the slab was the lighting situated? Was the distance from light systems to the slab different between farm areas and residential areas? Was the same type of lighting used in different areas?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the lighting for the farms was different.  It was much brighter.  It looked more like LEDs, but really bright.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are the food crops grown also odd colors, like the trees?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, all the vegetation was a greenish/bluish in color.  Most were more to the bluish side than green.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, &quot;no one was there&quot;. Are those farms and livestock areas automated, or were you referring solely to the residences as being devoid of other people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was mainly speaking of the residences.  But I didn&#39;t see many people for farms/livestock of that scale.  The farms seemed to be totally automated.  Was the livestock automated?  I would say at least partially.  A light would go off, a gate would open and they would all rush into the next pen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are the crops grown in soil, hydroponic setups, etc.?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wasn&#39;t close enough to it to see. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there anything else you wish to elaborate on about the farm or lighting systems that you thought was fascinating?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lighting felt a bit uncomfortable outside the house, in a way that you knew you were feeling something not natural.  I could only imagine how people would be 100+ years under those lights.  </p>

<p>I will say it was strange on how quiet the animals were.  I mean really quiet.  The place over all with all the machinery I could see, all the homes... it was just really quiet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say the event around 2020 will change the world in hours or minutes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly, around 2020 an event will happen that will change the way we live.  In my research this doesn&#39;t seem to be the event that will change our lives in minutes or hours.  I don&#39;t see that coming until a bit later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A cosmological event is on it&#39;s way to us that the elite are aware of and are confident of when it will arrive. (Planet of The Crossing?)
The event will be catalyzed by the elite themselves.

I am greatly enjoying your thread; thank you very much for your time and your patience with us.</p>

<p>You are in the ballpark of my research.</p>

<p>Just let me say, up until a event that cosmological, everything that you see go on, on a major scale no matter the cost of human life WAS PLANNED OUT.</p>

<p>=) you are correct.  We are basically destroying we WE NEED TO survive on the surface.  </p>

<p>I.E. destroying the water, air, food supply.  But even if we didn&#39;t, climate change would be still happening =)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a <em>good</em> thing.  We&#39;re moving from the worst, most devolved age in our solar system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Tha Kali Yuga</a>, to the next, more energetically invigorated age - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvapara_Yuga">The Dvapara Yuga</a>.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t live in a singular star system as it turns out, but a binary one - the star Sirius A being the sister star to our own Sol/Sun.  These two stars revolve around one another in an orbit of about 4.5 million years.  During that time, the energetic value of each star, as well as all the planetary bodies attached to and associated with each star, changes with the proximity of each star on one another.  It’s very similar to what happened when two magnets are in varying proximity to one another.  Their energy values change depending upon where they are in relation to one another.</p>

<p>Same with each star and their planets.</p>

<p>We were previously in a time when the two stars were <em>furthest</em> apart from one another.  This created the lowest and darkest energy point in each stars’ existence.  Hence, we were/had been in what’s referred to as The Kali Yuga - The Age Of Darkness and Avarice.</p>

<p>The two stars have past their respective <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=aphelion">aphelion points</a>, however, and are now beginning to “round the corner” so to speak and making their way back around <em>toward</em> one another.  This means that, as they’re coming closer to one another, their respective energetic values are increasing.  This is why we are now entering the next age - The Dwapara Yuga.  In this age, the energy value of everyone - human and non-human alike - increases.  Human awareness and ability/sensitivity increases in this time, and the human lifespan goes from the 100 year limit as is generally the case now/today, to a <em>1000</em> year limit.  This Dvapara Yuga, incidentally, also happens to be the age when the Bible took place - the “Jesus time”, so to speak.  This is why you get so many tales of “miracles” happening during that time and so many lifespans that last literally hundreds of years - Methuselah living to nearly 970 years of age.</p>

<p>There’s lots in the bible that is fabricated bullshit.  Yes.  But there’s quite a bit of it that corresponds significantly to historical and scientific data as well.  Gotta sift and separate the wheat from the chaff in it, so to speak.</p>

<p>It’s said that we’ve “officially” just entered into the Dvapara Yuga, and this is the reason why we are seeing an influx of savants and geniuses and kids of all kinds that have amazing and impressive abilities that just did <em>not</em> happen decades ago.  We’ve only <em>just</em> entered this new time, however, so the planet and the human species won’t really begin to feel the REAL effects of the next age for a few more generations still.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  You’re pretty much right in what you’re saying, bro.</p>

<p>America, it is already starting to affect parts of Europe now.  Most of the world has always been the half empty.  Whereas America has been half full if you get the analogy.  America will see how it feels to not be half empty.... but actually empty.</p>

<p>Less than 4, actually 3 years 3 months.  But the exact as if it will be plague, war, etc., are not 100% for certain because that depends on many factors. The climate factor is a bit down the road so at least you can count that one out for a while.</p>

<p>If someone were to say to me, out of all that I know or have experienced, in my opionion what should man be more concerned with?</p>

<p>I would say, man needs to find a way back to what it means to actually live life.  Not spend life actually working for a machine.  Man needs to recapture the spirit of adventure, and this adventure has nothing to do with WAR.  Man needs to understand and internalize the will to advance the internal self, not for more <strong>stuff</strong>, not for war, but because he wants to become closer to the universe itself.</p>

<p>Can we have tech, yes and of course.  Make a hard life easier.  But we shouldn&#39;t allow it to define us.</p>

<p>Also, we all can agree you shouldn&#39;t kill, steal, or destroy someone else property.  But other than that no one should be telling you how to live your life. When man also understands this, he will walk and act in a way in which only freemen behave.</p>

<p>But it could happen from the fracking, and over drilling that is going on in America. This just by default may cause several massive earthquakes which in turn, could activate and start the ball rolling for a eruption.</p>

<p>We just drove in.  </p>

<p>It was literally in the middle of no where.  Even though I didn&#39;t see anyone, I am sure if you were to drive close to there YOU would be stopped and asked to vacant the area.</p>

<p>So to answer, no direct security that I could remember.</p>

<p>When it came to the entrance, it was huge, like 15 story building huge.  But it was open.  And the door was at least 20 or so feet thick</p>

<p>Also as mentioned, I thought we&#39;re going to crash into the side of a hill.  LITERALLY. </p>

<p>So if you were to get close enough, even 30-40 yards away, you probably wouldn&#39;t see it.  I thought we were going to crash until we literally went right through it.  </p>

<p>Of course.  I didn&#39;t see him communicate.  But obviously they knew it was him and he was allowed to be there.  I thought I conveyed this as obvious.  Sorry if I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>o_O  Yes, open.  But like I said you could stand 20-30 yards from it and YOU WOULD NOT SEE IT.  You would&#39;ve seen a HILL like I did.  They just drove right into it.  It was like a projection almost over the door itself.</p>

<p>Nope, not covered.  If you paid attention to the surrounds you would see a road with tracks going around the hills, but also going straight into it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll say that this is the less likely scenario out of all possible.  At this time they are still milking the cow.  A EMP will make it so the cow can&#39;t be milked at all.  If a EMP actually happened it would be right before the nukes fell.</p>

However something happens and he has to go up there to get something for his family (it&#39;s kind of funny that the door that he enters the real world is actually inside of a porn shop) or something and he meets this bitchy girl and they fall in love, etc. I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s people who haven&#39;t watched this, I used to watch it all the time when I was younger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>City of Ember is a movie about a bunch of people living in a deep underground city for hundreds of years. Really a pretty good movie IMHO. Worth watching. Seems to capture a lot of what you&#39;re talking about here.</p>

<p>Okay, the far fetched details.</p>

<p>First, this place you went was so top secret it was only for super VIPs - well beyond several living presidents of the USA. That&#39;s pretty gods damned super secret. And YOU and SOME GUY your DAD knows actually went there? Sorry, no. If this place was THAT super secret and off limits to &#39;normies&#39; like you and me, there&#39;s no way you&#39;d have gotten within 50 miles of the entrance. I mean, your dad would have to be a super important dude himself in order to be let in there.</p>

<p>(As an aside I dated the daughter of the head of the national air defense system back when I was in college. Yes, for real. I could name names which no doubt some people out here would pick up on. Was very interesting having conversations with that guy. He couldn&#39;t tell us until he got back that he&#39;d been shipped off to &#39;the sandbox&#39; for three weeks to figure out how to shoot down SCUD missiles. So I know just a little teensy bit about how top secret stuff is handled.)</p>

<p>Driving a gasoline car down in to the cave should have been a no-no. If that was the actual case, you&#39;d have felt a strong breeze while down there from the ventilation system.</p>

<p>20 degrees down for 10-15 miles? No. I seriously doubt that. First, when driving underground, such as in a mine, it&#39;s really difficult to tell at what angle you&#39;re driving. At 5,000 feet below the surface, the temperature is about 105F and it&#39;s humid as fuck. Dry air is highly unlikely without a massively powerful ventilation system. As someone else stated, deeper than this things get stupid hot.</p>

<p>The furthest I&#39;ve been underground is about 800 feet in a gold mine. It was cold, but the air was certainly not dry. There was water everywhere, and there was a huge ventilation system.</p>

<p>Mars? Wat. I&#39;ll go look in to the Marine Captain guy, but I&#39;m doubting that we&#39;ve got people on Mars. Given the required technology to get there, I&#39;d be astonished. Not saying it&#39;s totally impossible, but extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>Look mang, you have to start dropping some verifiable information on this. By now, I&#39;m certain people have traced your IP address and maybe even know who you are. The fact that you seem clueless about this fact (based on one of your answers to someone on this) sprays bullshit everywhere. There is no way you&#39;d have been taken to a place like this without a very clear talking to about secrecy. And I guarantee, given what I know of how our government handles potential breaches of super secret information, you would never, ever come out on to Reddit with information like this if it were actually true. You&#39;d be shut up real fast like.</p>

<p>Yes, my dad is that super important.  But not as important as his friend.  And as his son, does that make me at least some what important.  Yeah I guess you can say that.  But not important enough to get my own spot there.  So that say enough.</p>

<p>I agree.  But it was a good 60-70 degrees on the slab.  So what can I say about that.  Maybe they did have some type of cooling system throughout but I didn&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>But this wasn&#39;t a mine.  And even though I agree with your experience of going underground, this was no way like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a engineer and could even only imagine how they built inside the cave itself.  Let alone the mirage/illusion door.  So, your guess may be as good as mine.

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Marin County, CA.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not your old man I&#39;m worrying about. Honestly, it&#39;s you. I know that if I was a super super super important dude and some guy went out on the net and told a bunch of people about my secret place, I&#39;d have him disappeared. More importantly, I&#39;d have made sure anyone who knew about my secret place would know they&#39;d be disappeared if they said anything. That&#39;s anyone - including sons of important fathers.</p>

<p>So why say all this then if you&#39;re not going to give verifiable evidence? I suppose for the lulz, huh?</p>

<p>Yes I&#39;m a bit riled. I know there are underground secret places - for sure. But things of this magnitude, and on a multiple scale (meaning apparently many of them), is pretty egregious. And our statements about things happening around 2020 are bothersome.</p>

<p>So you spoke with your father about you saying things out here. He&#39;s obviously in favor of it. Okay, so do him proud and go out with a bang. Drop some real evidence and change the US, or just stop. Without your willingness to be real and verifiable about something like this, your only single motive must be the lulz you get out of leading people on.</p>

<p>Those who are going to Mars and have been (yes, you heard me), are not those who are living underground.  The underground people are those who are powerful/rich enough, but not so powerful or rich to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>And these underground towns are all over the U.S.  many in the Midwest and up by near the Canadian border going west.</p>

<p>As far as the slab we were on, there were 10 more at that location.  Not sure if they were above, or below, or next wall over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GUADELLUPE MTS. - In the 1800&#39;s, two trappers reportedly discovered a cave in the Guadellupe Mts., which they followed to a considerable depth. Hiding behind a large outcropping of rock they observed in fascination and 
horror a procession of beings in dark hooded robes enter a large cavern and bagan to chant, at which a &quot;crystal like&quot; entity descended from the stalactites above, hovered and in a multi-colored display communicated with the 
beings in some type of xylophone-like manner, until it once again ascended and was lost among the stalactites above, at which the procession descended DOWNWARD through the passage from which they had emerged.

<p>Well, on one level, you’re, of course, very correct in this.  I don’t need validation from anyone since I personally already know they exist.  However, there are a multitude of global effects that will take place upon ET disclosure, not the least of which will be the necessary and inevitable disclosure of free energy technologies - the suppressing of which I strongly feel happens to be <em>the</em> main reason why ET disclosure has most definitely <em>not</em> occurred.  The last thing TPTB want is an undermining and a destroying of the multi-<em>trillion</em> dollar fossil fuel burning industry - and the disclosing of the existence of ETs on this planet will inevitably lead to the disclosing of free energy propulsion technologies (which is what many ETs use to travel many light years across/through space), and the disclosing of free energy propulsion systems will 100% do away with the archaic fossil fuel burning industry - taking away a <em>shit</em> ton of power form the elite.</p>

<p>Vicious circle kind of thing.</p>

<p>Also, disclosing ET existence on this planet will allow for a greater opening of open communication <em>with ETs</em> - which, although I know they’re already here on this planet, it would still be cool as all  <em>fuck</em> to be able to openly talk <em>see</em> them, possibly talk w/them, etc.</p>

<p>So yes.  Although I already know ETs are real and are here, I would still very much like open disclosure to occur.</p>

<p>Explain that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They would enslave the human race, as they are already doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct and of course, but you have to realize who &quot;they&quot; in fact are...and &quot;they&quot; aren&#39;t some big, bad, scary group that has plans to take over the whole planet.  It doesn&#39;t work like that as far as the information I&#39;ve researched goes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not just <em>one</em> elite group in charge of &quot;everything&quot; on planet Earth.  No.  There are <em>various</em> (not a lot, but a few) elite &quot;PTB&quot; groups on the planet - many of which have not only different agendas, but agendas that <em>conflict</em> with one another.</p>

<p>Some of these super elite ptb groups are &quot;service to self&quot; (sts) groups that are indeed trying to cull and get rid of the human population and have the Earth all for themselves so to speak.  These are the groups that have happened to be in power for some time now.  There are also a few other super elite ptb groups that just happen to <em>not</em> be like that, however, and that happen to realize that the m.o. that the service to self groups are employing is actually self-defeating and, in the end, actually a <em>bad</em> thing - for the planet and for the species in general - so they are actively working against the &quot;immediate and direct depopulation of the human population of planet Earth&quot; agenda.</p>

<p>Shit&#39;s complicated, but even though there are indeed very powerful groups that DON&#39;T have the best interest of the general human population on Earth in mind, there are in fact certain equally powerful groups that are indeed working to keep these <em>other</em> groups from going too, too nefariously crazy w/their agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sheesh.  I can’t say that whatever speculation I might ponder would have all that much validity or worth, honestly.  I mean who are the super powerful types on the planet?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There’s, of course, the pope/the Catholic church/the Jesuits and those in charge there.  I’m sure they’re either one faction or <em>part</em> of one powerful faction.</p></li>
<li><p>There are the money changers/the Ashkenazi Khazarian fake Jews currently committing genocide in Palestine and who all but control the United States and the money supply here.</p></li>
<li><p>There are those groups linked to and overseeing NASA and the JPL.</p></li>
<li><p>I imagine the group responsible for CERN and The Large Hadron Collider definitely have their hand in some deep shit - especially w/massively occult stuff like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bjeBVStaEw">this</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woQDrs8BzZU">this</a> going on.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s the group that Marine Captain Randy Cramer belongs to that’s a covert Marine special operations section <em>not</em> accounted for by the mainstream military.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And then there are the groups that fly so under the radar that not too many people are even aware of them.</p>

<p>These are all <em>groups</em> though - organizations.  They are powerful - yes - but there are also individuals in existence that these groups can’t even really effect too much.  There are individuals in the East that are more powerful than any external group of people.</p>

<p>There are people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSx3Kb6l8k">Ram Bahadur Bomjon</a> that has shown abilities quite significant indeed.  It’s all similar to what the great Indian teacher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a> said:</p>

<p><em>The greatest men in the world have passed away unknown.  The Buddhas and the Christs that we know are but second rate heroes in comparison with the greatest men of whom the world knows nothing.</em></p>

<p>So yes.  There are indeed powerful groups all vying for control on this planet.  However, it&#39;s not impossible for the individual to exert their own level of sovereignty where can.</p>

<p>Things are very complicated on this planet, but we are still very small in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">the grander scheme of things.</a></p>

<p>Depopulation has in fact been happening for a long time.  If you look at what the &#39;government&#39; says about how many people are on the earth etc.,  They say 7 billion or so.  It is far less than this.  Believe me if you want to or not, but it is far less than this number and I know this for a fact.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really simple.  The governments of the world, and more so the rest love to say how there&#39;s are to many people on the earth etc.. etc..  </p>

<p>And they love to say there 7 billions gonna be 8 billion soon this is disastrous! What if there was really closer to 12 Billion.  And now there is 7?  Or that it was 7 billion maybe 10 years ago, now it&#39;s closer to 6?  </p>

<p>How would that make you feel?  </p>

<p>That was my point.  IT&#39;s far less than they claim, but their original claim was B.S. also.</p>

<p>Why does <em>what</em> happen at all?  The secrecy?  The existence of ETs?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wait a minute…if such a <em>what</em> were real?  ET existence?  And <em>who</em> would “shut these things off”?  The U.S.?  The military?  Who?</p>

<p>Regardless, A) such a thing as ET existence on and around planet Earth is <em>very</em> much real, and B) they’ve been around here a <em>looot</em> longer than we human beings have.  They <em>created</em> us.  So no.  We don’t really have anywhere <em>near</em> the power to just “shut them down” regardless of what we wanted one way or the other.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is exactly what you’re referring to, however, so I may not even be addressing to the specific thing you were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why do the interviewers(on both sides) usually look like crazy psycho cult members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don’t.  You’re just propagandized and haven’t dug deep enough into the subject to understand that many don’t look anything like “crazy psycho cult members”.  All you’ve done is allowed yourself to be influenced by the cointelpro that TPTB have put forth on the surface level making everyone think of UFO researchers like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lLxCoWM.jpg">this</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack">this</a> and the people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkswXVmG4xM">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So my trust in these currently available reveals is extremely low.</p>

<p>Of course it is.  It’s because, again, your understanding is only at the most superficial of surface levels on the subject where tons of cointelpro runs amok.  To be sure, tons of cointelpro runs amok at the deep levels too, but there’s a lot more reality the deeper you go as well.</p>

<p>I didn’t dv you, btw.</p>

<p>There is no “belief”.  There is intelligent and critical assessment based upon available data.  That’s a <em>far</em> different thing altogether from mere “belief”.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nobody’s talking about “facts” here.  That’s the problem.  You’re looking for nothing <em>but</em> “facts” when the truth is that in this line of inquiry and investigation, you’re going to turn up almost nothing if that’s the only thing you’re looking for.  What you have to be looking for aren’t necessarily facts as much as <em>evidence</em>.  That can present itself in various ways and be rather subtle and not easily discernible - but ultimately very valuable all the same.</p>

<p>If all one is looking for is “hard facts!” then they’re going to simply miss the entire boat altogether because the roads which lead to truth in this area of inquiry are very, <em>very</em> gossamer and not easily pinned down.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That’s actually nowhere near “the root of most of the latest stories about human colonies/mars/secret space programs”.</p>

<p>Military serviceman Bernard Mendez has gone on record talking about the same types of projects.  Brett Stillings, another individual directly involved in the military, has gone on record talking about the same types of projects.  Corey Goode talks about exactly the same thing.  Laura Eisenhower - great granddaughter of president Dwight D. Eisenhower - has gone to great lengths to describe the same type of things, and did it long before Captain Cramer ever came out publicly.  Long time Washington state attorney Andrew Basiago has gone on record talking <em>at length</em> about the very same types of technologies that Captain Cramer has.</p>

<p>…so now…what was that about Captain Cramer being “the <em>root</em> of the latest stories”?  How is that even possible when there have been so many others that have already talked about similar projects?  He’s not piggy backing on anybody else’s narrative - as the specifics of the information he has are different - but he is by far not the “only” one who’s come out talking about these types of technologies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  It very much was.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That might be a valid enough claim if Captain Cramer hadn’t received clearance from his superior officers to come out.  Cramer isn’t a whistleblower.  A whistleblower is someone who goes against the commands and rules of his/her superiors and “blows the whistle” as it were on an operation that is going on that is illegal or immoral.  Captain Cramer is actually not doing that.  He was approached by his superior officers and requested to come forward to the public and divulge the information that he is divulging.</p>

<p>That is a far, far different thing altogether from what a traditional “whistleblower” does.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This statement continues to show the deep, deep level of ignorance you have on this subject.  Your thinking that any of the names that I’ve mentioned are the type that you described above indicates that you don’t know the first thing you’re talking about and are only making random statements based on whatever it is you want to make yourself believe is true.  These are not the actions of an intelligent person - <em>at all</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also can&#39;t seriously suspend my disbelief with stuff which comes from Wilcock&#39;s ilk about sphere alliance.</p>

<p>You mention this, but you’re the only one mentioning it, as I haven’t mentioned Wilcox at all.  Corey Goode existed and came out before Wilcox.  Independent of Goode’s testimony, there is such an overwhelming number of <em>other</em> individuals that have come forward that an attempt to cherry pick someone who fits your false narrative shows nothing but a great shortcoming on your part.  Nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Things are actually <em>extremely</em> clear with regard to where you’re coming from and what you do/do <em>not</em> know.</p>

<p>And yes.  You should probably stop now, as you’ve more than shown enough in the area of how little you know about this dynamic.</p>

<p>Good.  Whatever gets you to have a more open mind.  :)</p>

<p>Crazy times these are.  Crazy times.  Sucks that so many of us humans on this planet are kept from knowing about so very much that&#39;s really going on in existence.

<p>Seems like a word is missing here...who is forbidden to speak their names?  The media?  You?</p>

<p>Are these names we have heard such as Rothschild and Kissinger or names we have never heard?</p>

<p>Edit: I tend to think that OP is telling the truth.  A friend of mine, whom I trust implicitly, told me that when he worked as a cabbie he once drove a man way out to the middle of nowhere in PA and the man paid him, got out, walked a few steps and disappeared.  Not like he vanished in puff of smoke, but he was there one minute, gone the next, like he just walked through an invisible door.</p>

<p>I would never speak the name my father told me.  The names aren&#39;t meant to be said publicly in any form.  And if someone did, it would be immediately known, flagged, and that person would be gone.</p>

<p>No these are play names for the little people to think they know someone, something.  Rothschild and the rest of the names you would know have Employer(s).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll expose something here that you have never heard anywhere before.  That this is known once you start to amass great  enough power that you become a world threat.</p>

<p>To put you in your place, they would just show up.  Literally, just show up.  And they will show you for an example, you as a child and your mom rocking you (of course you&#39;ll be like WTF how the hell did you get a camera in there), but then they&#39;ll show you at a place/time where you were alone or with someone in a peculiar situation (and again you&#39;ll be like WTF how is this even possible!).  </p>

<p>From that point, 99.99999999999999% of people will obey.</p>

<p>No need for threats, not need for saying anything.  They will disappear as quickly as they appeared and you&#39;ll know to do as you&#39;re told.  Period.</p>

<p>This I would disagree with wholly.  Man is very powerful when he wants to be.  Problem is, is that he is more concerned with Race, Religion, Class and Gender.  Because of this, he has been and will continue to be manipulated for millennia. </p>

<p>They typically control those who want to rise within their world, or those who would serve their purposes greatly.</p>

<p>If you are a man (including women), that can not be bought or sold, a person who see&#39; past the bullshit as Class, Race, Gender, Religion and any mixture of their crap.</p>

<p>If you want humanity as a whole to live FREE as they CHOSE without the overlords and you do not have FEAR of this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been researching these topics for many years, and the time has come to start doing my part to inform others about what I&#39;ve learned. As always, cross reference claims you see with other sources you dig for.</p>

<ol>
<li>Some - not all - ultra-elite that are perpetuating above top secret and unacknowledged programs are Luciferian worshippers in nature.</li>
<li>Because of [1] this negative polarity bias, what they perceive will be evil in nature, similar to the double slit experiment, as in quantum physics studies. (i.e. matter at its most elemental nature that is observed behaves differently than when it is not observed, and what observations can/not be concealed etc.)</li>
<li>The ultra-elite DO have access to future event prediction technologies, so they have looked into the future, but those technologies are apparently affected by said double slit quantum effects.</li>
<li>Put 1 - 3 together, and you end up with <em>perceived</em> negative world ending events, that might happen to the observer, but not actually occur for the vast majority of the world&#39;s population.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many possible global catastrophes, giant meteor, coronal ejection from the sun (massive super heated &quot;flame/s&quot; swinging out from our sun hitting the earth, at best frying all electronics, at worst frying everyone on the surface), pole shift leading to global volcanoes and earthquakes and a magnetic shift of the North and South poles... etc etc. Point is, these are all scenarios the ultra elite have witnessed, but as per my points 1 - 4 above, there is ZERO <em>certainty</em> any of these will happen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They have warehoused 100+ years of food and have livestock plus multiple farms.  If in fact they couldn&#39;t live on the surface even after 100 years they still would have more than enough food/water for much much longer.</p>

<p>Great question!  Without exact since I&#39;ve only been once,  it would have to a mix match of probably nuclear (nasty but dependable) or thermo (great, but not as dependable).  </p>

<p>I know what you were getting at, but thank you for clarifying.  I am not a engineer, especially a nuclear physicist or the like, so even if I did see some large machinery, what could I really tell you?</p>

<p>My father had sad when I asked him years later (Approx. year 2002), he stated &quot;that it was because of government being unstable and some hinted to climate related catastrophes.&quot;</p>

<p>We stayed for (2) days and I have never been back.  When I was there I played basketball.  They had a full tennis court, and track.  I&#39;m sure in the homes people had whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>No, the slab we were in was about 3 football fields long, about 6 football fields wide.  The door to enter was completely hidden, more like miraged.  YOU WOULD NOT NOTICE from the outside unless you absolutely knew what you were looking for.  I thought we were going to crash into the side of a hill.  It looked like it did have a huge door that closed but it was open when we came in, and when we eventually departed.</p>

<p>There are always trump cards in play.  But will it change the inevitable?  That I can&#39;t say.  </p>

<p>How do I prepare, or spend my time?  I prepare based on what I have to do what I feel I need to do if within the normal range of things happen.  What do I spend most of my time on? I spend most of my time on task that enrich the spirit.</p>

<p>These types of events are in my Celestial category.  There is a celestial event that high up at NASA have been plotting for a while (this is classified).  </p>

<p>But of course other celestial events could happen anytime OUT OF NO WHERE, and these I would have no idea of.  </p>

<p>I will say this, that I sense from you that it&#39;s not about can secrets be held, BUT more less WHY hasn&#39;t anyone said anything, do they care what their doing etc.</p>

<p>Why do I say I sense this, it is because I felt this way myself for a very long time.  It was frustrating, and it in fact made me very angry.  Because it shows how evil people really are to do certain things to their fellow man.</p>

<p>Just think about how much the MSM lies.  They refuse to tell the truth on certain topics purposely.  And they do this time and time again.  Think all the news anchors that collaborate the lies.</p>

<p>And these people aren&#39;t even swore to secrecy.</p>

<p>Do you know how many declassified documents are still being released from the 50&#39;s that tell how governments and even the medical establishment was doing experiments on people.  And some of these experiments were horrific. </p>

<p>And guess what?  You didn&#39;t hear a peep of any of this until those documents become declassified.  If you&#39;re in the  military and having experienced secrecy at this level, you are not even close to being high enough up the chain (kindly).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a level of secrecy so far beyond day to day existence that these kinds of secrets keep themselves. Part of it is people can&#39;t believe they know such a thing and so only ever share it with those who already know. We all experience this in our lives at one point, or many.  There&#39;s no need to posit &quot;special&quot; secret keeping abilities - it&#39;s a fact of human nature and easily manipulable for those who study it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a bit about some of these organizations and they don&#39;t think in years or decades they think in centuries and millenia. So do I. And that makes touching certain parts of human nature very, very easy. But to say I understand how they think would be too generous...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not vouching for this story given the few details, but I do know about our <em>honeycomb earth</em>, it&#39;s not as some erroneously describe as hollow earth. Imagine how many people live on the surface and limited to our continents (about 7 billion). Honeycomb style chambers hundreds of miles deep, in many layers under our oceans too, means you could easily fit <strong>Q</strong>uadrillions of people, even with a certain buffer depth above the core. Then of course you need to start thinking about their craft to reach such depths efficiently.</p>

<p>But the people living in the underground towns were created with government ingenunity and with VERY long term planning in mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know specifics on the water system, but I do know it will last well over 300 years.  And they have over 100 years of food.  This is based on 3 meals a day with at proper nutrition standards. And they can grow their own food, they have live stock etc.</p>

<p>SILO people have none of this.  The most high tech silo I&#39;ve seen was GREAT for a family, living in complete isolation and if the outside would be livable withing a relative short period of time, cool.  </p>

<p>Long period of time.  Nope.  Just not large enough to accommodate the equipment, food, water that is needed for extreme long term isolation.</p>

<p>The Slabs were their own towns, own commodities and if they were actually living in them now, could trade with the above ground people as if they were the local town down the road.</p>

<p>You&#39;re looking at things from SCI-FI tv based assumptions (kindly).  Most things on the consumer level, there are equivalent things of much better quality if you know where to buy.  Things were not old.  And remember, it is not liked they are closed off now.  They can still bring in anything they want if certain systems need to be upgraded etc.</p>

<p>20 degrees down for 10-15 miles? No. I seriously doubt that. First, when driving underground, such as in a mine, it&#39;s really difficult to tell at what angle you&#39;re driving. At 5,000 feet below the surface, the temperature is about 105F and it&#39;s humid as fuck. Dry air is highly unlikely without a massively powerful ventilation system. As someone else stated, deeper than this things get stupid hot.</p>

<p>I agree.  But it was a good 60-70 degrees on the slab.  So what can I say about that.  Maybe they did have some type of cooling system throughout but I didn&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>The furthest I&#39;ve been underground is about 800 feet in a gold mine. It was cold, but the air was certainly not dry. There was water everywhere, and there was a huge ventilation system.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not your old man I&#39;m worrying about. Honestly, it&#39;s you. I know that if I was a super super super important dude and some guy went out on the net and told a bunch of people about my secret place, I&#39;d have him disappeared. More importantly, I&#39;d have made sure anyone who knew about my secret place would know they&#39;d be disappeared if they said anything. That&#39;s anyone - including sons of important fathers.</p>

<p>So why say all this then if you&#39;re not going to give verifiable evidence? I suppose for the lulz, huh?</p>

<p>Yes I&#39;m a bit riled. I know there are underground secret places - for sure. But things of this magnitude, and on a multiple scale (meaning apparently many of them), is pretty egregious. And our statements about things happening around 2020 are bothersome.</p>

<p>So you spoke with your father about you saying things out here. He&#39;s obviously in favor of it. Okay, so do him proud and go out with a bang. Drop some real evidence and change the US, or just stop. Without your willingness to be real and verifiable about something like this, your only single motive must be the lulz you get out of leading people on.</p>

Then these effers can lock themselves underground, we can go back to living peaceful lives. Idk what we do with the nationwide underground townships of psychopaths, but as long as they&#39;re locked in there, is that our problem? Does this logic make me a psychopath too? Can&#39;t we all just get along!?</p>

<p>They are not, but the tech they use allows them to see more than what they should.</p>

<p>Many want to know can the world be changed, can control be taken away from them.  </p>

<p>Short answer YES.  But it will come with major consequences. </p>

<p>That’s according to the history that your school books indoctrinated you to believe are “the” way things were.  History is written by the <del>winners</del> marauders.  Always remember that.</p>

<p>Might want to learn how to at least spell and construct proper grammatical sentences before attempting any critical statement in the future.</p>

<p>Good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand the pros/cons about each of these scenarios. But I also know that many people exist in &#39;leadership&#39; roles, who THINK they have the intelligence and experience needed to make the greater choice on behalf of many other citizens. Recent history, and most of history has shown us that most times, these &quot;leaders&quot; are vastly unexperienced, largely unintelligent, and many times, corrupt.</p>

<p>North America and South America, includes Canada along with Mexico and many other countries.</p>

<p>But yes, when people think of America, they think of only the United States.</p>
