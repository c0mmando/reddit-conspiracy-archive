        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html">CDC&#39;s data</a>, the rate of autism has been going up. While the rate was 1 in 150 children in 2000, it is 1 in 68 children as of 2012. Using a quadratic regression model, we should expect it to be all children by 2148 (assuming the slope won&#39;t be asymptotic).</p>

<p>So what is causing it? Neurotoxins? Vaccines? Fluoride? Chemtrails? Estrogen poisoning from womens&#39; birth control? If we don&#39;t get to the bottom of this, civilization will collapse. Of course, liberals love to obfuscate the problem, with propaganda such as the notion that &quot;it&#39;s just getting diagnosed more&quot;. They DENY the problem exists. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s deliberate (as in liberals wane for the collapse of civilization), or if it&#39;s willful ignorance. But it&#39;s scary that this is happening, and we need to take every precaution necessary to avoid such a catastrophe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just that more people are being diagnosed, it&#39;s the fact autism used to be identified as a single disorder. Now there is an entire spectrum. Previously, people were only diagnosed if they were at the far end, close to non functioning. These days, autism counts as everything from aspergers to the original idea of autism. So it is getting diagnosed more because the restrictions of what autism is were widened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s called &quot;Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot; because it&#39;s diagnosed on a spectrum so many more people are diagnosed. </p>

<p>This is similar (but not identical) to people saying more people get cancer now. No, we&#39;re just better at diagnosing it. When was the last time you heard of someone dying of &quot;old age.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, we need to not harm nature so that it doesn&#39;t harm us. But oftentimes, bioethics is hinged upon an unwarranted sympathy towards animals, when they are not capable of complex emotions or rational thought. Princeton bioethics professor Peter Singer outright considers infants to not be fully human, and favors 4th trimester abortions, because infants lack &quot;rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness&quot;. I extrapolate the same philosophy towards animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty fucked up in my opinion. I mean we don&#39;t need to get in a whole debate over it or anything, but the idea of anthropocentrism just sounds like humans thinking they are far more special than we are. Like sure we are conscious, we aren&#39;t immortal. We are equally subject to the vices of nature as any other beings or otherwise floating through space. Moreover, if we are special - the only conscious life on earth - perhaps even life on earth alone unique - then shouldn&#39;t we do what is possible to protect the life around us whether it is our own or otherwise? If you ask me, we nurture this crazy random happenstance life in abundance rather than neglect any that we can&#39;t identify with.
But hey, you didn&#39;t ask me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what you just said is right wing republican religious bullshit propaganda. There&#39;s really no solid evidence that animals don&#39;t have souls and if you ask me they do. And I&#39;m a pantheist, I believe in a god that&#39;s synonymous with nature, which means that everything that is is part of &quot;god&quot; and thus divine. I&#39;m not trying to convince you of anything and  I really couldn&#39;t care less whether you think I&#39;m wrong, but if you&#39;ve got nothing else going on and you&#39;ve got interest, do a little reading on pantheism (non to be confused with panentheism, totally different). If nothing else you&#39;ll be educated on a topic you disagree with and be able to argue against it better. Just throwing it out there, I think pantheism can be a happy medium where we can co exist happily with nature.</p>

<p>Actually, according to the bible:</p>

<p><em>Then God said, &quot;Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.&quot;</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s interpreted by a lot of people as saying that we can do whatever we want to animals. We&#39;re their rulers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s far more despicable in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is. To think that we as humans were given the ability to decide what animals live or die is absurd.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lots of animals would fuck us up. Most would. Humans are shit without tools to defend ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Just like people say to BLM, <strong>all</strong> lives matter. The human race will learn that soon enough if we keep fucking this planet up and wiping out species left and right. Shit, if the bees go, we&#39;re almost pretty much fucked in some ways.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The sooner people begin to actually question their beliefs, the sooner we can get back to fixing the world. Too many people have world views that allow them to lack empathy for other people and creatures because &quot;God made the world for us and I&#39;m going to heaven when I die so fuck this place and everything in it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So what is causing it? Neurotoxins? Vaccines? Fluoride? Chemtrails? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A combo of all of them, and it&#39;s mostly only in the U.S. If you go anywhere outside the U.S., or particularly into countries that don;t use the same vaccines/companies/schedules as they do in the U.S., then you hardly find autism there.</p>

<p>So its mostly an American problem, and a problem wherever they implement the same vaccines/schedule, glyphosate levels in the air/food/water</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s called &quot;Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot; because it&#39;s diagnosed on a spectrum so many more people are diagnosed. </p>

<p>This is similar (but not identical) to people saying more people get cancer now. No, we&#39;re just better at diagnosing it. When was the last time you heard of someone dying of &quot;old age.&quot;  </p>
