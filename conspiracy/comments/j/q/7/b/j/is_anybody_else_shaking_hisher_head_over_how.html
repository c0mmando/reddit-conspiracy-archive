       I have stated before that I was an active protester of the bush wars (before and during, I was arrested multiple times for sit-ins and roadblocks, all nonviolent). the war in libya reminds me of soviet shit in their former westward territories, but it's proximity to europe is unsettling, also that it was one of the few secular arabic/african governments in a majority islamic region, the whole deal just sounds fucked to me, total resource grab.
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact that the "progressives" and "liberals" are okay with black man obama bombing libya and killing osama makes my fucking head spin, the people that i thought stood beside me back in the bush days today are hollow shells, it's like talking to a fucking wall. idiotic.
      </p>
      <p>
       but yeah, calling bombing runs kinetic actions instead of war while arming the terrorist groups that will one day set their sights on america for the sake of cheap oil for europe in exchange for favorable dealings when it comes to americas fiat currency dominance sort of pisses me off, especially when people pretend it's for "humanitarian" reasons, have you fuckwits not understood 1984? shit, I read that in middle school. it's issues like these that i realise how truly dominated the american public is by utter fucking big lie bullshit.

       Yeah, I'm ashamed to be an American. They have killed the Libyan people, taken their country, at the orders of the oil companies because Gaddafi threatened to increase the royalties they paid and give all the money to the Libyan people. Also Libya was a socialist republic and the global plutocracy can't allow any system that doesn't enrich them. If I was young I would move, but move where? The plutocracy controls the world now, doing evil everywhere, dictating terms, driving the working people back into the dust. We are all screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't tell me Gaddafi and Libya were repressive. They were nothing compared to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and other dictatorships around the world. The capitalist plutocracy allows/encourages any kind of repression as long as their puppet rulers can be used to grind down their people so they, the global capitalists, can steal their resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, with the American people no longer buying "terrorism" in large enough numbers, they are resurrecting the Soviet Union, despite it being long deceased, because they must always have an enemy and they can conjure one up from the dead as easy as make up one from the living.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am ashamed of the American people, ashamed of Obama (who I will NEVER vote for again), ashamed of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya ever think about Obama. He was born and bred by the plutocracy, his father brought over from Africa so he wouldn't be politically active there, married to a CIA agent/asset, then when Barry was born he was raised and trained by the CIA and Rockefeller interests to know how to tell the right lies, and do whatever evil he was told to. He is as much a puppet as any tin-horned dictator controlled by foreign capitalists.

       Osama probably died 5 to 7 years ago. I think you're talking about how they claimed they killed Osama and dumped his body in the ocean, even though the guy who owned builds in the area said he didn't believe Osama could have have possibly lived there.

       This is why Americans and Europeans deserve what's going to happen to them. Economic collapse.

       I was on a 3 hour car drive with some friends the other day.  I don't remember how we got on the topic of actual news as opposed to their training of boyfriends (
       <em>
        facepalm
       </em>
       ) but I explained in very brief detail what they had mentioned and the immediate response was "oh, no debby downer bullshit" and that was it. I just sat in silence for a long time thinking about how common that reaction is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the masses know what's going on, they try to ignore it as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we won't see anything happen until shit hits their doorsteps.  Like Majid83 says below, something like economic collapse.

       Uggh I know someone like that.  Perfectly thrilled to discuss the latest episode of Glee into oblivion but mention some actual important world events and it's all "meh let's not get into that, it's depressing/boring/I-don't-know-enough-about-it-to-talk (but would prefer you would

       This war is portrayed as oppressed people overthrowing the bad guy and living happily ever after. It's a hollywood plot. Naturally people root for the protagonist.

       That's really the objective of propaganda. You use it initially, whether it's directly about the issue at hand, or whether it is all the preliminary and external stuff that sets up the kind of worldview you want your target audience to have and keeps them distracted, so that they're practically self-regulating.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are undoubtedly propagandists on the internet, particularly on reddit which has proven itself to be a powerful entity for social change (the rally to restore sanity on its own should be evidence of it's power - even if the rally hasn't made a clearly observable difference, just being able to muster that many people is significant), so it would be batshit insane and willfully stupid NOT to have people on here trying to influence readers. And it's likely propagandists from all sorts of organizations with an interest in manipulating people. You have marketers on here for sure, and several of them have been outed or have outed themselves. But they're really only needed to tweak and prod and adjust and regularly maintain a particular concept or theme because good propagandists make the target audience self-regulating to minimize the amount of work needed (among other reasons).

       Man I'm glad you pointed that out because I was just reading the 'happiest day in months' thread, and I was just thinking this guy sounds a hell of a lot like a propagandist in not just his stance on the matter, but the way he phrases his replies.

       It's so disheartening; you know if you voice your concerns or suspicions, people will marginalize you into oblivion once it's clear it's going against the popular fantasy.  I suppose that's just how life works, but it sucks.

       It sucks, and it is
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       way that life can work. There are ways to achieve your goals and circumvent the propaganda techniques. It just requires a little more thought. Most importantly is to have the facts on your side. Facts and logic. Evidence. Strong arguments. Even if the people living in a fantasy world can't hear them or aren't able to hold them in mind, there are methods of dissociating them from the brainwashing/hypnosis/propaganda just long enough to get the point across. But you've got to do it right, and you've got to be professional about it as far as PR/personal-image stuff goes.

       It's amazing how people can ignore the fact that the U.S. is dropping bombs on 6 countries.  Obama supporters that I know can't name a damn thing they like about the man, but the sure do LOVE him. Other than barely passing a watered-down health care reform bill, in spite of having a clear majority in the House and the Senate, Obama is as much of a puppet as Bush.

       I've been in a few recent real life arguments from people that STILL support him.  Not only that, they say that he's done a good job.  When I ask them what he's done that could possibly be construed as "good" it devolves into the standard "look at the hand he was dealt" argument.

       I was prepared to reluctantly vote for him again; partially because he scares me less than say... Michelle Bachman, partially in the hope that as a lame duck he'd be more willing to take the gloves off and force a few things.  Honestly, I still think that as a person, he is (was) sincere about wanting to improve the US for everyone.  Honestly, I still think that he had NO idea what he was getting into.  And though I knew ahead of time that they were probably going to make him just as much a tool of the corporate interests as the last guy, I hoped he'd be able to fight against it.  But he surrounded himself with sharks and is at the mercy of whatever they feed him, and buys into the illusion that's force fed to the rest of us about how America is so great, and of course we're not going to do anything to other countries that's not completely justified!  But now... I'm having a hard time telling whether he's been corrupted by the position or if he's just a LOT more gullible than I originally thought he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think he is (was?) a good man and that he honestly wanted and tried to do what's right. But whether he's being duped, used, manipulated, or just has been changed by the fact of being President, at this point I feel sorry for
       <em>
        him
       </em>
       that we elected him and put him in that position.  And he's going to serve as the human shield for all the hatred and anger because of all that's going on so that everyone can feel justified in voting for someone else next time, who will serve the same purpose.  He was my one remaining glimmer of faith in the election process, but I guess I'll just stay home from now on.  It doesn't matter who wins, and it probably never did.

       Chillax, bro. I already said I'm not voting for him again, I was just illustrating
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       I thought there might be hope for something decent to happen with this one.  Clearly, I was mistaken.  Not about his character, but about his ability to shake up the structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure your comparison is accurate there though.  Unless the boss in that scenario is the manager who hired the employee, then stood by while he continually kept getting screwed by the board of directors who effectively prevented him from doing his job, then the boss fired him for incompetence.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr I think the defect is not with Obama himself (at least I didn't think so originally; now I'm not as positive as I was) but that anyone being put in that job is subject to the same shit.  His biggest problem is thinking the people advising (read: 'controlling') him have either his or our best interests in mind.

       I just shake my head to all of this, I didn't support Canada's role in any of this either. It's 100% all about money and resource security and anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't deserve the air they're wasting. Even just the way the governments were stating how they weren't breaking any laws because they changed the name of operations, and after all this and the rebels move in, once they get setup they'll just start killing each other off. As long as Petro-Can gets it's oil we're all good though. I read something too about a Canadian built jail there, I'll have to find the link. If this was for millisecond about human life then we would be in Syria right now stomping the fuck out of their army, who are openly killing civvies, yet because the footage is "unverified" the media doesn't give a fuck and waters it all down, true independent journalism simply dismissed because mainstream media can't claim it as their own. I really wish people would look into the whole Dinar situation makes sense why the US would want to get rid of him.

       Thats the same video that got me looking into all of this. When you think about it and how fragile America is it really makes perfect sense. Basically if Libya was successful at introducing that it would systematically screw over the USA because they would not be able to purchase oil form them but only by fault of their own with putting faith into a worthless stamped piece of metal and paying interest on it all.

       Burma, Syria, Zimbabwe, Congo. All have brutal dictators. The west leaves them alone, why? Because they either follow the wests command or they dont have oil. This is a picture of the President of Europe with Gadaffi

       None of those countries are staging coups. None of the media organizations are referring to the troops as "NATO troops" or "US troops," they are rebels. This is a civil war being staged by the populace.  The reason NATO started fighting in Libya is because Gaddafi announced a
       <em>
        cease fire
       </em>
       and then
       <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42164455/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/?gt1=43001#.TlJcJai2qa4">
        broke it
       </a>
       against
       <em>
        his own citizens
       </em>
       when his troops started trying to take Benghazi. It's not a matter of "we used to be cool with him," it's a matter of protecting civilians. All NATO targets have been military installations such as tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have also been uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Kuwait, and Lebanon. In every case, I support the
       <em>
        people's rule,
       </em>
       not a single head of state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gadaffi is a ruler whose own people call for his head on a stake and he stills vows not to relinquish command. This is democracy in action - the citizens of Libya are pulling one of

       Unfortunately the west does not have the resources to invade every dictatorship and I do not know how practical those interventions would be, but they likely would not be as simple as airstrikes and naval blockades supporting a popular uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless and this may sound unfortunate but, does it matter why the west is intervening if it does in fact mean greater freedom for Libya? This was not started by the west after all.

       Well fair enough, but it's not that simple and I still don't think you would or that you know anything about living there. Neither do I in fact, but I do know that the people there chose to protest their leader and were killed in large numbers in response.

       All the infrastructure that oil wealth can afford does not change the fact that your leader would allow you virtually none of the rights you are currently experiencing.

       Libya's has(had) free health care and education for the people and subsidized housing.  Education was completely free in Libya. Libyans could study at home or abroad and the government gives them a monthly stipend while they are in school and they pay no tuition. If a Libyan needs a surgery that must be done overseas, then the government will pay for that surgery. Libyans were given a small sum of money on a yearly basis, usually  around the equivalent of $500 U.S. dollars. The Libyan government had NO national debt. If you want to get to the real reason for the war. Do some research on how Qadaffi was making the move to have the Libyan Dinar take the place of the U.S. dollar as main trading currency in Africa and throughout the Middle East. Check out this

       EVERY country has a rebel minority who want to over throw the government by whatever means necessary. The difference in Libya is that the CIA pumped millions of dollars into propping up the rebels to make them into "freedom fighters" in contrast to "terrorists". The media spin the story until you think what they are doing is a just cause. Go read "Confessions of an Economic Hitman". It will make you realise the level of propaganda that exists in international relations today.

       True or not it does not imply an equivalence between every cause the CIA supports. It does not change the fact that Gaddafi was a literal mad man, or that we can only speculate on the level of public support in Libya.

       Mad man? How so? Was he engaged in military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Egypt, Syria and most likely Iran by the end of the year? Insanity? That would be thinking that the U.S. is or has dropped bombs on all those nations simply for the good of the people. It's not about freedom, it's about money, power, natural resources, and concentrating the wealth of the world into as few hands as possible. You can think what you want, I'm done here.

       Look I agree with you I really do, my intention was not to defend the US motivation for the attacks
I'm simply saying that the end result is not necessarily bad, it's unknown at this point what will happen. And your point about the insanity of US foreign policy doesn't change the state of human rights in Libya.

       In fact Qaddafi must be a great guy, I love him because the mainstream media told me not to, let's just let him do whatever the fuck he wants!

       There are a lot of facts that support the conclusion that Col. Gaddhafi improved the quality of life for the Libyan people 100-fold.  They have free education now. Free health care. No homeless population - all Libyan families (with the exception of the nomadic Bedouin) have a home, and I believe most also have a car.  The literacy rate is now somewhere around 86% compared to around 20% before he took over.  He brought water into the desert with a huge irrigation effort. and provides anyone who wishes to be a farmer with land, equipment, and seeds.  He nationalized the oil, and every Libyan citizen gets a percentage of the sale of the country's oil.  He's been working on behalf of Africa to help the African nations unite, pool their resources and become a world power instead of so often being dependent on foreign aid and colonialist policies.  All the money from Libya's oil reserves is invested in building Libya and Africa and improving the quality of life for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not sitting around in gold-dripping palaces.  He lives in compounds and tents, for pete's sake.  Is he perfect? No. But these are the actions of a man who has spent the past 40 years trying to do right on behalf of Libya, and succeeding in many ways.  This whole 'brutal, oppressive dictator' thing is a huge stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       His humanitarian record may not be perfect, but neither is the US's, and quite frankly, the population of Libya have been enjoying benefits that US citizens would kill to have.  They have free education.  We're locking people up for enrolling their children in the 'wrong' school.  They have free health care, and if they do not have the capacity to perform a necessary procedure for a citizen, he/she will be flown out to another country to have it done and paid for.  The crime rate is virtually nonexistent.  We have 10% of our entire population in prison.  All these things were made possible under Gaddafi's leadership.  So you will pardon me if I don't buy the "he randomly kills his own people" BS story.  This is a man who has worked too hard on behalf of the welfare of his people for that to even make any sense.

       You're right, and I have read a lot about the good things he has done for his country recently and agree with many of his socialist policies.. however such conditions are pretty typical of oil rich nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is not that he is wasteful or surrounded by luxury, he is an authoritarian dictator.
He doesn't randomly kill his own people, just all the ones who disagree with him. Dissent is illegal, assassinations are relatively common, the prisons are full of political prisoners and freedom of speech is virtually non existent.

       Libya actually has an opportunity to modernize now.

       Fair enough, and I'm not going to stand here and say that that doesn't happen.  From what I understand, dissent and opposition are pretty much quelled where they crop up.  But I compare that to his policies of actually making life better for the Libyan people, and the fact that some of his policies threaten the western economies, and I remain open to the possibility that the 'dissidents' may well be provocateurs set up to distort his image in the world media and provide justification for the sorts of things that we're seeing from NATO now.  I could be dead wrong, I freely admit that.  But when a leader tries to steer his nation away from under the influence of western hegemony and dependence, it threatens western economy and the illusion of absolute dominance around the globe.  They will do whatever they need to to make sure a thorn in their side is removed.  But in order to move in and attack someone in a sovereign nation, it
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to appear justified, else the entire world would speak out against it, and the image of Europe and America as the bastions of justice and freedom would be destroyed.

       YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm on the front page being massively downvoted.  I don't know if it's some kind of massive PR campaign or if they are just the mass idiots who only watch MSNBC and CNN or maybe a combo of both.  Why is it that americans complain that US Govt is destroying their way of life but when the US Govt wants to overthrow the Libyan Govt and then destroy the libyans way of life too...then it's cool and it's freedom and blah blah blah.   I think americans need to make up their minds just what they believe.  I think americans talk a lot of bull but when it comes down to it, they believe what their own politicians say.

       Theres no point getting angry about it no point calling people sheep, it just alienates them. I'll say at this point i completely disagree with the libyan offensive, i dont disagree with the UN resolution, but i disagree with the usage of that UN resolution as a fig leaf for regime change. Especially since the rebels story is becoming murkier (the death of general Younis) and amnesty international has said there were no mass rapes etc. The reasons for it are amply clear as well, oil/africom ghaddafi flipping the bird to the US. 
TL:DR
agreed, but dont alienate the people who can help to change whats happening

       Yes.  For those here who don't know what smugness means, consider the alternate version of the title:

       "Is anyone else here not feeling superior enough today?  Let's find people who would dare disagree with us, then label them as inferior.  Also, just so we sound like adults, we'll pretend the submission has something to do with some war we've never bothered to look at in depth from all sides"

       Thanks - that helps a ton.   I had thought that these two wars were as different as WWI vs the grenada invasion and that any comparison between the two was ludicrous.  But I guess not.

       feeling that this whole situation is producing.
