<p>You mean the actual, tangible commodities and not the digital/paper trail in the NYSE, etc.? Probably already is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That will be a possibility as more and more people &quot;wake up&quot;. (I know the phrase is overused; but it&#39;s used incorrectly most of the time.) But it won&#39;t be as it appears. If this <em>does</em> happen it will to only cover up the source, like they are doing with Islam and the middle east.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, the physical stock piles. i think i remember reading an article about the COMEX being nearly dry. even the US Mint has been running out of silver. and then there&#39;s the private company stockpiles, which are doing much better, but then again, they don&#39;t sell their silver as a fractional reserve.</p>

<p>fractional reserve lending needs to be made illegal. it&#39;s a greedy pyramid banking scheme first created by Jewish goldsmiths...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the stockpiles should never dwindle as they do. the price should always reflect the available physical reserves. the price should simply go up until people stop buying it, that&#39;s the only way to have a balanced reserve. the fact that the reserves aren&#39;t balanced, and priced, according to production indicates fixing...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much, but appearances hold no power. At some point you have to look at <em>who</em> it is really, &quot;Jewish&quot; doesn&#39;t even begin to describe them. I&#39;m sure you have an idea of who I am referring to.</p>

<p>Silver went over $42.5 before the NYSE opened up this morning. That&#39;s 3$ gain in the last 2 days. This time last year it was ~17$ an oz. 2009 it was around 7-8$.</p>

<p>Same with gold. Gold is up 65$ in the last 3 days. 1 year up over 600$. Over 10 years up 800% - or 1600$.</p>

<p>Lots of people buying/stocking, and everyone making paper on fraudulent stock.</p>

<p>Gold is probably going to be over $2,000+ before the end of the year. And silver will rise accordingly until the very end where it takes long jumps.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is anything we can do at this point except spread the truth little by little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point about the speculators, but people who are going long are a different matter; they aren&#39;t trying to get rich, they are hedging against the collapse. They don&#39;t expect to need that gold until the US as we know it is long gone, and hopefully NWO as well. Of course most goldbugs won&#39;t survive, and there will be buried treasures aplenty for the new generation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, if confiscation happens it means you either trade it in for whatever the government is offering (probably current spot price), or you hide it for an undetermined amount of time until it&#39;s deregulated.</p>

<p>if you hide it, and wait past the given turn-in date, you&#39;d have to sell it on the black market. if you got caught with it after the turn-in date you&#39;d probably just lose it, maybe a slight chance of prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it has made some legitimate gains. though it seems when it hits the $40 range it gets a lot of resistance, more than what consumers could account for imo. it seems to move pretty freely at anything under $40, but once in that range seems totally artificial...</p>

<p>how much gold a dollar can buy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more paper that gets printed, the less it is worth, the more it takes to buy gold or any other item, even a loaf of bread. I&#39;m thinking of getting a new wheelbarrow, but I&#39;ll just have to settle on repairing the old one, to carry funds to buy that loaf of bread. Greenspan says we can just keep printing more.</p>
