       A few years back there was a BBC interview with Benazir Bhutto who was at that time, I believe running for president of Pakistan.  She stated that there were threats on her life.  When asked who was issuing these threats, she stated very clearly that the people who murdered Osama bin Laden were after her too.  As you may recall she was killed in a motorcade by an assassin.  The interview that was eventually aired removed her reference to bin Laden.  The whole interview can still be found on youtube.

       There is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       objective evidence of his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government's story changed some 4 or 5 times in the first 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The faked picture of Obama and Hillary and Co watching the attack. I particularly like Hillary's look of shock, that was later explained as a sneeze when it was revealed that it would have been impossible for anyone to actually watch the attack inside the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       The helicopter crash is still a big WTF to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       No interviews (even distorted to hide identity) with the alleged attack team.
      </p>
      <p>
       They shot Bin Laden for no apparent reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have is the government's
       <em>
        appeal to authority
       </em>
       about the attack. Sorry, but logical fallacies do not impress me as "proof" of
       <em>
        anything

       Not disputing what you are saying, but what were the four or five changes to the story?  I didn't pay much attention to the whole thing, so I didn't see it spilling out as it occurred.

       I paid attention because its pretty common knowledge in the spook community that Osama died back in '02. I wanted to see what "proof" they offered.

       Does anyone feel like they're in a weird Orwellian time?  I can't believe people reacted to this by getting wasted and cheering for his assassination.  1. No evidence that we actually killed him 2. The story repeatedly changed and sounded absurd to being with and 3. We executed OBL while he was unarmed.  What happened to a trial and the rule of law?
      </p>

       Things like this make me feel like we're doomed.

       If, indeed, Bin Laden was killed in the supposed Bin Laden compound in Pakistan, it was certainly murder by any judgement. The guy was begging for his life, unarmed, with his hands in the air, at the time he was shot to death. Bin Laden has been accused of various crimes, but have any crimes ever been proved against him in a court of law, while he was present to face and respond to his accusers? I don't think so.

       I'm with you on this one. The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       person to speak coherently about this was Ron Paul. He, too, questioned an extrajudicial killing solely on the order of the president. I've no doubt its happened hundreds of times in the past, but at least they had the good manners to keep quiet about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they celebrate it. There's
       <em>
        nothing

       to stop it from being you or me the next time.

       My favorite take on the whole Bin Laden death scenario was a random comment I came across the next day: "Just when i think people will draw the line at believing ridiculous bullshit, they top themselves.
Oh and by the way, i killed bigfoot last week. But according to bigfoot tradition i buried him at sea. Sorry guys"

       Bhutto was going to tell the world that Bin laden was dead, so they had her whacked too, and she was in with western intelligence.

       if you were listening to the propaganda on NPR today, please say so.
      </p>
      <p>
       they destroyed the evidence after the crime so there is no proof, crashed the helicopter at the base.. yeah movie of the week.. to drive the fact home they killed bin laden.

       what i tell you 3 times is true. its nueral linguistic programming on the population to make them trust what the authorities are saying.

       There are an army of shills with one objective: Make the nonbelievers believe, or brand them as dissenters/unpatriotic. You know who else used that tactic? The Nazis. Anything having to do with the War on Terror™ has been nothing but bullshit pushed repeatedly by the media as truth, and they make sure to include terms such as 'terrorist' or 'terrorism' or Al Qaeda so we never forget about the evil Islamist terrorists that hate us for our freedom blah blah ..

       its a sad but true fact that nearly 1/4 of the population is totally retarded. after that their retardation effects those around them. i dont mean like downs syndroms. im mean like if you had a hypnotist or a propagandist this is the % that will be fooled all of the time (according to pt banum)

       Yup. Few people I talk to even bother to question things. The govt knows this, which is why we had Osama's porn stash, some old guy who I guess was Osama watching TV, the poorly doctored evidence... They wouldn't put it out there unless they thought we were stupid enough to just accept it, which, judging by the cheering masses, is exactly the case.

       i mean, its sick ill admit, but you think they would parade his body around times square or something. i kind of compare it to the way they shipped all the debris from 9/11 off to china.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is kind of like a ninja 9/11 in a way.. it has created a cognitave dissonance in society. 80% believe that 9/11 was an attack on america from outside forces, 80% believe that bin laden was killed in some raid by a secret seal team that crashes helicopters
      </p>
      <p>
       and thats the way it will be. history written by the victors. no one cares about 9/11 anymore/.  the books will leave out norad standing down / wtc7/ etc

       I'm disgusted with the total disconnect in American society.  Within hours of the attacks, it was announced that Osama/al Qaeda were responsible, and with
       <em>
        no proof or evidence
       </em>
       the American public ate it up and gave Washington their unwavering support..... and off we went to start trillion-dollar wars in the name of proactively fighting terror.  Yet anybody who comes along with a conflicting account of what happened gets ridiculed because they don't have "solid evidence" that it was a conspiracy.  All of a sudden, these same people who had no problem believing the official story without solid evidence now demand evidence before even considering that it was all a lie.  Hypocrisy at its finest.
      </p>
      <p>
       His "involvement" in 9/11 was a lie, and his "death" at the hands of a SEAL team was a lie as well.
       <strong>
        In my opinion

       When people ask me for my evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, I simply ask them what proof they have of the government's story.
      </p>
      <p>
       No pictures of them at the airport. They weren't even on the passenger list, for christ's sake. no DNA evidence of any of the 19, although they said they found DNA evidence of
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       victim. No airplane parts linked back to the supposed flights. The government's had to admit that American Airlines didn't have in-flight phones in 2001, and making cell phone calls from 10,000 feet at 500 miles an hour is entirely impossible.

       What I think is, I don't know if Bin Laden was killed in the compound by Obama's hit squad, or if he had already been dead for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the whole operation to attack the Bin Laden compound stinks to high heaven. Why no video of Bin Laden being murdered by American troops? Why the crazy decision to "bury" his corpse in the ocean, before it could be independently identified? Why no independent DNA tests? Why no public report on the autopsy, if indeed any autopsy was ever even done on the corpse?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you come down to it, we have no way of knowing that there ever was a corpse. I'm assuming somebody got murdered that night, while begging for his life with his hands in the air, but was it Bin Laden or some poor, innocent dupe? How can we know, when Obama and his grisly crew concealed all the evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we supposed to just trust the government account? Sorry, the government account is nuts. And besides, I stopped trusting the US government a long time ago. Too many lies.

       Anyone who has learned to breathe through his mouth will clearly see what a fallacy this story is. But, it's a chapter in the War on Terror™ so we can't have expected any less from the Neocons running the show. I loved seeing the thousands of cheering people. It really cemented my belief that the media are doing its job in feeding the people the lies.

       We don't know if he is alive or dead. We have not seen a body which has been confirmed as him. He is probably dead, guessing from his age, health problems, and been chased around. He could have been killed in the raid as the US said, but we have no proof.

       This is the first time somebody brought up Osama since the few weeks after his death, and I think that says it all.  Whether it was real or he died years ago is irrelevant compared to the fact that Obama's huge press stunt has been almost forgotten by the people he tried to affect.

       There is no evidence that I have seen that Bin Laden ever killed any US citizens himself. He spouted hateful violent rhetoric and he had a lot of money, but then again so does Pat Robertson and he hasn't been called out as a terrorist yet. Killing someone for being an idealist with some cash and a pulpit is rather unsettling.

       Just like Saddam, Osama was created by the United States.  And when things got rough, we had our new enemy.  The one we created for ourselves.

       He denied any responsibility for 9/11.  Was never officially charged with any crimes around the attack.  And we're left to believe that 200 "Al Quaeda" operatives warrant TRILLIONS of dollars to fight.  War is a sham.  Terrorism is a sham.

       I'm pretty sure it was smoke and mirrors for the whole Obama birth certificate fiasco(which is not a form of id anyways).
       <br/>
       Basically Osama is probably on a yucht somewhere, as they obviously wouldn't off a CIA man and tell everyone.

       If, indeed, Bin Laden was killed in the supposed Bin Laden compound in Pakistan, it was certainly murder by any judgement. The guy was begging for his life, unarmed, with his hands in the air, at the time he was shot to death. Bin Laden has been accused of various crimes, but have any crimes ever been proved against him in a court of law, while he was present to face and respond to his accusers? I don't think so.

       I'm with you on this one. The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       person to speak coherently about this was Ron Paul. He, too, questioned an extrajudicial killing solely on the order of the president. I've no doubt its happened hundreds of times in the past, but at least they had the good manners to keep quiet about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they celebrate it. There's
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to stop it from being you or me the next time.
