        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some prescribe to the belief that globalists and the Illuminati have &quot;special&quot; dates that they use as sort of justification or reason for pressing the next stage in their agenda.</p>

<p>Gulf of Tonkin was precipitous in the start of the Vietnam war, and we learned nearly 40 years later that incident could very well have been a false flag.</p>

<p>Today, 47 years after Tonkin, we saw the passing of this debt ceiling bill, as well as the creation of a super congress, preceded by some of the (to me) most obvious political theater ever seen.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t known what to believe in a long time. I honestly don&#39;t believe that specific dates could hold so much importance, but on the other hand, as a caring, empathetic, responsible, and loving adult I&#39;m incapable of understanding the globalists and their agenda anyway; nothing that these people do makes sense to me, so why would them having some weird ceremonial dates be so incredible?</p>

<p>Anyway, no real question here. Just some food for thought, and I thought that you guys might appreciate the reminder because I haven&#39;t seen this mentioned here today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum banking was tied to laundering drug money from Golden Triangle Drug running from old French Colonies of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The French were funding their Vietnam War using the Opium Trade and feeding the Drugs into Marseilles France. Rosenbaum was getting a cut to launder the drug and Jewish Mafia money in the US using his BCI Swiss banking account. When the US got into Vietnam, they also took up the same methods of taking over the Opium trading to keep the money from the Communist side. Thus, the CIA got into the Drug Business with Marseilles France and the Corsicans. This Drug Network also spread to Montreal and fed drugs into the US via Chicago and New York, and likewise the French New Orleans associations were running drugs into the US from Central America using United Fruit and other CIA assets. It was these CIA operations that JFK sought to break into a million pieces, because of the intense corruption involved in Government. When all is said and done, it was the British interests in the Drug Trade from their old methods of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eRvKKDy6nM">Sassoon’s and Hong Kong</a> that became the biggest issue involved in killing JFK, and second was the Israel/British interests, which are a Pet Project of the UK’s Rothschild’s Banking interests and British Intelligence with Louis Bloomfield in Canada.</p>

<p>The plot matured with former Chicago Mafia Drug Runner Jack &quot;Ruby&quot; Rubinstein doing a lot of the footwork in Dallas for the plan, and his worry that the plot will be traced to the highly Jewish associated ardent Zionists that wanted JFK dead. Louis Bloomfield is one of the “godfathers” of Israel having trained the Jewish Military and showing them the Intelligence Methods that came to form the Mossad. Bloomfield’s Bronfman Gang’s Montreal connections had excellent working relationships with New York and Chicago and all the US Mafia to include New Orleans and Carlos Marcello. Marcello put out the Hit solicitation to the French at Marseilles, to provide some compartmentalization disconnects from Montreal. French Montreal and New Orleans had much in common due to New Orleans being a former French Colony. Montreal is also the head of a large British Intelligence operation in North America</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you actually know the rules, it&#39;s best to assume the game is random. Predicting events based on past events is hard wired into our brains. Frequently this can be helpful. However, it should never be relied on entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but there&#39;s a difference between predicting a single outcome, and predicting a set of outcomes dependent upon a building understanding of the system. I&#39;m reminded of a card game I played in high school that went, to us, by the name of <em>Mao</em>. The rules were simple. &quot;Rule number one: You are not allowed to explain the rules.&quot; If you want to win, what do you do? You don&#39;t throw your mind to the wind. You watch, and you look for patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like an awesome game.</p>

<p>I was just pointing out (albeit in a pithy manner) to IOCAMS that just because you think something is &quot;due&quot; to happen, doesn&#39;t mean that it will.</p>
