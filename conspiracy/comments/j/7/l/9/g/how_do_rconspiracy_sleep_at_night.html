    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not forcing anything.  When someone is alive, there is clearly a difference between when they have died.  Physically, nothing changes with the body immediately,but something is not there. That, is the light. The soul. The spark. Consciousness. When it changes, the body begins to decay.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;spark&quot; is called being &quot;alive.&quot;  It does <em>not</em> pre-suppose a soul.  How can you honestly say &quot;death is different than life therefore there is a soul.&quot; and not feel ridiculous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><del>On top of a pile of money, with many beautiful women</del> Mh, well, no. Actually, you have to learn to disengage and be critical of many theories and givens: yes, hidden interests are at work everywhere, but becoming clinically paranoid and frozen with fear doesn&#39;t help. Learn of the lies, know how to spot and how to react to them, THEN live your life at full. Refuse to become a hermit afraid of every speck of PCB or WiFi signal. Be a healthy cynic, and distrustful of bullshit just because it&#39;s spewed from &#39;authority&#39; figures, but don&#39;t become a ranting loon that makes those near you and loved ones&#39; life a nightmare.</p>

<p>Just keep a camera fully charged and with plenty of rec time near your bed, as well as a bat, so any MIB, NWO thugs or aliens don&#39;t take you by surprise :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got to put some distance between yourself and the issues, or you&#39;ll go nuts. Worse, you might be impelled to take some desperate but pointless action just as a way of doing something. George Carlin managed to distance himself by regarding himself as merely a spectator. He basically gave up on the idea that he could make a difference, and just resigned himself to watching the show. Most of us probably aren&#39;t ready for that level of cynical detachment, but unless you step back from what is going on, it can eat you alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good Question.... I am from a country where the most common saying is &quot;Thetta reddast&quot; which translates too: &quot;It&#39;ll work out&quot;...... I just try to believe that it will, even if it is possible that it means I&#39;m in denial. But the sadness over the state of affairs, lack of truth and massive widespread injustice, wars and poverty obviously gets to you. Just know that you have a purpose and every little thing you do is planting a seed that might help getting things back on track. Things look much better than they did 5 years ago and more people are waking up. </p>

<p>On a more spiritual level I think studying OBE&#39;s, lucid dreaming and wake induced lucid dreaming (wilds). Experiencing it by myself completely took away my fear of dying. I think not fearing death makes it a hell of a lot easier not to fear other things.</p>
