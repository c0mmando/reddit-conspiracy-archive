       I just did, by asserting that there is no evidence for a soul.  If it worked the other way around, we could logically believe in anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example I have an invisible, non-corporeal dragon in my garage and I challenge you to prove that I do not.  The properties my dragon has 
makes it pretty much impossible for you to test for its presence, but I assure you it's absolutely there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your inability to disprove my dragon's existence reason for you to believe in it?

       I'm not forcing anything.  When someone is alive, there is clearly a difference between when they have died.  Physically, nothing changes with the body immediately,but something is not there. That, is the light. The soul. The spark. Consciousness. When it changes, the body begins to decay.

       That "spark" is called being "alive."  It does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       pre-suppose a soul.  How can you honestly say "death is different than life therefore there is a soul." and not feel ridiculous?

       Mh, well, no. Actually, you have to learn to disengage and be critical of many theories and givens: yes, hidden interests are at work everywhere, but becoming clinically paranoid and frozen with fear doesn't help. Learn of the lies, know how to spot and how to react to them, THEN live your life at full. Refuse to become a hermit afraid of every speck of PCB or WiFi signal. Be a healthy cynic, and distrustful of bullshit just because it's spewed from 'authority' figures, but don't become a ranting loon that makes those near you and loved ones' life a nightmare.
      </p>

       Just keep a camera fully charged and with plenty of rec time near your bed, as well as a bat, so any MIB, NWO thugs or aliens don't take you by surprise :-)

       You've got to put some distance between yourself and the issues, or you'll go nuts. Worse, you might be impelled to take some desperate but pointless action just as a way of doing something. George Carlin managed to distance himself by regarding himself as merely a spectator. He basically gave up on the idea that he could make a difference, and just resigned himself to watching the show. Most of us probably aren't ready for that level of cynical detachment, but unless you step back from what is going on, it can eat you alive.

       Sounds good. I feel like batten down the hatches sometimes and doing some real off-the-wall shit but then I just feel like why bother? And I feel like if get into it too much, I'd really just fall off the face of the earth. Not even lying, reading some of these articles and even trying to get into Behold a Pale Horse will make me sick. But, thanks for the comment.

       Good Question.... I am from a country where the most common saying is "Thetta reddast" which translates too: "It'll work out"...... I just try to believe that it will, even if it is possible that it means I'm in denial. But the sadness over the state of affairs, lack of truth and massive widespread injustice, wars and poverty obviously gets to you. Just know that you have a purpose and every little thing you do is planting a seed that might help getting things back on track. Things look much better than they did 5 years ago and more people are waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a more spiritual level I think studying OBE's, lucid dreaming and wake induced lucid dreaming (wilds). Experiencing it by myself completely took away my fear of dying. I think not fearing death makes it a hell of a lot easier not to fear other things.

       I guess...sometimes, it is hard to swallow the bullet of truth. Even when I got into this conspiracy shit in college, it seemed like there was belief...but then it seemed more like people we're just disappointed with the injustice. So they only got to the surface of some ideas...but, I'll try that method.

       As you may already be aware thousands of Americans, possibly in the millions are heavily into survivalism. This means that they are growing their own food, own physical precious metals, are energy independent (solar/wind/hydro power), and are well armed and able to form a militia on a moments notice.

       Everyone else is basically helpless once the dollar crashes.

       Hmmm, sounds good to me. We're not privy to energy dependence yet but growing food and shit has been in our favor. You're generating your own energy tho?
