    <div class="md"><p>Really? Alex Jones doesn&#39;t talk about Israel? I guess these articles on his site Infowars.com are just apart of my imagination?</p>

<p>Stop believing soundbytes from disinfo, Alex Jones does talk about Israel. Maybe just not the way some people want him to? Can&#39;t please everyone.</p>

<p>In Alex Jones&#39;s film Endgame(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-CrNlilZho">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-CrNlilZho</a>) he spents 15 minutes or so explaining how the Rothschilds came to power and how they operate. The Rothschilds are supposedly the biggest Zioinist family. He is constantly attacking the Rothschilds and Rockefellers. These are the 2 biggest Zionist families in existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, he avoids criticism, or even casual mention, of Israel. It&#39;s as if Israel doesn&#39;t exist in his world. He also avoids talking about Jews, Zionism, or the Holocaust. Why? Because he knows these are the topics that can hurt him, if he speaks the truth about them. They have been rendered taboo by Zionist propaganda in the schools, universities, and mainstream media for many decades. Jones should have a lot to say on all these topics. After all, Zionists are at the heart of the New World Order. But he says nothing. I think he&#39;s mostly just afraid of being labeled an antisemite, because those slapped with this label are dismissed by the media and the intelligensia (with only a very few exceptions). But his sympathy for Israel may also be part of the reason he avoids criticizing it.</p>
