       I've noticed him and his site steer clear of Israel. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       When he does mention it, he seems to always mention Hal Turner, as if that somehow justifies his role as gatekeeper.

       Really? Alex Jones doesn't talk about Israel? I guess these articles on his site Infowars.com are just apart of my imagination?
      </p>

       Stop believing soundbytes from disinfo, Alex Jones does talk about Israel. Maybe just not the way some people want him to? Can't please everyone.

       ) he spents 15 minutes or so explaining how the Rothschilds came to power and how they operate. The Rothschilds are supposedly the biggest Zioinist family. He is constantly attacking the Rothschilds and Rockefellers. These are the 2 biggest Zionist families in existence.

       You're right, he avoids criticism, or even casual mention, of Israel. It's as if Israel doesn't exist in his world. He also avoids talking about Jews, Zionism, or the Holocaust. Why? Because he knows these are the topics that can hurt him, if he speaks the truth about them. They have been rendered taboo by Zionist propaganda in the schools, universities, and mainstream media for many decades. Jones should have a lot to say on all these topics. After all, Zionists are at the heart of the New World Order. But he says nothing. I think he's mostly just afraid of being labeled an antisemite, because those slapped with this label are dismissed by the media and the intelligensia (with only a very few exceptions). But his sympathy for Israel may also be part of the reason he avoids criticizing it.

       Yup, you can't speak the truth about Jews, Zionism, Israel, or the Holocaust, in America. If you do, the media (which is under Jewish control) will ... pardon the term ... crucify you.

       Look at comedian Patrice O'Neal, probably the most brilliant comedian out there.  Far better than current favorite, Louie C.K.  Why doesn't he have a tv show?  Because he speaks openly about what others keep their mouths shut about.

       I just listened to the whole clip. Patrice had some nice things to say about Alex Jones, because he thinks Jones is "a soldier" who has then energy to do his thing -- which is true enough.

       He's just a conservative/libertarian--anti govt---anti taxation--anti medicare SS but also a bankster spotter--which I like..
Too bad about his refusal to speak of the aparthied in Gaza--which tells us he's not anti-- CFR------FEAR is the name of the game..
      </p>
      <p>
       He's really a help to those trying to figure it all out but I feel he's either being led astray or he's in on misleading the public and taking those already suspicious away from the truth...

       Alex Jones has limits---his act is to snatch the minds of the naive---with a fear of govt-----including the protection of the taxcuts for the top 1%------He's tea party with an edge---who supplied Glenn Beck with the mainstreet version---against working folks--progressives...

       Do many people here see him as the authority? I think he's a great source for beginners who are just starting to open their eyes and need some direction in their research. Eventually you outgrow him (probably because 5 minutes of talk is followed by 8 of commercial content). Shill, pig, Zionist, who knows. I see him as just a guy who wants to make money and stay alive... Like most of us.

       Alex is really getting to the facts about an unfair banking system and the inside trading done on wall st---He's also a positive on Jobs being sent over seas and about intelligence connections to terrorism that are now being used to manipulate political agendas---maybe he isn't perfect and protecting some--Koch oligarchs and fox news media issues like Israel---but hes covering a lot of good things that do need to be exposed---maybe someday he'll include Israels mossad in his rants--we'll see!

       He's in the entertainment business. He's there to make money and if you want to make decent coin you might just need to succumb to the politics of it and watch what you say. I don't think he's a shill just more of a guy in the infotainment business. If he was a shill I don't think he'd know it...
