       I could understand when the first group of protesters in Tottenham turned violent - it's easy enough for that to happen - it could have been deliberate agents provocateurs, it could have just been local disaffected youth looking to hijack a protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what has unfolded since has not only covered
       <em>
        multiple
       </em>
       areas of London, it's also unfolded in
       <em>
        other cities
       </em>
       (!), seemingly simultaneously, well organized (the looters/rioters always seem to be one step ahead of the Police), and righteous (every single rioter interviewed seems to follow the same script : "It's the government's fault", "we're getting our tax back", "This is our bankers' bonus" - almost as if they have been
       <em>
        briefed
       </em>
       on how to justify such actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not for a moment suggesting WHO might organize such an event, or HOW, or WHY, but I can certainly think of a few groups (the Government being the obvious example) who might benefit from this kind of social unrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think? Is this a False flag attack designed to justify the state unleashing a full Police state on the UK? If so, why? What are they preparing for? (Peak Oil?).   Or is this the actions of a state intelligence service - perhaps the FSB, or Chinese Intelligence, as retaliation for the OBVIOUS intelligence operations involved in the "Arab Spring" in Egypt, Iran, Syria, and most notably Lybia.

       Are we seeing the opening salvos in WW3?

      <p>
       Yes I do. And here is why:
      </p>
      <p>
       Authorities have a history of using agent provocateurs to create violence.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St1-WTc1kow">
        Watch this video
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now watch this video where the Police actually
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaeuV2RNL3o&amp;amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=5s">
        ADMITTED
       </a>
       that the "anarchists" were undercover cops posing as protesters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Prime Minister has already said that he will increase London's police force by 60%. He could never have gotten away with it before the "riots" because of the austerity measures and such. And so continues the inevitable march towards a militarized police state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it is good timing after the whole News of the World scandal that implicated David Cameron AND the police (the police were taking bribes from the newspaper). Now the police are heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first became suspicious when I kept on looking for so called "rioters" on the reports. I just saw handfuls of agent-provocateur types. There are no "riots".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people started asking why the police where not doing anything, just standing by and watching (I refer you to my video links above for an explanation of that behavior).
      </p>
      <p>
       The "rioters" are probably being controlled by certain elements within the police force. I think the looters are mainly just regular people... opportunist criminals, chavs and the like, but the rioters seem way too coordinated and there seems to be no solid reason for this spontaneous action. Also, how can the government and media predict that the riots are going to spread to other cities?
      </p>
      <p>
       I applaud you for asking this question. We need answers. We can NEVER assume that our leaders have our best interests at heart. They have broken the bond of trust far too many times for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please treat all news reports with complete suspicion. Do not rely on the BBC.

       I have family/friends that are right and left wing, rich and poor...scabbing off the government or drained by the government and they all think the same thing: The osterity measures taken by David Cameron and the economic situation have led to a whole bunch of bored poor people. As another commentor said on a different post: The rich pay the poor to not riot and ruin everything through entitlement programs and benefits. You take that away and you get a bunch of angry people that want to ruin everything. I believe that what you say above is possible, probable in fact...but maybe going a little too far in this case.

       Well, yes, that's because the rich own everything, and the poor don't own anything.

       Fair enough. Thank you for your balanced and enlightened input - my ultimate hope was that this (logical) explanation was the most likely one. I just couldn't get my head around the apparent coordination involved, but then I guess I shouldn't be surprised - if it worked in the middle east, I guess Twitter can work for rioting Chavs stealing Adidas shoes as well.

       you don't have to be university educated to set up a twitter account and post. i think now days organizing a protest is as easy as throwing a party. if not easier, b/c if it turns into a riot the 'host' doesn't have to clean up afterwards.

       Yeah, but we're hearing reports of coordinated attacks using networks of people with Blackberry devices. You don't need a University degree for a BB, but they're a fair chunk of change next to a shitty burn phone. Add to that how RIM was threatened with becoming the rioters' next target when they indicated they would work with Police to share information.

       It's not like smart phones are THAT much money. A lot of poor people have nice phones. Sound financial decisions may not be their strong point. I think it's pointless to attack them for what phones they use as a phone isn't a true signifier of wealth or opulence.

       Because it has been quite obvious that given a choice between supporting taxpayers, and supporting bankers, most governments around the world have chosen to support bankers.

       Automatically discounting an opinion based on the fact it's from a news source (which is a part of your conspiracy) is complete bollocks. Come to England and have a word with a few of the local reprobates to see if it changes your mind. Did you see the video of the youths helping the attacked, bleeding child up off of the floor? just so they could rob shit out of his backpack? Do you think that's attributable to the kid's banking bonus? I don't think so.

       It's deliberate as in the 'youth' that have been out robbing are co-ordinating it and know full well they're taking advantage of sporadic police coverage.

       For a start, the police have stepped back for three days to allow criminal damage to occur.  They have more than enough resources to catch looters and rioters and there are national police operation contingency plans available at any time to effectively police such uprisings.  But they haven't been used because the solution will undoubtedly be more legislated power given to the police.  Probably more guns on the beat too.

Now those factories have outsourced to the East because the currency has devalued, the youth have nothing to do every day but deal and steal.

       You clearly know fuck all about English culture. Remember hearing about the 7 lads arrested for smashing someone over the head with a golf club, giving him a kicking and then stabbing him with the broken shaft? I suppose that can be attributed to the police not wanting to help.

       Generally, simple obvious questions shouldn't need to be asked. The title could just've easily been posted as "Is there any evidence to support the UK violence been planned?" if the OP was genuinely interested in discussion and analysis of this situation, Instead he chose to ask an obvious loaded question for reinforcement of his ideas without comprismising them via discussion alternative theories and evidence.

       If you rephrase that to discuss instead of argue, then you're dead on - /conspiracy doesn't want to discuss theories that happen to go against the (alternative) grain.

       I have a very hard time believing this all started because of the murder of a small time drug dealer.  There has to be a bigger story here.  Any reports of abnormally built rioters ie. undercover cops?  Don't get me wrong, there is plenty to riot about, or at least thats my American perspective. But that doesn't seem to be what the London riots are about.

       I think something is coordinating the violent uprisings we're seeing in numerous countries. What, I don't know. I don't think it's a single person, or a single group. I'm more inclined to suspect it is some kind of unrecognized group intelligence -- a kind of crowd mind or composite mind, or racial intelligence if you will.

       Well, if this wasn't orchestrated from day zero, it's a gift from
       <del>
        god

       the chavs for government: make the public forget about newspaper and police scandals, give police a chance to come out as savior in shining armor, and have the perfect excuse to have more control of electronic communication means as well as filling London with cops so the Olympics are glitch-free.

       I don't doubt class inequality, hopelessness and racial stress of many of the young in England found in the first protests the perfect way to blow some steam. But of course, who knows just from
       <em>
        where
       </em>
       those mythical BB messages prodding mobs to riot and loot actually originated from. Again, it's tragic that an event born from what seems to be police incompetence will become an excuse to use the disenfranchised as scapegoats and bogeymen.

       A similar spate of messages (allegedly numbering in the thousands) were sent to groups of Lebanese youth and Aussie "Patriots" leading up to the Bondi Beach race riots in Sydney some years ago.

       The elephant in the room here (and probably why no further media coverage ever asked questions about it) is that the only real organizations capable of mobilizing such technology without detection are either organized crime, or state intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the questions simply become "Who?" and "Why?"

       Definitely not planned but the MSM did take the opportunity to attack the internet since some of the rioters coordinated meet-ups and strategy using social networks.
