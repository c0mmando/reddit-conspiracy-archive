    <div class="md"><p>The rioters are the lowest people on the socio-economic scale that have nothing to lose. I have lived around them in fits and spurts. As Gerald Celente said, &quot;when people have nothing to lose, they lose it.&quot;  These people clearly have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting seeing that the shops they are attacking are perceived by them as &#39;the enemy&#39; , &#39;the rich&#39; and the &#39;business owners&#39; and then going on to attack small businesses and chain stores.. 
Really though, they have been oppressed by the higher ups in society by way of cutting their welfare and offshoring their jobs to the far east...</p>

<p>One thing that Sociology taught me when investigating the causes football violence is to never call it &#39;mindless violence&#39; as lots of people are labeling the current scenario. In doing so, you have immediately cut off any rationale to explain why it&#39;s going on and thus, the remedy to fix it.  </p>

<p>There are two choices Cameron can make to stop this.
1. Full force of the law, with &quot;extra police powers&quot;
2. stop cuts and reintroduce more welfare/job opportunities for the oppressed scumbags.</p>

<p>If full force of the law is coming, it will be nasty. Nasty to the point where police are doing an &#39;Egypt&#39; on British people. When that happens, the next rung in the socio-economic ladder will join in the rioting but it won&#39;t be against §hitty shops for fruitless booty. </p>

<p>It will be against the &#39;oppressors&#39; that are perceived as being the enemy of these new recruits which includes, banks, councils, government, institutions etc...</p>

<p>stopping the cuts and being nice to the scumbags won&#39;t win a lot of favors in some camps but it&#39;s what got them all in this sticky situation in the first place.  </p>

<p>Its always about the money.</p>

<p>edit: to say it&#39;s not about the spying (they have always had that capability) it&#39;s an excuse to enable more police powers to target the rest of the population when they <strong>really</strong> revolt and attempt an actual &#39;pitchforks &amp; torches&#39; run on the actual elite (e.g. elites, downing street, bucks palace, city Investment banks et-al)</p>

<p>Remember that &#39;the people&#39; always have to grant permission for these draconian security measures to be implemented - even to the point of people <strong>demanding</strong> it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no riots. Just gangs of agent provocateur types burning down buildings, smashing windows and setting fire to cars.</p>

<p>A lot of the looters are just every-day opportunists. These are the people who will be brought to justice.</p>

<p>And get ready for more draconian laws. Cameron has already promised to raise the amount of police in London 60%.</p>

<p>I think that he is increasing them from 6,000 to 16,000.</p>

<p>That&#39;s about about 180%</p>

<p>Neither are the citizens.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that anyone&#39;s yet been killed during the rioting, which is amazing in itself.</p>

<p>If the cops started shooting people, I think it would escalate pretty quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at how most people are treating the rioters: like scumbags, ignorant trash, thieves. Look at how most people, normal people, are calling for the army to intervene and shoot down the rioters, even on reddit, which used to have a pretty liberal userbase. Look at how everyone is taking the side of businesses and siding against the alienated youth. These riots have successfully put the middle class against the working class, because they can act as liberally as they want but, in the end, fear is often the easiest way to manipulate the middle class, especially fear of losing their possessions. What to expect after these riots? UK will officially become a police state, more than it already is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that people should condone or even approve the violence perpetrated by the youths, it&#39;s absolutely disgusting. But instead of worrying about social inequality and working class alienation and unemployment and many other things that are directly related to the riot, everyone is worrying about the poor shop owners having their stuff stolen. That&#39;s missing the point of a riot, in my opinion. You can&#39;t organize a riot if people are happy. Sure, there are always assholes but riots so big can&#39;t be entirely blamed on a few assholes. It&#39;s rare to find a riot as nihilistic as this one, without any political affiliation, message or even a real pretext. Yet, it&#39;s a big riot, something that should make people think. </p>

<p>Is attacking people and setting fire to cars right? No, it isn&#39;t. Would adults listen to the younger if the riots never happened? No. And they still won&#39;t listen, because everyone is trying to disguise this riot as a simple excuse to loot and pillage. The fact that there haven&#39;t been any major casualties and that the violence is directed primarily toward private property means <em>a lot</em>. These people are so fucking out on their minds and yet all they can think about is stealing, they struggle to express themselves but the only thing they know is capitalism, even if they always lived it though the perspective of the wage slaves, or worse of unemployed people unable to fulfill themselves in the capitalistic way. Thus the stealing and looting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot on this subreddit do condone and approve this violence. People aren&#39;t worrying about that because it&#39;s not nothing new, and it&#39;s not nothing subverted. I promise you, these riots are nothing to do with either the initial police shooting of Duggan or the socioeconomic state.</p>

<p>The general state of England over the past twenty years may in part explain the presence of such youth that are participating in this wanton destruction but it&#39;s not the sole, nor major cause. I promise you that the vast majority of the participants are the character are the type of people like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSAqFF2sI2Q">this</a>, Hard, Violent, Noneducated thugs. The type of people who used to be bullies in school, who weren&#39;t interested in learning - more just larking around and having a good time. Much like now, they don&#39;t care about people properties or lives and are just interested in getting some free shit and having a laugh. It&#39;s not societies fault these guys don&#39;t have jobs. It&#39;s part their parents, part bad luck, and majority themselves. These people don&#39;t want to get jobs. Think the UK equivalent of trailer trash.</p>

<p>Rioters have just breached the manchester shopping centre. I&#39;m looking at live images of gangs of these youths walking around manchester city. A bloke who&#39;s been interviewed live has just arrived at his shop which has been gutted. He doesn&#39;t look like a banker or a fatcat business man to me. A honest simple bloke who while may be just as unintelligent as the types I discussed above, wouldn&#39;t engage in any activity like them and would teach his children the same. Please take some time to view the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14449675">BBC&#39;s live coverage</a> to see what&#39;s actually happening to my country and who is performing it.</p>

<p>Not sure if you&#39;re aware where you&#39;re from but it&#39;s also the summer holidays in England so there&#39;s lots of kids with nothing to do.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t turn this political, when you (to be honest) appear to know little about the actual situation.</p>

<p>My question to you: Why aren&#39;t the rest of the unemployed youth rioting if they&#39;re in the exact same situation? the vast majority of people deplore these acts.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Does this look like the talk of a politically motivated person who knows what he&#39;s fighting for?</p>

The riots in England will be used as an excuse for the British authorities to increase surveillance of citizens, and to restrict freedom of communication on the Internet. It would be a miracle if this didn&#39;t happen, because there are officials all ready and set to go ahead with such measures, who have only been waiting for an excuse.</p>
