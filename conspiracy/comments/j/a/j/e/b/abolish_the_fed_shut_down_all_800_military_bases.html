       One of the most common sense arguments to legalizing cannabis is the value of industrial hemp. There are so many freaking uses for the
       <a href="http://www.votehemp.com/markets_stalk.html">
        stalk fiber
       </a>
       and the
       <a href="http://www.votehemp.com/markets_oilseed.html">
        oilseed
       </a>
       . We can cut down our reliance on oil by creating biofuels, slow deforestation by using it for paper, make food for the ever-growing population; clothes, cosmetics, on and on and on...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we realize that the cannabis industry is the perfect example of how corrupt politics and corporate power can snatch away a smart, sustainable, economically and environmentally responsible set of products or ideas in return for the benefit (or guaranteed survival) of their own products or ideas. The whole system is rigged, and it's not helping anyone anymore.

       This is my main argument for legalization. The best part is that industrial hemp for stalk fiber requires growing cannabis in a way that makes it not worth smoking as the buds never get a chance to form because all we want is the stalk! Of course my argument is always irrelevant because I am just a "pothead" and all I really want to do is "get high" whenever I jump into a legalization debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget medical cannabis, I want my notes on hemp paper made in the USA, my hand cream to be hemp oils, my hemp rope, and my clothing to be durable with hemp. If I had a time machine I would beg the creators of the constitution to protect hemp like they protected the right to bear arms, so America could have gone through the hemp revolution we were already going towards.

       I'm not sure if I want the media in the hands of the majority. The masses ARE, generally speaking, ignorant and everyone seems to forget this.

       True. In fact I would say general ignorance is due to big media's agenda, but the ignorance needs to be solved another way. You can't expect media to do it, because if given the choice, they won't.

       Farmers don't make unhealthy foods, unless you mean GMO, even then they are not responsible. The real problem there is the shift from the gvm't paying farmers to NOT to grow too much, to paying the farmers to grow as much as they can, then letting 90% of raw foods to corporations who then process it and add chemicals to make it cheaper. Used to be processed food was more expensive and the poor people were the healthiest because they couldn't afford processed foods.

       for the most part, imports are only detrimental to our economy. the rest of the world would hate us for not buying anything, but it would force us to go back to our industrial roots, which would create jobs, and wealth. alternative energy has a lot a wiggle room for growth, hemp could play an important part in that.

       Fact is, the US is not going to change unless certain segments of the population feel enormous pain.  Until the industrialized farmers feel absolute, dire world change, the US is not going anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you who work in the Military-Industrial complex make radical changes in your lifestyles: no Change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the few billionaires in control start feeling the heat from the population, there will be no Change.

       America's situation is far better than some damned credit agency would have you believe. We have enormous wealth, and room for growth and innovation. It's only on this current path that we are doomed. When I step out of the box, it looks 100% intentional. Like our government has turned into a malignant tumor in total cooperation with a greater entity that wants to destroy us. We can save this country, but only by becoming isolationists, and freeing our economy from international debt...

       I agree wholeheartedly with that statement. The human species has so much potential. Most people don't realize the huge potential we have as individuals and as a whole. We have at our fingertips cancer cures, incredible life extension technology, space travel technology, technology that will allow everyone in this world to get 3 good meals a day and clean water. The only thing stopping us from achieving that is this parasite some call the Illuminati. They are hindering us, they are successful in some areas and causing a lot of pain. If we throw these maggots off of us we could achieve things beyond the imagination. Where will technology be in 100 years, 200 years? The reason they are working so hard right now to suppress us and dumb us down is because we are very close to being out of their reach. If the public gets a hold of some of the technology soon to come their illusion of power will be obsolete.

       It's not that we need to stop imports, we have to stop unbalanced trade. We need to institute a slide-scale import tax that makes XYZ imports from country W the same costs as ABC exports from the US to country W. If only one country has a free trade policy, then that country is paying double to export, which makes it unprofitable.

       Dude, the US can't make iphones. We don't have the chip foundries. And we can not assemble them because we can not compete with China on labor costs. The US is not the biggest trend setter. You just think that because you live in the US. There are other countries and other trends. You just don't know about them is all.

       and watch the economy collapse... The stateside bases put tons of money into the local economy through employment, military construction contracts and simple local spending. According to ohio.gov, Wright Patterson AFB is the 6th largest employer in the state and "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton employs 23,800 civilian (14,800) and military personnel (9,000).  At 8,145 acres, the Air Base is considered the largest employer at a single site in the state."

       So we have a collapsing economy and you think instantly making a few hundred thousand more unemployed will help? That doesn't even include the local business's around the bases that make money because of the customers that work and live on those bases.

       Oh get real, America decides how the world works.... We set the trends, we practically decide whats industrialized and what isn't. Since when do we need to rely on imports? We can make anything any other country makes, and we can do it better...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does this country have to deal with the rest of the world at all? We simply don't. Sure things would be hard to begin with, but in time things would get better as if we practiced isolation...

       It's clear from what you've said that you don't have the slightest clue as to how the global economy works.  You might want to do some research into your

       and it's nice round $14

       you sound like a shill. to say America couldn't function without world trade is ridiculous. don't you know that most of the stuff we buy from China are our inventions??? At one time we were the worlds leading industrial nation, we could always go back to that...
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is we are far to dependent on other nations due to world trade agreements, i,e, we'll move a Brigs &amp; Straton manufacturing plant to China in return for (whatever). we need to stop outsourcing altogether. if American goods can't compete with the cheap price of foreign goods then we obviously need to stop importing those goods. it's really that simple...

       No, it really isn't that simple.  Go take a university level world economics class and try to get yourself up to speed with how the world works.  You can't just 'pull away' and pretend that you can survive without the rest of the world.  It doesn't work that way.

       "This is why the globalist system strains so hard to undermine any concept of “choice”. Either you use the dollar, or you starve. Either you work within the corporate framework, or you starve. Either you accept the autocratic puppeteering of groups like the Federal Reserve, or you starve. As soon as people begin to recognize that they actually have other options beyond the establishment status quo, the base of power for the elites falls apart."

       Remember you wouldn't be on the internet right now spouting your rhetoric on reddit without military contractors developing the science behind all of this with universities. The internet may not exist at all. Not everyone there is working on killing people. Lots of things have come from there that we use every single day as private citizens. GPS positioning chips for example.

       How 'bout we keep the topic relevant to the Century and Decade. By the way, I don't believe ending the military is a productive idea and wholesale defense of the military is even less so. In order to compete in a global economy, nothing should be off the table. We need to get our house in order, or we WILL fall to the wayside. What good will that do future generations but guarantee a life of veritable slavery.

       This is my main argument for legalization. The best part is that industrial hemp for stalk fiber requires growing cannabis in a way that makes it not worth smoking as the buds never get a chance to form because all we want is the stalk! Of course my argument is always irrelevant because I am just a "pothead" and all I really want to do is "get high" whenever I jump into a legalization debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget medical cannabis, I want my notes on hemp paper made in the USA, my hand cream to be hemp oils, my hemp rope, and my clothing to be durable with hemp. If I had a time machine I would beg the creators of the constitution to protect hemp like they protected the right to bear arms, so America could have gone through the hemp revolution we were already going towards.
