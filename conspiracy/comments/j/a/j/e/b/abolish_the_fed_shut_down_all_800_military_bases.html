    <div class="md"><p>One of the most common sense arguments to legalizing cannabis is the value of industrial hemp. There are so many freaking uses for the <a href="http://www.votehemp.com/markets_stalk.html">stalk fiber</a> and the <a href="http://www.votehemp.com/markets_oilseed.html">oilseed</a>. We can cut down our reliance on oil by creating biofuels, slow deforestation by using it for paper, make food for the ever-growing population; clothes, cosmetics, on and on and on...</p>

<p>Then we realize that the cannabis industry is the perfect example of how corrupt politics and corporate power can snatch away a smart, sustainable, economically and environmentally responsible set of products or ideas in return for the benefit (or guaranteed survival) of their own products or ideas. The whole system is rigged, and it&#39;s not helping anyone anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my main argument for legalization. The best part is that industrial hemp for stalk fiber requires growing cannabis in a way that makes it not worth smoking as the buds never get a chance to form because all we want is the stalk! Of course my argument is always irrelevant because I am just a &quot;pothead&quot; and all I really want to do is &quot;get high&quot; whenever I jump into a legalization debate.</p>

<p>Forget medical cannabis, I want my notes on hemp paper made in the USA, my hand cream to be hemp oils, my hemp rope, and my clothing to be durable with hemp. If I had a time machine I would beg the creators of the constitution to protect hemp like they protected the right to bear arms, so America could have gone through the hemp revolution we were already going towards.</p>

<p>Also, is your name a reference to the WoT series?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree wholeheartedly with that statement. The human species has so much potential. Most people don&#39;t realize the huge potential we have as individuals and as a whole. We have at our fingertips cancer cures, incredible life extension technology, space travel technology, technology that will allow everyone in this world to get 3 good meals a day and clean water. The only thing stopping us from achieving that is this parasite some call the Illuminati. They are hindering us, they are successful in some areas and causing a lot of pain. If we throw these maggots off of us we could achieve things beyond the imagination. Where will technology be in 100 years, 200 years? The reason they are working so hard right now to suppress us and dumb us down is because we are very close to being out of their reach. If the public gets a hold of some of the technology soon to come their illusion of power will be obsolete.</p>

GPS positioning chips for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my main argument for legalization. The best part is that industrial hemp for stalk fiber requires growing cannabis in a way that makes it not worth smoking as the buds never get a chance to form because all we want is the stalk! Of course my argument is always irrelevant because I am just a &quot;pothead&quot; and all I really want to do is &quot;get high&quot; whenever I jump into a legalization debate.</p>

<p>Forget medical cannabis, I want my notes on hemp paper made in the USA, my hand cream to be hemp oils, my hemp rope, and my clothing to be durable with hemp. If I had a time machine I would beg the creators of the constitution to protect hemp like they protected the right to bear arms, so America could have gone through the hemp revolution we were already going towards.</p>
