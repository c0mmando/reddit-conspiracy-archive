        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Paranoia is a Loser script; It defines somebody else as being in charge around here except me. I prefer to define myself and my friends as the architects of the future. If David Rockefeller has the same idea about himself and his friends, well, the future itself will decide which coalition was really on the Evolutionary Wave: the Money people or the Idea People.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I regard myself and my friends as the power elite. That way I don&#39;t have to worry if someone else is manipulating me. They&#39;re trying, but we&#39;re outsmarting them every step of the way. Most people want to believe somebody else is in charge. Then they don&#39;t have to take responsibility. Then they have the supreme pleasure of perpetually complaining that somebody else is in charge, and it would be better if only they were in charge. As long as I think I&#39;m in charge, I&#39;ve got nothing to complain about.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said! The only way to bring change is to <strong>BE</strong> change. A &quot;Viva La Revolucion&quot; bumper sticker on the back of your car isn&#39;t going to incite any activism, and paranoid rants from Alex Jones and other retards (Jordan Maxwell, David Icke) only spread misinformation and propaganda. Quit <em>listening</em> and start <strong>ACTING</strong>.</p>

<p>As far as the post title goes, everyone reading this thread is subconsciously and unknowingly seeking to join the Illuminati. That&#39;s why I personally think we should add some sort of content on the side of r/conspiracy about that organization so newcomers have a good head start and a positive direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the part when I realize that people take RAW very seriously. I&#39;m not sure if that was his intention.</p>

<p>Those questions steer away from my original point. No need to respond to them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hypothetical situation.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a slave on the plantation. You pick cotton from sun come up to sun go down.  You really don&#39;t like what Master does to you. You know one of the other slaves, his name is Robert Anton Wilson. He comes to you and says: &quot;cheer up my friend.  Let me tell you something. Instead of hating the fact that I&#39;m a slave to Master and pick cotton all day while being dominated, I just pretend that I&#39;m the master.&quot;  Naturally you look at him funny and keep picking cotton.</p>

<p>So if you find RAW&#39;s quote alleviating, first of all you might have been paranoid in the first place, and secondly now you have Stockholm Syndrome. The power elite are cool, and I&#39;m part of the power elite. Now I&#39;m going to go back to blogging about conspiracy theories and call others who I don&#39;t know paranoid!</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t always choose to get fucked in the ass, but when I do, I like to pretend that I&#39;m actually fucking someone else in the ass. Because really I&#39;m part of the power elite.&quot;</p>

<p>conspiracy theorists often get trapped into a self-image of victimisation, but not RAW, he was one of the few willing to ask himself if he could be doing something to cause the problems he faced.  as long as we think we know that someone/something else is causing the problems we face, we&#39;ll never ask ourselves what we could be doing to cause the problems ourselves...</p>

<p>in the hypothetical situation you mentioned, maybe the &quot;slave&quot; is causing the problems they face by being unwilling to attempt escape.  maybe it&#39;s impossible for the &quot;slave&quot; to escape, maybe not, but they&#39;ll never know unless they try, and they&#39;ll never try unless they ask themselves if they could be causing the problem by not trying to escape.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve come away with the assumption I&#39;m encouraging you to have delusions of grandeur, because you ignored the third question like a presumptuous smartarse.
&quot;The power elite&quot; (wat) are a group of talking monkeys like any other human group, full of their own cognitive biases, and, if they&#39;re in to ritual human sacrifice for example, superstition. Why would I have stockholm syndrome for a cryptocracy that&#39;s as fallible as any other group of humans?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the main point to be driven home here. They&#39;re just people. Dave Rothschild still needs to whipe after he takes a shit in the morning. Don&#39;t put them on a pedestal just because they have more resources than you. It&#39;s the urge to be lead by someone else that&#39;s gotten us into this mess.</p>

<p>When the real elite decide to destroy the economy or blow up buildings, we&#39;re not one step ahead, we&#39;re at the whim of their control.</p>

<p>Most people want to believe somebody else is in charge. Then they don&#39;t have to take responsibility. Then they have the supreme pleasure of perpetually complaining that somebody else is in charge, and it would be better if only they were in charge. As long as I think I&#39;m in charge, I&#39;ve got nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>The quote is akin to a homeless person thinking, &quot;I might not be one of the rich, but I like to think I&#39;m one of the rich anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Positive thinking doesn&#39;t automatically translate into a positive politic.</p>

<p>i would say it&#39;s more like a homeless person doing something to fix the problems they&#39;re facing, instead of wasting time and energy blaming &quot;the rich&quot;...</p>
