<p>I&#39;m an average guy who&#39;s only just ventured into this sub-reddit. I&#39;ll admit now that I don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories at the moment, but they&#39;ve always interested me and I&#39;ve always wondered - the <em>why</em> behind 9/11.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say it was a government plan... why did they do it? Is there a mixture of responses or is there something everyone agrees upon?</p>

<p>“Naturally the common people don&#39;t want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring">~Hermann Goering</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most logical reason for causing a terroristic threat on national soil is so they have some grounds to limit freedoms. They can wiretap, videotape, and arrest you now just because they <em>think</em> you could be a terrorist, or involved in terrorist activity. What is terrorist activity? Anything they don&#39;t want you doing. Stealing, selling, buying, trading, informing... any of it could be construed as &#39;terrorist&#39; activity. </p>

<p>In this sense, they can apply whatever force they want to take down whoever they feel they want, because it is &#39;for the greater good of stopping terrorism&#39;. This is a cause that <del>sheeple</del> people can get behind and justify the wreckless murders and injustices of war.</p>

<p>Why do we want war? So we can have things. Dominate territory. Why are we bombing Libya? Gold and oil reserves. Why were/are we at war in Iraq? Oil reserves and a foothold in the middle East, adding to the Allies territories in capturing every square foot of land out there in the name of Western interests.</p>

<p>War keeps people fearful for their lives. If we are always on the brink of war, no one wants to revolt. They keep us entertained, drugged, fat and lazy so we can&#39;t fight back, even if we wanted to. So you just keep plugging away, knowing they are &#39;protecting you from terror&#39;, so you just keep sending them your money so they can keep doing what they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe the official story of 9/11, then speculating about motivation is the last thing you should do. </p>

<p>Disbelief in the 9/11 official story results because people look skeptically at the available evidence and find it is not consistent with the official story. I encourage you to look further and try to understand why people see major problems with the official story. </p>

<p>Even if you come to agree with these doubts, it probably won&#39;t be very productive to speculate about motive. It&#39;s very difficult or impossible to prove motive conclusively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the black op created to run in the new threat to the world--the replacement for communism as a new viable threat to capitalism---</p>

<p>now the threat level has gone nuclear---so a clear opportunity to demonize all political opposition now exists---</p>

<p>with a clear distraction away from the acts of a criminal shadow banking industry now on a global scale..</p>

<p>Beware of the new and improved privatized freedom fighter/terrorist---evovled from the past nation sponsered military intelligence..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Motive---same reason for any attack on anyone---to impose or force social,, economic and political change----Shadow govt--private sector control---big business. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu6Vw2FExZQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu6Vw2FExZQ</a></p>

<p>Major business and profit growth opportunities have always awaited America in nations with business friendly leaders and we&#39;ve always assisted those leaders--who agree with American businesses..</p>

<p>If you flip over the rock of American foreign policy of the past century, this is what crawls out…</p>

<p>invasions … bombings … overthrowing governments … 
occupations … suppressing movements for social change … 
assassinating political leaders … perverting elections … 
manipulating labor unions … manufacturing &quot;news&quot; … 
economic and political sanctions ... death squads …
torture … biological warfare … depleted uranium …
drug trafficking … mercenaries …</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a pretty picture.
It is enough to give imperialism a bad name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American empire has finally turned on it&#39;s own---all those secret invasions and govt coups the business elite had the CIA involved in back in the days of Lyndon Johnson/nixon/carter/reagan/Bush/clinton to rid the world of any leaders who chose to serve the working class and the poor at the expense of the wealthy----have now been brought to American shores----to exterminate the middle class----and the world watches as the American people exhibit the effects of decades of being dumbed down and divided in a two-party system that has completely turned against them..</p>

<p>Americans are stuck now hoping for a &quot;lesser evil&quot; between two politicians who will be held hostage in the white house with his family and forced to pull the rug out from under millions of SS and medicare receipients so the wealthy bankers can be bailed out and corporations can cash in completely tax-free----Shhhhhhhh----democrats don&#39;t know it yet!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re going to hear a lot of bull in response to this which is mostly conjecture. The real answer is that there isn&#39;t one and definitely no evidence for any of the theories beyond poorly cobbled together circumstantial &quot;evidence&quot; that is far from conclusive.</p>

<p>Most of the theories you will hear, i.e. the PATRIOT Act, invading the Middle East, etc. etc. are all red herrings. Almost all of the &quot;reasons&quot; you will be given could have been accomplished without 9/11 or were barely even important enough to warrant such a massive attack. </p>

<p>Show me whatever youtube videos you want, there is still no compelling goal for 9/11 that couldn&#39;t have been accomplished without it.</p>
