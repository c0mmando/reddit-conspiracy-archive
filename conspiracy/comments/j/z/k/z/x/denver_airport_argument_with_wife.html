       My wife and I have been talking about the Denver Airport for the last hour. I think that the symbolism in the construction and art shows that the Free Masons are behind it, attempting to make some sort of statement. She thinks that these are just artists and architects may be performing a conspiracy of sorts, but does not have enough evidence to prove it to her. Can anyone help with somewhat concrete evidence?

       You see, this is your problem. You take the word of a self proclaimed conspiracy theorist as gospel. Yes there are symbols, but symbols have no inherent meaning beyond that which the interpreter ascribes. Do you think this guy on the internet isn't a little biased in his interpretations? Does he know what the artists intended when they made the symbols? It seems to me if you were really troubled by these things and were truly trying to find an objective, logical truth you'd ask these questions and do a deeper investigation than just asking the internet paranoids. No. It's so much easier (and a lot more fun) to sensationalize and jump to any conclusions you want. You're just as bad as my neighbors who take Sarah pain and glen beck as the two-headed second coming of our lord and savior. All of you make me want to barf.

       so, let's say the man writing the checks is a mason and had the artists design it to reflect mason designs. I still see no conspiracy. What if the man just likes the designs? why must there be meaning behind it? Can't the meaning be that he really likes the masons? where do you even begin to assume there is a secret conspiracy?

       Exactly my point. There is no information to suggest any conspiracy. People jump to conclusions because they find "buzz words" and images they've been trained to look out for. It's like the goddamn 23 enigma. Someone tells you 23 is important so you start noticing it everywhere and come up with excuses as to how they're all related. It's akin to the brainwashing you get on fox news. Here's a novel idea: shut up until there's some actual evidence.

       I would say that is inappropriate as well. The mural does have a progression, where the Nazi is dead and children have smiles. I still think it is odd. Where do we go from here? other than speculation, what proof do we have?

       I don't want to mock, but I'm suspicious about the Denver/Mason connection. Sure, maybe... but another explanation is that certain artists are obsessed with symbolism for other reasons (aesthetic, some connection to tradition, sense of artistic legitimacy). I had an art prof back in the undergrad days who was like this. He went on and on about the golden section, five- and six-pointed stars, the elegance of medieval typeface (individual letters and their super-elegant proportions), etc. He put all kinds of semi-mystical symbolism in his own art, but I never got the sense he was sending messages more deep than the basic symbolism of the symbols themselves.

       that is definitely an option. I was fresh from the "discussion" so I may have been a little polarized. It will be difficult for us to prove the intentions behind art. There do seem to be many odd choices for this building. thanks

       To be clear, I'm not ruling out the Illuminati/Templars/Whatever ideas, either; but it seems simpler to just imagine that it's a symbol-obsessed architect or two. Of course, if it's the former, I figure that will become apparent, eventually, because there should be some functional element to doing all the symbolism, instead of mere aesthetics. So I suppose time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, what if it's a symbol-obsessed Illuminati who did it just for the fun of it? Then we'll never know.

       What about when multiple artist are involved and working from instruction to put all kinds of symbolism that seems to point in particular directions? I can understand a vast array of symbolism, but ones pointing towards death in an airport?

       Oh, maaaan... now I'm super-excited. Do you know if anyone has ever done any "urban p" in that airport, in areas not officially permitted? Not that I'm the guy to do it (I have a crippling fear of jail), but it would be cool. I mean, if those hypothesized hidden structures exist, someone should explore them and post photos.

       If they're real, and you got in there, AND you were okay enough with what you saw to return to your normal life... you'd never get out of there. It's also the most MILITARIZED airport I've even seen. I made one wrong turn, boom MILITARY CHECKPOINT. Almost shit myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Great Hall is patrolled by officers on segways. The other concourses are only accessible by train.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know this. You would be a brave man to try and gain access to unauthorized areas. But you would need to prepare beforehand with information no one has. And you would need to evade a military force and countermeasures no one in the public has information on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're willing to import marble from all over the world for the goddamn floor, what do you think the budget ceiling is on security deterrents? I would love to see 'inside', but if you have anything to lose that you value, look at The Great Hall yourself, and leave with your skin.

       Hm. So it's super-mysterious, there's tons of interesting and sinister stuff just out of sight, but nobody can ever verify it? I'm not one for getting myself arrested (I say "yes sir" lots when undergoing the ritual fondlings and scannings in airports), so I'm not the guy to figure this out, but the combination of "it's real and it's secret and it's evil" with "but nobody who has seen it has lived to tell the tale" seems a little overblown. Still, I want to go to this airport and take pictures, especially of the gargoyles.

       No no no. I very clearly said 'if'. It's word one in my post. This could just be another situation where preparation plans weren't made public, so the very real loons out there immediately started spinning yarns.

       Yes, the freemasons are mocking you with their hidden messages of world domination... in the Denver airport? Why the Denver airport? Well, because if anyone claimed there were secret messages in the airport, they would be called a fool. Naturally, the best way to conduct a conspiracy is to leave clues out in the open but in silly places of no importance so it would seem like a coincidence. This way anyone who really catches on just alienates themselves and subsequently the Truth from the rest of society with seemingly ridiculous notions. Seriously though, you should read the illuminates! Trilogy if you haven't already. If you have, I have nothing more to say but... 5 tons of flax! Silly paranoids.

       No, that's me saying I'm pretty sure by your tone and your words you're very familiar with the climate change theories, but you don't think the science is sound because your talking head of choice with a degree in communications says so.

       Why do I have to be a drooling slave to a talking head in order to disagree with you? It can't possibly be that the theories aren't backed by any solid evidence and are just grasping ay straws. They must be true, therefore anyone who doesn't believe is an ignorant puppet. This is the problem with conspiracy theories. Again, why can't it just be an airport? You see, the logical approach is to have a standard of sufficient hard evidence before submitting belief and championing something as truth. These theories are based on speculation of, at best, suspicion. You fool.

       It CAN just be an airport? Why do I have to be a loony conspiracy theorist to point out oddities about the place? For all I know it could be a conspiracy art exhibit.

       And for all we know it could be a covert alien embassy where the MIB do most of their immigration. You see, the reason why we don't believe this or any of the other infinite imaginative possibilities is for a lack of sufficient evidence. first, it's an airport. When you have evidence then you can tell me there's a conspiracy. Until that day, it's an airport with some weird art choices. Occam's razor, my friend.

       But all of that doesn't preclude me or others from asking why this particular overbudget airport with strange art choices was built when a perfectly fine airport was already in place.

       No one should ever not be allowed to ask questions. And asking questions doesn't make you a "conspiracy kook". Just a theorist.

       What do you mean "behind it"?  The airport was approved (and desired) by the city.  They farmed it out to hundreds, if not thousands of contracting companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, what symbolism?  The runways look like a swastika?  Yeah, that is a coincidence because it happens to be an efficient way to keep runways separate, but all meet back in the terminals in the center.
      </p>
      <p>
       The artwork?  Yeah, some of it's odd, but who knows?  A lot of it is just functional art, and has little meaning.  Some celebrates the history of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "new world airport commission" or whatever it was called?  That was, as far as anyone can tell, basically an LLC set up solely for the dedication party when the airport was opened.  Really.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, to what end?  Do you think this is an indoctrination because people see the art and think "that's odd?" and somehow fall under a spell?

       I think that our consciousness only allows us to be aware of very little that is going on around us. I believe that symbolism is used to sway people. I think it is possible that the symbolism in this airport was driven by an organization that has hurt the world in the past. It may be nothing, it may be something. Unfortunately it looks like we cannot prove anything here at this point. I will tell you this, I would love to go to this place and see it for myself. thanks for the reply
