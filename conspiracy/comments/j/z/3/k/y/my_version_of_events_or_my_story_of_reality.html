        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So for a while I was struggling with all of these crazy conspiracies cropping up, from UFOs to NWOs and massive deception of the public through media manipulation. </p>

<p>I finally might have pieced together what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the first conspiracy. Medical marijuana. We were told that marijuana causes cancer, that its physically addicting, when the truth of the matter is THC is actually anti-tumor and in high dosages causes cell apoptosis strictly to cancer cells. I will not even try to prove this one to you, you can google for ten seconds and find hundreds of hundreds of studies saying the same thing.</p>

<p>After that, I started to look at the world slightly differently. Not only is marijuana medicine, but it is being actively withheld from the public for reasons not having to do with personal safety. </p>

<p>The next ‘conspiracy’ that I started to research is the UFO/ancient alien theory. The ancient alien theory is very simple, and it is that we have been visited by ancient astronaut’s from other planets in the past, and they taught us civilization. They taught us how to build, how to write, astronomy (mayans, Egyptians), etc. Once they left, we wanted them back, and religions and ritual were created. </p>

<p>If you look at ancient religions from ALL over the globe, you discover one thing. They tell us that people came from the sky and taught us how to live, and that they are watching. Our ‘space brothers’, our ‘gods from the void’, ‘star people’ etc. To me it is blatantly obvious if you step back from the picture that these people are retelling a true series of events, interpreted incorrectly. They did not understand technology, and so assigned them godlike properties. I cannot sit here and convince you of this, and it took me investigating modern UFOlogy to accept the theory, but the information is out there.
For recent books involving UFOlogy, I highly recommend Leslie Kean’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Generals-Pilots-Government-Officials/dp/0307716848">UFO’s pilots and generals</a>.  Or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk">The Disclosure Project</a>. Here is <a href="http://lithiumdreamer.tripod.com/ufoart.html">ancient ufo art.</a>. Yes I know its tripod, the art is still real. </p>

<p>I think there are many people throughout history that have known this knowledge but couldn’t go public and openly talk about it. You cannot tell somebody that their god was a flesh and blood being, that their life is a lie.</p>

<p>This is where secret societies come in. I think that the freemasons, the ‘illuminated ones’ simply wanted to talk philosophy and life without involving god, and thus they had to do it in secret. They loved math and the laws that describe the universe but did not believe in a personal god (Benjamin Franklin, etc), but a ‘grand architect’ These people simply realized there was no such thing as Magic. The ones shedding light on the truth. Maybe they had secrets passed down from the Knights Templar, or maybe they figured it out for themselves.</p>

<p>This is how the pentagon, pentagram, and numerology such as 666 got Satanist ties simply because they were labeled for not believing in the Christian God.<a href="http://www.closertogod.net/main/images/thoughts/world/WhiteHousePyramids.jpg"> The White House is situated at the tip of a pentagram.</a> The <a href="http://sonic.net/bernard/wnm-note.html">Washington monument is built to Masonic dimensions</a>, which BTW, is an Egyptian Obelisk. There is Masonic symbolism all through government. The NATO symbol is a compass. German Republic emblem is a compass. I think the compass is NOT a drawing compass, but a compass reminding of ‘the way’ ‘the truth north path’. </p>

<p>If you accept the ET reality and accept that maybe some people knew, the entire NWO falls right into place.</p>

<p>The idea is that human/mankind has to be in balance with the planet, and we currently are raping her for all shes got. Most of us are blind consumers, and the elite realize this. They do not see individuals, they see mankind. To them, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">The Age of Reason/Georgia Guidestones</a> cannot happen with so many deluded individuals. </p>

<p>This is why the massive UFO coverup of Western nations. They KNOW its real. This is why Winston Churchill (a mason) ordered a 50 year coverup on foo fighter reports during WWII. He knew something we didn’t, and that is the ET reality.</p>

<p>Ever since the start of America, we have been on a plan of eventual global unification.</p>

<p>“Conspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented gradually, citing the formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.”</p>

<p>If you simply look at the Seal of the United States on your dollar bill, you’ll see the message. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Great_Seal_Reverse.svg">The all seeing eye is an allegory to ET(Architect), not GOD watching over us.</a> B Franklin did not believe in a personal god. So what is annuit coeptis? He or she or they approve of our undertaking. Followed by an all seeing eye glowing orb triangle over Masonic construction. The bottom reading new world order. These people believe they are the builders of mankind. <a href="http://a4.l3-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/4/9a9b6064f8c3b4184480d1e925b8a842/l.jpg">Draw a pentagram on the seal with the apex at bottom center and you spell out MASON.</a></p>

<p>So there it is. I don’t know what the plan is. There is hundreds of billions dollars being pumped into black budget for who knows what, but I know there’s a plan. Before the NWO made no sense to me, but now, frighteningly, I almost agree with it. We are not asian, american, black/white, we are mankind. Eventually we have to wake up and deal with it. </p>

<p>Either
A)  They <strong>create revelations</strong>. Natural disastors through ionospheric heaters and resonance physics through devices such as HAARP.  People will not only accept martial law and unified government, they will run for it.</p>

<p>B)  They stage an external extraterrestrial threat, having the same outcome as A.</p>

<p>C)  They know of impending disaster through prophecies that were revealed to ancient civilizations, and figure if you aren’t ‘in the know’ its on you, natural selection, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a man in canada who cured cancer in his community with cannabis oil. His name is rick simpson. He grew it in is yard then extracted the oil and gave it to sick people for free. According to the people in this small nova scotian community it was a cure all. One man on the documentary had lung cancer throughout his lungs and the doctors sent him home with a week to live. He took a couple drops of oil everyday and the cancer disapeared within a short time. Ingesting oil doesnt get you high. Smoking it doesnt work.</p>

<p>I am a mason, consume marijuana for relaxation and preventive maintenance and I support the NWO, it is not coming by choice, it is coming by necessity. My only problem with it it is way to slow.</p>

<p>There is a bigger planetary picture emerging soon and the humans are insignificant by comparison, a couple of generations sacrifice for a greater humanity is inevitable but unfortunately the me me me society and false deities for justification of their existence is in the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have had more or less the same conclusions as you... I know that we are slowly creeping towards the NWO... and when I step back and think about &quot;what are the benefits&quot; I realize that it will bring human race together, war will for the most part stop... we will no longer waste resources on land disputes, etc. and will be able to venture more into space and spend more on science... at first I was against the NWO but just like you frighteningly I have come to see it as necessary to forward the progress of mankind... I also realized that those that are pushing the anti NWO are pretty religious which I am totally against, I would easily move towards a NWO if it meant the death of religion and the birth of a new enlightenment of man through science and reason.</p>
