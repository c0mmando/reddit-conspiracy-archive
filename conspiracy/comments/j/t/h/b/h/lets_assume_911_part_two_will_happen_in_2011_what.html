        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just like the title says... assuming Obama will listen to the many &quot;Advisers&quot; and &quot;Experts&quot; saying he needs an OKC, or a 9/11 to get his second term and a &quot;terrorist&quot; attack will take place... what do you think it will/could be?</p>

<p>Personally I think in order to sway the pissed off and mostly fed up population it would have to be something rather large... much bigger than 9/11. I also think it would have to last longer, or have some sort of imposed danger longer than just the event. So perhaps a dirty bomb? If it were a something nuclear in nature, even if it&#39;s a dirty bomb (small explosion) the fallout is what would scare people the most. Just imagine them showing weather like maps showing the wind carrying the fallout. It would give a perfect reason for martial law and perhaps use of the FEMA camps. I also don&#39;t think NYC will be the target, I think Washington DC, Chicago, maybe Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Given the rules of this game I will guess a rogue Alien attack with a type of EMP weapon.  Then we learn of an aggressive alien race that wants to attack.  We have been scouted for a while and most governments know.  They have not been aggressive until this point so the facts have been withheld until now.</p>

<p>Then changes are proposed to protect us... changes we only accept out of fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To start with it has to be perpetrated by a &quot;lone&quot; terrorist because that&#39;s what all of the propaganda has been about lately. Secondly, it cannot have any adverse effect on any high ranking Zionist. That eliminates DC. (Oh, wait a minute... will congress be back in session by 9/11? Wonder what would happen if the majority of congress were wiped out.) Thirdly, it will have to &quot;shock&quot; the public enough to support absolutely anything.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually have any predictions in particular but, rest assured, if the powers that be think they need something to happen, then it will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add to your opinion here and point out that the &quot;Super Congress&quot; now exists.. so congress being &quot;wiped out&quot; doesn&#39;t really pose much of a threat to legislation as most of it is controlled by the what, 13, members of this new Super Congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. And that just makes the rest of congress expendable, doesn&#39;t it? It would be much less expensive for &quot;them&quot; to control 13 rather than 535.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that but let&#39;s not forget that in case of catastrophic failure or an attack FEMA takes over and states and the governors of those states basically don&#39;t exist.

    <div class="md"><p>Wait; this is a conspiracy theory thread... So what if the conspiracy is Kashbrowns is being paid by the FBI to ask everyone on Reddit what kind of terrorist attack they would suggest, so that the FBI can use it against you later. After all, it might be hard for you to explain away a quote describing a terrorist attack against a US target. I&#39;m not saying they would necessarily use it, but it will be in your file... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assure you I&#39;m nothing of the sort. Go ahead and review all my past Reddit goings-ons... To be completely honest and clear, when I was 18 and graduated high school in &#39;08 I originally was going to school for criminal justice in the hopes of becoming a cop but really I wanted to make it to detective as quick as possible. I dropped out of that after a year seeing how insane our police force is and I was &quot;awake&quot; before college so it&#39;s not that I was awoken to all the goings on... I guess I was just dreaming that being a cop and helping people would be awesome but sadly being a good cop, helping people and living up to the whole protect and serve is usually disciplined now. I&#39;m now going into IT Networking :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thing to add to this, Sears Tower is now named Willis Tower. It may not be anymore, but around when it was renamed it was owned, or the lease was owned by Larry Silverstein... the owner of former WTC. He also had an unusual insurance policy on the towers that basically mirrored what happened on 9/11 and profited greatly on the purchase due to the insurance money from the collapses. I didn&#39;t really google it, but he may not own Willis Tower anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The building formerly known as the Sears Tower is now called Willis Tower. It&#39;s lease is owned by Larry Silverstein, he owned the WTC at the time of the 9/11 attacks and profited greatly from the insurance money. I&#39;ve found conflicting articles claiming he sold the Willis Tower recently, or he just brought in other owners that split ownership. So what I&#39;m saying is, if it happens at Willis Tower he needs to be investigated because he owned the WTC at the time of the 9/11 attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s part of the reason why Obama isn&#39;t getting good approval ratings. He ran on a campaign of ending the wars and lowering taxes but in December of 2010 he extended the Bush Era Tax Cuts for the hyper-rich and all the tax burden is falling on the middle/working class. Not to mention the BP oil spill is on the tax payer now too... HOW is that even POSSIBLE?! BP posted giant profits last quarter.. if I&#39;m held responsible for the oil spill and have to pay for the clean up why the FUCK don&#39;t I get a percentage of their profits. Also look at some of my other replies as to Ron Paul Vs. Obama, Non-Puppet Vs. Puppet and why Obama needs something to raise approval ratings.</p>

My one doubt is that would kill the push for nuclear power, unless that&#39;s something that would be profitable by the &quot;powers that be&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it would have to be an attack on the transportation section so that HLS could crack down more. Most likely 3 separate attacks in 3 different cities, possible a highway, airport terminal, and train. all occurring at the same time. </p>

<p>Did any watch Rubicon when it was on, there could be something like that to with a an oil tank being blown up a two for one deal?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont think they have done one yet. all the security precautions right now are only for the planes themselves. so that a bomb cant be on a plane or a plane is not used as a weapon. but if a terminal was hit than the security would be heightened to the terminal area     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t buy the premise. Why would the ruling class launch another false flag event? The legacy of 9/11 is still with us. The US just pulled of a brilliant (from the imperialist point of view) war against Libya -- and there was nary a discouraging word.</p>

<p>Washington knows what it&#39;s doing; just stick to a humanitarian message and keep the casualties low or hidden and the American people won&#39;t do shit. Obama could easily attack Syria if he wanted to just as he did Libya.</p>

<p>The only way a false flag operation would be needed would be for a major war which would have major casualties. I don&#39;t see that on the table.</p>

<p>But what would it take? Nothing as spectacular as 9/11 or the month-plus-long series of anthrax attacks. It&#39;d only take a simple bomb, probably in a west coast city (since they seem a bit more squeamish about war than the east coast). Just a simple bomb killing or wounding a couple of dozen, and blame it on some foreign Muslims. Our corporate mass media propaganda system would then kick in remembering 9/11 and saying the job&#39;s still not done, and that&#39;d be all that&#39;s needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your opinion, and thank you for replying first of all. However I disagree with you. If you look at the current polls going around, Ron Paul is receiving a TON of support, I know relatives that are hardcore liberal that are going to vote for Ron Paul... He&#39;s winning or coming VERY close to winning in most of the polls. The mainstream media is pretending he doesn&#39;t exist. He also has 100% consistency in his political career, he&#39;s the only candidate that will end the wars which Americans do not approve of. Obama&#39;s approval ratings are absolutely horrible at this point and he&#39;s proven during his first term that he&#39;s just another puppet under control of the corporations. If they want a puppet to remain in power and keep this Corporatocracy alive they need to give Obama a better shot at re-election. Because as it stands now Ron Paul is the front runner anyway you slice it. So if Obama isn&#39;t re-elected then Ron Paul has damn good odds of being elected and he&#39;s not a puppet or bought and paid for by the corporations. Look at all the back lash from the TSA grope downs and body scanners.. American&#39;s aren&#39;t rolling over anymore, they know that terrorism is bad but giving away your liberties is even worse. If the big banks and corporations want to remain in power and hold the strings they can&#39;t let Ron Paul win. So I think there best bet would be some sort of false flag to boost Obama&#39;s approval rating. It worked for Clinton, it worked for Bush, why would they stray from a plan that has worked twice for them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a couple of things to mention. I was listening to Jesse Ventura on the JFK assassination. I&#39;m definitely not an expert on any of this, but I&#39;m smart enough to see through bullshit.</p>

<p>Scenario A:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume Ron Paul gets elected into office and does all the things he said he would do. This would undoubtedly piss off all of the &quot;Powers That Be&quot; to no end. Wouldn&#39;t they just assassinate him? Clearly, his goals are not in alignment with what&#39;s been running for a long, long time. I guess I just fear for his safety if he were elected.</p>

<p>Scenario B:</p>

<p>Pure speculation, he gets elected and turns into a puppet just like other presidents of this country. I also don&#39;t want to think about that, but it <em>is</em> possible.</p>

<p>One more thing, to the point of boosting Obama&#39;s approval rating. I understand that the story about &#39;The US got Osama&#39; helped Obama&#39;s rating, but there&#39;s too many other factors at play here to make a huge difference. Regardless, I just wanted to say I don&#39;t, not even for a second, believe MSM that, under the Obama administration, Osama bin Laden was assassinated. It&#39;s bullshit to me, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21QoRAgkKzs#t=02m11s">because of this</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with assassinations is that you run the risk of him becoming a martyr for his cause. Basically if they kill Ron Paul and then all of the reform he was doing is scrapped they might have an uprising on their hands. I personally don&#39;t think they&#39;ll &quot;allow&quot; him to get elected. They&#39;re pretending he doesn&#39;t exist, they can easily tamper with voting machines that&#39;s just common knowledge that they&#39;ve done it before. They are already trying to label Ron Paul supporters, Military Veterans, and Anti-federal reserver people as terrorists. Also I really doubt he&#39;ll become a puppet because he has 100% consistency, he&#39;s been re-elected HOW many times. I know some people on reddit are giving Ron Paul shit for being highly religious and pro-life but seriously that&#39;s something politicians talk about during campaign time.. it never really affects what they do when they get into office. Also yes, I don&#39;t think Osama bin Laden was killed by Seal Team 6 and the fact that most of the people that went on that &quot;raid&quot; are now dead... it&#39;s just like any other conspiracy, tying up those loose ends. Actually I&#39;m pretty sure there are plenty of polls showing that Americans are really skeptical about the whole &quot;We got him&quot;.</p>

Look for a segment of that demographic to get creamed by it; LA would be the prime target in my opinion. Si se puede!</p>
