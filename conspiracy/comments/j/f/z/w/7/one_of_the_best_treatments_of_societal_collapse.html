        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">55</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2011-08-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/Lagavulin.html">Lagavulin</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Perhaps 10 years ago I downloaded &amp; printed-out what was (at that time) a 4-volume tome by Marc Widdowson entitled &quot;The Phoenix Principle and the Coming Dark Age&quot;.  It may well have been recommended here on Reddit somewhere, but regardless it was so highly spoken of that I was convinced to download the 400+ pages of the .pdf book.  Of course, it was probably another year or two before I finally got around to reading it, but it was indeed very impressive: an incredibly comprehensive, erudite and inspired work on how and why societies/cultures collapse.  It drew from countless historical examples, and was almost obsessively citation-ed.  I&#39;d been studying the principles of collapse myself for some time already - had even hosted a fairly popular weblog on the subject - so I was familiar with a wide number of the more &#39;popular&#39; (in these circles) authors on the subject.  I&#39;d even written a short thesis on preparing for collapse which sold over 2,000 copies.  But Widdowson&#39;s book(s) were on a whole different level.  </p>

<p>Thus sometime after reading it I hoped to recommend &#39;The Phoenix Principle&#39; on my weblog...I think I even wrote that if one day universities decided to take-up Societal Collapse as a field of research, Widdowson&#39;s book should become a cornerstone for such study.</p>

<p>But to my dismay when I went to link to it I found that it had essentially disappeared from the internet...at least in its readable, format-friendly .pdf version.  I wrote to Widdowson to try to get a copy, but never received any reply, and resolved myself to thinking that this incredible effort of his was simply slipping through the cracks of history, save perhaps for my copy, which still sits on my closet shelf as I write this.  </p>

<p>So on whim just now I googled it again, and was delighted to find that Widdowson has re-posted the .pdf version of &#39;The Phoenix Principle&#39; on his (now defunct) weblog.  It also appears to have been combined into one volume, albeit still one that runs over 400 pages.  I have no idea what other changes he has made, but I imagine he&#39;s cleaned and tightened it up a bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can&#39;t recommend this enough for anyone interested in one of the most scholarly and comprehensive attempts to understand our present age.  I&#39;d love to summarize it, but this introduction has probably already run too long as it is.  Suffice to say that in Widdowson&#39;s view (and my own), you can only understand collapse if you see it as an inherent and lawful degradation of a societies&#39; or culture&#39;s cohesive &#39;will&#39; and &#39;identity&#39;.  Thus, the ties that bind a people together in a myriad of ways and on many levels of scale, erode to the point where everything you look at shows itself as unraveling or having past a &#39;tipping point&#39; or having become too oppressive to continue on.  There&#39;s no stopping the decline, since there&#39;s nothing firm to grab onto, and yet the powers that be, who of course have the greatest stake in the old order, invariably cannot help but throw everything they can at the problem, all the while making things worse.  </p>

<p>But also - and most crucial for us all to understand - is that the seeds for the rebirth of the next emergent culture are already present during the collapse of the existing one.  So history shows that those who align themselves with this ascending movement might find themselves positioned at the fore-front of the emerging new &#39;age&#39;.  Those that cannot will be caught up in the maelstrom of collapse.</p>

<p>So with further apologies for the length of this posting, here&#39;s the page where the .pdf is hosted:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it would seem that he is using a pen name, his masonic roots go way the hell back or some in his family recently changed their name.  None of these explanations seem very acceptable to me.  Considering his work is about the grand master plan concerning where society is and where it is going, it seems very Illuminati like to me.  It seems to me that the people who would have the most understanding of our societal collapse would be the people who are causing it or at least have access to the secret documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading a small amount of this and hearing the poster&#39;s comments, it seems there is a underlying message that sticking to good principals in times of turmoil will be the very tool needed to bring forward a more positive society. A society that is filled with corruption collapsing isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world, it opens up more room for growth, and acts as a learning period for our species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re forgetting the reason why societal collapse is a negative in the first place. A good percentage of the people living in this country will not feel that this is a time for growth and responsibility and they will turn to violence. Remember, we have needs/desires/wants, those don&#39;t just go away after much of what we own and know is stripped from us. It&#39;s also important to know that the very corporations that bleed us are the ones keeping us alive. It would take generations upon generations to recover if a societal collapse were to occur. I won&#39;t be alive to see this new found growth you speak of, hence why it is depressing to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how it will appear many years from now, but I think we&#39;re seeing the beginnings of it in the emerging return to &#39;local&#39; sovereignty in its various aspects....all of which are, significantly and crucially, being spear-headed by <em>food</em> i.e. the growing local-foods, &quot;know your farmer&quot;, raw milk, etc movements.  </p>

<p>These are clearly a sincere, grass-roots/individually inspired &#39;revolution&#39; in the true sense of the term: as a &#39;return&#39; - but in an entirely new way - to what had been erroneously given up before.  Also, it&#39;s important to note that these movement are <em>uniting</em> people across the social spectrum, not dividing them (which is what false, illusory or imposed &quot;revolutions&quot; do).  </p>
