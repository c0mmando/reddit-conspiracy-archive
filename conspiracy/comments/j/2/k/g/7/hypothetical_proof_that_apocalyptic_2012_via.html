       [9] I was thinking about the method by which a Mayan prophecy could affect us  and I realized maybe its as simple as the effects of the giant gravitational field of a Comet crossing very closely to our planet. Our planet is already stretched to its limit as it is (relevant:

       ) and the Comet's gravitational pull on the ocean much like the moon's is bound to be near 'apocalyptic' as far as flooding.

       Comets don't have enough mass to effect planetary bodies gravitationally, though they may, and probably do, carry immense electrical charges which are a significant threat in their own right if the comet gets close to anything. There is a theory that many of what we have been thinking are impact craters around the solar system may in fact be points of discharge between heavenly bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elenin may not be a comet, however. It should be off-gassing prodigiously by now, and it's not. That means it's not a dirty snowball, and is in fact made of something denser. How dense is not known, so gravitational effects are still a possibility. An object 4000km across that was somehow the same density as a brown dwarf star would still rock our world significantly at the distance it will pass while still near the ecliptic. That something is orbiting such a small object suggests an extraordinary density, and also has the implication of enough gravity that substantial debris is being towed along behind for Earth to encounter when it passes behind Elenin toward the end of October.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Brooks Agnew, an expert on tomography, it has too many angular surfaces to be an ordinary space object, and chances are fairly decent it's an artifact or technology of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as an aside; the Sumerians claimed the most distant body orbiting the brown dwarf is in fact a very small planet made mostly of iron which the Annunaki use as a weapon, and which they call the destroyer; it is this object which is responsible for the rain of fire and meteors that precedes the crossing of the dark star.

       google electric comet theory...makes some sense.  Especially when you look back at the big EQs we've had each time the earth has passed between Elenin and the sun in the last year+

       Why would they interrupt STEREO-B in order to image a small comet? It's a half billion dollar machine. They are going to roll the H1 optics 135 degrees to take a tourist photo. Get ready for a picture of an ordinary comet going by. Or complete silence.

       This is where I have to jump ship with this stuff...the whole section about Saturn, um...if the planet Saturn were tilted in some unexpected or anomalous way, even a TINY bit, thousands of amateur astronomers would know about it all over the world and it would be impossible to explain away or not cover by the media.

       What is the extent of your metaphysical/symbolic interpretabiilty? I know three things that you might also know. But I also know three things that are the same three things that you may not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three that you may know are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The penitence of man.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The name of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The leap of faith.

       I've been depressed lately because theirs like three worlds out there. 1) the natural world which we as humanity have infested like a cancer. 2) The social world which can't be bothered with what you can't tweet popularly. 3) The enlightened path which is traveled by the few. The path of undulated reality that forces truth or subjugation.

       I don't know, I mean the oceans ebb and flows based on lunar magnetic pull, you could make the argument that a large object crossing our path closer than the moon should have some affect on our oceans.

       It's a matter of scale. Gravity decreases with the square of the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them from their center.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What this means in practice is that as the distance between two gravitational bodies increases, the strength of attraction between them drops off precipitiously. To cause any gravitational effects on the Earth, the body would need to be truly massive, or would need to pass extremely close. But if it is a small body, such as a comet, even if it kissed the surface of the Earth it would not be close enough to its center to actually produce any significant gravitational effect (the Earth is 4,000 miles in radius).
      </p>
      <p>
       For this astronomical body to be a threat, it would need to be MASSIVE, and it would need to pass very close to the Earth. Both. One or the other isn't going to do it.

       but my point is do you really need that much gravitational pull with the way things are going. I mean the way our ecosystem is precariously balanced it will have a negative (even if its minute). The secret of the last straw that broke the camels back is that there where 99 thousand straws before it.

       Repenter is right. The comet will have the mass of half the moon and pass at exactly the right point to not only have a pull stronger than that of the moon but enough to counteract the effect the moon already has. This will tip the precarious line of ecological dominoes over and there will be a negative result. More than likely caused by "them" and their hidden agenda to keep America, nay, the world in the dark about the apocalypse. It's all in the murals at Denver international!!!!!!!!!

       This is where I have to jump ship with this stuff...the whole section about Saturn, um...if the planet Saturn were tilted in some unexpected or anomalous way, even a TINY bit, thousands of amateur astronomers would know about it all over the world and it would be impossible to explain away or not cover by the media.
