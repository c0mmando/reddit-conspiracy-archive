        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lucius plays the role of the opposition, but ultimately gives in based on the strong moral grounds of &#39;just this once&#39; and &#39;it really is for the best&#39; and &#39;we&#39;ll destroy it when we&#39;re done so no one else can abuse it&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Batman: Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Lucius Fox: Beautiful. Unethical. DANGEROUS. You&#39;ve turned every cellphone in Gotham into a microphone. </p>

<p>Batman: And a high-frequency generator-receiver. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city. With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham. This is wrong. </p>

<p>Batman: I&#39;ve gotta find this man, Lucius. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: At what cost? </p>

<p>Batman: The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: This is too much power for one person. </p>

<p>Batman: That&#39;s why I gave it to you. Only you can use it. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: Spying on 30 million people isn&#39;t part of my job description. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now just swap out Batman for any government leader and Lucius for any data analyst/technology expert with moral qualms, &#39;that man&#39; for terrorist and it reads exactly like a justification for the patriot act, which it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, mind you, I believe the Illuminati has a strong foot-hold in the entertainment industry. So what I&#39;ve to say, take worth a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Basically, what&#39;s being said is that the film depicts a &quot;valid&quot; form of spying on people. The two things to consider is that, no. No it&#39;s not valid. People, even gentle old kind black men, can not ever be trusted with power.</p>

<p>The other thing though is how impressionable people can be. That&#39;s why I asked, &quot;when you were a KID.&quot; Versus being an adult. Kids are impressionable. Immature adults are too. Which is more a statement regarding the sad state of affairs we live in.</p>

<p>Of course, it is just a movie. If it were a real debate, there would have been a dozen other alternatives to capturing the terrorist. (Batman didn&#39;t need no super gadgetry to beat Joker in the first movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, You are a fucking moron. If you honestly think people are delusional to the point where the movie the DARK KNIGHT could somehow subtly change their opinion on being monitored by their government. It&#39;s the most ludicrous thing I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p>If someone can not OPEN THEIR FUCKING eyes and realize that they&#39;re being surveillanced through their technological devices than they&#39;re morons. I say this ALL the time on conspiracy IF YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO BE MONITORED. DO NOT BUY ELECTRONICS. IT IS A CHOICE. If you want to cover tracks online LEARN HOW. But don&#39;t simply bitch about a FICTIONAL movie and try to turn it into some kind of Illuminati conspiracy to take over the world.</p>

<p>American&#39;s accept the Patriot act because they&#39;re asleep at the wheel, they accept all the bullshit that they&#39;re given. You know what? America deserves the country it gets too.</p>

<p>Because the America that American&#39;s deserve, is not the one it has right now. So we&#39;ll protest and riot because it can take it. Because America is not our hero. It&#39;s our silent guardian, a watchful protector(jk). However, we must become our own Heros, and fight for our own problems. Not just simply bitch on message boards blaming fictional films for our problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are arguing that there are no people whose opinions are affected by media.</p>

<p>There are plenty in this thread who disagree with you.</p>

<p>Media, including movies, has a large effect on how many people view things, I.e. foreign cultures etc.</p>

<p>There are some people who are set in their ways, and there are some who think for themselves, however, there are a great many who do not feel strongly either way and don&#39;t think too hard and are easily swayed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/news/department/news/?id=124">&quot;When you’re watching movies, your hormones are responding, not just your mind,&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When people are watching an action flick, like Batman, they&#39;re testosterone levels increase, as shown in the link above. When people are emotional, they&#39;re less apt to be using their rational part of their brain making them more susceptible to poor arguments made (like the conversation between the hero character and his technologist).</p>

<p>And on to <a href="http://hull.aug.edu/thoughtLeadership/research/Amos-Holmes-Strutton-IJA-2008.pdf">using popular media characters to sell/endorse an idea.</a></p>

<p>You seem to be saying, &quot;if there hasn&#39;t been a study proving that this specific piece of media had an effect, then it is irrational to say that it could have an effect, regardless of similar pieces of media having an affect on viewers.&quot;</p>

<p>To me that&#39;s like arguing that the atoms in a specific apple won&#39;t fall, because it&#39;s not the exact same apple as the other ones you&#39;ve dropped.</p>

<p>Media affects how people view things, whether it is &#39;news&#39; or a morality tale, like Dark Knight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that... my main point was that (s)he&#39;s really looking into one small part of a movie... The rest of the movie is just about a criminal and steals a lot of points from the comics. My point is why tear apart this one little scene and go &quot;Zomg see this, see it!? They&#39;re doing it to desensitize it!&quot; If they were trying to have some sort of propaganda piece do you really think it would be The Dark Knight and that little scene where it&#39;s only used for like a minute... and it&#39;s actually the opposite it shows Batman didn&#39;t want to have to use it, and that Mr. Fox also opposed it... THIS is why people call us tin foil hatters... Looking to fucking movies for tiny scenes like this... how about focus on the real conspiracies that are proven to exist... how we faked our way into the Vietnam War among other wars, Operation Northwoods, the legislation around FEMA camps... All REAL stuff that you don&#39;t have to get a magnifying glass out and interpret your own way... JUST THE COLD HARD FACTS that this shit is going on. I HATE conspiracies like this because they get grouped up with legit laws getting pushed through that hurt the American people and their liberty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kinda stupid because everything that Batman does it technically illegal.</p>

<p>Got stop the Joker? Lemme destroy a shit load of pillars in the lower levels of the city. Also let me get in the way of SWAT team operations, and even harm SWAT team members to do what I want.</p>

<p>Gotta save some Batman wanna be vigilantes? Let me tear up a carpark.</p>

<p>Gotta save my girlfriend? Let me speed, fuck up a shit load of police cars, go stealth mode, mess up some more police cars and people&#39;s property -- basically do what I want with no real regard for anyone else.</p>

<p>He breaks into places without permission and basically tortures people to get what he wants...yet <em>this</em> bothers you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, don&#39;t try to explain to anyone who agrees with the OP. Apparently they can&#39;t establish a difference between an action movie and real life. They also think people are so stupid that they can&#39;t understand simple plot points in a film. Also, apparently because it happens in a movie, it is now propaganda. I guess then every book or film that has ever touched on the subject of violating individual human rights is propaganda. I wonder what they think of Hostel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually batman has been using a computer at least since the 60s.  So unless the west show, Burton films &amp; tas are all prophetic propaganda this is just another movie.  Sorry.</p>

<p>Plus in context batman is a vigilante working against the corrupt system.  Gordon being the only good person in the Gotham police.  Batman doesnt live by the same norms &amp; rules as a govt.</p>

<p>Sorry this has nothing to do with the patriot act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about &#39;using a computer&#39;, it&#39;s about the justification for spying.</p>

<p>Lucius plays the role of the opposition, but ultimately gives in based on the strong moral grounds of &#39;just this once&#39; and &#39;it really is for the best&#39; and &#39;we&#39;ll destroy it when we&#39;re done so no one else can abuse it&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Batman: Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Lucius Fox: Beautiful. Unethical. DANGEROUS. You&#39;ve turned every cellphone in Gotham into a microphone. </p>

<p>Batman: And a high-frequency generator-receiver. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city. With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham. This is wrong. </p>

<p>Batman: I&#39;ve gotta find this man, Lucius. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: At what cost? </p>

<p>Batman: The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: This is too much power for one person. </p>

<p>Batman: That&#39;s why I gave it to you. Only you can use it. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: Spying on 30 million people isn&#39;t part of my job description. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now just swap out Batman for any government leader and Lucius for any data analyst/technology expert with moral qualms, &#39;that man&#39; for terrorist and it reads exactly like a justification for the patriot act, which it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True; but given the title and theme of the movie, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s propaganda. The mutually inclusive relationship between The Joker and Batman, and Batman actually being a rich man operating with impunity outside the law, The Joker&#39;s creative genius in spite of all batman&#39;s efforts to quash it. The film is full of food for thought regarding such things. The gist of The Dark Knight is that the difference between dystopia and utopia is not only what is done, but the spirit in which it is done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The line the Joker wanted Batman to cross was murder, that&#39;s why he was so happy when he thought Batman snapped and threw him out of the building, but ultimately Batman saved him so he didn&#39;t break the rule.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that <em>in the movie</em> they didn&#39;t destroy the ability to spy like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying in reality when governments gain powers and abilities, like spying on all of their citizens, they tend to abuse it.</p>

<p>So while in Batman, where spying on citizens without their knowledge or consent, even though it is said it is unethical, is justified, with caveats, in reality incorruptible people do not exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is that the OP, notfeelingsowell, isn&#39;t interested in conversation. He has decided that the Dark Knight is a propaganda film, and he explains why he believes that. No matter how many people explain that the idea is silly, he&#39;s not going to change his mind. This could have been a great dialogue about the ideas he brought up and their influence on/relevance to the movie, the country, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s either THE DARK KNIGHT IS A PROPAGANDA FILM or everything this dude believes is wrong, because one little thing has him completely convinced of something&#39;s absolute truth without any facts or proof to back it up. This is the only problem with r/conspiracy and conspiracy theorists in general - some get an idea and run with it without caring about the truth or what&#39;s actually happening and present the ideas as facts and draw crazy conclusions about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article is protected by a pay wall, but from the quotes I&#39;ve seen, it sounds like he&#39;s saying batman is pro-bush.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying batman is pro-&#39;whatever it takes to get results&#39;, including going outside the law.</p>

<p>Which <em>is</em> a position the government has taken in regards to extraordinary rendition and spying on civilians.</p>

<p>In those cases, arms of the government, like the CIA, act as those agents who do the legally shady things that batman does, that the official government pretends not to be fully okay with, but gives the same justification: it is necessary for just a little bit. </p>

<p>This is not &quot;Proof&quot; of what I&#39;m saying, but please just listen.</p>

<p>This is the Xbox Kinect.  This is hacked by a civilian who happens to know a little bit about software programming.  Now imagine what the DoD, NSA, Pentagon, CIA, and other international intelligence agencies have.  The pentagon and the CIA are the most complex, sophisticated intelligence gathering communities the world has ever known.  They are accountable only to those who fund their operations (not us).  The internet was pioneered by the military - do you really think there is no upside potential for our rulers?  The shit we get in our consumer products is OLD news.  It&#39;s been proven that the technology and intellectual property owned by military contractors and the U.S. patent office under abuse of the National Security act is DECADES more advanced than what we have now.  The Kinect is two cameras with some processing power dedicated to some sophisticated software that interprets the image.  How much longer before this type of stuff is available in some form on our telephones?  Considering the PSP Vita is probably capable of doing this, i would say not so far off.</p>

<p>It was real novel when phones started getting little spy cameras on them (remember the CIA spy cameras from the 60&#39;s?).  It&#39;s novel still to have a camera on the front of the phone and on the back of the phone - and what do we see now?  3D cameras on your phone!  So you can take 3D video, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all fun and games but please understand these same patents, these same concepts and these same technologies are in the hands of our owners.  It is at their disposal, to be released on their timeline.  As is often the case with these psy-op hollywood movies, the technology is always portrayed as something that would be wayyyy in the future, when really it&#39;s not too far away.  </p>

<p>The phone sonar part was beyond retarded and completely impossible. It was like watching an episode of CSI.</p>

<p>I mean yes we all enjoyed the dark knight but in retrospect lets not pretend that the plot was just terrible by that point and that Christian Bale&#39;s performance wasn&#39;t fucking laughable as he tried to force his voice so low it showed up on seismographs.</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear, the film advocates allowing a wealthy influential symbol of hope get away with murder just so that the people won&#39;t lose hope.</p>

<p>I kind of want to get a thread going about the &#39;ethics&#39; of movies.</p>

<p>What they justify ethically by making certain people protagonists and having situations turn out the way they decide, and the conversations/arguments they decide to show, and who they script to win the arguments, and who turns out to be &#39;right&#39; in their made up world.</p>

<p>For instance, SLC Punk is popular among the punk scene, but it&#39;s basic message is that ultimately you should buy into the system and the best way to change the system is from within.</p>

<p>Its essentially a conversion/prodigal son morality tale.</p>

<p>Lucius plays the role of the opposition, but ultimately gives in based on the strong moral grounds of &#39;just this once&#39; and &#39;it really is for the best&#39; and &#39;we&#39;ll destroy it when we&#39;re done so no one else can abuse it&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Batman: Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Lucius Fox: Beautiful. Unethical. DANGEROUS. You&#39;ve turned every cellphone in Gotham into a microphone. </p>

<p>Batman: And a high-frequency generator-receiver. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city. With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham. This is wrong. </p>

<p>Batman: I&#39;ve gotta find this man, Lucius. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: At what cost? </p>

<p>Batman: The database is null-key encrypted. It can only be accessed by one person. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: This is too much power for one person. </p>

<p>Batman: That&#39;s why I gave it to you. Only you can use it. </p>

<p>Lucius Fox: Spying on 30 million people isn&#39;t part of my job description. </p>

<p>Now just swap out Batman for any government leader and Lucius for any data analyst/technology expert with moral qualms, &#39;that man&#39; for terrorist and it reads exactly like a justification for the patriot act, which it is.</p>
