       If anyone can point to a group of actual people, rather than the government, CIA, NSA, or other amorphous boogymen entities, with actual evidence, I would begin to accept the notion that 911 was some 'inside job.'
Having been a g-man, with intimate knowledge of government and corporate organizational incompetence, I would be happy to see some truther be able to name names.  (I know 19).

       Who is guilty? The contractor who did his job and didn't ask questions?

       The manager who did his job and didn't ask questions?

       My concern is that it is near impossible to get names because very very few would have known enough details to be considered guilty. If someone has names, GREAT. If not, it doesn't mean the events never took place.

       And impossible to name names?  I can find out who came into my building at any time.  A guy that didn't ask questions?  How about a brigade of workers that didn't ask questions.

       Loose lips sink ships.  There must be a brigade of loose lips out there.  You count on human infallibility if you think this cannot be investigated.

       The fact that it is 4:00 am in NYC and your still actively commenting tells me that you're just bored on a friday night and want to rile up r/conspiracy.  You seem well educated on the subject and very sound in your beliefs so I'm sure that your mind would not easially be changed by some random stranger on the internet giving you a "name."  I get it, I come here for the entertainment value sometimes, too, but I don't think your really fooling anyone.

       poignant. but i am not trying to fool anyone.  it reminds me of creationism.  since you can't answer x, y, and z, it has to be {god}.  it is an argument of the gaps.  sure i currently accept the generally accepted narrative, but i am open to evidence of conspiracy for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is there is no proof of conspiracy.  You have to have conspirators to prove conspiracy, that is what I have been after here, not trying to fool anyone.  All I have seen about that is the seemingly eternal International Jewish Conspiracy (tm).  Yeah, right, and the Reichstag was burnt down by Van der Lubbe.  This is not so much about entertainment as venting frustration.  From what I can tell, this truthr movement is utter nonsense.  I want evidence of a conspiracy to knock down buildings, not evidence that buildings were knocked down.  As a pilot, a guy that works in a wobbly high rise, and given my former career in government, I have little doubt in the prevailing narrative.  Government and corporate operations are far too shortsighted for them to be as omnipowerful as truthers would like.  Secrets that great are too great to be secrets.

       I would argue there's plenty
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       out there to make a case for conspiracy.  I think where you're hung up, and where you and I differ, is that you need someone to point a finger at.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a rule I hate dividing people into dichotomous groups but for the purpose of this discussion: There are people who value personal gain over human life and those who do not.  Individuals who have success in the global political arena are exclusively of the former.  Notable exceptions like Gandhi, Dali Lama, Mandela while
       <em>
        popular
       </em>
       for their beliefs, have  little influence on global politics.  The fact of the matter is, the individuals occupying positions of power throughout the world value that power more than human life.  That's how they got there, that's why they stay there and our political system rewards them for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to have a name because for me they are all the same person.  Terrorists, Fascists, Communists, Neo-cons, Liberals, Nationalists, Dictators, Despots, Imperialists, Emperors...it's all semantics.  If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want to know who would/could have orchestrated something like 9/11 just follow the money (plenty of people around here will help you with that).  Who profited? The answer is always at the end of the rainbow.

       First off, you don't use thermite for demolition.
Secondly, it would take longer than 4 days to pack a building for demolition, and would involve a brigade of workers.  Can you find one of them?  Is there anyone in this international jewish conspiracy other than {boogyman jew}?  what about NORAD stand down?  what about the lies in the 911 commission, they are all jew collaborators?  this sounds like I am arguing with the ss.

       I am a pilot, and I am very interested in accidents (best to learn than repeat).
I point to saudi 163, air france 358, china air 120.  Take a look, much less catastrophic accidents than flying into a building, plenty of deformed and molten metal.  Melting metal is not even necessary for catastrophic loss of structural integrity, you would not 'melt steel' to destroy a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is besides the point.
Out of the thousands of people that it took to orchestrate this, the only reason that we have to show that they haven't been found is they are profound secret-keepers, showing a skill greater than any large-scale US, Israeli, Soviet, or German operation.

       You are missing the point. There was molten metal and melted steel in the debris. Plus molten metal flowing out of the WTC. There is no explanation on how the steel was melted.

       molten metal?  did you not look up any of those accidents?  sure, there were molten metals of many different variety present.  no doubt, metals melted.  aircraft have metals that melt (and burn) at the burn temperature of kerosene.  wtc buildings had various metals in it.  you prove nothing by pointing to molten metal, there are various types of metals, combustibles, etc. inside any building.  metals, they melt, sometimes at room temperature.

       Sigh . . . .

      <p>
       Melted steel columns from building 7, you know about building 7, right, the one that was demoloshed on Sept 11. Well FEMA got some debris and tried to analyse it. Please go look at
       <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">
        FEMA Appendix C
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The first picture you see is a wide flange beam. Are you seriously telling me that you know how that beam melted. The authors of the report say the cause of the melted steel was an unknown phenomenon. Here's what they said in conclusion:"A detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon(the melted steel) is needed to determine what risk, if any, is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long-burning fires."
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that, I hope you don't take the position that you know what caused it and they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take a minute to look at this
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNOM_U5UM6Q#t=10m34s">
        video
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have looked at the pictures in the FEMA report and look at what the steel beams look like from the use of thermite on them, is there any chance you can see the similarity? Everyone I know that looks at the images say that they look exactly alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your explanation of what cause the melted steel in building 7?

       You are presenting a red herring.  The member could've been destroyed by any number of things.  Get a degree in engineering and figure it out,  our monday morning quarterbacking is worth its weight in keystrokes.

       I say if there is a conspiracy, there must be conspirators.  Please provide some evidence of conspirators.  This van, here, this day, etc.  Otherwise, I really think you haven't come close (within a gigameter) to the evidence needed to support a Grand Multinational (probably jewish) Conspiracy that you would like us to believe.  Metal corroded, unknown parameters, and...?

       NIST was there the night before. Netenyahu was there the same day just a couple blocks away. There was the 5 Israelis. The van they had tested positive for explosives. Another van was reported filled with explosive. Where that one is, no one knows.

       Ya know Abe, I think there was another possibility. I think everyone knew what was up. If I remember right, I think most of the intelligence agencies around the world tried to tell the USA what was going to happen, including Israel. Now if you are Israel and told the USA what was going to happen, wouldn't you want to be there to see what was going down? Would you?

       sure, but these items are very disparate.  demo is not a part of building maintenance.  salvage is very different than demo.
it would take hundreds of contractors (and their employees) to make this theory work.  and these are nyc contractors, we are known for being crooked and out for ourselves and backstabbing bastards (who like to drink on the job).  you think they would be able to conspire together in absolute secrecy?  try going to an irish bar in midtown to find out about the new building on 57th and 7, you can find out a ton about the inner workings of buildings, construction and contractors.  these are workers, not secret agents.

(d) Nickel-molybdenum steel. This type of steel cannot be cut easily by conventional steel-cutting charges. The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as

       First off, there are no Military Field Manuals.  There are Army Field Manuals, there are Marine Corps Field Manuals, but no USMFM.  You are talking about a superseded USA FM.
Secondly, there is 1 mention of thermite in that manual, ONE (and actual methods of thermite usage? NONE.  this is field expedience).  And that is not a source for demolition, but for cutting through nickel-molybdenum steel (just cutting, that is all).
       <br/>
       Thirdly, nickel-molybdenum steel was used not as structural steel in WTC, but in the facade.  You would not use thermite to blow out the structural members (see the word
       <em>
        blow
       </em>
       , you would blow, as in expansion of volume, not burn through members to destroy a building (well, you would cut members in prep for demo, but then you would blow)
Again, find me a person, an actual person in the small army that it would've taken to pull off this operation, and I would have no problem moving towards your camp.  Instead you find me an Army manual written in a 6th grade level with one mention of thermite.  Quite parochial.

       3-6. is under the heading:

       "a. Target Factors. The following target factors are critical in
       <strong>
        steel-structure demolitions
       </strong>
       , more so than with other materials:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Target Configuration. The configuration of the steel in the structure determines the type and amount of charge necessary for successful demolition. Examples of structured steel are I-beams,
       <strong>
        wide-flange beams
       </strong>
       , channels, angle sections, structural tees, and steel plates used in
       <strong>
        building
       </strong>
       or bridge construction."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea where you are coming from. The manual clearly states that they use thermite to demolish buildings. I have no idea how you can reject that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain to me why the army field manual on explosives and demolitions is not a valid source when examining the use of thermite in demolitions?

       Let me ask you a question? If you were responsible in the mass murder of 3000 people and a traitor, would you willingly admit to your guilt. You're position seems to be that you would confess to all. Guess that would make you a very moral person, wouldn't it.

       Why hundreds or thousands? You are making up that number. There is no need for that many. You know the deal, just the few know it all and the worker bees know just a little bit; not enough to implicate themselves.

       Let me ask you this, if you were put in charge of a covert operation to demolish the Eiffel Tower and two other buildings near by, and you had the full resources of the United States; how many people would you have to use to accomplish your mission?

       Considering that in 1993 there was an attempt to blow up the WTC with explosives, wouldn't you consider it prudent to look for explosives in the building that collapsed on 911 that was not hit by a plane. Wouldn't it also be prudent to see who was responsible for the 1993 attempt to blow up the WTC and see if they were connected?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most would think that's reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize that Emad Salem, the person that set up the 1993 attempt worked for the FBI. Would you be surprised that after the attempt, he was left to the wolves. But hark! Emad Salem had recorded his phone conversations with his FBI handlers.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Salem, initially believing that this was to be a sting operation, claimed that the FBI's original plan was for Salem to
       <strong>
        supply the conspirators with a harmless powder instead of actual explosive to build their bomb
       </strong>
       , but that the FBI chose to use him for other purposes instead. He secretly recorded hundreds of hours of telephone conversations with his FBI handlers" &lt;

       "In one of the first numbered tapes, Mr. Salem is quoted as telling agent Floyd: "Since the bomb went off I feel terrible. I feel bad. I feel here is people who don't listen."

      <p>
       "The transcript quotes Mr. Salem as saying that he wanted to complain to F.B.I. headquarters in Washington about the bureau's failure to stop the bombing, but was dissuaded by an agent identified as John Anticev."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do you deny," Mr. Salem says he told the other agent, "your supervisor is the main reason of bombing the World Trade Center?" Mr. Salem said Mr. Anticev did not deny it."

       sure, but these items are very disparate.  demo is not a part of building maintenance.  salvage is very different than demo.
it would take hundreds of contractors (and their employees) to make this theory work.  and these are nyc contractors, we are known for being crooked and out for ourselves and backstabbing bastards (who like to drink on the job).  you think they would be able to conspire together in absolute secrecy?  try going to an irish bar in midtown to find out about the new building on 57th and 7, you can find out a ton about the inner workings of buildings, construction and contractors.  these are workers, not secret agents.
