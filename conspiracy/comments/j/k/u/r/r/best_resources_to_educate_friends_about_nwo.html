       I have been talking with a few friends about govt and bank corruption, the NWO, etc. and I think they're interested in learning more.  I'd like to be able to point them to one or two resources to help them get the bigger picture.  Everything that I know now has been picked up from visiting many different sites, youtube videos, etc.  Are there any sites out there that do a good job of providing a "beginners guide" to help wake people up about these issues?

       This group is so crafty at what they do they even twist our sacred things to advantage them. The Pledge of Allegiance was changed the around the same time as the Military Industrial Complex. Where we then became divisible "under God". Through this small twist they accomplished 2 things:
      </p>
      <p>
       *They made atheists upset about having to say they believe in something they dont = division

       then any Christ type.

       some call it a joke, but in 1979 a half million dollars wasnt a joke to these people. In the 90's maybe, but NOT back then. The "rules" dont sound bad until every one of them is about controlling people like slaves, even the "Balance personal rights with social duties" means that if you feed the slaves you get to travel to the kitchen. If your a slave owner you can travel farther. If your one of the 8 families you can go wherever whenever you want. Guess what the regular slaves get? (oh dont forget this calls for 6.5 BILLION people to be ... gone... rule 1)

       The shock doctrine. The war on democracy, I think the best way to get through to people is focus on things that are provable and don't sound crazy. Eg. Best arguement for 911.....there was molten metal up to 3000+ degrees under wtc even weeks after 911. Show infared images, pics, videos showing this. Now explain to them hydrocarbons only burn as hot as 1500-1800 degrees. Proving this should be easy. So it's impossible for steel to have melted then without a catalyst. Case closed......that's impossible to refute. Good luck.

       I always thought Zeitgeist: addendum and Invisible Empire were good films about the NWO. But the best film about corrupt banking is called The Money Masters. It's long and has some dull parts, but it's truly educational on how the banking system got started and where it is up until 1995.

       Documentaries - If you can get someone to sit down for an hour and a half and pay attention to any of the plethora of documentaries out there, they will come out of it knowing a lot more.

       Dude, my advice is: READ BOOKS. Reading things on the internet while stimulating and interesting is much more of a surface glance on the subject than reading some literature based on factual evidence. Plus if you tell the person you're talking to that you read it in a book rather than on the internet it sounds more credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Onto rec's: I highly recommend you read Antony Suttons Wall Street and FDR/Hitler/USSR books.
      </p>

       Aside from books, read the site Zerohedge. Steep learning curve, but you will learn
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: It's easy to watch movies, but once you start arguing with someone, you realize you don't have specific sources on hand and your argument falls to shit. I consider literature to be "battle-ready" knowledge, whereas video's, however truthful they may be, should be thought of more as entertainment and thought-provocation

       Not a site, but a book:

        Confessions of an Economic Hitman
       </a>
       by John Perkins

       Well worth the read.

       Get former governor Ventura's new book. It's a quick read and is based on official documents which means they can look them up to verify the information. It's called 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
