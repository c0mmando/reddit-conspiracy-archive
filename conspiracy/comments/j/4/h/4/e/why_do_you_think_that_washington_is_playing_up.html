    <div class="md"><p>I think that you are right there but I&#39;m thinking that probably it won&#39;t pass this time.  They always do a practice run psyop to see what the hangups will be although at some level, sure they would like it to pass on the first attempt.  Then they tone down the wording and make it feel like something else.  If you look back to the precursor legislation to the Federal Reserve Act called the Nelson Aldrich Bill you can see this at play.  Supposedly people couldn&#39;t see that the bills were essentially the same in their most important function.  In this context I think that we will see this super congress idea coming up again <strong>very</strong> soon if it does not fly this time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;debt ceiling crisis?&quot;  I don&#39;t know, that much is hard to tell.  Nobody knows a date or a time, or if they do they are absolutely at the top.  But the long-term trend is without a doubt exactly what you say; our demotion from the world reserve status.  But let&#39;s not be fooled to think that this will only affect us - it won&#39;t.  We are the world reserve status, so what does that mean?  It means everyone is affected - this is the new world order&#39;s plan! It makes so much sense.  The United States Dollar has fooled people for 30-40 years by making them think it&#39;s as good as gold.  It is no exaggeration to say that those who hold this power [the power to print something with the purchasing power of gold] have the power to play god.  The goal, of course, is to actually become god - the plan would be to propagate the world with our currency then fabricate a seeming &quot;crisis&quot; that needs to be solved...Then present the solution that they already fabricated<a href="http://thegldnrule.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/problemsolutionresolution/">1</a>. Since all central banks of other countries hold our dollars as reserves (in the past they may have held gold, or silver, or a combination of the two).  When this is what people depend on for a &quot;Store of value&quot; that gives those who can print it an enormous amount of power to consume and direct resources.  Therefore the eventual plan is to have a catastrophic event which will quickly destroy the wealth of millions or billions of people so that a majority rule will accept a New World Order.  Again; Order out of Chaos.  It makes so much sense (to me, anyways).  To conclude - is this tuesday THE event?  I don&#39;t know.  Maybe!  The important thing to know is that &quot;THE event&quot; is coming sometime relatively soon, so we should always individually and collectively preparing. That way, if it is on Tuesday I won&#39;t be in panic mode and will be able to rationally and [hopefully] successfully survive.</p>

Some  (a small handful) find it insulting that the only way to finance the nation is to borrow from the Fed (owned by foreign interests, meaning foreign interests own this country).

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s another red herring.</p>

<p>This &quot;issue&quot; is eating up most media time at the moment, detracting from the various attempts of lesser-known media outlets to expose the ongoing and epic amounts of corruption being laid bare. Organizations like Wikileaks and Anonymous have been dropping bombshells for about the last three of four months, and it falls on deaf ears because of smoke screens like this. Debate about topics which could lead to real change have been effectively marginalized, which is why we find ourselves reading and posting threads here.</p>

<p>They have raised the debt ceiling over a hundred times since WW2. They will raise it again. In fact, not raising it isn&#39;t really on the table; this is just political theater to make Obama seem ineffective as president in hopes of weakening his position as incumbent, so their &quot;super candidate 2012&quot; can come in like a -white- knight in shining armor. </p>
