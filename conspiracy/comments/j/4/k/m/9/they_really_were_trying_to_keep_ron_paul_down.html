       I forgot about this until today. Has anyone heard of wheresgeorge.com? The site allows you to enter the serial number of U.S. one dollar bill and it will tell you where it has been (if anyone else had registered it on the site before). I always register any bills I find that are marked with the website and write a little note for the OP and for any future contributors. Any way, in 2008 I decided to write "RON PAUL for president 2008" for my message and pressed enter. The bill was registered but the message only read "for president 2008". I tried to change the message back to the original but again it said "for president 2008". So then I thought they just wouldn't allow the names of political figures, so i tried george bush, dick cheney, and several others. None of the other names were erased! Then i tried a little trickery and put a space between each letter of R o n P a u l's name and it posted just fine. One of the next few times I registered a bill they had a new disclaimer prohibitting any political messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Webite wouldn't allow RON PAULs name to be posted but would allow any other political figure in 2008

       Quote from this Web site:

      <p>
       <em>
        "THE JEWISH-CONTROLLED MEDIA WILL EITHER SMEAR OR IGNORE a Presidential candidate they don’t like. Ron Paul is now on the ignore function of the Jews who control the American media."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost as if the person who wrote this article is trying to be deliberately inflammatory, in order to link in the minds of visitors to the site Ron Paul with antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that what is said here is untrue ... it is perfectly correct. Jews do run the media in America, and they are deliberately ignoring Ron Paul because he does not fit in with the Zionist agenda. But the language is provocative, and needless to say, Ron Paul had nothing to do with the site.

       This claim that you keep mindlessly parroting from your neo-nazi web sites of a zionist controlled media, is
       <strong>
        false
       </strong>
       .  People who have actually looked into the question, found relatively few Jews in positions of power in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
       <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2270045">
        Slate: Do Jews Really Control the Media?
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not one of the major television news operations—Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, CBS News, or NBC News—is currently headed by a Jewish executive. (That includes Ken Jautz, the man who fired Sanchez.) Or at least none of these executives has talked about being Jewish in a public forum. The Internet is littered with rumors about various media moguls being Jewish, but few of those claims are backed by any evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are more Jews at the head of the country’s major newspapers, but it’s still a stretch to say these publications are controlled by them. Even in New York City, where around 12 percent of the population is Jewish, there isn’t any indication of Jewish dominance. The Ochs Sulzberger family, which has controlled the New York Times for more than a century, is of Jewish origin. But current Executive Editor Bill Keller is not.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Wall Street Journal, the only hint of Jewish influence at the top is the persistent Internet rumor that the mother of Rupert Murdoch, the CEO of Journal parent News Corp., is Jewish. Murdoch has joked about the gossip but hasn’t addressed the whispers publicly. (The Explainer’s phone calls to News Corp. headquarters went unreturned.) The Bancroft family, which controlled the Journal for nearly eight decades until they handed the reins to Murdoch in 2007, isn’t Jewish, nor is current Journal Managing Editor Robert Thomson.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jewish-American businessman Eugene Meyer bought the Washington Post in 1933. Philip Graham, his non-Jewish son-in-law, took over in 1946, and the paper has been published by gentiles ever since.  Current Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli is not Jewish, nor are any of his top 12 editors. The Chandler family, which owned the Los Angeles Times for decades, is not Jewish. Sam Zell, who bought the paper in 2007, is a Jew, but top editor Russ Stanton is not.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You keep trying to justifying your moronic bigotry with "I'm not talking about Jews; I'm only talking about Zionists!!!"  If you're even pretending to tell the truth there, then you'd need to show evidence that the Jews who ARE in the media, are Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take your stupid bigotry back to stormfront.

       I don't belong to Stormfront and know nothing about that organization. I don't have any neo-Nazi Web sites. Your information seems to be unreliable. And, yes,

        Jews do run the popular media in America
       </a>
       , all of it. I should add for open-minded readers that the important factors are twofold: Jews, who have predominently Zionist inclinations, control American news, and hence, what Americans perceive as the events of the world; and by controlling entertainment media such as movies and television, Jews have been able to socially engineer the American population in accordance with a Zionist agenda.

       but it shows you how they got to where they are and how they got the control they believe they deserve over the people. I do not agree with all of it, but its is very interesting to see how some things can be possible, but the facts of the accusations they make are legitimate.

       Actually, it's your kind of thinking that's causing the world's problems. If you weren't so blind, you would understand who "they" are and help stop them rather than act like because you can't fathom it, it must not be true. It is. They are doing these things. Pay attention and stop being so ignorant.

       If you're so enlightened, then perhaps you can tell a "blind" and "ignorant" guy like me exactly who "they" are?
      </p>
      <p>
       And seeing as it appears to be common knowledge in this subreddit who "they" are, why not call them by their name instead of using vague labels like in some bad movie? It only makes you look silly, you know...

       I'm sorry I don't have a list of names to provide for you. But imagine you are a super wealthy billionaire and you and some of your Bilderburg buddies, Trilateral Commission member buddies, Zionist friends, sit at a table and a realize the world's resources are being depleted very quickly and most of this terrible problem could be solved if only we didn't have so many people and that those people weren't breeding like rabbits?
      </p>
      <p>
       How long would it take for you guys to begin plotting ways to eliminate this problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or imagine the same group understanding that if SHTF, they are the ones with the most to lose... how long before that same group decides to begin controlling matters to make sure they don't lose their stuff in a crazy riot begun by millions of starving, unprepared, ignorant "breeders &amp; feeders" in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't take long but if it took longer than a minute, then you probably wouldn't be in that group in the first place. These guys didn't get there because they had great grades in school. Ruthless comes to mind.  What's happening is a natural sequence of events...

        This is the material that will put Ron Schmaul, and his treasonous brood, way down and into the ground - convcted and executed as capital traitors, in the matter of the 911 attacks!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that 60,000 + Jews stayed away from work at the WTC Towers on 911, warned via the Odigo Hebrew language messaging service, and from the pulpit of New York synagogues the Friday before, and watched the immolation of their co workers live on television.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST Engineer Sunder says.. “on 911 there were between 8,500 and 9,000 occupants in each building,” ABC News Anchor Peter Jennings while the drama was still unfolding said, “the normal total of workers at the WTC Towers was around eighty thousand.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunder’s total of between seventeen and eighteen thousand souls in the Towers, makes some sixty two thousand or so absent using Peter Jennings figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly 500 foreign nationals from over 80 different nations, were killed in the World Trade Center, as a center of world trade and finance this is not surprising, it is known that many Israelis work in the field of international trade and finance .. The laws of probability dictate, that there should have been a considerable number of Israelis dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alon Pinkas, Israel’s Consul General in New York, confirmed that one Israeli was killed in each of the planes that crashed into the towers, and one Israeli who had been the WTC on business was also killed .. Surely that makes around sixty thousand good reasons to hate Jews!
      </p>
      <p>
       The famous “dancing Israelis”who were spotted in several locations filming — and celebrating — the attacks. Their names were Sivan &amp; Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Schmuel, Oded Ellner. They later appeared on an Israeli talk show and claimed to be “documenting the event”. CIA agent Robert Baer confirmed their cameras were set up BEFORE the first plane struck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another group of Israelis were caught with truck bombs around the George Washington Bridge. A third group of Jews were caught with a van that had a mural painted on the side literally depicting the 9/11 attacks, these vans were working for Mossad front company “urban moving systems,” under the direction of Mossad agent Dominic Suter, who fled to Israel immediately after 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the weight of the evidence implicating them in involvement in the attacks, ALL of these Israeli Jews were sent back to Israel by the orders of the Head of Homeland Security, dual citizen and Zionist extraordinaire Michael Chertoff.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Yeah it is a hangin' offense, for Members of Congress to turn away from hard evidence, that Jews not Osama bin Laden and 19 crazed Arab, perped the attacks!
