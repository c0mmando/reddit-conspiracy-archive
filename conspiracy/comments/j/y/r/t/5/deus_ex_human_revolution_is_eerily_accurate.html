       Let me just start by saying that I realize that this is a game and they want it to be grounded in reality since it only takes place 16 years from now (2027). Yes they're bound to use some things happening around now to create a "Base" story/history for this fictitious world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to the Conspiracy related things. This may be mildly spoilerly if you want to play the game and have NOTHING spoiled STOP READING HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       So in this game the country is basically in shambles. Detroit has hobos at every corner and the only booming part of town is the corporation you work at. With in the first city (Detroit) you'll find radios, which are also all around the world. This person seems to be a mild parody of Alex Jones or someone of that type. They basically yell about what's going on and how they have to hide from the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA. They mention things like the government doesn't exist that we're ruled by corporations and special interests kept in a constant state of fear so that we feel like we need the government. He also talks a lot about the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group.... If you haven't caught on these are all things happening right now... REX-84 is mentioned time and time again in emails, on the radio, by "criminals". You even go into a FEMA detention center/bunker. The cops are basically Military in the game patrolling the streets on foot with assault weapons. It's so eerily accurate to what I think could potentially be our country in 16 years. They even mention the "Illuminati" later in the game... It's probably them just wanting to be accurate or make it as believable as possible but a part of me hopes this was set up to make people that are fans of the game to google and talk about the legislation/groups mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR  Game mentions FEMA, DHS, REX-84, Alex Jones Radio Host Parody, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group and Illuminati, amongst others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts? Oh and also this game is reaaaaaallllyy good and fun :)

       The first game was all about the Illuminati. You start off as a UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) officer, only to find out the group is run by, and is in effect the secret police of, an Illuminati offshoot group. You later join the "terrorist" group you were fighting at the start to take them down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big bad guy is a former Illuminati leader, who  has a computer at area 51 that all the worlds communications are filtered through. Long story short he plans to meld with the computers AI and become a digital Dictator/god. Deus ex machina, "God in the machine" get it? :) The new game is a prequel btw, the first game happens in 2052.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it came out in 2000.

       How do you conspiracy people not know about this game? :)

       Exactly... the first deus ex... pretty much WAS the only proper conspiracy story game ever made...

       I mean this kind of sums up why so many nuts on here are so ignorant of reality... they haven't bloody left their basement to actually go see it.

       Alpha Protocol is a hell of a conspiracy game. It's about an agent that gets burned/blacklisted. There is corporation which is illegally selling arms on the blackmarket and setting false flag attacks in motion to increase profit and us interests by creating events that casue odd political laws/regs to be passed. The game has a lot of choice to it as well

       It's kind of cool.. but I find in interesting that only the greatest gam in the history of mankind actually managed to pull off a working conspiracy theory after years of development.

       Well I was 10 when the game came out so that gives me a bit of an excuse. I also knew that the current game was a prequel however I thought it was made by different people so I wasn't sure about the first ggame. That actually does sound like an amazing story-line I might have to look into playing the original.

       Actually what happened was the same team that did 1 did 3 for the most part(different names now but same guys). The second game was the oddball, not made by them, and not a great game. The story goes waaay too scifi.

       I was 10 when it was released. I'll definitely have to seek it out, also I thought DEHR was made by a different group so I wasn't sure if it was going to be that similar with all the conspiracy stuff based on real legislation and what not.

       Its a cyberpunk game. Cyberpunk accurately predicted all this 2 decades ago...

       (Predict - Pre-Dictate; to say, see before. That which you focus on shall come to pass - thus the massive amount of Programming in the media - they dont call it "Programming" for no reason. You need to PAY attention - i.e. give your attention to the programming such that it can come to pass.)

       You don't think large corporations are in control of the world right now?  The world is a business,  16 years isn't that far ahead and I'm not sure big Corporations will let go of this kind of control in that span of time.

       I didn't give an opinion one way or the other about corporations controlling the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I merely made a statement about the choice of words used.

       How can something be accurate but also only potentially true in somebodies opinion?

       I know there was 2 other games and that DEHR was a prequel but I thought DEHR was made by a different developer so I thought things might be a bit different.
