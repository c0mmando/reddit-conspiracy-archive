      <p>
       It was about 7 months ago, I was a member of Facebook, and had a fairly large (knew everyone personally) group of friends, and a very active news-stream. It was around this time that I became very interested in the Truth Movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would often post links regarding 9/11 truth, and other various theories. I began to notice that certain links I posted to the news-stream would be instantly moved to the bottom of the page, and in some cases COMPLETELY IGNORED, they would never enter the stream. So I knew I was being censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was around the time when the Alex Jones V for vendetta thing was going on, and I decided that I liked the idea of an upside-down pyramid to convey my dislike for globalism. I found a picture of an pyramid from a dollar bill, and edited it in paint to look like a V, highlighting/outlining the V it's self. I then tried to post it to the news-stream, it was ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried a second time, this time it worked, but not only did it post the intended picture, it also posted a very sensitive picture from my hard drive I took of some marijuana while at a friends house over a year ago. Anyone that uses Facebook knows it's virtually impossible to mistakenly post unintended pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to first select the picture (which wasn't even in the same folder), then you go to a confirmation page, just to make sure you want to share it. So there is not just one confirmation, there is two. The picture of marijuana was not in the confirmation, I NEVER SELECTED IT. Yet, there it was, right next to the upside down pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew right then and there that I had been hacked, the contents of my hard drive had been reviewed and or downloaded by someone concerned with my point of view. I decided immediately that I would cancel my account.
      </p>
      <p>
       During account cancellation they ask you why you are leaving. I put something down like "something very strange is going on here, you win". They also have you type a human verification thing. You know, those little boxes with gibberish that are nearly impossible to read and almost never actually spell a real word. Well in my case, the word I had to type was "cornered cat".
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire experience freaked me out, and I no longer use any social networking. I'm sure that's what the intended outcome was all along. To scare me into not sharing the links I was finding, and to not make upside down pyramids...
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, FACEBOOK = CIA

       So, let's get this straight...
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook is intentionally hiding your anti-globalism pictures, and scanning your hard drive and uploading pictures of marijuana as well, in an effort to... discredit you?  Their CAPTCHA system is also in on it, and generated a suggestive phrase to mock you on your way out?

       Do you think the government would randomly target some no name kid with a few conspiracy websites listed on his facebook and zero ability to do anything about them. This is more a case of being too paranoid to realize your building personal conspiracies from thin air.

       I post stuff to FB all the time that is not along the MSM lines and I do feel like it either gets buried or censored. I have thought that for a long time since I do have friends that are savvy to the current trends and would comment and share my articles, but many times the posts go unnoticed. It's not a scare tactic, it's a cover-up. They're not trying to frighten us. They're trying to bury us...under debt, under work, and under a FB feed full of inane FMLs.

       What's more likely - Facebook is a part of a massive government coverup conspiracy that is hiding YOUR posts from the world because you
       <em>
        know too much
       </em>
       , or... your friends just didn't comment on your post.

       The fact that Keytap's comment is currently -1 is an indictment to this entire SubReddit. I believe in the 9/11 Truth Movement but you really have to use some sort of common sense. What you are describing simply is not possible. The man-hours it would take would be phenomenal and the pay-off completely worthless. The reason your links go missing is because they have been marked by many other users as spam and are automatically blocked. Everything else IS A COINCIDENCE. You can believe in certain conspiracies and the existence of coincidences. It's not a either or choice.

       What a ridiculous non-phrase. What does that even mean? How do you even know there is ANY government intervention? By your thinking any action anywhere in the world no matter what can be seen as an act of government and therefore not a coincidence. You are saying here that coincidences do not exist and yet you are upvoted. I'm unsubscribing from this Subreddit and I will never be back. Goodbye.

       A phenomenal amount of man-hours?  Impossible?  That's odd.... last I heard, government agencies like the CIA and companies like Facebook are swimming in billions of dollars, as well as the most advanced &amp; sophisticated computer technology on the planet.  Man-hours?  That's hilarious.

       The fact that this comment is at +7 is also an indictment. You've addressed one aspect of my post, man-hours. Your defence against the argument that it would simply not be possible to scan all pictures posted to Facebook for anti-Government material, then scan your hard-drive AUTOMATICALLY for incriminating evidence. How does it pick up a picture of marijuana? Then it will replace your picture with this magically found image, then its Captcha system for no reason at all will generate a mocking phrase. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE without human intervention and this would not in any way be a worthwhile use of time for any agenda they have planned no matter how crazy you are. FFS people think. You make the rare intelligent sceptic amongst you look retarded simply by your own lack of logical thinking.

       I didn't say I agree with the OP, and that this is definitely a conspiracy and the government is after him or anything of that nature.  You said this kind of thing is impossible, and I'm simply saying its not, based on the sheer computing power, money, and resources the CIA has at their disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also didn't say no human presence was necessary.  But you seem to imply that it would take an entire department of computer professionals many, many hours to pull off what a teenaged hacker could probably do in minutes, given the right tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it all just coincidence?  I'm inclined to think so.  But I can't speak for the CIA and their agendas, or what they consider a "worthwhile use of their time", and neither can you.

       Censoring people on FB is impossible??? Lots of alternative media sites are blocked from FB who recognizes them as spam. How did it ever get to the point where alternative media news sites are treated that way? Who created the policy that said these sites were spam?

       I'm not, and neither is Keytap, in any way suggesting that censorship on Facebook does not happen or is not possible. There is no policy regarding certain sites you incomparable imbecile. There is a button MARK AS SPAM. Enough people mark an article / site as spam and it will be MARKED AS SPAM. This is not complicated. Please think before posting.

       as a matter of fact, FB automatically blocks links, and even words associated with
       <em>

       competing social websites... that's obviously part of a policy that specifically targets, and filters specific url's...

       LOL, your problem seems to be that you cannot, even when faced with a completely reasoned and rational argument look at your assumptions with anything else than fervour. You are even worse than the people to consume the media's bullshit because at least their bullshit is well made, you're just scoffing down your own fecal idiocy. Pointing out that Facebook won't let you advertise competing services on their website does not forward the argument that they spend their time slightly scaring people who post anti-government articles.

       you can't win an argument with insults and fancy, pompous words. it is you making assumptions when you say that they (FB) only block competing social websites. you originally said they didn't block any websites, and that they had no such policies in place. please explain to the community how you are so intimately aware of the policies of the greatest intelligence gathering tool the world has ever known.

       Pompous words? "I knew right then and there that I had been hacked, the contents of my hard drive had been reviewed and or downloaded by someone concerned with my point of view." The problem with your creepy Facebook experience and so much of the paranoid ramblings you find here is the sheer arrogance in assuming anyone gives even a microscopic fuck about what you're posting to Facebook. They gave so much of a fuck that they hacked into your computer and uploaded a picture of marijuana! Wow. We'll never agree on anything as you're capable of writing that phrase seriously.

       "For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations."

       And? Your irrelevant quote simply states that JFK believes there is a conspiracy. How is that relevant to you believing this conspiracy extends to slightly scaring you on Facebook? Why remove it from your Facebook? You do realise that for you to post it to Facebook it has to be available? It's not like Facebook is some magic entity, it's simply a social media network online. If they're really as omniscient as you claim why don't they just remove the original articles rather than going to the trouble of performing the nonsense you're describing?

       because it's not rational of you to so easily dismiss the Kennedy quote even though one of the things he's directly referring to has to do with our very own intelligence services (corrupt). you're presenting a very hard-line, nonsensical, and just plain irrational argument.

       and I suppose you have evidence proving they're isn't any "links"? besides, theories are only irrelevant when you have facts, which neither of us have, though i do have a small body of evidence which highlights very specific censorship by FB, censorship (mind you) with only one obvious beneficiary. anyone of rational thought can draw the line between the two. all this is far more than you have, and a point you initially denied

       "In science rational assumptions are often based on theories". Yes, well I guess you could even say that a theory itself is simply rational assumptions made on the basis of surrounding facts which is then itself tested. The drivel you are spewing could even be called a theory, the facts that it is based on however are extremely tenuously linked to the hypothesis you are driving towards and as we test your conspiracy theory we find it lacking don't we? Oh a quote from someone about social media sites being open to investigation which starts with "I think" which you are trying to use as supporting evidence of your theory that Facebook engages in active censorship of Anti-Government sites and employs people to root through people's hard drives for pictures of marijuana which they can then post for no reason. In their spare time they create vaguely threatening captchas for these people as well. You are saying Apples are Purple, I am saying prove it and then you blather on about it being obviously true because Oranges are orange. You fail in every single one of your responses to address or strengthen your own argument. As involved as you are in now trying to win this ridiculous non-contest for the sake of your own self-improvement try and see the flaws in your arguments.

       Again here we have you shouting about how oranges are oranges proves apples are purple. I finally give up. You're incapable of understanding the very basics of logical thought and I guess that's probably what leads you to see conspiracies where none exist. For my one final attempt to improve your reasoning, why would I need a "basis of surrounding facts" when it is you who is postulating this theory? If I say a hedgehog lives in the sky and rules the world I would not expect you to give me a basis of surrounding facts that disproves it. This is really simple stuff.

       Again, you fail to actually address the point. Your question is completely irrelevant to the point yet again. Your being or not being an activist does not make your story similar to what you have managed to "prove" through your links. Facebook may censor activist groups or websites from being posted but is this the same thing as them singling out individuals and hacking into their computer, uploading pictures from their computer to Facebook and creating slightly scary captchas for them? I really don't understand how you can't see the massive holes in your ability to debate a point.

       That's pretty amusing, forcing the debate to evolve in my favour? It's called a logical progression of thought. Your Creepy Facebook Experience is nothing more than your own paranoia and self-importance magically combining into a conspiracy. You have shown no evidence that your story is even close to a possibility, you fail to address the major elements of your tale such as the hacking into of your computer and the uploading of the marijuana picture, the captcha system or even why they would bother. I'm done here. Goodbye and I really do hope, with no ill will, that you get better at being able to debate. I do believe that there are conspiracies out there but your current inability to debate mixed with your obvious fervour will do nothing but make everyone look bad and will only add to the idea of "conspiracy theorists" as nutters.

       One last thing. it is you who fail to grasp the point, rather deliberately or otherwise. "whats so hard to understand here? i'm an activist, i've experienced censhorship (as I've documented happens)." I'm going to make this very very simple as I thought I had done so previously. You have shown no evidence of any intervention on Facebook's part towards individual activists, you have shown no evidence of Facebook taking part in any breaching of computer security, you have shown no evidence of Facebook scaring people with captchas and finally you have shown no evidence that what you are suggesting is even possible. What you have shown is that Facebook has intervened against Anti-Cut protestor groups near the Royal Wedding. I really can't put this any simpler.

       I'm not saying it's not "a policy" you crazy crazy man. I'm saying that there is not a policy regarding certain sites, such as conspiracy sites, 9/11 truth sites etc. How do I know that their policy of removing spam isn't applied to certain websites? I'm sure it is once those websites are marked by enough people as spam. Do I work for FB now? Can I use logical thinking to see the glaring holes in your crazy assertions, yes. As to your final sentence, do you honestly think Facebook roots through every anti-government site someone posts there and adds it to a big list of sites to "make disappear"?

       honestly I don't think it was an automated system that pulled the picture, and posted it to FB. Though I do think it was an automated system that discovered me.
      </p>
      <p>
       in other words, I think there is an automated system that searches for people linking to certain sites, or posts that express an anti-establishment point of view. I think that the worst of the automatically discovered dissenters (depending of course on their posts), are then handed over to real people, hackers, to discredit, scare, whatever...

       I think the US Government is scared shitless that civil unrest and riots will break out in America, as they are in the UK. i also think a majority of that unrest will be a result of alternative news sites, and blogs...

       No they don't. The show that Facebook removed Anti-Cut websites on teh day of the Royal Wedding. That obviously does not show that Facebook has a policy of removing any other sites, can you show any focus of theirs on conspiracy sites, 9/11 Truth Sites or anything conspiracy related?

       Sigh, you've managed to make up a story in your head that not even the OP has referenced. The idiocy here makes me sick and I honestly and truly despair for any advancement in the cause of truth. The OP is saying that his links to articles go missing from Facebook. This is because those links / articles have been marked as spam by a large percentage of the people who have seen that previously posted link.

       During the very first class meeting our Prof introduces himself as an important figure in Republican strategy and a speech writer for Nixon and Reagan.  Everything was going normal until I felt as if someone was staring at me. I turned to my right in the direction of the classroom door and a young man wearing a suit and tie was staring at me. I returned the eyeballing and immediately he  twisted back behind the doorway. Wow , I thought, this isn't going to turn out to be spooks in training..? After the first hour Prof struts around the class speaking about war and just retelling much of what the Govt wants us to think about war, nationalism, patriotism, etc...He looks stright at mmy eyes and begins to speak about how Arab hijackers perp'ed 911. raises his voice and exclaims with a giggle that if anyone thought 911 was an inside , youd have to be completely insane. classroom goes alone with it and giggles abound, meanwhile I sat there poker faced debating whether or not I should argue this point by simply saying, "building 7". I sat there in silence while he looks to me slyly continuing on about political idealism. I look to me right again and two of these young men as ONE eyeballing me like the Three stooges one on top of the other from behind the door jam. Wow, I thought, i never thought this would happen to me because of what I had been adding to myspace page. The only thing I could possibly think of as to why this would be happening. I guess they do research on their students beforehand...what to do you think? Think I was being monitored and it just so happens these were the local guys? Very unnerving event. Thats basically the story. I had written a long essay about the Illuminati and had many truth articles on my myspace page, since deleted.

       some of you are not taking into the account the fact that FB was used to help start the Arab Spring, which has so far resulted in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. To say that a grass-roots movement starting on FB couldn't turn into something of concern for a ruling government is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how you stifle government dissent? You kill it at the root, where it begins. All great revolutions have started with nothing more than a spark. Who's to say the US Government isn't actively stifling dissent, even be it mundane? especially on websites capable of reaching millions of people.

       the posts I made which seemed to be ignored more frequently than others had to do with UN Agenda 21. what is so spammy about Agenda 21? What is so crazy about Agenda 21?

       I had an experience where all private messages from the past 5 years between me and my cousin were deleted on FB. Here's the details....
He's four years younger than me and in the navy. He was in Washington State prior to Bin Laden being killed. He got orders to ship out, and when he did, I send him a message that said "all kidding aside (we don't get along politically), take care of yourself because i feel like some shit is about to go down". When I went back to check on the time stamp of the message, I found that all of the messages between us had been deleted. 5 years worth of private messages all gone. FB is not secure. It took that slap in the face for me to realize it.

       no more than an hour following my post below, i received a phone call from the "Gun's Rights Club" asking me a poll question about "whether Obama had made some sort of correct decision about guns rights." I NEVER ever have received a phone call like this in my life. I answered the guy with hey Im busy and am not following politics goodbye... lol He sounded like he was trying to put words in my mouth. These guys are one-track minded man. I was about to say , Hey Broseph, that's PRESIDENTObama  to you! WEIRD coincidence !
