       Voting is undeniably necessary in any free society.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Voting against our politicians in droves could at least help in identifying voter fraud/election rigging."
      </p>
      <p>
       To vote against one politician, you have to vote for another.  The reason approval ratings for Congress are at record lows is a result of American citizens knowing there is a systemic virus of special interest buying out sociopathic hack politicians that say premeditated talking points, and this has infected Washington for decades. It's an indictment of both parties for having sold out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two potential steps in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The more revolutionary move would be to have a direct democracy where the citizens vote for legislation themselves as Gerald Celente has been recently advocating, though he shouldn't be credited as the first person to come up with this idea.  There are still problems with a direct democracy.  Media outlets could still sway public opinion through disinformation and fear into making serious voting mistakes, and then there's always voting fraud. It's clear to see how this is an improvement over voting for the best politician money can buy.  The internet would be invaluable for the dissemination of news and information that mainstream media would suppress.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) An impetus to assert a fair opportunity for third parties into the mainstream US political arena.  Like two competing giant corporations mutually in competition to any fairness from other businesses, the Republican and Democratic parties mutually thwart any challenging third party candidates by dominating the US mainstream media outlets.  Once again the Internet needs to play a major part here.

       The logical inverse of this statement would be the following:

      <p>
       There exists a society that is not free and where voting is debatably unnecessary.
      </p>

       There it is.  I say that is where we are at now.

       Voting is a method (intentional or not) of keeping people from rioting in the streets.

       People want to do something to make a change. If they believe their vote will do something, they're less likely to resort to more... violent measures.

       So, you would argue (I assume) that with voting, there was substantial political change? 
Although the OP does not specify the time (women's suffrage, civil rights, GLBT rights, etc.. all came via voting power), would you say any substantial political changes have occurred in the last decade thanks to voter turnout?
      </p>
      <p>
       Protip: Electing Obama was not substantial political change.

       Same, I find it fascinating because it appeals to such powerful emotions and it's so ambiguous and has so many "catch all" statements it's hard to refute. Also the religions that say the Earth, the body, and fucking are bad (all things that are natural I might add) are the most unnatural ones. Makes me laugh everytime.

       1) There is nothing wrong with paper money, it's like saying valid promissory notes are harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Even when coins and notes represented real and redeemable resources, and in some economies the precious metal minted as a coin, their value still fluctuated via supply, demand and exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Today's money does have a value, it's just the way that value is derived is corrupt. If the money had no value, you couldn't buy a pepsi at 7-11.

       Gold has almost no intrinsic material value. It's only valuable because fools like you are willing to exchange currency for it (oh the irony, it stings) and there's no reason to believe that it will be considered valuable in the future.

       I pretty much agree with this. The value of gold is its scarcity and the effort (value) invested in it's recovery. Precious metals have been used to regulate currency by ensuring that the supply can not be inflated rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not stupid to use a resource like this to represent value, as it wouldn't be to use any other random scarce resource. It does have the added advantage of being shiny and pliable.

       Computers and other electronics (is extremely malleable, does not corrode and conducts electricity very well), gold is used in almost every sophisticated electronic device, reflects heat when used in glass for climate control in buildings and gold is used in every space vehicle launched by NASA.  Every one.  The fact that it is used mostly for jewelry is the absurd part.  But yes, our paper issue currency is an illusion.  You can exchange it for goods and services but it is only a matter of time until what is essentially worthless becomes exactly that.

       I think you lack any understanding of currency at all. Gold has been used as representation of effort for 2700 years, which sort of makes your points regarding it's application irrelevant. Golds value does not derive from its applications. It comes from the fact that people agree to trust that it is hard to forge, takes effort to recover and has a stored value.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been used because of it's relative scarcity and difficulty in recovery. It is a representation of stored value. I.e I invest time and effort growing a crop, I exchange that crop for gold and the crop is consumed. The only lasting item is the gold, which is a representation of the value or effort invested in growing the crop. That stored value could be represented as sea shells and it would still be valid. Only sea shells are easily recovered, and therefore not as effective as gold. (note: some random society did use a rare form of seashell).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paper notes are derived from promissory notes, which represented a tangible asset such as commodities or gold (stored value). They are easier to transport and exchange, and upon standardisation became a common currency, redeemable for gold (stored value). Watch any of the videos pointing out fractional reserve banking and you will see they applaud a paper issued currency which is redeemable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       wrong with paper money, the problem usually resides with the value represented by it.

       I understand where the problem lies.  That is what I was alluding to.  I was mostly responding to your comment that it has the plus of being shiny and pliable.  It's 
applications go way beyond that.  I'm sure if there are extra terrestrials observing us or discover our planet in the future on of the biggest jokes among them is going to be that we used gold to make jewelry and back our fancy colored paper that we use to trade for goods and services.
Your history lesson aside, I'm pretty sure we haven't gone by the gold standard in some time.  Wouldn't it stand to reason that the value of gold, then, is in it's applications?  Much like oil, diamonds and other natural resources?  I am not, unfortunately, an economist or expert on natural resources but I'm sure you are an economist, geologist and all around expert on everything on this world and others so please educate me and the rest of my poor fellow ignoramuses.

       You really don't know? Precious metals have a value that is independent of what the government says, or wants. Nobody can "place a value" on gold, it simply has a value. When that gold is in the form of a coin, then the coin has a value because of the gold that is in it -- a universal, timeless value. Paper money on the other hand, is a piece of paper. It's value is all illusion. To grant paper money value, you must engage in magical thinking. If the government collapses, that imaginary value, which never existed in the first place, vanishes instantly -- because it was never real.

       What the fuck are you talking about? What value does gold have that we have not placed upon it?
       <em>
        Nothing
       </em>
       has value that we do not place upon it. It doesn't even have any practical uses outside of the fact that it conducts electricity slightly better than copper and other such metals. Its too soft to use to make useful tools. People place value on it for two reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Its shiny
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        It's rare (not extremely rare, but kind of rare)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Neither of those things makes it inherently more valuable than anything else.

       Gold is valuable because it is valued. It has always been valued. That is how human beings regard it, as a substance of great worth. Paper, on the other hand, is just paper. It can be associated by a governing authority with an abstract value -- a value that at one time was measured by an amount of gold -- but it is just paper. A piece of paper has no particular value, even a piece called "money" -- because it's still a piece of paper. The illusion of value attached to it vanished as soon as the government that claims to back it falls. Gold, on the other hand, doesn't need anyone backing it. It has always possessed value, and probably always will. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? An indifferent thing? Who the fuck cares? It is the reality. Gold has a value that is not conditional on governments or banks or on the form it takes or on what is printed on it or on who possesses it. Hence, an intrinsic value.

       This could be true... I'm not sure about its being an "inside job", but I am sure that WTC7 did NOT fall from office fires.  If people investigate WTC7, without drawing larger conclusions until WTC7 is explained, then I think the whole story would come out.  But if you start off by saying its an "inside job", people refuse to listen to you... not that people listen to anyone anymore anyways :D

       That you can't plan for just 6 months ahead. If we want our country to succeed we need long term plans. I guess, I would want the people to take back control of their country. A new American revolution. It's nothing new, but it's time for Washington D.C. to get a colon cleanse.

       We are economic and political slaves, primarily because of the concepts of compound interest, the government borrowing money from itself, the federal reserve printing money out of thin air and war being a very profitable business.  This is one idea because all of these things are interrelated and each very much depends upon the others.

       Money must be taken out of the hands of the wealthy elite that now controls it, and placed back into the hands of the people. A nation's money should be issued and backed by the government itself, not by any form of private banking institutions, regardless of who runs them ... and we know fucking well who runs them.

       I'm not talking about The Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States treasury states that approximately two-thirds of the entire sum is the public debt. In other words, the money the United States government owes the people, businesses, and foreign governments which purchased treasury bills, notes, and bonds. The remaining one-third is owed by the government to itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets discuss that one-third the “government owes itself,” because that statement is misleading. When the money borrowed from the public,  businesses, and other countries did not cover spending, the government decided  to borrow from its trust funds such as Social Security. It withdrew funds from  these sources because at the time they were in surplus. However, they were only in excess as long as the working taxpayers contributing didn’t need to utilize the  funds for their intended purposes. Therefore that one-third the government “owes  to itself,” it actually owes to the American people.

       doing as they please with no regard for life, liberty, or happiness.

       As people of this country, citizen or immigrant, it is your solemn duty to relieve or punish those whose hands you have put your well-being and who should take your well-being and strip it bare and even sell that well being to the highest bid. As individuals, you cower is disgust and shame. As a country now is the time to unite; now is the time to stand up and reclaim your dignity and light that torch once more; to be the beacon for humanity as we once were.

       give them credit. an entire class of humans decided to band together in ancient times, agree to a lie, never work, and control the population. that doesn't mean there's no greater power out there, it just means it sure as fuck isn't a hateful little desert god that kills infants as they sleep and decrees endless genocides.

       I'm a Christian and IMO I don't really think it's a scam unless you are going extreme with it and harming people (In other words, fundamentalism or a cult). I don't think there are many violent religions out there, and most of them teaches peace. I guess you can argue but that's what I believe.

       God is not "a being"; rather,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/b77es/you_know_his_name_wasnt_really_jesus_christ_right/c0larnt?context=3">
        God is Being
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews and Muslims are actually allowed to know this. Only Christianity has chosen to put on the false face of god as "a being" which can be depicted in art to look like an old man in the clouds.

       I think the moment of greatest terrifying clarity came about when I accepted the narrow scope of most people's attention, time and competence.  That was when I realized there were almost no large scale conspiracies, no masterminds behind social norms and institutions, and many many offices and committees actually attempted to work pretty much as they describe themselves.  There is no one behind 99% of the cameras in the world, and those that are would mostly capture a lot of nose picking if the feed was reversed.  For all of us, at least most of the time, whether citizens, business people, secretaries, politicians, bureaucrats, officers, or vagrants - we are just looking for something to which we may agree or consent.

       Jesus died confronting the government for its lies.  the resulting cover-up was so hopeless that its only aim was to take his message and turn it into a state-sponsored religion, after centuries of direct censorship by execution ("throw the Christians to the lions") had failed.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (39) Jesus said, "The pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis) and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves."
       </p>
       <p>
        (40) Jesus said, "A grapevine has been planted outside of the father, but being unsound, it will be pulled up by its roots and destroyed."
       </p>
       <p>
        (41) Jesus said, "Whoever has something in his hand will receive more, and whoever has nothing will be deprived of even the little he has."
       </p>
       <p>
        (42) Jesus said, "Become passers-by."
       </p>
       <p>
        (43) His disciples said to him, "Who are you, that you should say these things to us?"
       </p>
       <p>
        &lt;Jesus said to them,&gt; "You do not realize who I am from what I say to you, but you have become like the Jews, for they (either) love the tree and hate its fruit (or) love the fruit and hate the tree."
       </p>
       <p>
        (44) Jesus said, "Whoever blasphemes against the father will be forgiven, and whoever blasphemes against the son will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either on earth or in heaven."
       </p>
       <p>
        (45) Jesus said, "Grapes are not harvested from thorns, nor are figs gathered from thistles, for they do not produce fruit. A good man brings forth good from his storehouse; an evil man brings forth evil things from his evil storehouse, which is in his heart, and says evil things. For out of the abundance of the heart he brings forth evil things."

       of course that's radical historical revisionism if you ask most atheists or christians.  but somebody wrote all that shit and stashed it away in a jar for a few millenia.  and i think they probably had a really fucking good reason.

        13“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. 14[“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.]
       </p>
       <p>
        15“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        16“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.’ 17“You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold? 18“And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.’ 19“You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering? 20“Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it. 21“And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it. 22“And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
       </p>
       <p>
        23“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others. 24“You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
       </p>
       <p>
        25“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean 
the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence. 26“You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.
       </p>
       <p>
        27“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. 28“So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
       </p>
       <p>
        29“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, 30and say, ‘If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ 31“So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32“Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers. 33“You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?
       </p>
       <p>
        34“Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city, 35so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 36“Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.

       it's hardly my idea. admittedly, i occasionally correspond with a Dr. Eric Pianka and am an environmentalist, but i'd be more on board with forced sterilization of all and in-vitro reproduction for the few who are fit to pass on their genes. (based on IQ, psychological fitness, and health-NOT racial/national criteria.) 
Freedom and happiness are divisible by population. If we lose a billion people, no more unemployment, for example.

       eugenics is an American idea, not a Nazi one....and it one with merit. why let the sick and weak breed? we're polluting the gene pool by allowing the poorest and most useless, those that present the biggest drain on humanity, to spread, while the artists and scientists die childless.

       I never mentioned Nazism.  America is plenty fascist, and the idea is fascist.

       "Why let the sick and weak breed?"  Maybe because the right to control over your ability to have children is a natural right?  Why on earth would anyone have the authority to decide who is and who is not fit to breed?  You may argue that science can determine who has the "best" genes, and therefore, who should be allowed to reproduce.  This simply ignores the fact that human beings are incredibly diverse, and we have a number of talents and strategies for surviving.  You can't place a value on something that is qualitative and call it objective.  Secondly, any type of program that is meant to "purify" will almost certainly be used to "wipe out" the enemies of the group that decides who can reproduce.  Whether or not the factors used include race, human nature will guarantee this type of program will be used to wipe out certain groups of people (Critics of the government in particular).  The biggest drain on humanity is not the poor and weak.  It is the people in power that deny the poor man his basic human rights.

       That's not a billion people. At
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       , maybe 10k who are actually committed to this in the grand global scheme. The rest are followers who would be detered from the ideology of oppressing the masses, if the masses were to surgically remove that 10k.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it became certain that the masses no longer tolerate such things, and have the capability to implement precision targetting of oppressors... the ideology of oppressing would  disappear in a heartbeat. (ala Judge Parker's assertion: it isn't the severity of the punishment which deters &lt;an activity&gt;, it is the certainty of it.)

       The elites that make decisions about the economic control of the world are rich old white guys.

       Blaming the jews, the zionists, and the israelis is entirely missing the point and detracting from your potential to create substantive change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there rich jews with power, power they are abusing? Of course. But they are no more doing it as representatives of the jewish faith than are the rest of the rich old guys doing it as representatives of christianity, or paganism, or devil worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you spend all of your time blaming only one specific ethnic group, you lose all credibility. You are scapegoating, which is nothing more than a political trick by non-jews hoping for the power the jews currently hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all of the jews, zionists, and israeli's were... ahem... exterminated, they would be replaced by equally power hungry rich old white guys in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to go after the bankers, fine they probably deserve it, but when you say you want to go after the jewish bankers, it makes you look like a white-power hillbilly.

       I must disagree with you. Just look at the actual power held by Jews in America. They are 2% of the population, yet contribute 50% of the campaign money to the Democratic Party, and 33% to the Republican Party. Jews control the mass media in America -- and by control, I mean they own it, manage it, and determine what gets into it and what is withheld from it. By controling the media, they control the propaganda, and have the ability to engage in long-term social engineering ... which they have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they were totally benign, it would be an unhealthy situation for the nation. But they are not benign. They have a Zionist agenda, and it is in conflict with the best interests of America.

       I'm just here to tell you that the world doesn't work as simplistically as you think it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       By putting a jewish face on 'the elites' you get to blame all jews for your lot in life. This is very convenient but also intellectually lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you spent as much time talking about how protestants controlled Washington, the oil companies, all of the major law firms and multinational corporations you'd have a much better view of where the power is held.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't even begin to address who holds power across the middle east, europe, japan and china.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand you're scarred and you want someone to blame. I get that. You just need to expand the number of people (in your world view) that hold power across the world. If you do that you'll find that the jews aren't responsible for your lot in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct about one thing though, the elites worldwide have no concern whatsoever for the 'best interests of America' they only care about their own interests.

       By deliberately refusing to look at the role of Zionist Jews in the New World Order, you are blinding yourself to one aspect of reality. I know why you are doing it. I understand that you are afraid of ever being labeled as anti-Semitic (or a self-hating Jew if you happen to be Jewish). I know you want to conform to the standards you believe exist in your society, because you've been trained all your life that not to conform to those standards is somehow evil or ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, by deliberately closing your eyes to the very real power Jews have gathered to themselves in the United States over the past century or so, you close your eyes to the real world, and make your decisions based on a fantasy reality that has been tailor-made for your mind by others. No, Jews are not all of the problem, but they are a large part of the problem. That's reality, and hiding your head in the sand won't change it.

       do you have any idea how many jewish people there are in this country...
      </p>
      <p>
       the people at the top of the "pyramid" happen to be jewish.  but those same people have stepped on the rest of that religion over and over again to meet their own goals for their close relatives.  don't generalize about "jewish" people, the last thing this kind of community needs is to be mislabeled as "antisemitic."  call individuals out for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       just think about circumcision.  if jewish people worked together and thought together as one group with collective self-interest, then why the fuck does that shit happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       religious traditions get passed down and fuck people over in every major abrahamic religion.  somebody wrote that part of the Old Testament, you know, where God shows up all of a sudden and tells people to cut off part of their penises with a rock.  think about that one for a while.

       I'm not refusing to look at anything, I acknowledge that some jews are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that jews don't have the monopoly on being evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you to focus exclusively on the jews as the cause of your problems is myopic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you broaden your worldview and stop only getting your information from the confirmation bias/ sounding board of 'blame it on the jews' conspiracy websites, you'll see the real story is much bigger and more complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding my ethnicity, I'm not jewish myself, nor am I concerned about appearing to be anti-Semitic. I'm also not concerned about being accused of hating blacks or asians or women. The only thing I hate is ignorant people who pretend to be free-thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding my standards, I respect free-thinkers. Sadly you've hitched your wagons to intellectual laziness. It's comforting but it won't get you anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding your claim that I'm closing my eyes, I've done no such thing. I acknowledge that jews have considerable power in America and that Israel has a disproportionate influence on American foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that protestants have even more power and Europe, Japan, the middle east and China have a much larger influence on US foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize you've made up your mind about who to blame for your life, I'm just here to tell you you're wrong.

      <p>
       And, specifically, at the pinnacle of those "rich old white guys" is the Rothschild family... who founded Israel to ensure that there would be a constant thorn in the side of the entire world, every day, for as long as they are in power. So, Israel and the Zionists, while secondary to the money masters, is part and parcel of the overall package.

       Apart from that small detail, I agree with much of the rest of what you said. Institutionalized religions (including Judaism, which is inherently racist) are the lairs in which Satan breeds minions.

       Do you really know that or is that something that you've seen on youtube so many times that you now know it without questioning whether or not you have any proof?

       I love it when you ask a simple question (do you have any evidence that the Rothchild's run the world?) and get this kind of response.

       Calling me a troll means you have no evidence.

       Not that an absence of evidence would ever stop you from speaking assuredly about a conclusion that fits your worldview.

       This is  what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a great many people weilding power (especially money as power),  so... to answer your direct troll questioon: No. I don't have proof of
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's plenty of evidence to indicate that very few people have ever weilded their power so dominantly nor for as long as the Rothchild international banking family has for the past 300 years. While others have come and gone, it's been the Rothschilds who have always come through things smelling like a ~~ rose ~~ skunk.

       I'm not questioning the power of the family through history and you could be right, they may be silently running the world behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they don't appear to be the richest people in the world, they don't appear on the radar much in international politics, and they don't appear to be dominant in the banking or media world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, to me at least, it seems like a lot of insinuation and speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the thing that I notice when you have a large group of people in the conspiracy community talking about the Rothchild's as evil, and all of the jewish bankers as evil, and all of the zionists as evil, is that theirs is a movement to blame all of the world's problems on the jews (without any evidence).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm sorry but until you can provide me with some substantive evidence that the Rothchild's are running the world according to a zionist playbook, I will continue to suspect that anti-semitism and ignorance are fueling your ideology rather than a sincere attempt to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a troll is someone who insist on better evidence than youtube videos with scary music then yes I am proudly a troll.

       Again you troll. And, the rest of your post discounts any evidence one might even attempt to reference. All youtube videos are out, no matter how credible. Any lack of evidence where there should be some (ala, media silence) is ruled out.

       Not very familiar with what substantive evidence is, are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the rothchild's are ruling the world surely there is real substantive evidence. Documents, bank statements, correspondences, legal documents, memoranda, contracts, court rulings, diplomatic papers, etc... etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a wealth of forms of evidence I am receptive to. Please offer me evidence.

       Anyone can invent evidence out of thin air and post it on youtube but that doesn't exactly make it good quality evidence, does it?

       Just kidding.  But I really believe it.  I've only seen one picture of her pregnant, and that was at Prince William &amp; Kate's wedding.

       You are more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Dream big and chase those dreams doggedly and you will succeed beyond your imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is not a force on this earth that is more powerful than the force of the imagination. It is, in fact, the only force that brings any change to our existence. If everyone dreamed and pursued those dreams a lot more, and worked shitty wage slave jobs a lot less, the world would be in far better shape.

       That the plutocrats are playing their Endgame very sloppily at this stage in history, because there is real awakening happening across the world.

       The whole lie is separation.  We are all one.  One consciousness experiencing itself subjectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have two basic paths available... Service to Self and Service to Others.

       No human being is worthless, we all have much more value than our market value.

       To be in form is a game, you're playing hide and go seek with your true self.  We choose limits for ourselves in order to make the game fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duality is a condition at this level of form.

       Th next stage of human evolution is going to be a globally networked consciousness.

       The heights are infinite and the depths are infinite.

       There are a lot of games afoot, the trick is not to live in fear of anything or anyone.  All control systems are based on fear.

       That all things are made up of systems upon systems upon systems of becoming. A human being is itself a system of systems all interacting, and a human will then go and interact with other systems. All of reality is made of individual units combining with each other to manifest new levels of reality. Everything is essentially one, the multiplicity, variety, and subjective nature of reality we experience is a product of this process of becoming. When you embody this understanding in action there is no other, only another yourself that is packaged and developed differently and you seek only to help that other understand that there is no other.

       It would be in the best interests of the United States to impose some sane limits on campaign contributions and campaign length, in order to reduce the total costs of a presidential campaign. Limits should be imposed on how much any individual or group can give, since campaign contributions, as the system now stands, are nothing other than bribes. Everyone knows this. It's not even a matter of dispute.

       By contributing a disproportionate amount of money to politicians, Jews are perverting the system, which is supposed to represent the people as a whole, not merely the wealthiest group.

       Similarly, the media of a nation should express the aspirations and beliefs of the people of that nation, not the aspirations and beliefs of a small minority who happens to control the media through money.

       Most people on reddit would consider this (with my amendment) to be entirely accurate.

       Most people would also agree that most corporations are owned and operated by non-jews.

       In this scenario, however, you would solve the fundamental political problem of our time without sounding like a racist.

       Imagine how much more influence you could have if you took this road? You could still hate jews in private, but you'd be far more effective at creating substantive change in America. Which I presume is your goal?

       You are, I assume, being deliberately misleading, since you seem intelligent and articulate. I don't hate Jews. Nowhere do I say such a thing. Why would you say such a thing? It is an insult, and also happens to be completely untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call attention to the disproportionate power held by Jews in the United States because I see it as a problem for the future of the country. There is no hate involved. Jews have a huge amount of power and influence -- an amount of power far above their percentage of the population -- and they use it to forward their own ends, which often conflict with the best interests of the people of America as a whole. That's the problem. Hate doesn't figure into it.

       Don't you see the irony in what you're saying? It's a very slippery slope to assume that everything that may work against the conspiracy theorist movement must be a conspiracy.

       yes I do, I play devils advocate all the time. As I know I can switch my opinion on the matter at any time. My opinion doesn't matter that much anyways. What we're speculating may indeed not be a conspiracy at all, that's just what I felt like typing at the time.

       But like I said, on the internet, anything goes, you have to embrace the random. Therefore I think someone, even one person could be able to manipulate the popularity strongly but possibly having multiple bot accounts on a grand scale. It's quite feasible to achieve very easily. I mean it may not necessarily be true at all, but it's definitely in the cards, and it would be stupid to count it out entirely. Evidence is key of course, but without the ability to prove or disprove, you just have to keep an open eye and mind. That's pretty much the only reason I read this sub reddit at all really, and I'm sure it's the same for you in some sense. Although I do have to say most of it is pure opinionated bull shit. It's definitely an exercise in trying to filter it out, but even then nothing is guaranteed.

       This statement is what puts me off the most. Sure, a lot of things are
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       . But likely? Probably not. This is an awful lot like being an agnostic which, to me, is not productive. Or like being the believer who says that I have to prove there
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       a god instead of the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have is that a lot of people here assume that because something is merely possible, that it
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be true.

       Again, this is illogical.
      </p>
      <p>
       To imply that because other conspiracies have been exposed that conspiracy in general is more likely is fallacious. It seems like you're trying to imply that because someone found a massive sock puppet network conspiracy going on to upvote spam that we can assume that it is somehow more likely that there is a conspiracy afoot to discredit conspiracy theorists. The two are not related and therefore the likelihood of one is not in any way connected to the likelihood of the other.

       It's not a conspiracy when one person does it. It's professional trolling/cyber terrorism plain and simple. I don't believe in anyone's 'conspiracies' but my own, and I don't share those with anyone. I am simply saying here that bots and numbers are easy to manipulate, no conspiracy necessary.

       you're making a blanket statement about everyone on the thread. that's a sign of an ignorant person. you're using schoolyard language to marginalize people...also the sign of an ignorant person. you don't have to be insane to realize that we're being lied to, robbed, and increasingly, even killed by the people who run our government. frankly, one would have to be a complete moron to buy the official story of 9-11 or the fake Bin Laden death.
      </p>
      <p>
       however...there are admittedy people who make us look terrible. theories about space lizards and numerology, about alien gods returning in 2012, about Freemasons controlling everyone's minds, about chemtrails, the list goes on. but those topics were not brought up. painting everyone in the thread with the same brush David Icke gets is simply ignorant.

       The problem with many theorists, regardless of the theory, is that they draw finite conclusions from circumstantial data. Their theory, which actually has no proof, then becomes canonized and untouchable, i.e. "you'd have to be stupid not to see
       <em>
        X
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       They also tend to dismiss arguments that they don't agree with as belonging to the conspiracy instead of analyzing or applying reason to the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the theories here have little more, if any, solid evidence than aliens, lizards, and freemasons. The sooner you accept that the closer you will be to actually being able to accept criticism of those theories.

       there's a positive side to it. perhaps it should just be called 'dissenting inquiry' when the given facts stink to high heaven, and the ugly Cui Bono question points the blame at the ruling elite who stand only to gain from disaster, death, and mayhem. their 'facts' are easily dismissed, and too many new questions are raised, even if the real story may never be found. then again, we'd need to rediscover something called 'dialogue' to make this useful, instead of partisan shrieking and pandering.

       You really don't know? Precious metals have a value that is independent of what the government says, or wants. Nobody can "place a value" on gold, it simply has a value. When that gold is in the form of a coin, then the coin has a value because of the gold that is in it -- a universal, timeless value. Paper money on the other hand, is a piece of paper. It's value is all illusion. To grant paper money value, you must engage in magical thinking. If the government collapses, that imaginary value, which never existed in the first place, vanishes instantly -- because it was never real.
