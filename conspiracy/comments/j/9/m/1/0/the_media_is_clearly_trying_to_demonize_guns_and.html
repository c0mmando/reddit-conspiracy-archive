       Ok so you are just assuming that there are all these unreported cases of heroics, but you have no real basis for that belief. You should fix that situation because opponents of guns have no problems finding examples to the contrary.

       ok, since you were too lazy to look it up (cause it's virtually common sense when you consider 300 million people with 90% ownership) I did it for you. the figures are actually much higher, 2.5 million examples a year of law abiding citizens using firearms to stop crime. if if that figure is way off, you can still assume it happens everyday. i bet you a statistician would have assumed the same thing when given those figures, they are common sense numbers...

       okay well I found the survey where you got your 2.5 million number.  It was a research paper from Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University.  He surveyed only 5000 households.  I don't know enough to say that his research is bullshit but a leap from 5000 surveryed to 2.5 million times is quite a large gap.  It sounds like he used a lot of your "common sense" rather than a lot of "actual knowledge"

       why isn't a 5 thousand household survey, performed by a criminologists enough to convince you it's a fact that a citizen stops a crime with a gun at least one time per day in the US?

      <p>
       it's silly to assume otherwise, even if the numbers are off. i mean c'mon dude, there's 270 million guns and 300 million people in the US...

       you are assuming that all 300 million are using guns to PREVENT crimes.  As much as I would like to believe that everyone is a law-abiding citizen, I can actually provide facts to show that that is not true.

       Listen man, I'm not saying you are wrong.  I'm just saying that when arguing using facts and numbers, it helps to show up to the argument with either one or the other.

       what do accidental discharged have to do with anything? are you actually saying that because someone occasionally has an accident we should ban firearms? i'll tell you right now, if my own child was accidentally killed by a firearm, it would not change my stance on gun ownership, and gun rights.

       exercising the freedoms that come from our Constitution, and Bill of Rights, is far more important than any single persons life, and even more important that many peoples lives. if you don't realize that you're to progressive to be considered a patriot.

       You are the one that uses the argument that guns are needed to stop crimes, and even by your made-up statistics it happens every other day, which will make it about 150 cases per year. Not even saved lifes - just stopping (allegedly) crimes. Is it worth taking the time to consider?

       if you were interested in real facts you'd be doing some of your own research, but its clear you aren't interested in facts, only an ideology. a new age ideology with it's roots in world government, and passive sheeple.

       just answer this. why not apply strict adherence to The US Constitution, and The Bill of Rights? it's really that simple. those documents are far more important than an opinion, which is all you have...

       For one, because it is just a piece of paper. Same reason even the most devout Christians don't apply strict adherence to the Bible.
Plus the Second Amendment could be interpreted as a right of the state to keep its militia (also known as National Guard), which has nothing to do with rednecks driving around with automatic assault rifles.

       so by your own admittance, you're not a devout American. the debate is over, you said it yourself. no need to further debate your sad, anti-American point of view. move to the UK, or Australia, they've lost their God given right to protect themselves and their loved ones with firearms...

       It does not say anywhere in the Bill of Rights that you get to have guns when you're not part of a well-regulated militia.

       And when that was written, the government had muskets and people had musket. Now they have cruise missiles and the original rationale means nothing.

       How about the shooting sports related to gun ownership? ...Or the activity and sport of hunting? Why are these not legitimate reasons to own firearms?

        i'll tell you right now, if my own child was accidentally killed by a firearm, it would not change my stance on gun ownership, and gun rights.

       Here is a fact for you: Of the total number of deaths for all ages in each Cause of Death 1.2% are caused by firearms. 0.8% (two thirds) are caused by ACCIDENTAL FIREARM DISCHARGE.  That is 770 per year.
