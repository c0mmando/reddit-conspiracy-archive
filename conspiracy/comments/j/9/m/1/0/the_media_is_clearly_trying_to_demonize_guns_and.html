    <div class="md"><p>okay well I found the survey where you got your 2.5 million number.  It was a research paper from Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University.  He surveyed only 5000 households.  I don&#39;t know enough to say that his research is bullshit but a leap from 5000 surveryed to 2.5 million times is quite a large gap.  It sounds like he used a lot of your &quot;common sense&quot; rather than a lot of &quot;actual knowledge&quot;</p>
