    <div class="md"><p>Simple enough. They want to protect and strengthen their own group, and they believe that weakening and hurting other more powerful groups in society is a way to do this. Promotion of multiculturalism is a way to weaken the dominant group in Western society -- white Christians of European descent. Jews see Christians as their enemy. They always have, from the very beginning of Christianity, which they did their best to destroy when it was in its infancy. They failed, but they have hated Christianity and Christians ever since, and they have done everything in their power to corrupt and weaken Christian culture. As Jews became more powerful in Western societies, their ability to harm Christian culture increased. The promotion of multiculturalism is their way of destroying Christianity. Of course, they have zero intention of applying the principles of multiculturialism to themselves. To even suggest such a thing is laughable. They want to stay strong. Why would they destroy themselves? No, they want to destroy <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>Someone around these parts turned me on to this a while back.  I&#39;d argue though that it is not necessarily about destroying anyone but instead pacifying anyone (turns out to be everyone besides them) who could possible harm them.  The Jews are not exactly Skynet from Terminator like you are saying but they do seem to believe that a strong everyone else is a slippery slope towards their demise.</p>

<p>I think that it is obvious that they have pitted themselves against reasonable and moral people but I contest the severity, when you say &#39;destroy&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews own Hollywood. This is a claim made by a Jewish guy who wrote an article ablout it. It can be backed up fairly well if you look at the history of Hollywood and the major studios.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 3 major abrahamic religions. Christians, Muslims, and the Jews.</p>

<p>There&#39;s far less Jewish people than there are Christians and when the US was founded, it was done by white anglo saxons.</p>

<p>There was a lot of anti-semitism early on. to combat it, the  best way is to get like minded groups to help you fight.</p>

<p>The ADL is an early group that attached anti-semitism to the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>By combining black rights, gay rights, women&#39;s rights, rights for handicapped, rights for pets, rights for everyone except white christians, the Jewish groups were able to convert liberal minded people to support them, without even really meaning to.</p>

<p>Take a look at r/politics. You can say anything bad about FOX. Say something bad about Jon Stewart and you get attacked by the hivemind idiots who downvote your comments out of fanboy worship and ingrained social culturing.</p>

<p>I just find it adorable how white supremacists and Pro-Muslim Anti-Zionists (many of them are Muslims living in America and Europe) are able to bridge to differences between them and join arms to fight a common Jewish enemy that &quot;wants to take over the world&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Being ant-Zionism isn&#39;t a racist thing, it isn&#39;t an atheist or white supremacist or Islamic thing either. They are just the ones who are up front about it. But because they are the most prolific groups (intentionally because of media saturation), it is easy to lump anyone who distrusts the government of israel and their heavy connection to US domestic and foreign policy into the same groups. You oppose the gaza offensive? Antisemitist. You oppose the genocide of Palestinians? Antisemitist. You oppose Jewish control of western media? Man you must really hate Jews!</p>

<p>Jewish people aren&#39;t my problem. It&#39;s the people manipulating the Jews and the Christians that are the problem. According to Joe Biden, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZmO80dLfE">you don&#39;t have to be a Jew to be a zionist</a>.</p>

<p>Jew, Christian, Muslim. Whatever man, they&#39;re all part of the same crappy cult worship nonsense.</p>

<p>But yeah, keep forgetting that Jews are a race and a religion. I have no issues with the race side, it&#39;s the religious side I have a problem with cause it&#39;s manipulative, exceptionalist, and retarded. Same as the other two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure. I do know that most American Jews oppose illegal immigration, and in the Netherlands, a large number of Jews are very much against further immigration to my country. If you are right, I would argue that Jewish organizations apparently don&#39;t represent the Jewish people on this issue:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/10/12/2741253/poll-jewish-support-for-obama-falling">http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/10/12/2741253/poll-jewish-support-for-obama-falling</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harris said the most surprising result of the poll is that a majority of Jewish voters back Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, which encourages police to check the immigration credentials of persons being questioned on other matters. The law already has sparked an exodus of undocumented workers from the state.</p>

<p>The survey asked its Jewish respondents: “A new law in Arizona gives police the power to ask people they’ve stopped to verify their residency status. Supporters say this will help crack down on illegal immigration. Opponents say it could violate civil rights and lead to racial profiling. On balance, do you support or oppose this law?”</p>

<p>The result was a slim majority in favor of the law: 52 percent to 46 percent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, maybe because not all Jews are the same? </p>

<p>Multiculturalism isn&#39;t a &#39;weakness&#39;, there are Jews that are against it, and Jews that are for it, most Jews are for it, and if you look at the numbers, a majority of Jews in Israel and otherwise support it. Just because a vocal group of Jewish people in Israel are against it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there. </p>

<p>Also, many Jews want to feel safe, they feel safe around other Jews because they&#39;ve faced oppression elsewhere, it has nothing to do with trying to &#39;weaken&#39; anyone and has a lot more to do with wanting a safe place where they can be Jewish and unafraid. </p>

<p>Christians have dozens of countries, Muslims have dozens of countries, Buddhists have multiple countries, Hindus are almost a billion strong and have their own country, etc. </p>

<p>Jews are a small people and have a small country. I don&#39;t really see a plan of &quot;divide and conquer&quot; as being really all that effective. </p>

<p>Also, Multiculturalism doesn&#39;t mean omni-culturalism. Accepting and tolerating all cultures is different from wanting to dissolve your own or others cultures and merge them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiculturalism means integration. When have Jews ever integrated with anybody? They live in Western societies, but they are never integrated with those societies. They have always remained aloof and apart. That is how they have survived. Multiculturalism would have destroyed Jews in a few generations. It was only by avoiding it like the plague that they still exist. Yet they want to impose it on us. They don&#39;t want it for themselves, but they want to impose it on us. Think about that. What is their reason? Well, obviously they think it will be good for <em>them</em> to impose multiculturalism on <em>us</em>. That does not mean in any way that it will be good for us to have it imposed on us. Just the opposite is true. They see our weakness as their strength. But why should we rejoice and assist in our own destruction? That is insanity. Yet we are being brainwashed by the Zionist-controlled media that we must embrace this suicidal insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think any Jews want to &quot;impose&quot; multi-culturalism on anyway. I think Jews have integrated pretty well, I know tons of Jews that don&#39;t even bring up their Jewishness, they have married non-Jewish people and live just like &quot;normal&quot; people (because news flash, THEY ARE.) </p>

<p>How is multi-culturalism hurting anyone? My family is multi-cultural, I have a mixed heritage, and I am a proud and happy American. How has that made me &#39;weaker&#39;? I tolerate others and am happy with my life. Accepting other cultures has if anything made me a happier and more knowledgeable person. </p>

<p>Also, Multi-culturalism for me is simply about accepting and tolerant, it has nothing to do with integration or assimilation. Multi-culturalism suggests an innate duality, OMNI-cultralism is the idea that we should all merge, assimilate, and integrate. </p>

<p>I think Jews like that idea, because a culture that accepts and is tolerant of multiple cultures would most likely not try to accuse them of not being patriotic or try to destroy them. </p>

Back then, it was all about strutting around sticking sharp things into people who looked, talked or thought different.  Maybe sometimes people who got in the way just for practice.

<p>At some point, it was informally decided that we could afford nicer things if we didn&#39;t incinerate any significant portion of our customers.  So we adopted open societies, liberal democracy and constitutions.  It&#39;s still an experiment in progress I guess, and one that appears to still be very unpopular in many parts of the world.  It certainly gets more than its fair share of negative press.</p>

<p>What &#39;christian&#39; countries are there? Sure, there&#39;s countries where muslims are the dominating religion, but just because they have that doesn&#39;t mean others need that.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know... a few thousand years of expulsions and genocides for starters? The Holocaust? Pogroms? Forced Relocation Programs? </p>

<p>Jews have been oppressed and treated as 2nd class citizens in most places they have called home for most of their existence (along with any &quot;outsider&quot; group really, Jews aren&#39;t special in this case, but their history is tied to it.) </p>

<p>You can&#39;t remove people from their historical context, just like you can&#39;t remove hundreds of years of slavery and oppression from blacks in America and the West. Just because we have a black President, and a lot of successful black CEO&#39;s and media figures, doesn&#39;t remove the long history of oppression or erase all the times they been expelled or treated like 2nd class citizens. </p>

<p>Just because you as a majority doesn&#39;t understand it and think they are being insecure, doesn&#39;t make it true. Let your people get treated like trash and lets see them not want to try to make a home somewhere else where they can be themselves. </p>

<p>Also, contemporary treatment of Jews in the Western world is kind of completely removed from historical treatment of Jews. Just 60 years about half the Jews on the planet were murdered, a person that was born when it happened hasn&#39;t even hit retirement yet in most places! You can&#39;t just pretend that doesn&#39;t have an effect or it doesn&#39;t matter anymore.  </p>

<p>And yea, &quot;gets along great&quot;, Iran is hardly a place to hold up as a great example of religious tolerance and human rights, you can be punished for trying to convert people from Islam, much less for opposing the government. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hardly a &quot;small penis issue&quot;, if you&#39;re oppressed and pushed around for a thousand years, and you decide to go home, it&#39;s barely a &quot;Well everyone ELSE has a country we should too!&quot;. You&#39;d think they wouldn&#39;t have given back so much land if they&#39;d had a complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Canadian. Aside from the natives, we&#39;re all immigrants. What in the world makes Jews any different than Italians or Irish or any other group?</p>

<p>A few thousand years. That&#39;s an argument based solely on religious attitudes, and really, a bunch of Europeans who share a religious background is hardly a realistic argument to anyone who doesn&#39;t share their attitudes.</p>

<p>I am not the majority. If it was up to me, i&#39;d take all religious influence such as the 700 club off mainstream tv and force schools to adhere to a public system that doesn&#39;t have one favourite over the other.</p>

<p>Thousands of years. That&#39;s fucking retarded. I could go start up the cult of the super sumerian and claim Israel&#39;s actually my land cause my religion was founded earlier.</p>

<p>The US voted for Barrack Obama purely because Bush was so bad, that of course the democrats were going to win. They picked a chick or a black guy because the US is so culturally battered into political correctness, and so fucking delusional about race issues and thinking that voting for a black guy actually made a step of progress towards eliminating the ignorance of the Bush era.</p>

<p>A monkey could have picked that Obama was going to win, solely based on the social attitudes democrats present. </p>

<p>Voting for Obama did nothing though since he&#39;s still at the will of the Jewish lobby groups who have an amazing amount of influence.</p>

<p>Again, I still fail to see how the Jews have been oppressed since the holocaust, and why the actions someone else in the past did, should have an affect on my life. I didn&#39;t cause slavery, I never forced anyone to do anything they&#39;ve never wanted to. Why should I have to cater to a religious demographic that somehow deems it&#39;s own self worth more important than anyone else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a lot makes the Jews different, I mean that&#39;s why they are Jews rather than Nigerians or Inuits. Everyone is different because everyone has different cultures and histories. </p>

<p>Saying someone is different is a lot different than saying someone is better. Jews are NO BETTER than any other people on the planet, but EVERYBODY is different. A Jewish-Canadian deserves no more rights or protections than an Irish-Canadian, and someone who hates Irish people and throws a brick through the Irish-Canadians window should be punished just as harshly as someone who hates Jews and throws a brick through the other fellows window. </p>

<p>Jews have a unique history and culture, just like every other group, and you can&#39;t just remove a people from their identity and expect everyone to act and think identically. </p>

<p>Regardless, you seem to think wanting to value their culture and identity somehow treads on other people? Once again multi-culturalism does NOT equate to forced merging of cultures. Multi-culturalism is simply tolerance and respect of all of the different groups in an area and country. I don&#39;t see how that is a bad thing. </p>

<p>A lot of Jews supporting Multi-culturalism doesn&#39;t mean that all Jews do, and you can&#39;t really claim there is some kind of organized Jewish idea to push the world towards multi-culturalism while keeping themselves &quot;pure&quot;. </p>

<p>A far simpler explanation is that some Jews support multi-culturalism, some Jews don&#39;t. Some Jews think they are better than people who aren&#39;t Jewish, most don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Jews valuing their identity and culture does not mean by default that they think they are BETTER than other people. Just because I want to preserve my families traditions and live with my family in my safe home, does that mean that I think my families traditions are &quot;better&quot;? No, I just think it&#39;s worth valuing and it works for me, that doesn&#39;t mean that I am better or more deserving than anyone else. Obviously, there is a big leap between preferring something, and thinking that your choices are the ONLY choices available. </p>

<p>A lot of Jews wanting to protect their culture and history in no way is any scarier than you as a Canadian wanting to protect your culture and history. You&#39;re the same in that regard. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re allowed to love your country and value what it means to be a Canadian without being a Canadian Supremacist, then a Jew can do the same without being a Jew Supremacist. </p>

<p>Also, Jews have faced continued hate crimes. Over the 20th century Jews have stayed near the top (even in the tolerant Western nations) of groups who have had their places of worship vandalized or faced hate crimes and discrimination because of who they are. They have faced several invasions of their single country, and been under constant attacks by outside forces, many of which who are open about wanting to kill all Jews everywhere. </p>

<p>Regardless, even if you remove all of that, and pretend that the last 65 years has been honky-dory, you still have families shattered by genocide and war, families that have been held back or destroyed, families and people who don&#39;t exist anymore because someone thought they were unworthy of life. </p>

<p>There are still people alive today who remember the pain and are still feeling the effects, you can pretend like that doesn&#39;t have an effect on people. </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/4gTYC-lJZvY">http://youtu.be/4gTYC-lJZvY</a> </p>

<p>This is a comedy bit (the relevant bit is 3:30 onward), but where he mentions you can&#39;t remove people from their historical context is important. Did you own slaves? No of course not. </p>

<p>But the thing is literally just a few generations ago you COULD. And you can&#39;t throw people off the plantations and be like &quot;Wow, it&#39;s been 150 years since you were kicked off of plantations without anything!? You still don&#39;t have your shit together!?&quot; </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just kill off half of the Jews on the planet, and then say, &quot;OMG WHY DO YOU WANT YOUR OWN COUNTRY!? NOTHING IS HAPPENING TO YOU NOW!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it totally isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Look, countries are sovereign, they have a right to limit or open up immigration as much or as little as they want. If they want to have a Jewish majority nation, that is their right. If they change that and decide they want to focus on more Finns that&#39;s also their right. </p>

<p>The difference is that Israel is a nation of a people who were practically sliced in half just a few decades ago. Their continued existence was threatened, they were in a very hostile place. </p>

<p>Christians don&#39;t have to worry about their survival, there are over a billion of them, and they are the majority in major countries from Africa to Europe to the Americas. </p>

<p>But I can promise you if Christian demographics WERE threatened, I mean actually threatened, like there were only a couple of million Christians left, and a few hundred thousand non-Christians could totally upset that demographic balance, they would probably be limiting immigration to non-Christians. </p>

<p>In fact, Christians are the majority in America and there are some radical Christian groups that already argue we shouldn&#39;t accept any non-Christian immigrants. </p>

It forced out 700,000 Arabs to create a Jewish majority state.  And as if that weren&#39;t enough it continues to engage in acts of ethnic cleansing by moving its Jewish population into the West Bank and East Jerusalem in its quest for a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; and segregating the Palestinians there into bantustan communities.</p>

<p>Stop playing the role of the doe-eyed innocent here.  What Israel has done over the last 65 years is deplorable and bigoted.  For crying out loud look at how it treats its Arab citizens in Israel proper itself.  (And please don&#39;t for one minute pretend it doesn&#39;t have classes of citizenship).  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been there.  My mother was born and raised there.  She is neither a Jew nor an Arab nor a Muslim.  She has no dog in this fight.  She had watched things transpire there since the mandate all the way to 1970.  My grandfather had seen Palestine since before the days of the British mandate while under Ottoman rule.  Dozens of my family members--all Christians, all non-Arabs, will unanimously give you a far different narrative than the one you are providing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and they have failed to ethnically cleanse themselves of anything. If they have been attempting a program of ethnic cleansing then it&#39;s failed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long conflict, but obviously all of the things you&#39;ve claimed Israel is doing is not working to achieve the goals, so obviously they are going to have to come to terms with Palestinians on their own terms eventually. Hope it happens sooner rather than later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look if you want to cuss and scream, fine. Nothing you said is substantiated. You accuse me of repeating stuff from &quot;zionist rags&quot; and call me names, but you don&#39;t offer any proof. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t care about my position, you don&#39;t care about the Jews almost being wiped out, you don&#39;t care that Israel is under constant attack, you don&#39;t want to understand their psychology and mentality and try to understand the &quot;why&quot;, you just want to criticize and try to demean the Jews by comparing them to their oppressors. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not going to accomplish anything but make them feel like they are under greater attack and continue perpetuating the Israeli siege mentality. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t offer citations then get out. If that&#39;s your reality, someone else has a just as convincing reality, and I can run off and claim I don&#39;t need citations for my version of reality too. </p>

<p>You can try to pretend that the Holocaust doesn&#39;t matter, but it&#39;s integral to understanding the Israeli siege mentality and modern Jewish culture. It&#39;s not about &quot;playing&quot; anything, and simply a matter of bringing up that it&#39;s a major event that still has a heavy effect on the Israeli way of thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quote:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies [sic] that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the centre of that. It’s a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.”</em></p>

<p>This is incorrect. Europe would do just fine without the help of Jewish organizers and activists moving it down the road of multiculturalism. In fact, Europe has had about as much of this &quot;leading role&quot; of Jews as it can stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a lot makes the Jews different, I mean that&#39;s why they are Jews rather than Nigerians or Inuits. Everyone is different because everyone has different cultures and histories. </p>

<p>Saying someone is different is a lot different than saying someone is better. Jews are NO BETTER than any other people on the planet, but EVERYBODY is different. A Jewish-Canadian deserves no more rights or protections than an Irish-Canadian, and someone who hates Irish people and throws a brick through the Irish-Canadians window should be punished just as harshly as someone who hates Jews and throws a brick through the other fellows window. </p>

<p>Jews have a unique history and culture, just like every other group, and you can&#39;t just remove a people from their identity and expect everyone to act and think identically. </p>

<p>Regardless, you seem to think wanting to value their culture and identity somehow treads on other people? Once again multi-culturalism does NOT equate to forced merging of cultures. Multi-culturalism is simply tolerance and respect of all of the different groups in an area and country. I don&#39;t see how that is a bad thing. </p>

<p>A lot of Jews supporting Multi-culturalism doesn&#39;t mean that all Jews do, and you can&#39;t really claim there is some kind of organized Jewish idea to push the world towards multi-culturalism while keeping themselves &quot;pure&quot;. </p>

<p>A far simpler explanation is that some Jews support multi-culturalism, some Jews don&#39;t. Some Jews think they are better than people who aren&#39;t Jewish, most don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Jews valuing their identity and culture does not mean by default that they think they are BETTER than other people. Just because I want to preserve my families traditions and live with my family in my safe home, does that mean that I think my families traditions are &quot;better&quot;? No, I just think it&#39;s worth valuing and it works for me, that doesn&#39;t mean that I am better or more deserving than anyone else. Obviously, there is a big leap between preferring something, and thinking that your choices are the ONLY choices available. </p>

<p>A lot of Jews wanting to protect their culture and history in no way is any scarier than you as a Canadian wanting to protect your culture and history. You&#39;re the same in that regard. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re allowed to love your country and value what it means to be a Canadian without being a Canadian Supremacist, then a Jew can do the same without being a Jew Supremacist. </p>

<p>Also, Jews have faced continued hate crimes. Over the 20th century Jews have stayed near the top (even in the tolerant Western nations) of groups who have had their places of worship vandalized or faced hate crimes and discrimination because of who they are. They have faced several invasions of their single country, and been under constant attacks by outside forces, many of which who are open about wanting to kill all Jews everywhere. </p>

<p>Regardless, even if you remove all of that, and pretend that the last 65 years has been honky-dory, you still have families shattered by genocide and war, families that have been held back or destroyed, families and people who don&#39;t exist anymore because someone thought they were unworthy of life. </p>

<p>There are still people alive today who remember the pain and are still feeling the effects, you can pretend like that doesn&#39;t have an effect on people. </p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/4gTYC-lJZvY">http://youtu.be/4gTYC-lJZvY</a> </p>

<p>This is a comedy bit (the relevant bit is 3:30 onward), but where he mentions you can&#39;t remove people from their historical context is important. Did you own slaves? No of course not. </p>

<p>But the thing is literally just a few generations ago you COULD. And you can&#39;t throw people off the plantations and be like &quot;Wow, it&#39;s been 150 years since you were kicked off of plantations without anything!? You still don&#39;t have your shit together!?&quot; </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just kill off half of the Jews on the planet, and then say, &quot;OMG WHY DO YOU WANT YOUR OWN COUNTRY!? NOTHING IS HAPPENING TO YOU NOW!&quot; </p>
