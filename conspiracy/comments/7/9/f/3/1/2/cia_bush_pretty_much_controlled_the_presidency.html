        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dwight David Eisenhower warns the world of the military industrial complex (mostly the CIA) in 1961</p>

<p>JFK comes in and is murdered by them for going against their desires in 1963.</p>

<p>LBJ was clearly their guy who reverses many JFK decisions and starts the Vietnam war.</p>

<p>They kill Robert Kennedy so Nixon can get in after LBJ for 1968 election.</p>

<p>Nixon is one of the most corrupt presidents to ever serve and resigns into his second term, ford takes over and pardons Nixon.</p>

<p>Carter is next and is likely &quot;not their guy&quot; but CIA is busy anyhow orchestrating their middle east moves, giving him the Iran problem which causes the energy crisis which makes oil men like bush even richer. Carter is blamed allowing Reagan, an actor to storm to the presidency, but not before george bush is forced on him as the vice president.</p>

<p>Not even one year into Reagan&#39;s run in 1981 he is nearly assassinated by the son of a friend of George Bush (yes seriously,  george bush&#39;s son even had a date with the assassin planned for that day) .</p>

<p>Not long after being shot rumors of Reagan now being a puppet for bush start to be murmured, the public message is Reagan is recovering from his wounds so of course bush is taking more control. It is likely bush snr never thought he could come to power purely on his own merits and wanted to do a LBJ, after all their success they had with that.</p>

<p>But in 1988 bush snr manages to do it! The candidate the democrats rolled out was the biggest lame duck seen until we got Kerry. A decade of the CIA and usa supplying Iraq with weapons of mass destruction allows bush to then start a war in the middle east!</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even covered everything but it&#39;s amazing the amount of power the CIA had after JFK was taken out. Anything you think should be added to this?</p>

Global trade during that era was, as now, dominated by Jewish businessmen.  They owned the East India Company and controlled trade between the new and old worlds, running slaves, booze made from sugar plantations in the colonies, narcotics like tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, opium, cocoa (chocolate), and tea, textiles made from cotton, wool, and silk, timber, precious metals and other raw extractive industries.</p>

<p>Many people have tried to make hay over Lewinsky&#39;s family connections to Israel. I never imagined who would have been angry enough with what Clinton was accomplishing to burn him with a planted slattern. Of course, he is a scoundrel... but people do things, good and bad, with an infinite variety of motivations, fear being the most common thread, especially fear of being poor.</p>

<p>As far as the Clintons, they have connections well before Iran Contra and with money from drugs, Walmart  Tyson flowing like wine through Arkansas Development Finance Authority, they had no shortage of slush money for political aspirations.</p>

<p>People at these levels get momentum and soon enough, they cannot control it.</p>

<p>Then look who becomes POTUS after him. Nixon... the same guy who was expected by many to win in 1960. Nixon gets elected in 1968 and serves (almost) two terms until his resignation. After Nixon, Gerald Ford... who becomes President without being elected.</p>

<p>Then Jimmy Carter, former Navy man. Then Reagan, with George Bush Senior at his side. Technically, Reagan serves two terms. But some people say he was never really in control after getting shot by Hinckley. Some also say that Reagan&#39;s Alzheimer&#39;s left Bush et al effectively in control of the administration until Bush officially took power in 1988.</p>

<p>After that, it&#39;s been nothing but Clintons and Bushes until Trump got elected last year. Clinton was the CIA&#39;s man in Arkansas who cooperated with the Mena operation while he was Governor. Probably got rewarded with the Presidency as a result.</p>

<p>My thinking is that the Presidency itself has been little more than a figurehead position ever since JFK in 1963. The Deep State has been running the show more and more directly ever since then.... exactly what Eisenhower predicted (and warned about) in his final address.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years before he was President, nobody had even heard of him. So basically an actor placed in the White House as window dressing.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton spent her &quot;Obama years&quot; as Secretary of State until she quit to take another run at POTUS. </p>

<p>By the same line of reasoning, I see the Reagan years as Bush years because Sr. was in the White house as VP.</p>

<p>Obama more a nobody than a Clinton. But there was a Clinton present as a senior member of his administration. </p>

<p>People might hate Trump. But this is the first administration w/o any Bushes or Clintons in God knows how long. Since 1980 maybe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well stated.  There is much more.  Prescott Bush funded Hitler into power after failing to convince Smedley Butler to run as a puppet president. After wwii, when he came home and literally ran a newspaper ad to find Nixon, Nixon as VP creates the Operation 40 assassination team and rewards Bush by placing his son GHWB as supervisor. Operation 40 assassinated JFK.  Bush keeps failing to win offices, yet the Rockefellers keep placing him in important roles.  He is responsible for sooooo much anti-American evils.  Conglomerated media using tax dollars, tons of murders, Iran Contra, Bay of Pigs, Operation Brownstar pedophilia, Cointelpro, the list is never-ending. The flechette Reagan was shot with contained a prion disease that has symptoms of dimensia, just in case he survived.

I think a lot of the bad shit about Nixon came with the job to be honest. That job is fucked , it can ruin you. Its Ironic as these men thrust for that power, then when they have it their hair goes grey over night. There are a lot of things at play. Israel being the most destructive. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, no one accused trump of being racist until he called out mexicans. He was smart, he tapped in to an unused voting block. I think that&#39;s more of an indictment on America than Trump. He saw those people. Im not seeing they should be seen but the rules indicate they have a voice. He also masterfully understood the meme. He endeared himself to the Kek boys. Another huge voting block. Again I don&#39;t expect you to understand as you are regurgitating the narrative of the mainstream media . <em>pat on the head</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eisenhower created NSA by Executive Fiat alone (at least CIA has a Charter rubber stamped by Congress).
Eisenhower expanded CIA cover paramilitary power, MKULTRA, coups and extrajudicial assassinations began under Ike.
Tell me again how Eisenhower was a great opponent of the Military Industrial Complex?
Thanks for the laughs.
At the end, old Ike was just mad like Dr Frankenstein that his monster escaped his castle and
was slaughtering the villagers.</p>

<p>JFK, great speech gives, rails against CIA, threatens to scatter them to the
wind, warns against Secret Societies. Turns out, JFK order the CIA hits on
Castro, order Bay of Pigs then pulled the rug on D-Day, and RFJ ordered the wiretap on MLK.
Sure pal, the Kennedy&#39;s were opponents of the Deep State.</p>

<p>LBJ probably had something to do with whacking JFK, orders false flags in Tonkin to start Vietnam,
ignores Israel sinking USS Liberty, and sicks J Edgar Hoover on any one in America who doesn&#39;t like it,
orders the start of join FBI-CIA domestic spying in MKCHAOS/MHCHAOS, targetting literal &quot;the entire anti-war movement&quot;, every leader, every marcher, ever protest speaker, you&#39;re on The Watchlist. Then LBJ and his
&quot;Great Society&quot; BS was just empty political posturing to appease the poors and the Negroes from all out revolt to buy time for Deep State to win by attrition.</p>

<p>Nixon and Ford need no more said. Deep State Made-Men through and through.</p>

<p>Carter orders Zbigniew Brzezinski to order CIA to covert arm ISIS 1.0, the
Mujihideen in Afghanistan, creating al Qaeda, creating bin Laden and ultimately
creating the Global War on Terror.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you get it? Are you blind?</p>

<p>Every President has been an ENEMY of America, every President has been a Deep State puppet who
never fixes doodly squat, and who only accelerates Deep State covert war towards the inevitable splintering apart and collapse of America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, this is how I view it. The &quot;NWO&quot; is the Bush troupe (Halliburton, big oil, saudis etc). They take out JFK, get the anti-commie ball rolling to justify invasion of Vietnam. Get Reagan in there to cut their taxes down, inflate the military and foreign conflict. Rinse and repeat in the Middle East. Start long-lasting conflicts and profit immensely from them. Control the opposition via Rockerfeller Republicans (aka current Democrats), impeach one of them to make your opponent look bad and create a media circus, all the whole continuing the agenda. Cut privacy and civil liberties, both parties continue that(patriot act, Obama). Then fast forward to today, they&#39;re all hugs and smiles on stage and everything is A-OK. They&#39;ve made trillions, fucked us over financially, civilly, mentally...now George Bush is on the front page cause his intentions are good. </p>
