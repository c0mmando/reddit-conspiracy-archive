       Tom is a puppet convinced he is a master. Anyone who preaches that Aliens are evil or war mongers is controlled disinformation. His only goal is to raise money and promote his books for wealth. That’s why he is the perfect shill. He is told some truths, but 80% is just lies prepping people if they need to go ahead with Project BlueBeam. With the way things are going I think it’s a real possibility.

       But what has the motivations of aliens to do with controlled disinformation? You and I don't know their motivation and applying a human moral codex to them is beyond naive. We don't even know enough about our own status, the situation of our environment to make educated guesses about what we and our area means to some unknown aliens.

       The conflict of interest is that if people know they aren’t the top of the food chain and the material world we are program to serve doesn’t matter then the MIC, Govt and TPTB lose control over their slaves. Us. That’s why it’s kept secret. Not a “hippie” thing. Just cold hard Facts. When the Antarctica story really breaks into the mainstream they’ll spin it that the Elites are decedents of gods. Just like the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans did. ETI are benevolent. Anyone who preaches differently has alterior motives.

       You're the one who preaches that he believes to be right. But what you don't do is apply is actual logic.

       If a group(P2B) spins something as factual for their own benefits does not follow the opposite is the truth.

       And I’m telling you it’s only part truth. They’ll benefit from truth and the lies. That’s why they groom these “Messiahs” like DeLonge. Soon you’ll learn what I’m “preaching” is fact. Have a good day.

       Have you even read what I've written in this thread? This isn't about Tom Delonge which I consider untrustworthy. That was also my initial response after I've listen to his "famous" Fade to Black radio interview back then. I consider Wilcock a disinfo/cult/con artist.

       Just ponder about these things for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) We don't know where we come from. Did we develop natural on earth? We we created here? Are we a hybrid species? Did we come from somewhere else and what was our status back then? If we were created in some fashion somebody was the creator which might see us a property. How does some other (competing or non competing to the creator) alien race else see us then?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Are there previous owners of our planet or is our solar system inside an area of influence some other species sees as their territory?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Is there a competition for some kind of resources where any new species will be seen as a danger to other civilisations?
      </p>
      <p>
       All these complexes have serious conflict potential completely irrelevant of the profit/power interests of the military industrial complex.

       The only relevant thing Rumsfeld has ever said which fits like a glove to the problem.

       We are one of many genetic experiments that are still going. I know that ETI are real. Out Govt works with them and the US is the only country that denies they exist. I’m not saying I don’t believe. I don’t believe Tom’s “War of the Worlds” is coming Story.

       1) We are genetic experiments of various ETI races. We aren't V1.0 either. Most people aren't even 100% humanoids.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Yes. The Draco have been here for a long time. They control the Earth and the Moon. The Pre-Adamites that crashed in Antarctica had some control of major civilization, but lost it or came to a truce sometime after Egypt fell. The "Elite" worship the Pre-Adamite leader, Lucifer, who was an actual being.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Kinda. Gold is needed because it is a great conductor, but other than that the main purpose of Lockheed and Secret Space Program is open trade of material off earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just my two cents.

       There was a vid where it documents Joe's transformation over the years RE: UFOs and Aliens and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It showed him when he was younger doing his "normal thing", posing questions, pointing out inconsistencies in the normal narrative and siding strongly in favor of UFOs and aliens being very real and that we were being lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it shows a video of him saying something like, "Look if someone shows me an actual UFO and alien, I'll be 100% on the side of the government. I'll make fun of every motherfucking UFO dude who comes forward."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it shows him doing a 180 from his earlier days.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was quite revealing.  Wish I could find the vid.

       iTunes charges you for it. So it seemed iTunes refused to assist in the podcast making money or something, or not wanting iTunes to be associated with showing everyone the number one podcast at the time. Most people will click on the most popular or downloaded thing.. conspiracy !?

       Sure,  all these Deep State squamates were dying to reveal the truth of our reality to all the useless eaters yet couldn't because they had not been able find some played out, second rate popstar to act as their mouthpiece.
