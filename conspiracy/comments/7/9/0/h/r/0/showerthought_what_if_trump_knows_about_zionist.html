    <div class="md"><p>or what if the rothschilds bailed trump out in the 80&#39;s and he&#39;s been in their pocket ever since, to the point of appointing the former head of the new york office of N M Rothschild and Sons to be his secretary of commerce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geez, fine. Are direct quotes enough? His about his op-ed in his own newspaper or his interview with Forbes?</p>

&quot;...Donald Trump I know. The from-the-heart reactions of this man are instinctively pro-Jewish and pro-Israel. Just last week, at an event in New Hampshire, an audience member asked about wasting money on “Zionist Israel.” My father-in-law didn’t miss a beat in replying that “Israel is a very important ally of the United States and we are going to protect them 100 percent.” No script, no handlers, no TelePrompter—just a strong opinion from the heart.&quot;</p>

&quot;All I know about Steve is my experience working with him. He&#39;s an incredible Zionist and loves Israel,&quot; Kushner told Forbes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That hasn&#39;t been the case up to date of the Trump presidency. Kushner is said to be highly influential. Again, I think the facts of Trump&#39;s clear allegiance to Isreal speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Hope and change was so  8 years ago, you know, with the prior hack president. Now its make america great again, by bringing &quot;back &quot; chronyism, nepotism, lying to the public and serving the corporate state. Like how it was last year...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not to that level of cynicism...yet.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s allegiance to Israel is indeed worrying.  Yet I am still not convinced the degree to which it is political theater or not.  </p>

<p>Actions will speak louder than words for me, I&#39;m afraid...just hope they are the right actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Las Vegas mourned, Sheldon and Dr. Miriam Adelson met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday and discussed what they could do to help the victims of the mass shooting on the Strip.</p>

<p>The afternoon meeting was pre-arranged and set to discuss policy, said Andy Abboud, who serves as senior vice president of Government Relations for the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Las Vegas Sands Corp.</p>

<p>But the Adelsons and Trump also discussed the shooting and what they might do to help victims, he said.</p>

<p>The Adelsons, who have donated generously to Trump and his campaigns, also wanted to meet Trump’s new chief of staff, John Kelly, he said.</p>

<p>Son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, whose portfolio includes the president’s dream of brokering a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, also attended the meeting, Abboud said.</p>

<p>The Adelsons reportedly have been disappointed in Trump’s failure to keep a campaign pledge to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump has Jared in his plan. Keep in mind that Women have been the power when it comes down to the wire. IMO Jared is ally that has been used as a feeler for ousting TPTB.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Trump is protected by the Knights Templar. I&#39;m willing to bet that a whole lot of Isralei assets have been killed off because of this.</p>

<p>IMO Trump is allied with Freemasons that want to see the US rise above the degenerate influence of Israel. He has to be very careful because they are everywhere.</p>

<p>Israel is who started the freemasons.  Freemasons have been told that they will &#39;rule the world&#39; along with Jews when the NWO is in place (little knowing that they will be cast aside as having been &#39;useful idiots&#39;).</p>
