       With all this talk of war from Trump and our Secretary of Defense you really are just going to brush this off as "not going to happen?"  I think that is very short sighted of you.

       Trump has specifically called out NK saying that he could unleash fire and fury on them like the world has never seen before.  You are a Trump fan now are you saying to not take Trump seriously when he talks?  And idk what you are talking about with Syria... Has Trump said anything about Syria?  No.  How can you just ignore what Trump is saying and what the military is doing right now? Are you just trolling?

       Lmao you're hilarious fellow. Trump SAYS a lot of shit. Its called 7d chess my man. The art of the deal if you will. 
If you don't know what I mean about Syria then you absolutely shouldn't be trying to discuss North Korea. 
Lastly trolling is against the rules and I am no rule breaker my friend.

       Completely agree with you. NK wouldn’t start a war they wouldn’t win. I don’t see why people can’t agree to disagree damn.

       Unless they want it to happen.  look at Vietnam and Iraq.  The US had no reason to go to war and they did.  Now there is a "legitimate" reason to go to war whether fabricated or not it's going to happen.

       No, it really hasn't. The only thing that is different is that Trump talks back. Almost everything is pretty much the same. Drills are normal. Be ready for war...yeah that's everyday. NK has nothing to gain by starting a war that they would lose in less than a day. Their leader might be a narcissist but he isn't suicidal.

       He said specifically to get ready for war with North Korea......  The military can make extra preperations for war if one is coming.....  You realize that the drills were in direct response to the threats right? ???  When asked the next day what Trump meant about the comment "calm before the storm"  Sarah Huckabee said to take them seriously and Trump will do "anything to protect the American people."  She is obviously refering to the one direct threat they have been pushing for the past month... NORTH KOREA.

       You are forgetting a few things here. Lil Kim doesn't want to die or see an end to his dynasty. He enjoys food and people worshiping him way too much. And the US is not going to strike first. The back and forth is a game NK has played for a long time. As long as they leave it at that u pat them on the head like you do most petulant toddlers and move along. If Kim makes a move...he is toast faster than he can wobble.
