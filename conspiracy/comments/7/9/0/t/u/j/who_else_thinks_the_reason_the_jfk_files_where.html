    <div class="md"><p>There was a law that was put into place so Nsa Cia, Fbi, and etc etc could feel safe that their “Patriotic” Actions wouldnt be used against them.... so its not so much a national security issue to protect bush but instead its to make all our “patriots” feel ok with what they may be doing at this very moment... cause if you thought the next political wind shift could out your mission and possibly lead to your death or imprisonment your less inclined to do whats asked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe its a part of the Identities act in 1982 which was a further expansion of an original executive order from 1971, and the preliminary act in 1975 due to Richard Welch being assasinated . 
Its the same act that was called in to question when Cheney outed Valerie Plame as a cia agent. 
As far as I know.. if the living person has any documents tied to Classified Covert Ops it falls under the protections act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well that law needs to be repealed without their consent.</p>

<p>the proper way to gain consent is to send armed thugs to their door and remove the obstacles to disclosure. blame it on gang violence and a horrible mistake or something. say he was investigating the wrong people who had an intelligence network comparable to ours like a cartel or something.</p>

<p>then when the documents implicating them are out, it can be implied that it was an assassination with good cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>havn&#39;t read it, but i listened to lots of eric john phelps talks on youtube, he really does do a great job exposing the jesuits history and relevance today, but i don&#39;t hold much stock in the jesuits being the end all be all, i even wonder about the black nobility, like how hard can it be to make your name impossible to know if your at the very top? </p>

<p>these ancient roman/papal bloodlines are definately a BIG part of it though, they have more say in the world than any world leader we could ever elect</p>

<p>wtf do we do though, there&#39;s nothing, food air water, it&#39;s all poisoned, we work we get sick/retire we die, the top gets to live a healthy long and fruitful life, with all the knowledge we don&#39;t get</p>

<p>all we can do is recognize the problem and embrace our spiritual existense, theres gotta be more to this than the hell we are in</p>

Im not interested in who you worship or who you think is your king or prince.. im more interested in your rant.. it seems very passionate while discordant at best. Feel free to expound upon your hypothesis and try and give some structure to the details..
But as for my Handle.. Knight is a middle name. A code name of sorts.. Rook being my brothers. Queen being my sisters.. Brittle is due to Ehlers Danlos or also often known as a Brittle Syndrome, a terminal disability based on a collagen deficiency.  Some of which have it so severe they are liken to Mr Glass from M Night Shymalan’s Unbreakable movie  (sidebar:: he has a new movie coming out called Glass)
Are the jesuits grand conspirators.. yes several conspiracies due indicate they are involved in hidden actions that influence the world. Including the rumored assassination of a Pope and replacement with a look a like.</p>

An &quot;Agent&quot; is someone outside of the CIA who provides info or other activities, as directed by an &quot;Officer&quot;.
