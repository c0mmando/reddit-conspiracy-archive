       There were over 20,000 people at the concert, who are all "survivors of the shooting". The US death rate is ~823/100,000, which is about 13 deaths per month for a group this size.

       Is the death rate including elderly, sick, terminally ill, etc? I imagine the average person at the festival was between 20-40 years old and relatively healthy. Just a though.

       Exactly.  Most of the people who die in the next month will not have been at a concert in the previous few weeks.  Most of them will  be like your great aunt Gertrude who has been in a chronic care facility for the last 6 years.

       The fatalities at the concert ranged in age from 20 to 67, with plenty of people over 40. It's a country music concert in Las Vegas, both things older people enjoy. "Relatively healthy" is also a completely baseless assumption. Particularly when one of OP's links "had epilepsy and always been prone to seizures".

       And the majority of those are via cancer and heart disease.  People one month away from cancer deaths are not usually in Vegas line dancing.They are in homes/hospitals/hospice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the RATE of deaths that's odd. It's such peculiar methods. Fiery car crashes and homicides are not normal.  Deaths in vehicle fires in 2015 = 445  out of 320 million US population means 445/320,000,000. This is about a ONE in ONE MILLION chance.

       The girl (Kymberley Suchomel) was already sick and her own family and friends don't find her death suspicious. Her friend, Rick Ardito, who she mentioned in her Facebook post, has been on social media and radio interviews telling pretty much the same story as Kymberley (both before and after her death) and nobody has killed him. Not suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy (Danny Contreras) is legitimately dead, but his tweets and connecting to the concert/shooting are questionable. I've seen no authentication of his
       <em>
        "Feeling lcky to be alive, cant believe i got out of concert alive! 2 men chasing me with guns. not evry 1 so lcky."
       </em>
       tweet; just a screenshot that appeared in speculative articles after his death was announced. The account they link to has been suspended, so there's no way to know if the tweet is real or falsified. And even if it is real, we still don't know for sure he was even at the concert/near the shooting. Brian Hodges lied on social media about being in the room next to the shooter, this guy could be doing the same. If what authorities said is true and the victim had gang ties, he could've been lying about 2 guys chasing him with a gun to build street cred. For now, all we have is a few low-cred sites reporting on the connection and until I see the tweet authenticated and proof he was at the concert, I'm gonna say it's not suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The couple died in a car accident near their California home. Their daughters said that their parents had a new lease on life after the shooting -- which could imply living-on-the-edge activities like partying and speeding. It didn't sound like they were dwelling on the shooting, and the husband still hadn't even gotten his phone back from when he abandoned it during the shooting, so it's not like he was holding incriminating video or anything (the daughters received his phone in the mail after he died). The saddest part is that one of the daughters (16yo) heard the loud crash and ran outside to discovered her parents' car engulfed in flames. Incredibly tragic but really not suspicious.
