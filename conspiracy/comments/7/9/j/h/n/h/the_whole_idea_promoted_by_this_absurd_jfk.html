       We can already establish 70 to 80 percent of the total truth of what happened. The mainstream media is using this so called disclosure as a COVER UP. They neglect to even consult those who did the research to make this a debate to begin with. Instead we hear people like Gerald Posner with the mainstream media talking point, quote "evidence has never stopped the conspiracy theorist." Combined with constant reiteration of the disproved thesis the assassin is Lee Harvey Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mainstream media will say there no "smoking gun". When the "smoking gun" is comprised of many thousand interlocking facts researched by the same conspiracy theorists they demean. The media says this evidence is tangential. But the truth is in the tangents. The media will also emphasize the keystone cops negligence to explain away complicity. For people that new to the subject, the big question to start with is: Was there a frontal shot? Go and research everything about the "Harper Fragment" as far as the shot coming from the front. If people want to see the broad outlines of the conspiracy, I would advise the David Ferrie call to Jean West (Aase). Ferrie called called her in Chicago in September of 1963. The connection of Jean West to Lawrence Meyers. As well as Meyers trip to Dallas on nov 1963. You have David Ferrie the mentor of Oswald in New Orleans calling a phone in Chicago that belongs to Lawrence Meyers girlfriend, and of all places Meyers goes to Dallas on Nov 22 1963 and meets with Jack Ruby. He meets with Ruby, who later kills Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       This establishes at least the middle layers of a conspiracy that anyone can see. On the upper levels you can see the high placed part of this conspiracy at Bethesda. Ferrie is involved in the same 544 Camp St. Operation, and that address was stamped on Oswalds pro castro literature. When Oswald was actually handing out that literature with TED CRUZ father Raphael Cruz.

       You are so right! Wonder why this never gets reported?
There are  all members of the “club”and we aren’t.

      <p>
       11-2-63: The Chicago plot: Kennedy cancels scheduled trip to Chicago after Chicago PD discovers assassination plot and arrests Thomas Arthur Vallee ex-Marine who like Oswald worked at U2 base in Japan and is working at a Chicago warehouse overlooking upcoming motorcade. This Is a fact and has never been mentioned in any MSM format in the 54 years since!

       It is really fascinating. Vallee was meant to be the "Patsy" if they had killed JFK in Chicago. There was numerous other patsies lined up if they did not do JFK in Dallas.

       The best book to start with that covers a very large amount of varied material on the case is James Douglas "JFK And The Unspeakable".

       True.   Don't look at it as new information,  because we already knew that the Warren Commission was a cover up and it was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is new is that we had a president who didn't care to block its release.
      </p>
      <p>
       As corrupt as Trump is,   he was not the hand pick of the deep state,  probably.    Its hard to imagine one of their own hand picked people having released the juicier parts of what we are seeing.
