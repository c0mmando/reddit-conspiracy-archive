<p>“I have to say that this is one of those things where reasonable people cannot disagree: There just aren’t two sides,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on nuclear materials and nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.</p>

<p>According to the conspiracy theory, Clinton received money from several people affiliated with the uranium mine deal, and then pushed the CFIUS to approve it in return.</p>

<p>The problem is, that’s not how CFIUS works. Clinton’s vote would have been only one of nine, as the reviews are run by the Treasury Department and other Cabinet secretaries get to weigh in.</p>

<p>“The secretary of state is one, and frankly not usually a very powerful, member of the committee,” said Steve Grundman, a fellow at the Atlantic Council who dealt with CFIUS reviews while serving in the Pentagon in the 1990s. “You have to remember with CFIUS, the first letter stands for the committee.”</p>

<p>Also, Cabinet secretaries almost never deal with the committee themselves, instead delegating to underlings. For Clinton, that delegate was the assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, Jose Fernandez.</p>

<p>“Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter,” Fernandez told Time in 2015. Two former State Department officials who served under Clinton told Newsweek that Clinton would have been notified of a CFIUS decision only if there were disagreement among members of the committee, which would push a final decision to the president. The CFIUS decision on the Uranium One deal, however, was unanimous—all nine representatives agreed to approve it.</p>

<p>“For this conspiracy theory to be true, she would have to twist the arms of all these other eight Cabinet secretaries, which is completely absurd and completely implausible,” said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who specializes in U.S.-Russia relations and who worked at the State Department under both Clinton and her successor, John Kerry.</p>

<p>The claim that Clinton received big money for the Clinton Foundation from those tied to the Tenex–Uranium One deal is also tenuous. PolitiFact reviewed that claim, which was floated in a book by an editor at the far-right media outlet Breitbart, and found that almost all the money came from Frank Giustra, who sold his stake in Uranium One before Clinton became secretary of state.</p>

<p>According to the experts, even if Clinton had somehow managed to tilt the CFIUS decision in favor of Russian buyers, it wouldn’t matter: The mine isn’t very important.</p>

<p>The Russian-owned company does not have a license to export the uranium, and the actual mining process is not sensitive at all.</p>

<p>“It’s just a mine,” Lewis said. “There’s no technology that’s special. There’s no shortage of uranium around the world.”</p>

<p>Also, the deal took place during a period when the U.S. was trying to rebuild economic ties to Russia after Clinton and President Barack Obama initiated a “reset” with that country. The U.S. was buying helicopters from Russia for Afghanistan’s army, as well as rockets for U.S. satellite programs. It was a time before Russia had invaded Ukraine and meddled in the U.S. election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other ammunition I&#39;m not seeing here is Bill C. getting 500k for a speech in Russia around the time the deal was going down, and the new-and-improved FBI Anon indicating that the exact Russian company involved was under FBI investigation for bribery activities. The surface of these things riles up suspicions, as their accounting in Clinton Cash accomplished (although Schweizer deliberately fuddled with dates and retracted portions of that book). </p>

<p>The question is whether this is a pay-for-play scheme to the Clinton&#39;s benefit. This article does a decent job bringing some context to the table. Still, I wouldn&#39;t put it past the Clintons to make money off the back of government operations (nor any politician), it&#39;s just a matter if actual laws were broken. </p>

<p>The context of the &quot;Russian reset&quot; era/pre-Chrimea era of conflict are factors roundly ignored. So too are basic facts, you have guys calling into Michael Savage who believe Russia actually received shipments of uranium in order to make nukes to kill us. Isn&#39;t this the kind of &quot;we need to work with Russia&quot; that&#39;s been yelled in our faces for the last year plus?  </p>

<p>How come no one&#39;s asking Trump to try and retract the deal if it&#39;s such a big problem? It&#39;s probably more beneficial to keep talking about the story cause it can be framed as &quot;looking bad,&quot; but who knows how much this corresponds to reality.</p>

<p>As the article says, this took place prior to the Ukraine invasion, when both countries were making relatively minor goodwill transactions to improve relations. Did the US need to be buy helicopters from Russia? Of course not. Ditto for the mines in the United States.</p>

Clinton didn&#39;t have the authority to approve or deny the deal, and the majority of the Clinton Foundation donations were given by someone who wouldn&#39;t have been impacted by the deal </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>“For this conspiracy theory to be true, she would have to twist the arms of all these other eight Cabinet secretaries, which is completely absurd and completely implausible,”</strong> said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who specializes in U.S.-Russia relations and who worked at the State Department under both Clinton and her successor, John Kerry.</p>

<p>The claim that Clinton received big money for the Clinton Foundation from those tied to the Tenex–Uranium One deal is also tenuous. PolitiFact reviewed that claim, which was floated in a book by an editor at the far-right media outlet Breitbart, <strong>and found that almost all the money came from Frank Giustra</strong>, who sold his stake in Uranium One before Clinton became secretary of state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frank Giustra is not a good person and is in tight with the clinton machine. His fingerprints are on this scandal aswell.</p>

<p>Funny how these things slowly start to mesh together when the same people and organisations keep popping up together.</p>

<p>To suggest that we gave rights to Russia to mine 20% of our strategic Uranium is not a big deal and that it is &quot;just a mine&quot; is ludicrous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing you left out in your explanation of the Uranium One deal is that shortly thereafter, Bill Clinton gave a speech in Moscow, and the Clinton Foundation received a large sum of money for that speech. That’s the heart of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>You would have to be naive to think the 9 other people involved in approving the deal would not also be receiving some sort of kickback in one way or another...</p>
