        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My friend and I just recently worked on an exposé on James Carter, a member, and co-founder of Heart Progress, which was a group trying to legalize pedophilia.</p>

<p>However, we noticed a similar trend with Dan Schneider, with people coming about his creepy foot fetish that&#39;s prevalent in his shows, and the stories of sexual abuse behind the scenes at Nickelodeon.</p>

<p>We&#39;d like to be able to highlight all the times it creeped up in the shows Dan Schneider has created with his fetish, however excluding the newer shows it is over 19 years worth of television that my friend and I simply don&#39;t have the resources to go through.</p>

<p>With your help, we could create a huge document with timestamps of episodes to highlight and show that it&#39;s an actual issue with this sick bastard.</p>

<p>If you want to help, email us at <a href="mailto:exposenick@protonmail.com">exposenick@protonmail.com</a>.</p>

<li><p>Victor Salva, the director of &quot;Powder&quot; and the &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; series (which has a 3rd coming soon), spent 15 months of a 3-year sentence for molesting the 12-year-old star of his film &quot;Clownhouse&quot;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this is so common in Hollywood that it&#39;s considered &quot;an open secret.&quot; </p>

<p>I highly recommend this documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> (on Pedos in Hollywood with testimony from stars, court cases, etc, 1:40:00): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eeGX4SlF1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eeGX4SlF1s</a></p>

<p>Several people are named, but more importantly, it explains why most stars don&#39;t name abusers for years, if ever, because it ruins their chances at a successful career. The documentary calls for people who have been abused to rise up and try to put an end to this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The body language and sudden change of attitude coming from that girl sitting next to Ariana is <em>really</em> palpable. You can tell Ariana is uncomfortable as well, but that other girl instantly shuts down. She plays off her barking like she was just being funny, but what she was really doing was calling Dan a horn dog. Ariana continues being silly as the atmosphere around them becomes increasingly uncomfortable due to Dan&#39;s presence. It eventually becomes too much for the other girl, and she walks away when she realizes he wasn&#39;t going to leave them alone and put his focus on something or someone else on the set as she was hoping he would do. </p>

<p>While this video doesn&#39;t necessarily prove that Dan Schneider is or was sexually 
molesting these girls, their behavior and their body language when around him raises a red flag and it should not be readily dismissed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if Schneider was involved in Spongebob, but the other day I briefly caught a 30 second clip a kid was watching on his iPad. In that short period of time I saw numerous references to homosexuality and a number of sexual innuendoes. Im sure like many of you, I grew up on Nicklodeom, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, the Angry Beavers, the Wild Thornberries, Rocket Power, ya know the &quot;good&quot; ones from the 90s and early 2000&#39;s. What type of negative subconscious, subliminal, or psychological effects did such have on our collective developments into young men or women? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a stretch. While no one is denying the pedo-saturation in producing children&#39;s entertainment; it is not uncommon for animated programs and movies to have these kinds of subversive references to make the shows more tolerable for the parents. The child has no frame of reference for the innuendo so its effects are likely innocuous. </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not innocuous. It effects the subconscious and psyche is a very real way. Think about the word cuck, prior to the election cuck was not a popular term, it was a meme that was driven by &quot;meme magic&quot; so to speak. My 64 year old mother can even tell you want it is.

<p>I think that sounds fair.</p>

<p>What were you thinking? Putting up a sign telling people to pee on Carl? It was a terrible mistake, Officer Carl.</p>

<p>Well, that was And just so you know, I did have lotion.
