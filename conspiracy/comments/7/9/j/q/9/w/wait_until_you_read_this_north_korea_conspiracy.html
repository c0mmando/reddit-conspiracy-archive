<p>There is a thread on here about North Korea being near civil war. We all know about the Uranium One treason....</p>

<p>Did you know that ;when a uranium nuclear bomb is set off...scientists can tell &quot;whose&quot; bomb it was by the radioactive isotopes it leaves in the atmosphere? Russian bombs leave different isotopes than US bombs which are different than Chinese bombs, etc.</p>

<p>Now for the conspiracy:</p>

<p>Lil&#39; Kim nukes his own rebellious citizens...BUT, he does it with a bomb that was made from US made uranium...which was ILLEGALLY shipped out of the US by the Russians when they got their hands on the uranium from Uranium One!!!</p>

<p>The Russians make it look like it was an American attack...but, it was completely an inside job by Russia, China and North Korea!</p>

<p>Calling it treason implies there is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Outside that glaring falsehood I like post.  It has some real 3d chess in play.  But most likely highly unlikely to actually happen and even if it did no one would believe it and instead go with whatever narrative TPTB would put forward.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvote. Now THIS is a good valid point/question. I think its completely possible Nukes are a hoax. I once theorized that nukes are completely a fraud and the reason they don&#39;t want NK and Iran to try to make them because they will figure out they are a fraud and &quot;blow the whistle to everyone&quot;. 
Anyway I basically gave up because of the lack of info. And I&#39;m not really that interested in that any way. But yeah I&#39;ve seen the old videos of nuclear blasts and yeah they look fake as hell. 
But again. Good comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nuke Hoax has already been covered well by many independent outlets.</p>

<p>The reason is gets so little traction on r/conspiracy is that most users here still believe there are &#39;good guys&#39; and &#39;bad guys&#39; at the top of the control system. </p>

<p>Whether it is Trump vs Clinton or Trump vs Putin or or The West vs the Brics or &#39;internal schism in the deep state&#39;, they still believe that there is a battle going on for world control.</p>

<p>Once you realise that one group already control the whole show, the Nuke Hoax becomes obvious. Then you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywuM-UYySM">footage of &#39;nuclear tests&#39;</a> and the comedy becomes too much. It is all so blatant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carbon 14, and...I think cobalt is what they test for with wine.  </p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t have a clue what u/kingcubfan and I are talking about, here&#39;s a quick run down.</p>

<p>Prior to the detonation of the first atomic bomb, there was no real radiation present in the world, other than simple background radiation from the sun.  After the atomic bomb detonation, and thanks to further tests performed over the years, a fine but harmless dust of radioactive particles found its way into the atmosphere.  (Seriously, it&#39;s harmless.  Something like a .000000001 percent concentration.  Lead would be more radioactive, but I digress.)  These radioactive particles found their way into just about everything produced (even you) since then.  Meaning that we can now detect these radioactive isotopes, and use them to date objects.</p>

<p>So, if someone claims to have found a bottle of wine from the 1500&#39;s, we can test it for radiation.  If radiation is found, in particular those isotopes I spoke of earlier, then the wine couldn&#39;t have come from the 1500&#39;s, and is instead fake.</p>

<p>Sorry this became a TIL, but eh, there you go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if Uranium One was fabricated, and the powers that be want us to think Russia and DPRK have US isotopes? That way the US could execute a false flag attack and blame it on DPRK so the US could attack without risking conflict with China, and when it&#39;s brought up that the isotope is American, Uranium One could be made responsible. </p>

<p>If this happens there could still be conflict with China, but it would be worse if the US preemptively attacked DPRK. </p>
