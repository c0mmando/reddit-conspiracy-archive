<p>But I don&#39;t want it to just stop with the Manaforts. I want corruption to stop in Washington. I don&#39;t want it to only focus on the Trump circle, as Washington has been corrupt for a while. So when people bring up other corruption in conversation about the Manafort corruption, I think at the heart of it for those of us who have thought Washington has been corrupt for a while now is the idea that we really want to see all the corruption tackled and not just one side&#39;s corruption. And Trump really isn&#39;t even one side. He&#39;s like the third side. We still have the DNC and RNC establishments untouched in these corruption investigations.</p>
