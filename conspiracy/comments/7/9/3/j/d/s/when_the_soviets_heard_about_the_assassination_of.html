       Title basically says it all. Essentially, the Russians figured the JFK killing was an inside job (sound familiar?) done in order bring about a sort of "internal regime change".

       Many conspiracy theorists have been saying the same thing for decades. Nice to know we're not the only ones.

       This.   While the soviets may have had it right on the coup part, the fact that these were communist Soviets accusing the coup of being 'ultraright' seems a little bit disinfo-y.

       It wasn't a public announcement that could be disinformation. It was officials in the Soviet Union who believed it made sense to be a possible ultra right coup and they even list why in the document.

       The fact that the 'fbi' is taking down information from 'soviet communists' (in the 1960s no less) regarding 'their theory' about who killed JFK, knowing that that information would be released to the public at a later point is the problem I see...

       Given that it was the CIA, possibly with mob assistance and connections to the Bush-Harriman crew...  Prescott Bush (GW's father) was the money man behind the Nazis and tried to back a Nazi coup before WW2. How could that be anything BUT ultra-right?

       Your implication that it is the Comintern? That seems... improbable.

      <p>
       I would instead suggest that it is another entity, which remains nameless by virtue of their stranglehold on the body politic and public opinion... controls our policy both domestic and foreign, and compels us to wars of adventurism on their behalf.

       Agree that the possibility exists that Bush Sr. was involved (esp. w. cia connection) ....just saying there are players behind the players and these are usually nameless, faceless, and for that reason, they are more dangerous and subversive.

       The point is not support we gave them.  The Eisenhower administration, and the Kennedy administration after did not want Israel, making or possessing nuclear weapons.  Kennedy demanded inspections of Dimona.  The relationship with Ben-Gurion was straining, until Kennedy threatened to isolate Israel unless inspections were approved.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Finally, Kennedy had enough, and in a personal letter dated May 18, 1963, the president warned that unless American inspectors were allowed into Dimona (meaning the end of any military activities), Israel would find itself totally isolated.

       This scenario makes sense when you consider Kennedy's threats to rein in CIA power. Also makes sense in light of Johnson's relationship with JFK, that

       It coincides with our oligarchs (via the Powell Memo) securing their stranglehold on our "democracy" in the early 70s, the printed petrodollar and securitized debt unleashed the current boom-and-bust beast, and we were off to the races!

       I believe 100% that there was a coup in this country by organized, powerful, and wealthy groups. Presidents since the Founding Fathers have warned us about this moment.

       You know, sometimes I wonder if maybe the public really
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       handle public releases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The documents DO NOT prove what you are saying. You have to be very careful interpreting these documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The document essentially says, 'Our Russian informant says that Russia thinks X'.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just so inconclusive, It'll take me an inexhaustible list to explain why.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the informant could be genuinely wrong or misinformed.
       </li>
       <li>
        the informant could be lying.
       </li>
       <li>
        the informant might not be in-the-know.
       </li>
       <li>
        the informant could be a spy-acting-as-informant.
       </li>
       <li>
        the informant could have been fed false intelligence by his own intelligence community purposefully, for misdirection.
       </li>
       <li>
        the informant might be legit privy to information and actions of a certain few foreign officials, but perhaps not ALL of them  and perhaps not the ones that had knowledge that mattered.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The document is literally just a recounting of 'Person A has this to say on the matter'; but that does not confirm nor discredit any existing conspiracy theory NOR does it speak to the accuracy of his claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really have to have the right analytical approach to reading these documents, instead of just taking it word for word 'this was the hidden truth now come to light.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, think logically about the implications. If Russia plotted a covert assassination of the U.S. President and was successful - Do they shout it from the heavens that it was them? Or do they act completely shocked and befuddled?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't put any conclusive thought to that document. It's not proof, it's not evidence; it's not much of anything.

       I think we need to realize just how seriously everyone on the planet was shaken and taken aback by JFK's assassination, including the Soviets who had the best intelligence gathering network in the free world and could keep a tight lid on what they knew precisely because of the rigid state control they exercised over everyone in their own backyard.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the "hawks" in the US managed to kill Kennedy the "hawks" in the Soviet Union had no choice but to take over and remove Krushchev and take a more hostile and defensive position for whatever might come next. They didn't kill him, however, they simply moved him to  a resort community far away from Moscow where they kept him pretty much under house arrest for the rest of his days. Any hope for the peaceful co-existence both Kennedy and Kruschev wanted to lead their respective countries towards in relation to each other was completely reversed by that event.

       Ah, JFK and Khruschev... the original Russian collusion.

       I always wondered why the US and Russia didn't just team up and run the rest of the world as a duopoly. Seems like someone would rather have a few great powers forever fighting against each other.

       The legal question here is
       <em>

       ... who benefits? If it was an internal coup, Lyndon Johnson and the of the other top men (e.g. Allen Foster Dulles of the CIA) were involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This scenario makes sense when you consider Kennedy's threats to rein in CIA power. Also makes sense in light of Johnson's relationship with JFK, that
