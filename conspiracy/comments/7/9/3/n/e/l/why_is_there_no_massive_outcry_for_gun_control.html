       Have you noticed how the push for gun control was briefly pushed for a week after the Vegas shooting, but has almost disappeared from the news?  What gives?  You would think the anti-gun crowd would be foaming at the mouth right about now, but where are they?

       If you're in the situation most people are, that gun decreases your safety -- the odds you or someone you love accidentally shoots themself or chooses to commit suicide substantially outweighs the tiny chance that someone breaks in, means you physical harm, and you have the wherewithal to defend yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I own guns.  I first held a gun in my hand when I was two.  I love the shooting range.  But I don't delude myself.  Some number of people live in rural areas where they have to protect themselves or their livestock from wildlife.  Some people live in particularly dangerous neighborhoods.  Some people are the specific targets of past abusers or other dangerous people.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the rest -- the vast, vast majority of people who don't fall in that category, guns are a hobby, a toy, or an affect.  Nobody likes to hear this, but it's true.

       You accuse me of using anecdote evidence yet you use the same to try to refute me. If at the least various data are different then you have absolutely no proof that your theories of gun control is correct.  Furthermore, you speculate that suicide rate in Korea Japan would be higher with absolutely no evidence to back your statement. Do you have an alt dimension/reality machine where you traveled to a gun owning Korea?

       What you are really saying is that government should decide who gets the privilege of gun ownership. The mass shootings orchestrated by government prove it.  Because we know government is so wise and uncorruptable.

       I mean, we let the government decide who gets to drive a car, who gets to work, who gets to get married, who gets to

       </em>
       marriages, who gets to hunt, who gets to fish, who gets to cut hair, who gets to sell food on the street, who gets to renovate their garage, who gets to buy codeine cough syrup, and who gets to do like a 1000 other things that require licenses or applications -- the vast majority of which cause less collateral damage than firearms.

       It's already been established what the government would do if they had this power. They would make rule after rule until they disintegrated the "privilege". Just look at that cop in NY that saw a doctor for having trouble sleeping, lost his gun privilege and then his job. There is plenty of history showing what happens when gun ownership becomes a privilege granted by government. Domination required having the upper hand. For government to dominate and control it's citizens and create authoritarianism it must first disarm it's citizenry.

       Even if it's just ONE time in your life, you don't think the possibility is enough to prepare for it?  And yes, my house has been robbed before.  Luckily (for the thief I mean) no one was home.

       There's a lot of things that can happen. Doesn't mean they're all likely enough to prepare against. Like how you didn't alarm your house to protect against robbery.

       That is an unreasonable argument you are making.  What I can prepare for I will prepare for if it's feasible.   Your argument is akin to saying a meteor can fall on my house, so how are you preparing for it?  Don't be argumentative for the sake of being argumentative.

       What does that have anything to do with protecting myself and my family from intruders while we're home?  And yes, we have an alarm service.  Doesn't do much good with it takes the cops 15 minutes to arrive.

       What was once an essential part of being human, now has to be belittled and degraded because it represents traditionalism. Hunting, religion, self-sufficiency, free thought, tribal caution-- it all has to be torn down and relabeled.

       My guess is because the anti-gun citizens don't control the narrative. They may be having private conversations about gun control all day everyday but regardless the Narrative has changed. Probably on the defensive after uranium one. I think anti gun is about getting voters for 2020.

       The more talk there is about Vegas, the more people think about how nothing in the Vegas story adds up. They don't want people thinking about it AT ALL because this is the biggest fuckup yet on the recent sliding scale of Deep State "manufactured event" fuckups.
