    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re in the situation most people are, that gun decreases your safety -- the odds you or someone you love accidentally shoots themself or chooses to commit suicide substantially outweighs the tiny chance that someone breaks in, means you physical harm, and you have the wherewithal to defend yourself. </p>

<p>I own guns.  I first held a gun in my hand when I was two.  I love the shooting range.  But I don&#39;t delude myself.  Some number of people live in rural areas where they have to protect themselves or their livestock from wildlife.  Some people live in particularly dangerous neighborhoods.  Some people are the specific targets of past abusers or other dangerous people.</p>

<p>For the rest -- the vast, vast majority of people who don&#39;t fall in that category, guns are a hobby, a toy, or an affect.  Nobody likes to hear this, but it&#39;s true.  </p>

If at the least various data are different then you have absolutely no proof that your theories of gun control is correct.

<p>I mean, we let the government decide who gets to drive a car, who gets to work, who gets to get married, who gets to <em>perform</em> marriages, who gets to hunt, who gets to fish, who gets to cut hair, who gets to sell food on the street, who gets to renovate their garage, who gets to buy codeine cough syrup, and who gets to do like a 1000 other things that require licenses or applications -- the vast majority of which cause less collateral damage than firearms.</p>

<p>I know many people the government has confiscated their drivers license from and can not legally use a car. They do not have the ability to get to work and their lives are spiraling to rock bottom very quickly because of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s already been established what the government would do if they had this power. They would make rule after rule until they disintegrated the &quot;privilege&quot;. Just look at that cop in NY that saw a doctor for having trouble sleeping, lost his gun privilege and then his job. There is plenty of history showing what happens when gun ownership becomes a privilege granted by government. Domination required having the upper hand. For government to dominate and control it&#39;s citizens and create authoritarianism it must first disarm it&#39;s citizenry.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a pretty strong correlation in this country between those who own guns and those who believe in authoritarian ideas.</p>

<p>The democrat party establishment wants to control speech, control gun ownership, control the fruits of your labor to redistribute how they see fit.....</p>

Hollywood is being picked apart,
