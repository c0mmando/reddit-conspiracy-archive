    <div class="md"><p>Astral projection takes meditation and practice. You can start any time really. There are herbs that aid in doing as such.</p>

<p>Dimethyl triptamine(DMT) when smoked in its crystalline form has provided people with curious enough experiences in possible other dimension interacting with beings and objects there that one person wants to create a medical device to prolong/intensify the experience through constant intravenous dosing in order to investigate it. Crystalline DMT when smoked only lasts 13 or so minutes, so you don’t get to experience that stuff for long. </p>

<p>Ayahuasca(DMT taken orally as tea after consuming a maoi inhibitor) provides the longest experience with dmt but also doesn’t seem to have that inter-dimensional push. </p>

<p>Really interesting subject, check out info and experience reports on <a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt.shtml">Erowid</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cubism.</p>

<p>If you want a very basic understanding of the 5th dimension, cubism is your best first step.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my understanding that it (5th dimension) continues to &quot;build on and expand&quot; the &quot;first&quot; 4 (X,Y,Z axis and time). It allows one to view the first 4 at the same &quot;time&quot;. Cubism has a mixture of them in a really basic format, eg. You see the side of a face while also seeing the front.</p>

<p>The quotations are there because I suck at finding the right words to describe it, and these are the easiest.</p>

<p>To the best of my recollection, the 5th dimension was as far as my brain/mind could comprehend. I struggled with and ultimately failed to grasp the 6th as a physical mechanic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came across this (in Youtube comment section out of all places) and it sorta blew my mind as it summarised all the theories/ideas I&#39;ve been having about human existence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>LIFE PROCESS:</p>

<p>Soul = Fifth dimension</p>

<p>Mind = Fourth dimension</p>

<p>Body = Third dimension</p>

<p>The mind is the bridge between your physical perception and your Higher Self:</p>

<p>To be one with your Higher Self, you gotta be out of your mind. (like in meditation, you try to connect to your body and your higher self by quietening you mind)</p>

<p>All starts from the Perception = Feeling</p>

<p>From the Perception, you create new Thought = Imagination</p>

<p>From the Thought, you create your Reality = Manifestation</p>

<p>The way to mastering Instant Manifestation is to be one with your soul.
You cannot avoid your mind, you cannot avoid your Ego.
You can only embrace all there is as oneness and be mindful.
For once you enter the fifth dimension, you&#39;re sure to be embraced with one unconditional love with all the elements and bodies.
You&#39;re called and known as a multidimensional being.
This is where your real life begins and the very purpose of each human being lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TLDR: You already exist in and have access to multiple dimensions. But it does require discipline/training or one may take a short cut for a temporary glimpse with psychedelic drugs. This is the reason why we are oppressed, deceived and manipulated. We&#39;re much more powerful than we&#39;re made to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone&#39;s been watching &quot;Stranger Things&quot; haha. Or if you haven&#39;t, you should check it out. Anyways, there are probably multiple ways in which even the average person could access another dimension. The average person, however, is not privy to certain information about nor aware of such possibilities. 
I think we may be able to reach these other dimensions mentally and/or physically.
Through the mind, it may be done with the use of Sensory deprivation tanks,
DMT, maybe other substances, induced trances/altered states of consciousness, shamanic practices, deep meditation etc.
I think there is also the possibility that we could physically enter these other dimensions as well. I also think there&#39;s a possibility that people could enter these places without even being aware of it...I&#39;m hesitant to use fiction as an example, but this could occur much in the same way that occurs in the world of Twin Peaks, Stranger Things, or the movie Inland Empire. </p>
