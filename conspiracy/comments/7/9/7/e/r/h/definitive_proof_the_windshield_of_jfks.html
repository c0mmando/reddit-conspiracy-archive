        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the link to the windshield on display at the National Archives: <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/bullet-strike-scars-the-windshield-of-the-presidential-news-photo/576877618?#bullet-strike-scars-the-windshield-of-the-presidential-limousine-picture-id576877618">http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/bullet-strike-scars-the-windshield-of-the-presidential-news-photo/576877618?#bullet-strike-scars-the-windshield-of-the-presidential-limousine-picture-id576877618</a></p>

<p>Here is the link within the National Archives gallery of the windshield as it was presented to the Warren Commission Exhibit #351: <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305143">https://catalog.archives.gov/id/305143</a></p>

<p><strong>These windshields are clearly not the same</strong>. The true windshield has been replaced, at least once, with a new one and falsely damaged to mask evidence of a shot from the front. Multiple credible sources corroborate this:</p>

<p>Dallas motorcycle patrolmen Stavis Ellis and H. R. Freeman both observed a penetrating bullet hole in the limousine windshield at Parkland Hospital. Ellis told interviewer Gil Toff in 1971: “There was a hole in the left front windshield…You could put a pencil through it…you could take a regular standard writing pencil…and stick [it] through there.” Freeman corroborated this, saying: “[I was] right beside it. I could of [sic] touched it…it was a bullet hole. You could tell what it was.” </p>

<p>Mr. George Whitaker, Sr., a senior manager at the Ford Motor Company’s Rouge Plant in Detroit, Michigan, told attorney (and professor of criminal justice) Doug Weldon in August of 1993, in a tape recorded conversation, that after reporting to work on Monday, November 25th, he discovered the JFK limousine — a unique, one-of-a-kind item that he unequivocally identified — in the Rouge Plant’s B building, with the interior stripped out and in the process of being replaced, and with the windshield removed. He was then contacted by one of the Vice Presidents of the division for which he worked, and directed to report to the glass plant lab, immediately. After knocking on the locked door (which he found most unusual), he was let in by two of his subordinates and discovered that they were in possession of the windshield that had been removed from the JFK limousine. They had been told to use it as a template, and to make a new windshield identical to it in shape — and to then get the new windshield back to the B building for installation in the Presidential limousine that was quickly being rebuilt. Whitaker told Weldon (quoting from the audiotape of the 1993 interview): “And the windshield had a bullet hole in it, coming from the outside through…it was a good, clean bullet hole, right straight through, from the front. And you can tell, when the bullet hits the windshield, like when you hit a rock or something, what happens? The back chips out and the front may just have a pinhole in it…this had a clean round hole in the front and fragmentation coming out the back.” </p>

<p>Secret Service agent Charles Taylor, Jr., who wrote a report on November 27, 1963 in which he detailed his activities providing security for the limousine immediately after the car’s return to Washington following the assassination. The JFK limousine and the Secret Service follow-up car known as the “Queen Mary” arrived at Andrews AFB aboard a C-130 propeller-driven cargo plane at about 8:00 PM on November 22, 1963. Agent Taylor rode in the Presidential limousine as it was driven from Andrews AFB to the White House garage at 22nd and M Streets, N.W. In his report about what he witnessed inside the White House garage during the vehicle’s inspection, he wrote: “In addition, of particular note was the small hole just left of center in the windshield from which what appeared to be bullet fragments were removed.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that’s normal with broken windshields. Cracks always expand. In fact I have photos of my windshield doing just this from a small crack to all across my windshield. If there’s movement or expansion/contraction from temperature this is what happens. This has happened any time I’ve had a crack in my windshield. The fact the windshield was removed there’s no way they could’ve removed it without expanding the cracks.</p>

<p>Maybe you should treat your vehicles better so they don&#39;t continue to crack, after all I take care of my vehicle and it has not cracked further in many years and miles. See how the logic of your personal evidence (anecdotes) doesn&#39;t work if I apply mine to yours?</p>

<p>I think you meant windshield specifically though, in which case the one car I&#39;ve had which had this problem hasn&#39;t continued to expand. However there has been no official measurement from 7 years ago to now, probably because I don&#39;t care if it spreads due to insurance being required to replace 1 windshield a year in my state if the vehicle requires it (subsidized cost). There would need to be at least two points of data for me to provide the answer to your question. </p>

<p>Your post completely misses the point of mine, which is pointing out the previous posters logical fallacy of anecdotes.</p>

<p>Clearly these windshields are different. Maybe there’s something else in the archives.   Crowdsourcing this research just might get us something. There are a lot of knowledgeable people here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question as I really don&#39;t know.  How does the bullet through the windshield price a second shooter?  Could the bullet not have gone through his neck or head and gone through the windshield?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not doubting that JFK&#39;s assassination isn&#39;t a conspiracy, just curious to how the hole on the windshield proves anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Oswald only had enough time to shoot 3 bullets. We know this as a fact. That is why the magic bullet had to exist. One bullet had to go through Kennedy&#39;s neck through the gov&#39;s seat through his back out his chest hit his wrist brake his wrist then imbed in his leg. One of the bullets obviously hit Kennedy&#39;s head and we know one bullet misses because a man standing near the over pass was hit with shrapnel. There for if another bullet went through the windshield then Oswald could not do it alone. Also, if the bullet came from the front then obviously Oswald could not have fired it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, thank you for answering my question.</p>

<p>I guess to elaborate further on my question, and forgive me if you&#39;ve answered it and I&#39;m just not understanding, how are we sure that one of Oswald&#39;s bullets didn&#39;t go through the windshield?  How do we know it was a bullet that went through the front?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we know one missed entirely, one hit his head, and on went through all kinds of body parts and lodged in the governor&#39;s leg. </p>

<p>If this is a bullet hole then one of those three bullets would have had to cause it. The magic bullet couldn&#39;t because it ended in his leg. The other bullet missed and was the first one fired. If it had hit the windshield then everyone in the front seat would have flipped shit but the first real reaction comes from the second shot when Kennedy is hit. </p>

<p>Then we are left with the head shot. The downward angle that Oswald would have been shooting from would have made it extremely difficult for this shot to make it through the windshield. It also had the wrong direction for this to line up. It would have had to do some really strange trajectory changes. This is the only possible one though. That bullet fragmented a good amount. The bullet hole would not have been so perfect and would have been smaller from a fragment than what was reported by eye witnesses and that photo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... JFK was shot from the rear right and the bullet exited his head at front left and hits front left of windshield.</p>

<p>You&#39;re proposing the second gunman that fired from the front right at JFK in the BACK SEAT, shot through the front left of the windshield... that would mean he missed if true. More likely scenario is the bullet came from behind.</p>
