       Sometimes the easiest answer, though seemingly implausible, is the best answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the easiest answer comes from his reported/suspected ties to weapons deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       If such was actually the case, then it's entirely likely that any weapons he sold might be traced to owners who at best would not want discovered, and who at worst (in the case of drug dealers) might be a threat to surviving family of Paddock.  It's reasonable to suspect, given what we DO know of paddock, that he likely kept records of who he sold to, and what; as well as conversations between buyers and himself on the computer.  So, yanking it and ditching it would serve two purposes. First, it would obfuscate his contacts and dealings; and in the case of some of the buyers, might serve to protect his family.

       you call that "easy" ??

       how about:  The FBI took the hard drive, after they shot Paddock -- though "seemingly implausible", waaay easier.

       Unless Paddock was one step ahead. Knew what was going to happen and how he was going to be framed and that shot would go down in that room. So he gave the hard drive to someone that will come forth showing how everyone involved lied.

       Maybe he panicked during the firefight, and only had his trusty 00 Philips handy to remove the hard drive and masterfully hide it in the time he had...instead of idk...putting a round through the hd bay of the laptop?

       Why does Stephen Paddock do anything he does?  Why does he have a gunshot wound to the chest with a partially drying bloodstain if he “committed suicide by shooting himself in the head?”  Why did his suicide land his body in an odd position atop an AR-15 rifle?  Why was there a bipod used for shooting in the prone position set-up over his dead leg?  Why did he choose to wear bedroom slippers and gloves to carry-out such a sophisticated operation where he planned to ultimately end his own life?   Why did photos of his dead body get leaked immediately without a single still CCTV image of him in the hotel’s vicinity within the past 10 years turning up?  Why do Steve Wynn’s intelligence reports contradict the information from government agencies?  Why was his marksmanship unaffected by his alleged abuse of alcohol and benzodiazepines?  Where are all the interviews with the employees of the gun stores and shooting ranges he inevitably patronized like fellow “gun nut” Adam &amp; mommy Lanza?  Why does the LV Sheriff who bravely stood-up to the Feds during the Bundy Ranch look like a hostage while outwardly crying at press conferences while an agent breathes down his neck?  And lastly, why are these multiple agencies doing such a bad job lying to us this time?  Are they just getting lazy, or did a part of the plan go wrong?

       Everything you ask is spot on.

       I am glad you mentioned the deterioration of Lombardo. I myself wonder how the sheriff went from looking like a no-nonsense, in-charge guy to basically being Tweak from South Park, all over the course of a few days.  Maybe creepy agent-hovering-over-the-shoulder and the lying

       Ffs.. Anyone who knows anything about hard drives would be aware that so much of your personal information can be retrieved from a zeroed hard drive, including fragments of porn videos you download, emails you sent.. etc. Anyone who is preparing to kill themselves would be inclined to dispose of their hard drive before they do, even if only for reasons of privacy..
