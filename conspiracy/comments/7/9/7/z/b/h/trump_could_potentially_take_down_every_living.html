    <div class="md"><p>Bush and Clinton were both running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_drug_trafficking#Mena.2C_Arkansas">drugs</a> through Arkansas, and numerous murders to cover it up:</p>

<p>&quot;In October 2013, two former federal agents and an ex-CIA contractor told an American television network that CIA operatives were involved in the kidnapping and murder of DEA covert agent Enrique Camarena, because he was a threat to the agency&#39;s drug operations in Mexico. According to the three men, the CIA was collaborating with drug traffickers moving cocaine and marijuana to the United States, and using its share of the profits to finance Nicaraguan Contra rebels attempting to overthrow Nicaragua&#39;s Sandinista government. &quot;</p>

<p>Bush Jr. was not in on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2a22cr/ufreedomintensifies_on_the_buildup_behind_and/">9/11</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I&#39;d like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts.</p>

<p>On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera. Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11. This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington. In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying &quot;Angel is next,&quot; angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* &quot;Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?&quot; Fleischer: &quot;Yes, I can. That&#39;s correct.&quot;(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter&#39;s onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays.</p>

<p>This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ja-W5LWVk">video</a> explanation where you can see his body language, and it&#39;s pretty obvious he is <em>not</em> in charge of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what Cheney was doing on 9/11. Whoever was threatening Air Force One must had to have Cheney, the Vice President, in their pocket. Most researchers think Cheney wasn&#39;t just an LBJ, but was a very active leader of this coup faction, likely led by Bush Sr.</p>

<p>Side-note, I like your repeated mention of High Level Insider(s). Perhaps /pol&#39;s own HLI was a defector thereof? </p>
