<p>Based in Orlando. Site of previous mass Shooting at the gay bar. Crisis actors galore in that one.</p>

<p>CFCA has a bunch of big wig corporate sponsors, and they blend into the community as a public service.  Another sponsor they have is from  a crisis management firm.</p>

<p>Now why would a performing arts service have a sponsor from a crisis management firm?  Hmmm. Maybe we should ask Steven Paddock, it was him after all who was wearing that cfca t-shirt.</p>

<p>Jesus: As that door is closing– and it&#39;s so heavy, it almost slammed– I&#39;m walking down this way. And I believe that&#39;s what caught the shooter&#39;s attention. As I was walking down, I heard rapid fire. And at first, I took cover. I felt a burning sensation. I went to go lift my pant leg up, and I saw the blood. That&#39;s when I called it in on my radio that shots have been fired. And I was going to say that I was hit, but I got on over my cell phone just to clear the radio traffic so they can coordinate the rest of the call.</p>

<p>Ellen: So he shot– you didn&#39;t even know. He shot through this door, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copying my questions over from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/795zir/audio_of_jesus_campos_on_radio_reporting_shots">first thread</a> and adding a couple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What time did he call this in?</p></li>
<li><p>How did the other people on the radio respond? Did they even respond?</p></li>
<li><p>This is when we&#39;re supposed to believe he picked up his phone and told them he&#39;d been shot?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did they wait a month to release it? </p></li>
<li><p>How does this make sense when considering the <a href="https://youtu.be/QGQC5iogX1k">maintenance worker&#39;s audio recording</a>??? Schuck radios in and says someone&#39;s firing into the hallway on the 32nd floor, and someone else on the radio says &quot;Copy&quot; then yells out &quot;Hey, it&#39;s on 32!&quot; to someone else. Then a lady says <strong>&quot;Security wants to know if you know a room&quot;</strong> and Schuck says &quot;It&#39;s at the end of the hallway, uhhh... I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t tell you what room. He looked like he fired down the hallway when I got close to the door.&quot; If, according to the new Campos audio, Jesus had already radioed down and told them specifically that it was room 32-135, why did the lady tell Schuck &quot;Security wants to know if you know a room&quot;? Shouldn&#39;t she have already known? </p></li>
<li><p>If Jesus was already on the phone with Security when Schuck arrived (based on the Ellen version of his story), why did Schuck have to radio in the shots fired in the first place? And when the lady on the radio asked &quot;Security wants to know if you know a room,&quot; why didn&#39;t Schuck know? Shouldn&#39;t Jesus have been like &quot;It&#39;s 32-135!&quot;?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Always producing more questions than answers. </p>

<li><p>It appears after the Stephen Shuck call based on all other information.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it withheld?</p></li>
<li><p>Doesn&#39;t really sound like someone in a dangerous predicament that knows that they have been shot before making the call.</p></li>
<li><p>Why release it now? That&#39;s a key question.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn&#39;t make sense. They&#39;ll likely spin that they were concerned there may have been a second shooter hence why they asked Shuck. Why hadn&#39;t Shuck already heard over the radio that there were shots fired? How did Shuck not know the difference between gunfire and a jackhammer? What sort of maintenance person wouldn&#39;t know that difference?</p></li>
<li><p>Opens up a lot more questions.</p></li>
