    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       This is a theory I came up with three or four days after the shooting when the police were unable to find any motive whatsoever from Paddock. To this day, no motive has been ascribed to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the theory.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stephen Paddock is a well-off man who enjoys gambling. However, he’s always looking to make extra money to put down in Vegas.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In a casino, he’s propositioned by the Vegas shooter about buying guns. The Vegas shooter knows that he would never pass background checks to buy the needed guns for a shooting, due to a prior criminal record and/or the shooter isn’t planning on being caught.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The shooter offers Paddock a deal: Paddock, with his spotless criminal record, will stockpile guns. Paddock won’t have any trouble passing background checks as an older, wealthy man with nothing to hide. Plus, he’s already had some guns in the past.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Over six months, Paddock collects the guns, most of which were
         <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/06/us/stephen-paddock-47-guns/index.html">
          bought (33 of 47) between October 2016 and the shooting
         </a>
         . The other 14 are his own guns.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         During the collection, he kept in touch with the Vegas shooter with his computer.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         To avoid suspicion by dealers, he bought guns from all across the Southwest. “He visited gun stores in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas, where he purchased rifles, pistols and shotguns.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         While amassing the stockpile, he decides to keep some for himself. He buys nine for his homes, which were later found in his houses in Mesquite and Verdi, Nevada, near Reno.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He also is buying rounds of ammunition and up to 50 pounds of these exploding targets, which he leaves in the car. It’s worth it, though, because he’s being offered a hefty sum by a gambler who made enough to pay him in Vegas.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Finally, on the day of the Vegas shooting, the Vegas shooter sends Paddock a message about meeting to collect the guns. Paddock agrees, and then the shooter tells Paddock to rent a room in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, preferably in an obscure, high floor to complete the transaction.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        THE DAY OF THE SHOOTING
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Vegas shooter comes to the hotel to collect the guns from Paddock, or so Paddock thinks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock lets the shooter in and turns his back to walk to the guns laid out on the floor while telling him that he kept the explosives in the parking lot, as he didn’t want to accidentally set them off in a hotel. He’ll I’ve him then later.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As his back is turned, the shooter walks up to him and shoots him at point blank range. Although he would have liked to strangle or poison him to avoid noise, it wouldn’t fit if he were to frame him for suicide (keep reading).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Carefully, the shooter positions a gun on the ground as to make it seem like Paddock shot himself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Next, he opens up Paddock’s computer and removes the hard drive.
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is the biggest factor pointing to there being a second actor.
        <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/what-happened-to-las-vegas-shooters-hard-drive-its-a-mystery/">
         Police are stumped as to what happened to his hard drive
        </a>
        . It’s no where to be found in the hotel and missing from his computer.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now alone with the guns, the Vegas shooter props open the window to the 32nd floor hotel room window and opens fire on the people below.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After feeling his window for escape is closing, the Vegas shooter stops firing and returns to where Paddock is lying dead in a framed suicide.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       *Patting his pocket to check for the hard drive, the Vegas shooter slips away into a bathroom, where he hunkers down with his hands over his head and pretends to be hiding from gunfire. Later, he leaves the hotel as police find Paddock’s dead body surrounded by an arsenal of exhausted, heated, guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       ——————
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Largest evidence supporting the theory
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Missing hard drive, not missing computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’d think that if Paddock acted alone and still wanted to dispose of the computer, he would’ve done so WITH the hard drive. Why would he carry around a hard drive-less computer? A person slipping away wouldn’t want to be carrying a computer, but a hard drive? That can be easily concealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of this theory, the fact that Paddock would want to hide the hard drive is astounding evidence that he was in contact with others to plan the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Lack of a motive
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a wealthy man, not indebted, never committing criminal acts, never showing signs of illness, quit life murdering en mass? It doesn’t check out and the police still can’t find anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Why would a shooter keep ammunition in the parking lot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports say that he kept explosives
       <em>
        and ammunition
       </em>
       in his car. Why would he do that if he was meaning to use ammo to shoot people from his room?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Why didn’t the shooter shoot the shooting targets in his car?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he were planning on shooting targets to explode, why didn’t he? The 50 pounds of explosives were found in his car, but not set off by gunfire. The only explanation I can think of is if the shooter didn’t know where the car was, because it wasn’t his.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Paddock was stockpiling for nearly a year. Wouldn’t he show symptoms of lunacy in that time if he was planning on indiscriminate mass killing?
      </p>
      <p>
       It want a spontaneous shooting, yet no one that knew Paddock reports him acting differently in any way. Unless he was a master at hiding his rage, paranoia, depression, what have you, then it would be because he wasn’t actually feeling those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Biggest questions I would have about the theory
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) What about security camera footage?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the shooter entered the room, wouldn’t there be security camera footage of it? It’s a good question that I don’t know.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why did the shooter keep more guns for himself in this Reno homes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooter kept nine guns additional guns to add to the 14 he previously owned. Why would he keep guns in his home if he were planning on handing them out to the shooter? Again, it’s a valid question. My idea is that he, as a previously established gun fan, saw them and wanted them for himself as he was buying for the shooter, similarly to when you buy clothes for yourself when shopping for a present for someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       ———————-
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE: I’m not saying I believe this, but it’s the best alternative I can think of to the common theory that Paddock was deranged and shot them himself. Also, if you publish a murder mystery using these points, I expect at least a 5% cut ;)

       If you look into Paddock's history, and the shadiness of his family, you'll find that he isn't just some random old pensioner in LV. Your theory has more merit if you consider that Paddock was double crossed in some way.

       This view would be more valid if he was caught beforehand. But he wasn’t. And they even helped him up with his bags.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d say these deals take place in shady for spots for shady people. For those with wealth and access they can take place anywhere they choose.

       Making a quarter million (as an example) is 1/20 this wealth. It isn’t an insignificant sum, even for Paddock.

        You’d think that if Paddock acted alone and still wanted to dispose of the computer, he would’ve done so WITH the hard drive. Why would he carry around a hard drive-less computer?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Distraction.  Ditching the hard drive elsewhere, as I noted in another post, is relatively easy.  However, carrying the shell (HD less computer) around would serve as a good distraction and buy time for whatever method (personally, I think ditched in a trash can) used to get rid of the hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Man ditches a hard drive in his neighbor's trash, then carries the laptop around during a shooting.  Police, upon finding the laptop, will spend a good bit of time, possibly upwards of a day, trying to figure out what's on it.  During this time, the trashman comes, and the HD vanishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, if man yanks the HD and carries it with him, given the size of a laptop HD; it's possible that he will either forget he has it on him (i've done this with ssd's I was replacing), and upon finding it, police will take a day, usually less to dump the information.  If he ditches it at the site of the shooting, it's still likely to be found; since every avenue of evidence disposal will be searched.

       Well he doesn't have a gunshot wound to the head whatsoever, so that didn't happen.  I should have just stopped reading once you mentioned him being shot in the back of the head point blank, but I didn't.  I stopped when you mentioned a shooter propping open a window.  Do some research.  None of those windows prop open.

       they also don't bang out with a hammer.  Have you ever hit one?  yea, a hammer isn't breaking it.  If you watch the videos, you can see the room where he was supposedly shooting from, and not in a single one is the window broken out until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the initial barrage of bullets and chaos.  You shoot thru a window like that and see how easy it isnt.

       It's actually extremely easy to break a window when you're using a mini sledge and you're hitting a corner near the frame.  And even if he didn't hit the window direct with the hammer, all you need an object that is durable comes to a point (like a punch) and you hit that in the lower corner (consistent with the breaking of his windows).  I'd actually be really interested to see how well a piece of spark plug would do in comparison to the windows used at the Mandalay Bay.

       not gonna lie, I want to see this demonstrated on the windows around the one he broke out.  But it does bring to mind that shooting through a half broken window isn't easy, and with how busy it was, no one got hit by falling glass?  Those windows get thicker the higher up you go.

       Maybe paddock was involved in human trafficking. Somewhere along the line he wound up on the wrong side of a cartel and they told him if he procured a large amount of weapons  and ammo for them it would be a penance for his transgressions. He realizes he's in over his head and plans on making this last move before getting out. He sends his girlfriend out of the country so she don't get caught up in it and instructs her to buy a house, the one he plans on retiring to when it's all over. The whole thing went south when they shot him in the head anyway and opened fire on the crowd.

       The photo of dead Paddock appears as if the pistol was in his mouth and discharged through the upper back of his skull (limited swelling behind eyes, no bleed, pool of blood concentrated as if exit wound is from behind) it’s not impossible to believe Paddock could have been overpowered or knocked out prior to the “suicide.”
Good theory though!
