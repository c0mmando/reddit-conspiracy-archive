        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>DALLAS, May 15, 2014 — X-Men director Bryan Singer is accused of being involved in a series of pedophile parties where young boys were molested. Along with Singer, producer Gary Goddard, former Disney exec David Neuman and executive Garth Ancier are alleged to have been involved in the targeting and victimization of young boys...
...As a young boy of five years old, I became the “property” of a pedophile ring where parties such as the ones Singer is accused of attending were a common destination for drugged and terrified children.</p>

<p>Victims of child sex abuse are slowly and systematically trapped in an inescapable prison of silence using psychological blackmail and threats of violence against the child or their family. Pedophiles use all the above methods in a process known as “grooming” to wrap their victims in a cocoon of fear where many lay trapped until the end of their adult life.
We were trafficked and sold to whoever would pay the price and the darkest fantasy became our worst nightmare.</p>

<p>The leader of the pedophile ring was a ruthless psychopath named “Duke” who enjoyed choking children until they became unconscious and on several occasions his sick fantasy went too far. I watched one day as a friend of mine named “Steve” suffered the consequences of Duke’s rage. Steve had defied the authority of the lower ranking members and barely escaped with his life and this time he had become the nexus of the unstoppable fury of a psychopath. Duke calmly walked over to Steve placed his hand around his neck and as he lifted him off his feet I heard the last words my friend would ever say “Please no!” he pleaded but once Duke had taken action there was no stopping him. The color drained from Steve’s face and as the last ounce of life drained from him his bowels released their contents spilling all over Duke’s clothing. Steve’s last act had been his final revenge and I will always remember the look in his eyes as he lost his hold on the tortured life we all endured and finally found freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know of only one Duke.</p>

<p>Raoul Duke. AKA Hunter S. Thompson.</p>

<p>Thompson tried to warn us in Fear and Loathing about people who cut the heads off of people, drain the blood, take out the adrenal gland. He himself did this drug in the book/movie.</p>

<p>He used to manage the biggest sex club in san francisco.</p>

<p>He&#39;s rumored to have recorded some of these bohemian grove child sacrifices.</p>

<p>He once wrote: If I&#39;d written all the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people - including me - would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.</p>

<p>In his writings he never talked about his sex life.</p>
