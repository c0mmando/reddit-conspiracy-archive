For example, in the second source the only “account” he gave was a tweet saying he was chased by two people with guns, which I doubt he actually turned around to look but that’s besides the point.

<p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t expect reliable eyewitness testimony from people in a traumatic and chaotic event like that anyway. Rapidfire gunshots are echoing and ricocheting around, masses of people are running around in the dark, etc. </p>

<p>And if there were multiple gunmen chasing people around on ground level, I&#39;d expect a <em>lot</em> more carnage.</p>

I found it strange because I&#39;ve barely seen anyone saying that. There were a few people who said it at the beginning, but since then I&#39;ve heard nothing. The main conspiracy theory is that there were multiple shooters, with there being many different theories about who was involved and for what reason. But the news chooses to focus on a conspiracy theory which I&#39;m honestly unsure actually exists anymore. Why would anyone believe that the government would bother to go to the effort of staging it when they could just do it for real? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been convinced that WTC7 was blown up for a long time now.  As for WTC 1 and 2, I&#39;m not really sure what to think. If they were blown up, I&#39;m less convinced.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ve wondered to myself, if there really was a conspiracy, if the attacks were really an inside job, why would they blow up building 7? Most of the conspiracy theories talk about how this was a false-flag attack. But... almost no-one knows or cares about building 7. The twin towers are the true spectacles. So why go through the risk and effort of blowing up building 7 when there&#39;s nothing to gain?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory- tear it down as you see fit. Let&#39;s say the 911 attacks were genuine. No conspiracies, just foreign terrorists. The twin towers are hit, and they fall. In the meantime, building 7 has been heavily damaged, and evacuated. Who has been evacuated exactly? Well, there were many different tenants, but significantly, entire floors were owned by government agencies- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center#Tenants">CIA, DOD, and Secret Service</a>. I&#39;ll admit right here that I know nothing of how those agencies work... but if I were to guess, I bet those guys have contingencies in the case of fires or other emergencies that threaten the integrity of the building. Why? Well, they&#39;re up to their ears in secrets, and they want to keep them hidden from the public.</p>

<p>You can probably see where I&#39;m going with this: maybe 911 was such a messy situation that they felt it would be tidiest to completely destroy their office.  This would imply that they had detonators installed long ago in case of such an emergency.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn&#39;t seem wise or safe to riddle a city building full of explosives. But if they&#39;re crazy enough to do it, it could explain why they would feel the need to cover it up.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I&#39;m wrong and there&#39;s a totally different motive for destroying WTC7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well keep in mind one of the planes didn&#39;t arrive at it&#39;s planned destination. Likewise, it wasn&#39;t just those three, the pentagon was also hit.</p>

<p>On top of all <em>that</em>, the US already had military in the middle east, which is the claimed reason for why 9/11 occurred. Most countries, US included, already had info on the &#39;attack&#39;. A similar &#39;attack&#39; occurred in 1993 and was indeed staged.</p>

<p>On top of all <em>that</em>, there was naturally the controlled demolition nature of wtc7, as well as similar collapses in the twin towers.</p>

<p>As for why wtc7 in particular, it&#39;s hard to say. I don&#39;t really know enough about their operations to say why. But there&#39;s arguably no way that it collapsed from a &#39;shockwave&#39; or whatever, while literally every other surrounding building was fine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear the attack was intentional. But the details appear unclear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen people saying it was the government. Some have said it was done to make it easier to pass new security laws, others that it was to give a reason to pass laws on firearms, others that it was a ritual sacrifice by the illuminati. Others still have suggested it wasn&#39;t the government, but a Mexican cartel, the Italian-American mafia, or even ISIS, and the government was hiding it because they were either involved, or they didn&#39;t want people to get angry about the government&#39;s lack of ability to counter criminal organisations. </p>

<p>None of these explanations seem very convincing to me. I&#39;d also really like to know why, if there were multiple shooters, they would have picked an official narrative where there was only one. Why not just plan a narrative where there were multiple shooters, of if you wanted to pretend it was a lone wolf attack, then just use one shooter...</p>

<p>Basically, I&#39;m pretty skeptical about the conspiracy theories that have  come out about it, at least of the ones I&#39;ve seen, but I can&#39;t help but acknowledge that there are some very strange things about it, so I also remain skeptical of official story. </p>

There were 12 fairly long bursts and people who know what they&#39;re talking about suggested that the inconsistent rate of fire indicated that the shooter used a bump stock or a trigger crank before the authorities revealed which type of weapons were used. If multiple shooters were involved, more bursts and likely simultaneous bursts would have been fired, yet not a single piece of evidence is pointing to this. Multiple shooters would have killed so many more people. The only weird thing about the Las Vegas shooting is that the authorities haven&#39;t published videos of the shooter if only just to appease the conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you show me a detailed eyewitness report in which multiple shooters are identified visually? Ideally, it should be corroborated by another person. This should not be difficult since there were around 25,000 witnesses.</p>

<p>Everything I have read so far comes from a handful of obviously confused people who were running and trying to find shelter. They did not know where the shots were coming from, they assumed. It is perfectly logical to assume that the shots are coming from the crowd. A guy claimed that some of the shots came from ground level because he heard some of the bullets whizzing right over his head as if that meant anything. If the bullet had passed right over his head, he would have heard the crack that follows a supersonic bullet. Whizzing bullets can be ricochets (there must have been a huge number of ricochets) or bullets that fly past you before you can hear the crack. If supersonic bullets fly really close to you, the cracking noise is overwhelmingly loud and you typically do not hear the whizzing sound.</p>

<p>By the way, a good portion of people do not know that bullets produce this cracking noise on their trajectory when they are supersonic and they can easily mistake the cracking noise for the bang that is produced when a weapon is discharged.</p>

<p>We have good audio recordings of every single one of the 12 bursts that were fired at the crowd. These recordings show that if multiple assailants had participated in the attack, they would have taken turns firing at the crowd. Weapons were not discharged simultaneously and the pauses between two bursts are consistent with the time it takes to pick up another weapon, reload or travel from one window to the other one.</p>

<p>That is an understatement for people running for their lives while friends, family and strangers are getting their heads and bodies blown apart next to them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, not exactly.  Where is the audio of the &quot;200 shots&quot; fired at Campos 6 min before the mass murdering started?</p>

<p>What is the explaination for the 2, not one, single shots at the end and the woman who says &quot;I see falling glass&quot; at the Mandalay Bay in between those two shots?  Paddock can&#39;t shoot himself in the head twice, can he?</p>

<p>How do you explain the helicopters picked up on audio from the location of the concert videos?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weapons were not discharged simultaneously and the pauses between two bursts are consistent with the time it takes to pick up another weapon, reload or travel from one window to the other one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way you can conclude this because there is no single recording of the entire event from start to finish. In fact, the taxi recording clearly picks up two separate locations, one close, and one very far away at the start of the massacre.</p>

<p>As far as the gag order you talked about. I&#39;m going to assume the documentary lied to you about the scope and nature of the order. No way a federal gag order applies to &quot;everyone within a certain radius of the school&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I get your point. But explain this &quot;father&quot; to me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpRQ-p2HJWk">Robbie Parker</a>.  He&#39;s laughing and &#39;off camera&#39; mode then gets into a traditionally trained actors mode to act sad and recount his sons brutal murder that just happened about 24 hours earlier.</p>

<p>If it did happen, then a person like this, who can laugh and joke and be happy about &quot;something&quot; just before being able to instantly change for the cameras and wipe his smiles away and fake cry, could put on an act for his family and friends.</p>

<p>BTW, since you&#39;re so committed to the story being true, try to find where this eager to speak to the media father, Robbie Parker, is now....  Let us know please! </p>

<p>Do you realise how ridiculous that comparison that is? How the fuck would film directors get away with killing masses of people for their films? Sure there&#39;s plenty of sex offenders in Hollywood, but massacring people is on another level.</p>

<p>No one is pretending that films are real, so it&#39;s much easier for them to stage murder and violence, rather do them it real and try and hide it from everyone. False flag operations are the exact opposite. Everyone thinks the attacks are real, and that&#39;s what TPTB want people to think, so why the fuck would they go to effort of staging it? Also, it massively increases the amount of people involved who could potentially blow the whistle.</p>

<p>Yep, even &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39;. This is why it is so easy to pull off complete hoaxes. Very few people have the temerity to question the underlying narrative of &#39;people died&#39;.

<p>Why would anyone believe it might be staged? Because the government (or some element of it) has done that before. I&#39;m not saying the Vegas shooting was a hoax, but it&#39;s at least a possibility. There have been hoaxes where nobody was even hurt or killed. Sandy Hook is one glaring example. </p>

<p>This quote above seems to indicate that no-one was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. 20 little children, innocents, were murdered that day. I hope the above statement is just an accident or a misunderstanding and will be fixed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. I&#39;ve studied these mass shootings in public places and what I&#39;m most convinced of is that the false flags combine both real victims and crisis actors who give them control over the narrative. </p>

<p>OP makes a great point about LV. The real victims, who don&#39;t fall in line, must be dealt with to silence them and send a message.</p>

<p>The &quot;official narrative&quot; coming from the MGM/FBI camps must be told only by the people pre-selected to tell the official story.  </p>

<p>In this case, the most blatant &quot;tell&quot; of this strategy is Campos himself.  Not a single thing he did during the incident, nor after, makes any logical sense. Nothing.  </p>

<p>But Campos is there to be a victim, eye witness, hero and sympathetic pawn all wrapped up into one.  And having Ellen spoon feed him his lines show just how pathetic he really is as a human being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Ricky&quot; mentioned in Kymberley&#39;s Facebook post is Rick Ardito (and Cassie is his wife). He&#39;s talked in detail about their experience that night in some radio/podcast interviews, if you&#39;re interested: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rick&#39;s first podcast interview, recorded before Kymberley died: <a href="https://youtu.be/KeEXGkh4LsA">https://youtu.be/KeEXGkh4LsA</a></p></li>
<li><p>An interview Rick did after Kymberley died (he talks about her death at the 44:13 minute mark): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mZdlOKdWdI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mZdlOKdWdI</a></p></li>
<li><p>And here are Rick and Cassie&#39;s Facebook posts: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/772nr9/rick_cassie_ardito_friends_of_kymberly_suchomel">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/772nr9/rick_cassie_ardito_friends_of_kymberly_suchomel</a> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of his story matches Kym&#39;s, but he fills in more blanks in some areas as well. Be curious to know your thoughts on why he&#39;s still breathing is Kymberley was killed for telling the same story.  </p>

<p>And not actually a survivor, but Chad Nishimura is missing. He is the Mandalay Bay valet who parked Stephen Paddock’s car, went missing in the days following the shooting, after giving an interview to a Hawaiian mainstream outlet KITV4 in which he contradicted the official narrative, and pointed out that Paddock “didn’t have many bags.” Certainly not enough to cart 27 semi-automatic weapons, thousands of rounds and modifications up to the room.</p>

<p>Interview has been scrubbed from the site. But archived here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171003084931/http://www.kitv.com/story/36505487/hawaii-native-parked-shooters-car">https://web.archive.org/web/20171003084931/http://www.kitv.com/story/36505487/hawaii-native-parked-shooters-car</a></p>

<p>Regarding odds: Centers for Disease Control say the US mortality rate is 824 per 100,000 per year. So for 22,000 it would be 181 per year (about 15 per month). So nothing odd about people dying, but the causes are way off the spectrum. By far the largest killers are heart disease and cancer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A thought that has not been expressed in this thread thus far (though maybe I&#39;m missing something): Could the &quot;multiple gunmen&quot; have been regular concert-goers who happened to be carrying their own pistols, and when the concert was fired upon, fired back in the direction of attack, heard shots next to each other, then were embroiled in confusion through the mass exodus?</p>

<p>Yeah, and a couple others it looks like. I didn&#39;t know this until I just read the article, but his attorney had met with FBI and had info that wasn&#39;t being released to public. Suddenly dies, no reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they will often hijack the talking points of conspiracies to dumb them down so no one bothers.</p>

<p>Like how tower 7 became jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams and then everyone forgot about tower 7 and assumed the meme was about the other major towers.</p>

<p>Or the whole gmo thing. The actual issue is Monsanto&#39;s monopoly on Gmo&#39;s and the chemicals to grow them which lock farmers into a Monsanto-only cycle; people don&#39;t know that; they think the gmo conspiracy is the end product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister works for a billing company out of Vegas for like 2 dozen doctors and said there were a lot of hospitals involved and that real people were shot and died which I agree with but obviously it was an orchestrated event with multiple shooters and at this point you are right they can brazenly shoot citizens now or whatever for that matter and who would really do anything about it? Scares me to think what the next few years will be like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would anyone believe it might be staged? Because the government (or some element of it) has done that before. I&#39;m not saying the Vegas shooting was a hoax, but there have been hoaxes where nobody was even hurt or killed. Sandy Hook is one glaring example. So it&#39;s not as crazy as you make it sound. Watch the documentary We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook, shit blew my mind and completely opened my eyes to the level of deception going on these days with our government and mainstream media. My buddy tried to watch the documentary at his house and his internet literally stopped working for 24 hours. Never happened before or since. Makes you wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. I&#39;ve studied these mass shootings in public places and what I&#39;m most convinced of is that the false flags combine both real victims and crisis actors who give them control over the narrative. </p>

<p>OP makes a great point about LV. The real victims, who don&#39;t fall in line, must be dealt with to silence them and send a message.</p>

<p>The &quot;official narrative&quot; coming from the MGM/FBI camps must be told only by the people pre-selected to tell the official story.  </p>

<p>In this case, the most blatant &quot;tell&quot; of this strategy is Campos himself.  Not a single thing he did during the incident, nor after, makes any logical sense. Nothing.  </p>

<p>But Campos is there to be a victim, eye witness, hero and sympathetic pawn all wrapped up into one.  And having Ellen spoon feed him his lines show just how pathetic he really is as a human being.</p>
