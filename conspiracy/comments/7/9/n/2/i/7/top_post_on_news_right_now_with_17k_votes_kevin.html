<p>Totally calculated move on Spacey&#39;s part. How so?</p>

<p>He knows that this will help confuse the issue. People might be reluctant to criticize him because such criticism will tend to be conflated with criticism of homosexuality itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is kind of interesting the way &quot;open secrets&quot; have been being revealed lately though. Many of us might have already known, but someone with power decided to take this instance seriously and everyone else has jumped on board too. In the past, an allegation like this would have been swept under the rug and ignored, but we keep getting examples of these open secrets being revealed publicly and taken seriously. It&#39;s not surprising to learn that Spacey would sexually harrass a teenage boy, but I&#39;d say it is surprising that the truth is being taken seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently found out that the mods at r/news are diehard left-wing liberals, when I got banned for posting up a factual statement.  The post merely stated that Reddit is full of ignorant, bitter liberals, who can&#39;t get over the fact that Trump won the election. AND that post was in direct response to someone who denigrated/attacked anybody who supports Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anthony Rapp was the 14 year-old he molested, the fucking pederast. So the headline IS true, but not emphasizing the important part.</p>

<p>It should read: &quot;Kevin Spacey apologies to Anthony Rapp for molesting him, Comes Out as Gay.&quot; (As if everyone didn&#39;t already know he was Gay, but w/e). But he IS getting dragged in the media for it, as well as on twitter and the subs I read. But I do get your point.</p>

<p>Hollywood has a massive problem with sexual harassment, assault, and rape (both statutory and otherwise). What&#39;s unique to Hollywood is that the victims, I would speculate, are probably 50/50 men and women (and girls and boys).</p>

<p>I also got massively down-voted in a leftist sub I post in (I&#39;m socialist) for bringing up &quot;An 0pen Secret&quot; and the fact that Br1an S1nger is a pedophile and rapist. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was because I named dropped the documentary, the director, or both (they&#39;ve succeeded in suppressing the documentary, although you can find it online if you look). I highly doubt my comrades were the ones down-voting me, as we are currently talking about what a piece of shit Kevin Spacey is and it&#39;s got like 400 upvotes. Besides, we hate Liberals and Hollywood.</p>

<p>It did seem very suspicious to me, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there is are paid Redditors dedicated to constantly searching for that documentary and that director&#39;s name to try and bury it whenever it pops up.</p>

<p>Fake edit: Threw numbers in the names of both to try to throw off the Hollywood pedophile-enabling downvote brigade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say this was a great release by spacey. He&#39;s covering up that he&#39;s a documented pedofile. This isn&#39;t he first alleged incident. No one believes the kid, because people assume once you get rich and famous other people are out to ruin you.</p>
