        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So it turns out that the Russians had a pretty good basis for their little theory that the JFK assassination was a coup. Its interesting also that they used the term &quot;Ultra-Right&quot; to describe it. There really is only one group they could be talking about. Yeah Nazis.</p>

<p>I know everyone is sick to death of hearing about Nazis but I think this is intentional. An author and PhD historian Joseph Farrell has suggested that the lead up and end of WW2  involved a power struggle betweem Anglo-American and German elites. The end of WW2 involved a kind of detente where the Nazi party formed alliances with the American and Communist elites and were able to instigate tensions between them. The international nature of the globalist conspiracy requires some source of funding that is also international in nature. The only geopolitical power that could do this was Germany for the simple reason that their industrial might is enormous: IG farben was the beating heart of the German military industrial complex and it wasnt even fully dissolved until 2003:</p>

<p>There is a good chance that this was an early attempt to internationalize facism.</p>

<p>The ties to Bush SR, the Nazi party and the MIC are legion:

<p>A decent interview:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TDWhkjmuZjk">https://youtu.be/TDWhkjmuZjk</a></p>

<p>I am convinced that many of the eccentr√¨cities/condtradictions of the conspiracy community can be explained by this international facist network. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Gehlen">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Gehlen</a></p>

<p>This guy ran German army intelligence. <strong>He was bought off by the allies after the war to keep his Soviet network intact, whereupon hs most likely fed both sides disinformation to forment hostilities.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Skorzeny">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Skorzeny</a></p>

<p>This was Hitlers top spy. Basically James Bond with a German accent. <strong>He trained thousands of Arab Egyptian jihadists in suicide bombing and terrorist tactics</strong>. He also did work for the Mossad. (Wtf????)</p>

<p>The bizzare behavior of American and European governments makes sense when you realize there are multiple competing groups at the top. This aspect must be looked at much more closely by those in know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So help me out.<br/>
Going to try and recap your points:  </p>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s an international NAZI party.<br/></li>
<li>They&#39;re associated with the Bush family.<br/></li>
<li>They&#39;re also associated with the Russians?<br/></li>
<li>This part killed JFK and the Russians knew about it because of their associate with the global Nazi party? </li>
</ul>

<p>Is that right? Or am I missing something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tl;dr</p>

<p><strong>There&#39;s an international NAZI party.</strong></p>

<p>More an organization that operates how CNN claims Alquedia operates.</p>

<p><strong>They&#39;re associated with the Bush family.</strong></p>

<p>Used to be. Bushs helped create them. Divorce papers filed on 9/11.</p>

<p><strong>They&#39;re also associated with the Russians?</strong></p>

<p>They fed Russia and U.S. disinfo to spark Cold War. They gave the U.S. the atomic bomb and the Russians afterwards as well as... other stuff.</p>

<p><strong>The Nazi&#39;s killed JFK and the Russians knew about it because of their associate with the global Nazi party?</strong></p>

<p>Nazis were the only boots on the ground assets the CIA had. When JFK moved all covert operations to the Pentagon they were understandably pissed... along with half a dozen other groups including the mob. Russia was probably just getting wind of how f***ed up the situation was getting.</p>

<p>Long vers: The Anglo-American elite created three brands of Socialism and had them all try to kill each other. National Socialism, Revolutionary Socialism, and Welfare Socialism (The New Deal). All three are really just a counter-enlightenment strategy. The Russian revolution got out of control. Lenin looked like he was about to <em>actually</em> liberate the workers across Europe.</p>

<p>Hitler was then funded for this reason; to contain the Russian revolution within Russia.</p>

<p>It backfired completely. Hitler began rebuilding Germany with the U.S. gold he&#39;d recieved and began coining his own money. (Ever heard a lizard scream? Lol) The U.S. and the allies were brought in to contain Germany by way of Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>German and Russian armaments industries were American creations FIRST. The Russian Gorky truck plant was a Ford creation and produced vehicles that would find their way into Vietnam. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAZ">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAZ</a></p>

<p>The American Nazis (think Bush) realized that Hitler was nuts and couldn&#39;t be negotiated with. They allied themselves with the German military to assassinate Hitler, end the war on the western front, and ally against Russia. This was Operation Valkyrie. Jury is still out on what exactly went down.</p>

<p>In 1944 it was obvious the war was lost. The German banks and corporations were told to pack up and continue the war through other means. They moved to argentina and continued exotic weapons research. These were used as bargaining chips with the Anglo-American elite (US/UK Nazis). </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident</a></p>

<p>An alliance between the elite in Russia, US, and of the International Nazi variety was put into effect. This group <strong>effectively became their own civilization at this point with their own financial system</strong>. Our whole banking system has beem used to fund this breakaway civilization at this point.</p>

<p>The conventional forces of NATO and the USSR were kept in an arms race to fund further development of advanced weaponry doing god knows what. The KGB and CIA were fed disinformation in the form of massive over statatments of the enemies capabilities:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_B">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_B</a></p>

<p>The bizzarely planned adventures in Iraq, the amount of wars that destroy tons of U.S. hardware like Vietnam, the schizophrenic relationship with Israel along side the inexplicable funding of hostile Arab states, the Muslim immigration crisis, and the recent Russia scaremongering can be explained by the presence of a Facist organization running the U.S.</p>

<p>Note that I&#39;m talking old school Nazis. Not those LARPers in Charlottesville or the insecure white nationalists on 4chan. I mean the genocidal/totalitarian types that want to rule the world; Race is out, finance is in.</p>
