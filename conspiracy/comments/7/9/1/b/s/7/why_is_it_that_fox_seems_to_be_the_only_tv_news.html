It almost seems like it&#39;s an attempt to keep people focused on gun control (which I&#39;m not against, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hugely relevant to the mass shootings going on). </p>

<p>Also, the fact that it&#39;s only reported on by Fox just perpetuates the idea that all conspiracy theorists are far right, which 1) is not true, and 2) gives some people an excuse to write off their opinions. </p>

<p>9/11 I think is kind of an equalizer politically, in my opinion, and it exists on a scale. A lot more people think the government at least knew it was going to happen, than think the planes were CGI, for example. I mean Fahrenheit 9/11 was by Moore (very liberal) and grossed over 200 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we seem to have crossed some mirror-zone in tine or something, it&#39;s crazy. </p>

<p>I think a big issue is that the &quot;progressive&quot; left, the community which used to stand behind good voices like Kucinich and McKinney, completely abandoned their opposition to gov&#39;t corruption during the Obama years. Suddenly the &quot;social justice&quot; agenda took the forefront, and as long as gay people could get married and they could rail against &quot;institutional racism&quot;...gov&#39;t corruption, loss of freedom and a century of continual warfare went tk the backburner. Suddenly meaningless gestures and empty words meant everything to them.</p>

<p>This is karma for the way the railed against 9/11 truth during the Bush years. It was what drove me from &quot;progressives&quot; and into libertarianism.</p>

It&#39;s the opposite of liberalism.  And you see it on college campuses and the internet every day especially youtube, reddit, google and facebook.</p>

<p>You mentioned Cynthia McKinney, who I respectfully disagree with on many issues, at least she knows what a shame the Iraq war was and that we&#39;re being lied to about 911.  If the progressives have such a hard-on for women and minorities, why couldn&#39;t they get behind her?  Maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re full of bullshit.</p>

<p>2: Assange loves Trump</p>

<p>3: Fox News are working hard to differentiate themselves from any other MSM.</p>

<p>Since there is nothing new coming out on the LV shooting, everything is speculations. Fox News is speculating. The other MSM are speculating on the Trump-Russia investigation since nothing new are coming out.</p>

<p>Narrative, that is the answers.</p>

The Sandy Hook shooting had discussions on whether to arm teachers or more security at schools, the gay night club talked about how to combat Muslim Extremists.

    <div class="md"><p>Fox reports it so that the Left can dismiss it. It&#39;s an act of revealing by Fox knowing that it will not be believed by the liberal cult. They see it as a &quot;right wing conspiracy.&quot; You also have your conservative cult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of this one:</p>

<p>&quot;In some cases the FOX party line includes accurate revelations which would be thoughtcrimes in the CNN world. In such cases, the CNN world responds by classifying those revelations as  ‘right wing’ conspiracy theories. Unlike a propaganda-only system, where state crimes are always hidden, this multi-cult system enables the state to document its own crimes on conservative media, and know that the information will be disbelieved by the liberal cult. This system allows the truth to be hidden from some, through the act of revealing it to others.&quot;</p>

They&#39;re just questioning different things, like ideologies around sexism, racism, classism, and ableism, but some people take it to the extreme.
