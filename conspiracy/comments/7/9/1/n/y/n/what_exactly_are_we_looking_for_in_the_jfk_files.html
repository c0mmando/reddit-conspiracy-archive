       I keep circling back to your point. However, most of the files that were released were more than likely altered and most deemed unusable. Given the nature of whom the file keepers have been., I highly doubt that The CIA, FBI and Homeland Security would implicate themselves as criminals. We are at a volatile time such as the time we are currently living in. Not to mention the fact that thousands of very important doc.'s have yet to be released. I think it's almost a certainty that they either released what was convenient for their agenda or are using this date to their advantage. This is what I call "shiny red balloons"...as in, "Hey! Look over here at these lovely red balloons , so one can't look away and see the truth of our current state".  This was a prime time for a good distraction to keep America's brightest minds busy, so other more threatening matters aren't being addressed. Hmm...Nov 4th ring a bell? How about the many references to Russia...? Lovely timing, don't you think? It's just...curious, I suppose.

       it is to appease the masses, normal people(who don't stop looking further) will see this as the government doing a good deed, if this doesn't bring down the whole system and bring peace and happyness on earth then it is fuckin useless

       It is to appease the masses and I’m interested to see how the news will cover the story, the UK has been mentioning the Cambridge call and some man pretty much just said that the CIA and FBI fucked up. Thing is, you stop appeasing the masses when you don’t release all the documents and when the media starts questioning the government.

       At the end of the day it all depends how the media in US covers this whole issue. If they straight out say that FBI and CIA failed to prevent this (and this won’t be the first time they failed at their job) some people might get concerned. It’s unlikely they will say this though.
      </p>

       Everyone is clueless about what happened on that day and as posts have mentioned we won’t know the full truth.

       It's a big nothing burger to distract the conspiracy community for a few days. They redacted everything good. And, it made their puppet trump look good for awhile.

       They held these documents back all these years for a reason. Believe what you will but intelligence agencies dont give out information unless it fits some type of narrative they are pushing. They didnt want any of these files out. People long dead decided this info was too sensitive for the public and even now people who had nothing to do with rhe assassination are still pushing to keep some of it secret. This is real. Dots need to be connected. Carefull study of the files has to take place before any judgements can be made. We actually owe Donald Trump a thank you for doing what probably no other President would have. This may be the only positive thing he does for the public as President.

       The files where the FBI and CIA says they killed Kennedy dont exist. If they did rhey would be desposed of a long time ago. This is as good as it gets. We don't nerd to destroy these institutions, we need to control and regulate them.  Disposing of rouge cliques that have a stranglehold on inter- agency policies.

       Great point! I continuously find myself circling back to this logic and the logic in which the Dr. pointed out that this date has been set for 25 years...but, still. This seems too easy and convenient. I have learned through research that plausible conspiracy theories and the truth, often meet somewhere in the middle. I do hope you are correct, however!

       They have been covering up from day one. After all this time the real truth is not going to be found in anything they release.

       There's a couple very sound theories that are all very different, so no, we don't "pretty much how it all went down" --- You subscribe to one and I might believe something else.

       They don't give a shit if they leave evidence behind, they own the courts and government. Often there are massive amounts of evidence and whistleblowers, witnesses etc in suc things as JFK and nothing comes of it.
