      <p>
       This is an honest question.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, this guy is the most powerful man on earth now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people all over this country think he is for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They voted for a guy who was caught saying "I tried to fuck her like a bitch, but she rejected me" to a married woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       And bragged about "when you're famous they'll let you grab them by the pussy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone ever really thought "oh jeez well since he says some true things about Bill Clinton, that makes him not a rapist!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we know the Clintons were terrible people, and that nobody really expected Trump to win. But look at the guys history. He's as corrupt as they come, maybe in a different form than we've seen before, but he isn't the innocent Savior some people in this country see him as.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never trust him with my beautiful daughters alone. Hell no.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why trust him when he says he'll drain the swamp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because to me, and to millions of others who don't blindly worship him, he ain't draining no swamp.

       actually most "trumpers" don't really give a crap about your continued Hillary support program.  IF the triggered clintonites posting stuff on the net would look at the FACTS of what the DNC had and is doing, a logical mind would be repulsed.  Same goes for Republicans BTW.

       He's a reality TV President, dude. He's not really running the show. He's the face for the military junta that took over. They may not be that great, but it's possible they're slightly less evil than what we had before and:

       Ever go to a high end concert, in my case a raves.  Most Dj's always had, basically, a platter of drugs, take your pick.  Im sure other pleasures are presented in the same fashion with enough power.  Past the studio exec, the guy who owns the studio, more than likely gets what he wants.  Can't imagine letting ego run amok like that...

       You don't need to put many puzzle pieces together, you just need to believe one of them.  But no one would do that here because r/conspiracy has turned into another mindless alt-right sub.
