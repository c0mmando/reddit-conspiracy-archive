    <div class="md"><p>One time in college I was at a party where a supposed football player shot an innocent frat guy walking his dog.  I was there and the frat guy was coked out of his mind and threatening to shoot everyone at the party.  He came back with a gun and I took off.  On the news they portrayed this frat guy as an innocent victim.  It was so wrong.  Long story short the news missed by a long shot.  They never came back and apologized....15 minutes of air time and it was over. That was when I stopped believe long anything from MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the newspaper once when I was about 8 years old, my dad was practicing his serve at some tennis courts and I was on the court next to him hitting balls into the net. I was absolute shit at tennis and the only reason I tried was because my dad was really into it and was quite the beast. Someone took a pic of me mid swing and the caption was something to the effect of &quot;Tmntnut practicing his tennis skills, looking to become a future competitor someday.&quot; Was a little article and I don&#39;t remember exactly what it said. My parents have some of them stashed away so I could probably dig them up but it&#39;s really not worth it. They didn&#39;t really get the story correct but it&#39;s not like it was a huge deal or anything, I was just a kid trying to hit the shit out of a tennis ball into the net.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not me, but my son. He and a friend in high school decided to launch paper clips with rubber bands in the H S cafeteria. He hit the lunch lady, and got zinged for &quot;Zero Tolerence&quot;. Gawd, what a circus. I did not take the felony charges lightly, called the ACLU, and at the school board meeting, (after having to bail him out of county jail), AP wire service picked up on it, as well MTV news, CBS, NBC, and ABC news. Rush Limbaugh did a segment on it, as well as Readers&#39; Digest. Northwestern used my sons&#39; case as a teaching tool for a few years as well. The kid wound up being kicked out of school for having lousy aim, and getting his GED instead. I kicked enough of a legal fight to have the school superintendent retire, as well as the police chief in my one horse town.  My kid got called everything from a deliquent to a wanna be felon by the media. MTV called it the &quot;Story of the Decade&quot; against Zero Tolerence. Basically, he shot the paper clip heard around the world... Good times..</p>

One kid slammed the other through a vintage trophy case made of plain old glass, cutting his arm at the shoulder nearly 100% through, basically dangling on tendons.

<p>&quot;yah I don&#39;t know what happened a couple guys got in a fight and one was apparently hurt pretty bad&quot;</p>

<p>News lady &quot;we heard it was a knife fight, did you hear anything about a knife?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I haven&#39;t heard people saying anything about it was a knife fight&quot;</p>
