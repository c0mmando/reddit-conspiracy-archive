<p>Whenever a conspiracy figure tries to get me to trust the president, conservative media outlets like Fox news, and conservative &quot;conspiracy&quot; alternative media figures like Alex Jones or Roger Stone and Cenovich/Milo, I just roll my fucking eyes because they&#39;re so full of shit. </p>

<p>Stop letting these people suck you in to the left right paradigm. I see so much bashing of Clinton and the left (yea, they fucking suck too), but wow....The whataboutism and hypocrisy I&#39;ve been seeing lately regarding a trust in the conservative side of the paradigm is just embarrassing as a theorist...</p>

<p>Both sides are corrupt, and the whole game is to get you to take a side you goofballs....Lets wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem we&#39;re having now is that the Dems are proven evil, and the Trump administration is confusing. The Dems and the media have been mudslinging against Trump for nearly two years, and it&#39;s all coming out that they&#39;re in collusion to cover up some of the worst corruption in planetary history. Of course, many &quot;conservatives&quot; and &quot;Repubs&quot; have their hands in the same game, but the powers behind the power structure put most of their cards on the &quot;left&quot; and are still playing them. It&#39;s very difficult to discern what might be truly evil about Trump and his admin vs. the continual barrage of lies and mis-truths coming out of the &quot;establishment.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Assange has been a whore from him at all, unless there&#39;s some tweets I missed.</p>

<p>I think all of the people you mentioned in the second paragraph are definitely controlled gate keepers, but gate keepers know shit, and occasionally let it slip, or give clues that they&#39;re obfuscating. They&#39;re all deflecting from the money powers and founders of a shitty little mideast nation. It&#39;s fascinating to watch. </p>

<p>The Clinton bashing is long overdue and needs to turn from &quot;bashing&quot; to &quot;justice.&quot;</p>

<p>Your points are very well-taken though. Just adding and arguing, but only slightly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange has no boner for Trump dude, he wants the truth, and its not his fault that nobody has dirt on Trump. I really honestly dont think there is any, and if there was he already admitted to it (utilizing bankruptcy for gains) which is really petty compared to the shit we are seeing currently being exposed on the left side (clintons). The reason this is so huge is because it seems the loudest voices (celebs &amp;msm) combined with the left have claimed to be so perfect and innocent in any wrong doing during the 2016 election while bashing Trump, and independent media (alex jones) even though both of them said things that have both been proven to be wrong/right. Basically all the bullshit accusations the left have been pushing on America for the last 12 months is blowing up in their faces and it is great, the truth will be revealed people, dont listen to the msm and the false narrative.</p>
