       Idk if he was always a plant or a creature of the CIA, or if Wikileaks was taken over by TPTB and they're using him as a political weapon against conspiracy theorists, but hes just like Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson now, shilling for the right and attacking the left exclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a conspiracy figure tries to get me to trust the president, conservative media outlets like Fox news, and conservative "conspiracy" alternative media figures like Alex Jones or Roger Stone and Cenovich/Milo, I just roll my fucking eyes because they're so full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop letting these people suck you in to the left right paradigm. I see so much bashing of Clinton and the left (yea, they fucking suck too), but wow....The whataboutism and hypocrisy I've been seeing lately regarding a trust in the conservative side of the paradigm is just embarrassing as a theorist...
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides are corrupt, and the whole game is to get you to take a side you goofballs....Lets wake up.

       Don"t tell this guy what Trump thinks of Epstein back in 2002:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">
         And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

       Do you think Republicans are some pure group of people?  Do you honestly think that only people on the left have pedophile creeps?  I don't even know what you mean by killing innocent Americans specifically, but Trump killed American civilians with an early overseas attack.

       The problem we're having now is that the Dems are proven evil, and the Trump administration is confusing. The Dems and the media have been mudslinging against Trump for nearly two years, and it's all coming out that they're in collusion to cover up some of the worst corruption in planetary history. Of course, many "conservatives" and "Repubs" have their hands in the same game, but the powers behind the power structure put most of their cards on the "left" and are still playing them. It's very difficult to discern what might be truly evil about Trump and his admin vs. the continual barrage of lies and mis-truths coming out of the "establishment."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Assange has been a whore from him at all, unless there's some tweets I missed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all of the people you mentioned in the second paragraph are definitely controlled gate keepers, but gate keepers know shit, and occasionally let it slip, or give clues that they're obfuscating. They're all deflecting from the money powers and founders of a shitty little mideast nation. It's fascinating to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton bashing is long overdue and needs to turn from "bashing" to "justice."

       Your points are very well-taken though. Just adding and arguing, but only slightly.

       Are you being funny or implying that I'm talking about run-of-the-mill, garden-variety American Democrats? I'm talking about the DNC, the Clintons, Obama, Podesta and all the legitimate shit about them on this sub currently. They call themselves "Democrats," but that's just a contrived side of the dichotomy; they're all friends with the Bush family too.

       Everybody knows both sides are fucked. But you're not going to do anything about it. Are you? I bet you won't.

      <p>
       So which is the lesser of two evils? You've got the globalists network of child rapists who get off on war and human suffrage. Or you've got their deflectors who are fighting back.
      </p>
      <p>
       So obviously you are going to do absolutely fucking nothing. Not one single fucking thin will you do to prevent this because you're a lazy piece of shit who would rather watch TV.

       He doesn't play games, and as such, doesn't pick teams. You're falling for a false dichotomy playing on your emotions. It usually comes from a desire for delivered superiority. Knowing is half the battle, though. Take this dissonance as a learning experience.

       No, he does not. I know that you must think me a fool, and so, instead, I will use the words of my betters: Bertrand Russel once said, when asked what the greatest truth he knew from a lifetime of genuine seeking, "Love is wise; hatred is foolish".

       It's been a slow incremental process of him revealing himself as a conservative shill. Only calling out corruption on one side. And propping up the other. Leading us Into the fire...

       I think calling him a conservative shill says more about you, than about him.

       CIA and support for Israel have always been tied to conservatives

       That's why your post makes little to no sense.

       seriously, everyone jumping on Assange just doesn't realize they are the ones with internal bias they don't realize. he hasn't changed, you just give the liberal establishment credit they don't deserve and use "ohh the republicans and Trump are just as bad" as a way to avoid admitting it

       Assange has no boner for Trump dude, he wants the truth, and its not his fault that nobody has dirt on Trump. I really honestly dont think there is any, and if there was he already admitted to it (utilizing bankruptcy for gains) which is really petty compared to the shit we are seeing currently being exposed on the left side (clintons). The reason this is so huge is because it seems the loudest voices (celebs &amp;msm) combined with the left have claimed to be so perfect and innocent in any wrong doing during the 2016 election while bashing Trump, and independent media (alex jones) even though both of them said things that have both been proven to be wrong/right. Basically all the bullshit accusations the left have been pushing on America for the last 12 months is blowing up in their faces and it is great, the truth will be revealed people, dont listen to the msm and the false narrative.
