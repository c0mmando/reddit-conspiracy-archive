       There are quite a few questionable Peace prizes being awarded (Especially under Thorbjørn Jagland) but Kissinger's prize was, at the time, in line with the criteria listed in Alfred Nobel's testament. It is not a vetting of a person as a good and decent human being or a suggestion that everything they do is good but a recognition of participation in (at least) one of three activities:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The reduction of standing armies
       </li>
       <li>

       <li>

       NPR did a lighthearted comedy segment about GWHB couching their language with such apologetic excuses for him saying a bunch of old men were products of their time, grandfatherly "former President and war hero", and putting the emphasis on a corny joke he supposedly uses when grabbing asses.  Incidentally, they also referred to Trump as an "equal opportunity bad man" for not liking Comey and normalized the idea of giving up your expectation for privacy at home by allowing Amazon delivery men to place packages indoors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's always so fascinating to note when old public figures are paraded back into the limelight to defend against or distract from a story or promote an agenda.

       It really is depressing.  I hoped with Obama leaving office the anti-war left would pop up and scream for Trump to get us out of these wars that Bush got us into, just totally ignore Obama.  I don't care if they're hypocritical as long as people aren't dying over this nonsense anymore.  Of course the only thing the media praises Trump for is throwing bombs at deserts and because Obama just continued Bush's foreign policy it's officially approved, Bush wasn't wrong, we were.  Makes me so sad, getting out of these wars was my only hope from Trump winning.

       Anyone that lauds GWB is a dipshit. He delivered some of the worst years our country has ever seen. I seriously hope to god that I never have to live through worse. His tenure as President was a total shit-show: terrorist attack that in all  likelihood could have been prevented if his cabinet listened to the CIA and an oil price spike a fucked up housing market culminating in the worst market crash since WWII and a shitty and unnecessary war that has hamstrung the economic opportunity for the current generation.  He was so bad and his tenure was so crappy that the country elected Obama.

       Yeah that's all valid and stuff, but think of it this way: while he may have instituted an illegal surveillance state and started a war of aggression that killed (at a minimum) hundreds of thousands of innocent people, I just

       I don't know. Has been a few of these GWB posts around lately and the comments are mostly positive. Seems like a bit of a divide in opinion where US folks are positive and rest are negative.

       I've seen an explosion of pro-Bush posts in the last month all heavily upvoted all with similar comments in the threads about how he 'had a good heart' and 'was misled by his advisors' some even seem to have the same links to chat shows he was on where he 'showed he was a nice guy outside of politics'. The worst was one where he was being praised for his reaction to Katrina.
I'll look into the accounts tomorrow, should be obvious if they're from a PR company. It could just be young people romanticising past presidents becuase of Trump, but if I was Bush I'd pick this fantastic opportunity of an unpopular president to hire a PR company to whitewash my past.

       No kidding, I've seen the same. I find it quite bizarre cause Bush was seeing Trump-level hate both during and after his presidency. I suppose the old "distance makes the heart grow fonder" applies but it's insane he's now seen as this cute little harmless painter

       More like "an enemy of my enemy is my friend".   The MSM's been gaga over W since he made those anti-Trump comments (nationalism bad, globalism good).  It's all political theater and Trump's not on the playbill.

       Probably a little of A and a little of B. A lot of these morons aren't old enough to remember what it was like when Bush was president, or they were teenagers who didn't care but hated him cause it was trendy. But yes, agreed

       That's new? I've usually only seen negative stuff about that hell hole. I disagree with Reddit on most subjects but I thought everyone here could get behind fuck Saudi Arabia for so many reasons.

       I feel like it's mostly people who are seeing dubya as a well intentioned person who surrounded himself with a toxic cabinet of advisors. Which is not a crazy opinion on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people haven't read up on his and his family ties to the saudis, or his grandfathers ties to the 3rd Reich, or his think-tank's PNAC, or the weird rumors surrounding his involvement in the fraternity "skull and bones."
      </p>
      <p>
       For most people, it is probably easy to see him as a well intentioned man who surrounded himself with bad advisors if you don't know about his upbringing and family history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to play devils advocate, he actually
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a good, well intentioned man who surrounded himself with bad advisors at the direction/advice of his presidential father, or The influences of his grandfather and friends, maybe he actually wanted to be the change he wanted to see in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't think that is the case, but it's possible. And I think that's where the sudden positive view of him on Reddit is coming from.

       I think the consensus is still that he was a shit president, but just like Carter and other shit presidents, as the years go on you start to look at them as people who cared and still care about the country and did what they believed was right, even if they were flat out wrong.

       Because people weren't upvoting the picture, they were upvoting the words in the picture.  Wholesomememes is a place for wholesome discussion and shared things, not a place to bicker and bitch.  The quote in the picture fits perfectly with the sub, but the bitching and whining does not.  I support them locking the thread because it's not a place to discuss politics.

       Yes, the source matters. They're making it political by choosing to feature and defend horrible leaders. Of the millions of wholesome quotes to choose from, you pick one from Bush? You can't separate the individual from the crime.  There is no way to rehabilitate any Bush, so knock it off.

       I agree.  While Trump's administration hasn't been as harmful (yet), I think his election and presidency have pushed this country's attitudes toward free press, and political service in a dangerous direction.

       The Iraq War, Afghan War (still), the Patriot act, wall street bailouts, Dick Cheney and all the neoconservatives that surrounded his presidency.  The effects of the Bush administration are still being felt today and will take a long time to recover from, if ever.  Trump is terrible but he doesn't even come close to the damage Bush did.

       I think it makes sense. A lot of people using Reddit were kids while Bush jr was president. People often think of their childhoods as a simpler time. So, emotionally, these people may be more inclined to view him positively. Regardless of the facts of his presidency.

       No, Trump's actually very likable.  His charisma was a huge part of how he got into the presidency.  If you want to find the most unlikable men on the planet, turn your attention to Ted Cruz (so unlikable even his republican coworkers can't stand him), or Martin Skreli (who they had trouble finding a jury for in his recent white collar crime trial because even jurors who had no idea who he was took one look at him and said things like "that's a snake").
      </p>
      <p>
       You can argue that Trump is a liar, that he's unprepared for his role, that he's a narcissist, that he's easily manipulated by those around him, but you can't honestly argue that he's unlikable.  People who spend time with him state that he's actually fun to be around, and his voters loved him during his rallies.

       Sure, he’s unpopular as a politician, but in order to win the presidency you have to have some air of likability.  Candidates who lack this, like Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton, don’t win the country’s biggest popularity contest.  And yea, Clinton won her primary but that was through media influence and dirty procedural tricks, not because people liked her.

       I have to agree with this.  I'm far from a Trump supporter but the guy is likable.  I watched about 20 minutes of the Republican debates and the guy was
       <em>
        by far
       </em>
       the most likable guy on the stage, and the only one saying anything that sounded even remotely authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to admit it was rather fun watching him humiliate Jeb Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously - the reason Trump is in office is because the rest of the Republican candidates were utterly without charisma. I remember thinking "how the fuck did these guys become leaders?"

       Yeah, actually. Trump’s election represents the absolute rejection of the political status quo by the American voters. Whether or not he’s what we wanted is secondary to the fact that he’s a walking middle finger.

       For those who don't feel like following the rabbit hole for ten minutes: The source is self-reported from Social Media, by people who have been hit by these strikes, and by non-profits (while a list of the NGO's is available, their sources/reports are not), and from "Martyr Facebook Pages."

       Their page links to a source on The Daily Beast, which links back to Airwars, which links to a source page that says their kill counts come from social media posts by those affected, Martyr Facebook Pages, and NGO's operating in the area. They didn't actually list the militaries of either the Coalition or Russians as a source - could just be an inconsistency.

       From their site:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Airwars draws on a wide range of sources. These can include international and local news agencies and NGOs; and more fragmentary social media sites including local residents’ groups, Facebook pages (for examples martyrs’ pages), YouTube footage of incidents, and tweets relating to specific events. On occasion we also include links to militant and terrorist propaganda sources which are directly pertinent to an event. These are always clearly marked as such.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also collate reports from regionally-focused monitoring groups which can include:
Syrian Network for Human Rights
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
Syria Violations Documentation Center
Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently
Iraq Body Count
UN Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI)
Bellingcat (geolocation of strikes)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They don't say anything about Coalition military or Russians; the closest I see is "militant and terrorist propaganda."

       Nope, not yet.  The rhetoric is alarming though.  Standing in the UN and throwing out insults like 'Rocket Man' or blathering on about 'fire and fury' is not a good sign though.

       Let's hope that things don't get bad enough domestically that the only option they see is a foreign war to help galvanise support.

       North Korea has had a mutual defense treaty with China since 1961. Recently China has publicly restated their position:
      </p>
      <p>
       If NK attacks anyone, NK is on their own. If the US attacks NK, China will honor its mutual defense treaty with NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the people in the Pentagon and the deep state -- the people who really control things -- are going to let Trump start a war with China?

       Obama was certainly a war monger:  Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. Bombed more countries than Bush. Trump hasn't ended any of these operations.

       I think that kind of narrative plays right in to the kind of thinking this subreddit generally tries to avoid.  Red vs. Blue.  Black and white.  What if I support strong property laws, but also some gun control, and also gay marriage, but not all the multi-gender stuff?  There's no room for me in the conversation, because both sides often reject me.

       I think you hit it on the head. I was 6 on 9/11. Sure, I remember that, but I don't remember much of what life was actually like with GW as president. I didn't care about politics at all until like 2 years after he left office.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much harder to realize what he did unless you lived through it at the time. Reading back on it just doesn't do it justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       So today, when he makes a criticism I agree with, none of his past life comes to my mind because I didn't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       live through it and it's just distant history in my mind, which isn't right, but just how my brain processes it.

       Bush didn't kill a million people. Also, the majority of civilian causalities in the Iraq war are a direct result of the civil war. Are you claiming that the US provided material support to death squads in Iraq? That'd be real news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse resulted in actual convictions, and likely wasn't at request of the president.

       Rumsfield, I think, is probably a war criminal for Abu Ghraib. That's the difference.

      <p>
       The fact that a million civilians died in a war isn't the same thing as a war crime. There's a shit ton of Iraqi politicians that probably committed crimes against humanity. You're not going to see prosecution for obvious reasons. It was a dirty war and everyone knows that, but it wasn't a war of aggression.

       I feel exactly the same way!  I was 9, so I was definitely aware enough to realize my country had been attacked, and I was old enough for that to scare me.  My perception of GWB was just a kind, goofy father figure, taking us to war against the bad men.

       They were looking for any way to get Saddam H and they used the 9/11 attacks as that means.  Bush was just as bad as the others.  There was even an interesting video posted of Bush Jr's speeches as a politician prior to taking office compared to those once he became President.  It was kind of a stark contrast and seems if he was drugged up or the puppeteer rope was tightened up considerably.

       Glad I was old enough to start forming actual opinions during HW's time.  I watched his "crusade against terror" speech live in my undergraduate college's theater.  The term "crusade" was deliberately chosen at the time, despite them trying to walk it back the next day.  They wanted to inflame tensions.  The whole lot are a bunch of warmongering dipshits who don't care how many innocents die in their lust for power.  And I include all the presidents since nixon in that warmongering dipshits quote.

       When will they see that all these presidents are scrubs, including Trump?  Why keep having the same families rule the US?  The Bushes, the Clintons, etc.  I bet more Clintons and Bushes run down the line and probably the Obama chicks.  Seems like the only reason people keep supporting them is because they blindly follow rep or dem.

       How isn't a former POW who was held under horrific conditions including being deprived of medical treatment, food and water, placed on solitary, and tortured relentlessly without giving out any intel for almost 6 years, and refusing being released unless his fellow americans in the camp were released as well, a hero?

       There's plenty in his background and track record as a politician that detracts from the idea that he has all of our best interests in mind. There's also the highly questionable reasoning for the US invading Vietnam, making "what he fought for" less noble than, say, a WWII Pearl Harbor survivor. He deserves respect and admiration for his actions and sacrifices. But "hero" isn't a word an Iraqi orphan would use.

       I don't agree with the reasoning behind the Vietnam war either and I'm not his biggest fan when it comes to politics, but that doesn't mean he isn't a war hero for us or makes his actions any less noble. What he did there goes way beyond whatever the thought process the government went through to justify that war imo. A iraqi orphan wouldn't consider Charles de Gaulle a hero either, but he really is war a hero for the french, regardless of whether or not they agree with his politics.

       They actually deleted all comments critical of George Bush and muted anyone who PM'd them about it.

       Copy of my post from elsewhere about discussion I had with a mod about censoring comments
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm now banned, the reason they cited was me making this comment
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Funny I sent this to the mods after seeing they deleted any negative comments about bush
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         So you've deleted negative comments about bush because it's a wholesome community, using that logic a post about something nice hitler said would have any comments that criticise hitler deleted because they're negative?
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        They muted me for 72 hours, which is fucking hilarious considering the mod comment in that thread says
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         If you have any questions about this, or want to discuss further, please shoot us a PM. We are happy to talk.

       <p>
        By happy to talk they obviously mean agree with them.

       Personally, I thought they'd ban me for saying Nazi's weren't all bad because they dressed nice, Henry kissenger had a good heart, or Ted Bundy wasn't all bad because he had nice hair. Maybe they're considered wholesome?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit - lmao just got this PM from a mod
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Listen, as you're one of the very people from r/all I was referring to,
        <strong>
         I truly hope that whatever it is in your life that makes you feel as if it's appropriate to post things like "nazis had great fashion sense, they weren't all bad"
        </strong>
        gets resolved that that one day you can rejoin our lovely community as a wholesome member. In the meantime you should really maybe take some time off to reflect on your actions and the person you're being.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How is it even possible to not understand that that comment is a direct mocking of the comments they allowed in the Bush thread..
      </p>
      <p>
       edit 2 - mod followed up telling me 'most of the comments deleted were trolling or provoking arguments', I said 'so not all then? and asked for a screenshot of the deleted comment logs and I'd apologise if I was wrong, mod said I was 'clearly not here for a discussion of the situation'

       They did the same thing with their Obama post.  No mention of funding terrorists or destroying Libya allowed.  Especially not funding Nazis, I don't think you can bring that up anywhere or you somehow become a Nazi.

       Congress agreed unanimously to prevent aid from going to Nazis and other extremists, of course.  Voting against would have been political suicide.  BUT!  The amendment's sponsors withdrew it after getting pressure or incentives, possibly both.  This is 100% on Obama.  If he wanted the amendment to pass, a single mention to the press would have guaranteed passage.  The problem was he was helping Nazis AND sunni extremists, being the neocon FP lackey that he was.
If you want proof of the fact that the MSM is nearly completely bought, notice their almost unanimous cooperation with the administration in keeping this entire affair silent.  This should have been bigger than Watergate, and it all happened right in public view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, they later worked out a deal with Ukraine.  The neo Nazi Azov battalion was given regular army status, and congress passed another amendment banning aid specifically to the Azov battalion, instead of neonazis and extremists in general.  No problem because, officially,  there is no more azov battalion.  I have been called a Nazi nearly every time I bring this up on reddit, and downvoted to oblivion every time.

       I was banned from there for criticizing a pic of Obama as wholesome.  It was a pic of he and Michelle at their wedding with no text, implying that they are wholesome.  I didn't agree that someone who funds terrorists and starts unnecessary wars is wholesome.

       And people say that Shareblue don't exist. People in this sub even boldly state CTR doesn't exist despite the massive evidence and political climate shifts overnight. I mean come on, the liberal media treated Bush like they did Trump. Not as bad, but still constant bashing and hit pieces etc. Now they want everyone to love him when he spoke out against Trump?

       Exist in the fact that there's 24/7 roaming groups of down voters/forum sliders attempting to high jack not only conversation, but entire subs through established mod removal. There are absolutely people claiming that Shareblue doesn't do this, and that CTR didn't either.

       People don't have a context in this scenario. Both Bush's are beloved in Texas. Heck, they named an airport for Bush. The Houston Astros are in the World Series, why not celebrate with 2 local heroes? To me it makes perfect sense. W has thrown out the first pitch before.

       Honestly who fucking cares? This is a private website where us the user's have no control over anything. This is not new info, we all know this so what's the problem. If "someone" wants to censore stuff then let them. The user's that are upset over the censorship can easily just move on to another website where they can talk about his warcrimes. Now if the whole internet was censoring all conversations about bush so people could not talk about warcrimes then there would be a conspiracy. But that's not happening. So pull up your big boy pants, accept the fact this is a private website that can censor whatever they want and either move on to another website or hang out here and stop being upset and shocked when when conversations on the website are controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really though what would it matter to bush is people on reddit could openly discuss the warcrimes he is accused of? It would not effect bush in the slightest. So since it would not effect bush at all then why would the post be locked for the purpose of not allowing users to talk about warcrimes?

       The worst about this is locking comments so no one can remind people or tell those who were too young at the time what this man really was. I mean, really really, what he was, was a puppet. I have no doubt that Dubya had a terrible childhood, was probably abused in all kinds of twisted satanic rituals, sodomized by his father's friends and what have you, and was basically broken and stitched back together to be the perfect puppet zombie President to hail the new millennium, preside over 9/11 and be the fall guy should anything go wrong. Part of me even feels a little bit bad for him. I mean, look at his parents. I've never seen such clear radiation of evil.
      </p>

       But still, it's sick that the well documented war crimes he committed are being wiped out of collective memory. I mean, at least in the UK Tony Blair is still reviled, no matter how often they try to wheel him back out as though he's some nostalgic symbol of better times - people scream war criminal at him, including members of parliament and the new leader of the party he once led.

       So true George Bush should be in prison right now and his father. His father attacks Iraq in the 90s George Bush Jr gets into power makes up a fake story that Sadam has nuclear weapons, starts a war kills thousands hangs Sadam the suprise suprise no nuclear weapons. Then he starts installing fear on the public with "mass terror threats" the news promote the hell out of it. This is all even without bringing the world trade towers into it. Bush is the real terrorist it's sad to say but he has made a lot of the world dislike USA and the uk

       Bush was a lame duck president until 9/11 happened. Then that kicked off the war of terror that literally destroyed the middle east. Chuck in some imaginary WMDs and all the torture. Pretty dark time for the west.

       That's some pretty good shit your smoking there bud, either that or you don't know the definition of "Lame Duck". Bush was only President for 9 months when 9/11 happened. Lame Duck refers to a President or an elected official that is in the last year of their term usually with the opposing party in control of Congress.

       His poll numbers were collapsing? Really? Do you know anything that's correct? First of all poll numbers don't mean shit. You don't take a poll and elect a new President there junior. This ain't a popularity contest, this ain't high school. I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself, please name one speech Bush gave in the first nine months in office that he made a fool of himself and what did he say?

       Can I name a speech off the top of my head? No, you are talking about 16 years or ago or so. But his entire time as president was littered with examples of him making a complete fool of himself in speeches.

       I can say the same for Obama. Lauded as some eloquent statesman but just a stuttering idiot. If it wasn't on the teleprompter he couldn't spit it out. If you go back and see any off the cuff interview, he stuttered every answer. I guess the fake Harvard education couldn't fix his speech impediment.

       How stupid do people have to be to realise it's not a political discussion sub, it's an excellent quote from one of the most influential people of our time and you guys are calling it a conspiracy. It doesn't matter what you think of him that's not what the fucking post is about.

       As I already mentioned down further:
These Redditos I'm referring to are products of a university system that is heavily infested with Marxist sympathizing - or outright Marxist- Professors and educators. 
The fact they are supporting Bush AND Obama with equal vigor should tell you something. This isn't a Dem vs R conflict.

       Yeah, actually. Trump’s election represents the absolute rejection of the political status quo by the American voters. Whether or not he’s what we wanted is secondary to the fact that he’s a walking middle finger.
