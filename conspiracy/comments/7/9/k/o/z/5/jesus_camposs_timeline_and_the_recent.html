        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the break down of Jesus&#39;s Campos&#39;s time line since the 1st week.  I intentionally left out the Tucker stuff because I&#39;m not aware he&#39;s released those documents... I don&#39;t like anonymous sources... Especially if you have the documents.  Please add more to the timeline if I&#39;m missing things, I hope you do, thanks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>10/02/17: <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/10/02/las-vegas-gunman-shot-at-swat-team-through-hotel-room-door/">The Las Vegas shooter spent his last minutes desperately firing through the doorway of his hotel room while a SWAT team stormed into the suite. Stephen Paddock shot one security guard and fired on a SWAT team of six who searched the hotel floor by floor Sunday night before zeroing in on their target.</a></p></li>
<li><p>10/05/17: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/us/security-guard-las-vegas-hotel/index.html">After being shot, Campos spoke with police officers at 10:18 p.m., <strong>giving them the shooter&#39;s exact room</strong> and key pass.</a></p></li>
<li><p>10/06 - 10/08 - Campos went to Mexico according to Campos&#39;s lawyer.</p></li>
<li><p>10/09/17: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-20171009-story.html">the gunman shot a <strong>hotel security guard six minutes before opening fire on a country music concert</strong> — raising new questions about why police weren’t able to pinpoint the gunman’s location sooner.</a></p></li>
<li><p>10/12/17 <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-mandalay-20171012-story.html">“We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or <strong>within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio</strong>,” the company, which owns Mandalay Bay, said in a statement.</a></p></li>
<li><p>10/12/17: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/13/las-vegas-security-guard-jesus-campos-disappears-moments-before-tv-interviews.html">Campos dodges 5 interviews</a>, ABC reporter (not Fox reporter, but only Fox reports about the tweets) calls it out on twitter and he disappears for 6 days.</p></li>
<li><p>10/13/17: <strong>Las Vegas authorities have revised the timeline</strong> of the mass shooting, <a href="http://ktla.com/2017/10/13/las-vegas-police-agree-with-hotel-that-guard-was-shot-40-seconds-before-45-victims-still-being-hospitalized/">saying Stephen Paddock shot a hotel security guard around the time he began firing on the crowd</a>, not six minutes earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>10/18/17: (my interpretation of interview) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7gj1FoRIfE&amp;amp;t=2m15s">Interview with Ellen</a>, says he hears drilling noise after finding door secured (<strong>after shooting started</strong> this is after 17 days of the police &amp; MGM going back and forth) walked down hallways away from room, get&#39;s shot, finds cover, calls in to the police that <strong>shots had been fired</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>10/21/17: NYT releases their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000005473328/las-vegas-shooting-timeline-12-bursts.html?smid=tw-share">audio analysis of the shooting based off of videos</a> saying Campos was shot between the 2nd &amp; 3rd burst.</p></li>
<li><p>10/28/17: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/latimes/mandalay-bay-security-guard-reports-las-vegas-shooting">Audio of Campos&#39;s radio transmission</a>.  Take a listen, he is calm and cool... Even sounds like he is right outside the room and reading the room number off the wall.</p></li>
<li><p>10/30/17: <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/mgm-paying-for-hotel-stay-for-las-vegas-shooting-witness-jesus-campos/">Campos, who has had trouble sleeping since the shooting, left Las Vegas for Mexico on Oct. 6 to spend time with family members there and returned the evening of Oct. 8, Flansburg said. Campos returned to an MGM property when he came back and was still being housed by the company as of Thursday afternoon.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Has MGM or the Police decided on the timeline? Was it during the shooting, or before... Or after the shooting like you said for a full week after?  It doesn&#39;t add up.  They had 17 days to interview Jesus Campos.  Just some food for thought! Cheers  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all depends on what timeline you believe.</p>

<p>Remember  - Initially police said Campos wasn&#39;t shot when he met officers and then Lombardo said Campos got &quot;seperated&quot; and shot in the process of evacuating/clearing rooms.
You can&#39;t just change that timeline to well actually he was already shot when officers encountered him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not something that requires great investigation to figure out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it funny how in the Land of the Free, journalist&#39;s aren&#39;t allowed to ask the Sheriff questions about the biggest mass shooting in US modern history.. lil weird don&#39;t ya think?</p>

<p>Who remembers the press conference where Lombardo said &quot; i dont know - well i do know but i don&#39;t want to tell you&quot;</p>

<p>Or when asked &quot; did the shooter have an escape plan&quot; and Lombardo very confidently very quickly said &quot; YES&quot; , then when asked how he knows he pursed his lips shut tight and said &quot;i cant say&quot;   - Why the fuck can you not say how you know he planned to escape, the guy is DEAD, he can&#39;t escape anymore ? </p>

<p>Wtf is going on, everybody more worried about some shit from 30 years ago or suprised that some hollywood mogul has been touching people ( like thats some sort of secret ) </p>
