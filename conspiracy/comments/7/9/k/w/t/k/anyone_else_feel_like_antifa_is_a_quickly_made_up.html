    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not in my nature. But I try to look at the whole picture. The young man also had mental problems, and I worked in that field for years. I&#39;m not sure it happened in the way it&#39;s presented to us, for one thing. I wonder why the purple van was there earlier, but blocked the street before the protesters went that way, for one thing. There are some things that don&#39;t make sense about the whole thing. I really do think both sides were funded by the same people. And I&#39;ve noticed in the past, agencies like the CIA aren&#39;t above using young people with mental problems for their own purposes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe their movement/ ideology got hijacked, which is something that happens to both sides.  Trump&#39;s &quot;alt-right&quot; started as pro-nationalism and culturally liberal. But the media turned their nationalism into &quot;white nationalism&quot; and painted them as &quot;far right.&quot;</p>

<p>So now it&#39;s not that there&#39;s a bunch of ppl &quot;afraid&quot; to come out. It&#39;s that their name got hijacked and they don&#39;t identify as anything close to what the media has successfully labeled them as. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name one person ever killed or seriously injured by antifa.</p>

<p>On the flip side, there have been <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/6ap0wf/racist_has_a_bad_day_bonus_mugshot/dhh8olw/">dozens of people</a> killed just in the last year by white supremacists and the alt-right.</p>

<p>When I used to go to a lot of protests, antifa used to piss me off, because some of them would &quot;get unruly&quot;.  I realized however at a a certain point that they were much better at obeying the law than the friggen <em>police</em> who went out of their way to flaunt the fact that they could do whatever they like, and that in fact antifa as a whole was extreme disciplined and decent humans.</p>

<p>White supremacists and out-and-out Nazis have reappeared in America.  The antifa organizations are responding to them in a fashion that the police will not - note that the few people who smashed windows in Charlottesville are facing far more time in jail than the fascist who deliberately ran over and killed a person! - and I&#39;m proud to be on their side.</p>

<p>These people have loud voices and lots of grand plans and visions, but no actual plan to get there. No infrastructure. No cross-population support. None of the menial, grueling groundwork set up to achieve their goals. No actual real plan in place beyond “do the thing”.</p>

<p>It all rests on their belief that “i’m right and people around me think like me therefore most people think like me... we’re totally going to do the thing!”</p>

<p>I don’t like Antifa. I don’t hate them, but I don’t like them. They seem poorly organized. Loud. Obnoxious. Self-righteous and, unfortunately, just as willing to use violence, repression and intimidation to fight the threat of violent, repressive and intimidation by white nationalist and neo-nazi groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re mostly pathetic looking kids. But there are professional agitators sent in to these protests to fire things up and they aren&#39;t kids. Someone is paying them.  Soros and the deep state would be my guess. Who benefits from this? The people who want to stay in power, but who are being exposed and losing it. We have to stop looking at them like liberals and conservatives. They use both sides, but they are few. They want to continue their wars. They make money arming and funding both sides. They want to continue to go in and rape poor countries of their resources by &quot;nation building.&quot; When our own nation is in need of some funding to prop up our infrastructure, etc. They want to continue to put the squeeze on the rest of us using fear tactics and over-regulation to line their own pockets. That&#39;s our real enemy.</p>

<p>Look at Fredericksburg. Once people destroyed that place, who was there the next day to clean up? The poor locals who had their protest hijacked. The people that lived and worked there didn&#39;t burn those buildings or want that kind of mayhem. If all of these things were &quot;grass roots&quot; you wouldn&#39;t have a business like Crowds on Demand pop up. They pay those people $15 to $25 an hour to be there. But who pays them? Who are they working for?</p>

<p>Fact?  the far-left has a bad problem of getting caught trying to implement shit against the right (<a href="http://bayareanewstalk.com/bart-police-seeking-vandalism-suspect-connected-to-swastikas-racial-slurs-photos/"> link</a> ) So likely every link you have unless proven to be far righters are nothing but Anitfa in disguise. The few I read, said the right wing stuff was put of a few weeks before. </p>

<p>Umm, <a href="http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/05/24/berkeley-college-professor-arrested-as-assault-suspect/">Bike Lock Guy</a> You would hear about more but the cover their faces like cowards. </p>

<p>I hear Antifa, and all I think about is pussies in black attacking private property and trying to attack people protecting the 1st amendment. Thats the only image I have. Nothing before in your golden era. </p>

The first time I met them over 5 years ago they were just hanging out and all discussions were super political/anarchic. The person I met them with had known them since middle school and relayed they had always been like that. They now are leaders of Antifa related orgs who are certainly not being paid to agitate. Agitation is a way of life for them for over a decade. Interestingly, most of them are like many of you who believe all parts of the government are corrupt with no hope to change it without revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM, also. None of these groups would have enough funding to travel to these various protests--in chartered buses--without funding. Who paid for those printed signs? I checked out the white supremacist guy who organized  Charlottesville. He was bragging about having enough money to sue anyone. (And strangely he was an Obama supporter and protested and wrote articles with another man about the Occupy Wall Street movement up until January of this year.) Yet when I looked up the KKK stats on the FBI site, it said there were fewer than 1,000 loosely affiliated members in the entire U.S. They&#39;re watched because they&#39;re considered a hate group. I don&#39;t believe there are huge numbers to any of these groups. But someone is funding all of them to stir up trouble. Most Americans don&#39;t identify with any of these ideas--no matter what their ethnic background. Most of us are just working stiffs who pay our taxes and obey the law--no matter what color our skin is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa, BLM, KKK, they&#39;re all created, promoted, and funded to divide us along arbitrary lines. They all promote violence and hate. </p>

<p>The last peaceful loving group of activists were centered around MLK. He preached love and non-violent non-compliance. And was murdered for it. </p>

<p>If a political/social movement that promotes hate and violence is publicized in mainstream media you can bet your ass they&#39;re funded heavily by billionaires who benefit immensely from our division.</p>
