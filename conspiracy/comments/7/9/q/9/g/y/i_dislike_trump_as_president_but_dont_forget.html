       The Deep State is trying to take down a populist administration. Even though I hate Trump being president.....the fact they are trying to bring out George W Bush as a "grandpa president" everywhere shows they are trying to flip the history narrative.

       It’s just that now there’s a Republican that brings along all of that bullshit and also lacks any sense of class. They’re not saying “GWB was a good president”, they’re saying “even GWB was a better president than this embarrassment”.

       I guess we should only concentrate on one side at a time no matter what crimes were committed by the other, just like TPTB like it. When the Democrats win the next election, we can talk about them but

       Uhhhhhh but only one side is committing crimes here, so yeah. When Dems commit crimes, we can talk about that. Until we do, it's just distractions pushed by Republicans to deflect responsibility.

       If the standard is that actual presidents should be held accountable more than those who lose elections, why is the Republican two-term president/war criminal being canonized these days by the same people going after Trump? I get that he's not in power
       <em>
        anymore

       , but what message is this sending to the guy in the Oval Office who threatened to commit similar war crimes while campaigning?

       Yet this sub is on non stop "yeah Trump butttt.. buttt.. butt Clinton podesta DNC!!!" meanwhile a foreign policy advisor to Trump plee guilty to lying to federal agents, his former campaign and white house aide have been indicted and this post says Clinton and her people are the real bad ones and Trump is the victim.
      </p>

       There's nothing populist about Trump. The deep state didnt make manafort launder money nor did they make trumps advisor lie. Buttery males narrative is old and worn out.

       Bush a REPUBLICAN is trying to white wash his own legacy. Nobody in the DNC is endorsing bush. The fucking Republicans own Bush. They elected him. They put him in office twice because he was a cool guy you could get a drink with, he just a regular Joe, one of us. You fucking morons did the same dumbass shit with Trump and in 8 years from y'all will be saying the shit about Trump you're saying about bush. You idiots never learn

       I'm a Canadian progressive who voted for Trudeau and I think Trump is scum. Why the hell would you assume that "Accountability shouldn't hinge on whether or not it scores political points against the current POTUS" coupled with criticizing George W. Bush means I'm a Trump voter? Easy with the jumping to conclusions.

       There has been a lot of recent praise for GWB among Democrats -- a recent poll showed he now has a favourability rating something like 54% with Democrats if I recall correctly -- as if he was so much better than Trump, and that's
       <em>
        really

       disturbing to me.

       That's exactly the attitude that's so disturbing to me. Bush was absolutely horrible, and nothing Trump has done, however vile, makes starting an illegal war of aggression on fabricated pretences, torturing people, fearmongering to justify systematic erosion of civil liberties, etc. somehow look
       <em>
        good.
       </em>
       It's really creepy to me how Bush's horrific crimes are being normalized just because Trump is an obnoxious clown. Trump isn't (yet) a literal war criminal with the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands. He's got a long way to go if he wants to actually be worse than George W. Bush in any way besides being even more embarrassing for the US's public image.

       It's simple. Most people posting here are in their 20s, and probably barely remember Bush as President and/or were too young to really have an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a decade later, I think most people have made peace with the idea that nothing is going to happen to Bush, so it's (unfortunately) easier for people now to reconcile favorability based on personality rather than his actions as President.

       It boils down to the fact that as dumb as he was, Bush knew how to act as President compared to Trump. Bush was far more willing to uphold US diplomatic consistency compared to Trump, which is very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush never made us question whether we were going to deploy nuclear weapons within a year, unlike Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush chose to be a unifier by responding with compassion to US muslims after 9/11, unlike Trump, who wanted to make a registry of them...talk about Orwellian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush never attacked the judiciary like Trump either. Trump doesn't respect the sovereignty of the branches of government. AKA the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is down with the Establishment, just like Bush. His SoS is the fucking Exxon CEO. Trump just seems really, really unstable. He lies all the time, way more than Bush. As bad as Bush is, he's more trustworthy than Trump. That's why people like me are appreciating him more. Though he could be viewed as a war criminal...shows you how dangerous Trump is.

       Its kind of hard to compare the two. Yes the invasion of Iraq was awful, but Trump hasnt had a 9-11 either. Give him an excuse like that who knows what he would pull.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of them are very smart, both are over confident. But Bush hasnt been accused of cheating or abusing his wife. He has never bragged about sexually assaulting women. He never mocked a disabled reporter. Trump has, he has shown an obvious mean streak. He has show a tendancy to hold grudges and seek revenge over pety differences. He is callous towards greiving military families. Trunp bragged about bribing politicians. Trump is so much more than an obnoxious clown, this has made it hard for him to acheive his agenda. And hopefully he isnt allowed to.

       I would have said no before the election. Now, after he hired soros for our immigration policy and gave 240m$ from taxpayer money to the Clinton Foundation, I want his head on a fucking pike.

       My only goal in 2015 was making sure Harper didn't get another term after all the damage he'd done. So I voted for the party that was polling strongest against the Conservatives. In retrospect, I'd like to have voted NDP since I think the country would have been better off with a Liberal minority that had to work with other parties. But despite the things I'm furious with Trudeau about (
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       his broken promise to end first-past-the-post -- unforgivable), I'm not going to regret helping oust corrupt fearmonger Stephen Harper. Not in a million years.

       Trudeau paid 10 million $ to someone who made videos on how to build a bomb, was a terrorist, killed an American, would have killed a lot more if he could, tried to pay the guy secretly without anyone knowing and now he is angry and says he is investigating to punish the leaker.

       Bush is getting praise for going against his own party because it demonstrates that accusations against Trump aren't just political theatre from liberals and that it's not just about people being blinded by their liberal bias against Trump.  Trump is doing the same thing against Bush even though there's not a whole lot of ideological difference between the two men. It's not that liberals or the MSM particularly like Bush.  It's that Bush disliking Trump makes Trump seem even worse than Bush.

       Who is really gaslighting who here? That article is neither nonpartisan nor well researched. It insinuates to the reader that a Saudi Arabian could only be donating money to elicit political favor, or for some otherwise nefarious ends. I know it's popular for some to be cynical to the point of absurdity on this sub, but the undertones reek of unabashed xenophobia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The editorializing incorrectly conflates what the average person views as the relative worth of $10 or $25 million dollars, and projects that view onto a global non-profit, and then again onto Saudi royalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       While life-changing to the average person, that is simply not an earth shattering amount of money for an organization with over $500 million in assets, and it's a literal drop in the bucket for a wealthy Saudi.
      </p>
      <p>
       After 9/11, Al-Waleed Bin Talal wrote Rudy Giuliani a $10000000 check. That stinks of something sinister until you realize his net worth is $32 billion dollars. To put that in perspective, it would be the equivalent of someone with $5000 giving away $1.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be noted that the only reason anyone knows of these high profile donors is because that information is publicly disclosed. It certainly isn't a product of diligent research, unless that's what kids are calling a two second Google search these days. Financial disclosures are a requirement for 501(c) non-profits, however, someone recently introduced an amendment to remove this legal requirement for "reasons"...

       Gee, if only there were some group of conspiracy minded individuals who could suss out the impetus behind this questionable legislation. Unfortunately, this would requires paying attention to what people are actually doing, as opposed to what they are imagined of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone wants to know how much money is going in and out of the Clinton Foundation, you don't need a crash course on corporate espionage. You can look at Form 990 of their IRS filing and yearly financial statements. They are available online to anyone, and are exhaustively detailed. Far more than they are even legally required to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said the Politifact article misses the forest for the trees. That is an apt turn of phrase, given the bizarre obsession some have with Hillary, which still drives them to perpetually ignore the evidential mountain of net good CF does in an effort to extract one single scrap of incriminating dirt from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's outright comical at this point. If a multi-million dollar opp-research team couldn't uncover actionable wrongdoing in the midst of a US general election 12 months ago, why are people still beating that drum? I don't even get it. At this point it looks less like Woodward and Bernstein and more like Captain Ahab.

       This is a good point though. I do not understand the obsession with trying to indict Hillary. I voted for her but if she got indicted I would not give two fucks. I would be happy that our legal system was able to capture a criminal that high up on the pole. Right now retarded Trump supporters want Hillary indicted just to settle a score. If she gets indicted then what ? ... Trump wins , he's already won. He's already in a position to set policy but he fucking sucks at it. He fucking sucks at being president so these morons put Hillary in the White House in their imaginations. She is over , she is done with I hope she does get indicted just because she ran such a shitty fucking campaign. That fact that she lost to Trump speaks volumes about her credibility. To summarize its possible to be a democrat and have voted for Hillary but to also feel no emotional connection to her because why the fuck would I ? I like her policies not her. Which really makes the whole Donald Trump masturbation fan club R/The_Donald so strange to me ... why are all these people on reddit trying to have sex with the president he's not even slightly attractive.

       Hillary Clinton literally wronged me personally when she colluded with the DNC to rig their primaries and shit on a candidate that I donated money to. I hope she rots in a cell for the rest of her life and I don't give two shits about what happens to Trump.

       I hate Clinton. I despise her. I think she is pure evil.

       Trump, I honestly don't care about him. He seems like a controlled asset.

       It boils down to the two party system. Simultaneously both political parties have been able to shut down any sort of opposition besides the two, all while being in the same bed. As a result they obtained the power they have today.  The two parties should just be remanded to “this or that”.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because of the fact there’s two parties, it makes the people focus more on the competition aspect rather than seeing the purpose of the campaigns. Campaigning has become a sport; nothing but ads, merchandise, and large venues.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no real discussion allowed with a two party system.

       Nobody - okay, let's say a very very small minority of people - view Clinton as a saint. That's just a strawman Republicans fight, to make their worship of Trump - sorry, the GEOTUS - seem defensible.
