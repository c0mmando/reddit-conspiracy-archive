    <div class="md"><p>Yeah same here. I have a mild distaste for Trump. He’s probably not a good guy, but I doubt he’s at Clinton level of corruption. Possibly the cleanest President we’ve had in a while just by only being billionaire American dirty. Kind of sad.</p>

<p>It’s dumb how you can’t say anything about either without being accused of being a supporter of the other one. I didn’t vote for either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and it sucks to be in this position.  We are here because previous generations were duped into accepting the Federal Reserve and having politicians owned and controlled by the bankers.  Do you we do something about it now or do we pass the problem to future generations?  </p>

<p>I personally think that Trump is doing much better than I expected.  I thought he would accept a huge bribe by now and start singing the praises of the New World Order.  When this happens, the MSM will magically start praising Trump.  I see no indication of any of this.  </p>

<p>We have not had a President stand up to the New World Order globalists since Carter.  Before Carter, it was JFK.  I think the situation is much different for us now because we can control the narrative, which scares the shit out of them.  We are also not the naive people that were around in 1963.  Maybe I should not say that.  They woke up because of the Warren Report bullshit and Vietnam, but then they went back to sleep in the late 70&#39;s.  If they only would have kept pushing...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way the question is asked gave me a great idea for an ESPN show. </p>

<p>&quot;Clinton in the outfield asking for some dirt on Donald Trump, but oh what is that, noone has ever done that in the history of corruptionball, selling uranium supplies to Russia!!! The crowd goes wild as the jurors raise their gradesigns. Juror one only rewards her with a 7 which promptly makes the crowd go silent again. But what&#39;s that Trump is nearing the goal with an absolute shocker: Hiring a foreign agent, by god that is brilliant. Jimmy what do you think? Well I think the jurors cannot give anything lower than a perfect score if I&#39;m being honest with you Martin, this is sentational stuff, we&#39;re watching history being written! We await the results, but first a message to our sponsor. This edition of corruptionball is sponsored by Miller Lite, the only way to eat, drink and watch some good ol&#39; sports....&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easily Trump. It&#39;s looking more and more likely that his greed for money and power, of trying to buy success led him to Russia for loans and more corrupt dealings.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been in with mafia guys in NYC, but he stepped up to the majors with Putin.</p>

<p>The fact that a country hostile to the US was able to buy such influence, and conduct so much open crimes against us is frightening. </p>

<p>How many other countries are doing the same thing to destabilize and take advantage over people in the US? Of turning us against each other and pushing race, religious and class divisions to keep us from realizing the corruption that has festered for decades?</p>

<p>We may never know the full details of what has been accomplished.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think killing 10s to 100s of thousands of civilians in foreign wars wins out over financial greed. Not to say Clinton doesn&#39;t also excel in that arena. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no fan of either, but Clinton&#39;s tenure as Sec. of State is mired with war crimes and shady shady shit. I really think she wins the trophy for &quot;Worst&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, what you&#39;ve stated about &quot;turning us against each other and pushing... divisions to keep us from realizing the corruption...&quot; - our own government has been doing a great job of that for years. I&#39;m not saying foreign powers HAVEN&#39;T been doing the same here, but the US govt doesn&#39;t really need help from outside sources.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the US govt has a proven track record of destabilizing the ever loving SHIT out of other countries. So, if other countries have finally decided to try their hand at some reciprocation, well I can&#39;t fault them for fair play.</p>

<p>I think all the corporate favors Trump gets caught doing she would have done the same yet gotten away with it more often. Add to that the fact she wanted to impose a &quot;no fly&quot; zone on Syria against Russia and you have to wonder how much military muscle we would have needed to flex in order to enforce a no fly zone over a sovereign nation state and against one of the most powerful militaries ever and invited as an ally by Syria. Not to mention the international blow back. HC is a fucking war hawk and she&#39;s as bad or worse than others because she&#39;s a dumpy, little sociopathic, bitch with deep seaded insecurity complexs who always has to prove she can keep up with big boys when it comes to bombing the shit outta 3rd world countries.</p>
