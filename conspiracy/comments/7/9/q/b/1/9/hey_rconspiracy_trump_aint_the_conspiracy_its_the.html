<p>Dems do because of the concussions and because of the special tax breaks they get. Go check out John Oilver&#39;s segments on it and the support from reddit he got.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They supported the Iran deal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s been some pro-Iran stuff around here. Their leader calling Trump retarded got a ton of upvotes for instance. Very strange from a place that hates people who don&#39;t like gays and don&#39;t think women should be working.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They hated higher taxes? Bullshit. </p>

<p>They absolutely hate Trump&#39;s plan which will give money back to normal people, which is what they were calling for with $15 an hour and other movements. </p>

<p>I think the best way for them to protect themselves would be to actually tackle + pull instead of going for big hits. People rarely ever tackle anymore. They should be wearing Rugby style helmets or no helmets, then they won&#39;t be encouraged to nail people under the guise of &quot;the helmet will protect me&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The NFL is a workplace. I would get in trouble if I took a knee at my work. No different in the NFL. </p>

<p>While I do find the protests annoying, doing it during the flag is disrespectful and what really gets me. If they did it any other time, I would roll my eyes but not care as much. I also don&#39;t think that the 1% of cops who kill blacks are the problems, but the 97% of blacks who kill blacks are. Accusing mass groups of people of various things is racism at its finest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think we are making peace with groups who chant &quot;death to America&quot; and run propaganda campaigns on TV for terroristic actions. Go check out &quot;The Cult of the Suicide Bomber&quot;. I also don&#39;t think the ideas of the west and first world countries are compatible with the Middle East or places like China on a large scale.</p>

<p>NK should have been solved 25 years ago before it got to this point. Letting Un continue to make threats and praying that he doesn&#39;t actually act on his threats is being his bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s difficult, I admit, for me to get through to people on this sub who are so aware of so many more truths than the average joe but still will not even able to consider having an open mind about the possibility of there exists even a single good person inside the government. I may have been crass, but I never said this is how it is. I said “might” twice because I’m trying to get people to just accept the possibility that trump MIGHT be a good thing. I’m trying to get people to understand that our only chance at liberty is disclosure of government secrets. How our actual world is run. If people suddenly had this knowledge, we could even end world poverty tomorrow. My point is everything would be different, the people would take back the power of their own lies. And so now those very people have elected a total outsider who the mainstream media (one of their most important tools for control) have bashed him and lied about him 24/7. The people did it anyways. Even the republican side coulda chosen any other of that massive field of candidates. That tells me more people are waking up. AND, the way the establishment and the media have gone after them leads me to believe they both see him as a huge disclosure threat. Once mueller is gone and the other two thirds of trump’s picks are confirmed, THERE’S A CHANCE we might see a concerted effort for trump to bring secrets to light. Yet the very community (r/conspiracy) who knows all these secrets and wishes the rest of the world knew fails to consider that outcome even a possibility. The establishment and media are desperate right now because of trump. Can’t we all agree that’s a good thing?!?</p>

<p>It&#39;s gone to crazy level not because he &quot;came along&quot; but because he won. He wasn&#39;t expected to win. The MSM loved the amount of press he generated as a candidate, and he was propped up like a Pied Piper by his opponents so that he would fail, but he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say he ISN&#39;T corrupt (hell, he used to be a friend of the Clintons). He messed up the structure for four years, and as such is a wild card.</p>

<p>Whether that&#39;s a GOOD or BAD wild card depends on the reader&#39;s own political leanings, and what he does in his time in office.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a couple of reasons Trump may have run:</p>

<p>1) Wanted to make America better and hated its current direction.</p>

<p>2) Wanted to see if he could do it, took it as a challenge to cap off a successful life.</p>

<p>3) Saw the potential fame/business gains from it and went for it.</p>

<p>All could be true, one specific reason could be true, none could be true. No one but Trump and maybe his inner circle knows. </p>

There are no benefits of being president after all, he can&#39;t push legislation or executive order his way into tax breaks. He can&#39;t not divest himself of his businesses and vacation at his own clubs (after raising the prices) so that government money flows directly into his pockets. Man, he really is self-less.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/money/4703151/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-costs-taxpayers-palm-beach/">Each visit costs taxpayers $3 million dollars</a></p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t need to tell you everything there costs money and the secret service by law has to pay. <a href="https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-politics/donald-trump-in-palm-beach/article33453459/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;amp;/">It&#39;s as much as $2000 a night for a room there</a> In addition, he&#39;s considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/us/mar-a-lago-trump-ethics-winter-white-house.html">at least 3 MarLargo members for ambassadorships.</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s normal i&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>None of that accounting for local costs, police, coast guard, shutting down streets, etc.</p>

<p>He could go to Camp David, you know the place designed for Presidents to take vacations (you know the vacations he said he would never take) but here&#39;s what he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Yea, Camp David is very rustic, it’s nice, you’d like it. You know how long you’d like it? For about 30 minutes.”</p>

<p>Ah well, I guess its fine if he thinks it&#39;s boring...</p>

<p>THIS IS CORRUPTION ON THE MOST BASIC OF LEVELS</p>

<p>Yeah man, i&#39;m sure Trump has never done anything wrong. He&#39;s perfect and only the bad bad media wants to take him down because they are evil and stuff! It&#39;s not like Trump has had a long history of shady business practices, or given his children powerful government positions, or filled out his administration with goldman sachs bankers. None of that stuff happened.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need CNN to see what&#39;s right in front of your face. But hey, don&#39;t let me interrupt your circle jerk. there are other subreddits you can go to if you just want memes that reinforce things you&#39;ve already decided on. if the harsh truth doesn&#39;t go down well, that is.</p>

<p>I think people are sick policy being made by ivory tower academics who are ignorant of the practical applications of their theories.</p>

<p>Look at how ridiculously complex the tax code currently is, and consider how it got that way. We need a massive overhaul and simplification.

Trump&#39;s campaign manager was indicted today and more significantly his foreign policy staffer has already plead guilty to lying to the FBI about Russian contacts. That happened. There is clearly a conspiracy there. CNN reporting on it doesn&#39;t make it all suddenly false and doesn&#39;t make the conspiracy go away despite how much Trump&#39;s cockholsters want it to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current Manafort/Gates charges themselves don&#39;t mention Trump&#39;s campaign. But that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t related. Financial charges are the easiest to prove because you can just &quot;follow the money.&quot; Since these are the very first charges in the investigation into Trump&#39;s campaign, it makes perfect sense that they were brought to obtain leverage over Manafort/Gates and force them to take a deal. So it is disingenuous to say they have &quot;nothing to do&quot; with Trump&#39;s campaign. </p>

<p>Additionally, you conveniently ignored the Papas guilty plea which does mention the Trump campaign in detail (which is why I said it was &quot;more significant&quot;). Clearly, there is more to come in this investigation. It is extremely premature to conclude already that these charges have nothing to do with Trump&#39;s campaign. Only the White House (surprise) and right wing media seem to be pushing that  narrative which you are pushing now.</p>

Trump took a picture with the Clintons, he must be a rapist too. Clintons sold uranium to the Russians illegally,  and a person who worked under Trump secretly shared secrets with the Russians,  so that means Trump did too.
I mean seriosuly now the more people keep digging dirt the more OTHER people are getting in trouble except Trump. Maybe because Trump didnt do a damn thing.  He is immature emotionally sure. But nothing brought agaisnt him hold any water. </p>
