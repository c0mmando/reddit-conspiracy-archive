       Hi everyone.  I have a few things that I want to talk about and get some feedback. I’ve been on Reddit for a few years now. I’ve been a lurker on this sub for quite some time. Always appreciated most things that I’ve seen on here. When LV  happened I subscribed and started really paying attention and joining in on conversations. With everything that has happened in the last month since LV (Weinstein, uranium one, jfk files etc.) I’ve had this sinking feeling that something bigger is coming. Maybe it’s just me being overwhelmed with all this new info, or maybe it’s supposed to be overwhelming and a distraction from something else. What is everyone’s opinions? Do we think it’s going to be 9/11 sized or just more smaller incidents to keep everyone on edge?

       American politics is corrupt.  Washington has been in a cold war since the election.  Maybe it will go over into hot war, but probably not.  In a hot war everyone loses.

       Wow that’s a great point that I’ve never thought of. Maybe this is an all out ploy to try and recover what they have left. Try and throw out as much info as possible in all different directions so that they can “rebuild”?

       We are witnessing the Collapse of Empire.  As the whole thing implodes, "they" will stage more false flags, ramp up nationalism propaganda, and incite war for profit.  It will not preserve the status quo, not for long.  Then the walls come tumbling down.

       In trading they always tell you to 'buy the rumour sell the news'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because in general news is built up and hyped and everyone gets excited pushing the price up. Then the actual news is released, is generally underwhelming so everyone sells off.

       I imagine this tomDelong thing will be 'buy the rumour sell the news'.

       I had hope for Tom Delonge's project until I saw Joe Rogan's podcast. Tom was showing very obvious hoax videos as proof of amazing technology... It was actually kinda sad. I really do hope they end up building something cool, but it will be without my investment.

       WvB Threat Sequence:
1. Communism
2. Terrorism
3. Rogue Nations
4. Asteroids
5. E.T.

       Imo, we will have a devastating asteroid  event before we see E.T.

       I mean, if you look at it, short of the return of Christ/aliens/benevolent super ai, humanity is pretty fucked. Dying planet, extreme concentration of wealth, geopolitical instability, poor career prospects for many.

       At least for us first worlders, short of a miracle things are only going to get worse, the real question is how quickly.

       Just remember...
      </p>
      <p>
       Dying planet = major media hype and political interests... the jury is still out on the planet "dying". Major, major global climate "Red Alerts" have passed without any cataclysmic repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extreme Concentration of Wealth = NWO By Design... divide and conquer, keep the underlings helpless and bring them to heel
      </p>
      <p>
       Geopolitical Instability = 100% NWO By Design... otherwise, no war. No war = progress and stability. Progress and stability = less extreme profiteering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor Career Prospects = A thinned economy, outsourcing everything, a general lull when it comes to innovation and in-sourcing... again, likely by design. The more people they have begging for entitlement, the more control they wield.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our miracle lies in the draining of the swamp. I'm not talking about some laws against lobbyists. I'm talking about the extreme evisceration of TPTB from the ground up... holding the $7+ trillion shadow budget to the flames, eliminating the spy rings/rat-lines, regaining national strength throughout the entire world (all nations, individually, growing on their own accord, helping each other) and a new renaissance for mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They want us to feel like this requires a miracle
       </strong>
       . When in fact, it simply requires everyone to rise up and tear down the corruption. Markets will slowly settle back into a strong middle class. Taking care of the truly underprivileged will be something that everyone WANTS to do, and not a financially impossible burden.

       I think we should remain positive. The worst of TPTB want us to be scared, we know that and have known that for a long time. So I think we should not be scared. They are the ones who seem to be scared these days, and I believe that's because their time is up and good things are coming for humanity! There are good people who are 'in the know' who have been working for these evil fuckers who are now seeing a change in the public, a change in the world and are finally able to see the potential real significant earth changing problems that are arising and will arise if they continue to play goon1 goon 2 etc to these sociopaths. I think these people are starting to wake up and they have the power to make a positive difference as long as the rest of us keep pushing for the truth and keep focusing on being good to each other and don't get tangled up in all the fake partisan/race/religion etc divisions that are solely there to trap us and keep us away from solving the real issues.

       I am a Christian. But I have great respect for the Eastern "religions" (in some ways they are far more than religions), and believe Jesus Christ must in some way during the long stretch of his life that is unknown, learned about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much to Buddhism an Hinduism that is true. While I will certainly defer to my Lord, my personal feeling is that God has been trying to make it easier and easier for humankind to reach Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       While many of my Christian peers feel "Jesus is the only way," and that may well prove true--it is certainly true for me PERSONALLY--it also seems to me quite likely that there is a way to a transcendent afterlife through Buddhism and Hinduism but it is much harder, especially in our increasingly materialistic world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as the centuries have passed, since God loves us so, he keeps trying to make it easier, and nothing is more easy than accepting a Savior who takes all of your sins upon himself in divine sacrifice. And yet people STILL fuck it up, including a lot of so-called "Christians."
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just personal theory. I have no idea. Jesus Christ has worked for me, saved my life, helped me kick porn (though I know I could backslide, so "kicked" might be too strong), is an active presence in my life. But I have nothing bad to say about Hinduism. Or Buddhism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Kali, for that matter. Bring it, goddess. Tear this fucking house of cards down.

       Thank you very much for your input and I really appreciate you saying that Jesus has worked for your and not saying that it is the only way. I am a very accepting atheist and love to have these types of conversations. I do question part of your answer about you feeling god is making it easier to make it to heaven? I’ve always had an issue with that. Why doesn’t god just let the good into heaven instead of making them work for it and suffer? Never understood how an all loving god could put people through what we go through and then people willingly say oh it’s his way of showing us he loves us? Kind of a contradiction to me. And the house of cards thing was nice especially with the Kevin spacey nonsense going on and Netflix canceling it!!!

       Not entirely sure, but my opinion is that it's got to do with a mixture of the blessing/curse of Free Will and this material plane, as opposed to the ethereal or spiritual plane(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if we are ultimately ETERNAL beings, even a century is less than a teardrop in the ocean for the most miserable of lives. Perhaps pain and pleasure is the karmic balance that comes with a material experience, and our spirits know that's part of the deal when we choose to come here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't have all the answers, only a few hypothesis and a lot more questions. And I will only evangelize about what's worked for ME. And Jesus Christ saved me from a miserable, selfish, compulsive life. I really appreciate it.
      </p>

       We don't need a god to be happy/control us anymore. We don't need religion to be our purpose. We don't need religion at all, because beliefs and blind faith are not good. Just be yourself, be good and try to leave a better earth to the future, you don't need god for that and if you did he

       I appreciate your comments and general civility. This obviously means a lot to you.

       But I've got a personal relationship here, I can see genuine amazing synchronicities and other divine patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover "religion" is not my purpose. Religion is man-made. Faith is the divine relationship. And my purpose has been to raise healthy, well-adjusted children and try to reach other people and convince them to pursue a personal relationship with God as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       God did not kill his own son, btw. People did. It was destined that He would be rejected however, so I suppose he was sent on a suicide mission, but He knew what He was in for. After all, He was God.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm even willing to ponder the possibilities of....what if you are right? Even if you are right, I must be doing something that God has enjoyed, because he has heard my prayers and blessed me. Like I said, I won't evangelize for Jesus from anyone but me. But the fact is that Jesus has been good for me. I might suggest others try the Jesus route, but all have free will and can do as they please.

       If you switch Jesus and for the sun, or Mohammed, or Budda or a piece of cake it's the same 50% chance of it being heard because they are irrelevant.

       If a god wants something, he does. The way you believe god is, it is absurd to assume his plan is working since he has no control whatsoever. The bible's version of a god is a guy who changes his mind everytime and can't even make a civilization that won't kill his son or make a universe where his son's destiny isn't to die. It's all about a failed plan, a failed attempt at greatness. That's not how a god would work at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reckon religion can be good, specially with drug addicts and general "bad people", but that's just switching from heroine or murder to prayers. If you study (and I'm not trying to be a douche, just saying) about our origins and the universe itself you'll see god is completely unneeded. If we assume god is real, then who created him? (I'm going off topic here so I'll leave it as it is).
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you a good life, and god won't make that happen and neither you can make sure it will because we are not the center or the reason for it. We're just part of a breed of animals who developed on earth and who learned to be aware of themselves and that freaks us out.

       It's a nice thought, but I just don't see that happening. This is a huge criminal syndicate we are talking about. The Gambinos and Genovese. A few people may go down, but when the all hell breaks lose and it looks like the Government might actually start working for the people, in the interest of the people, instead of the interest of TPTB, The criminals will unite and fight to hold power.

       Some politicians might go down, some charges might be levied, but outside a very few people of power doing actual time, nothing more will happen.

       Here is a conspiracy theory for you. The CIA has disrupted Governments in strategic countries. The have caused chaos and wars in many locations. These locations happen to populated by a certain majority of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB, knowing that we need a perpetual boogie man in order to perpetuate fear and war, open the borders to many countries, allowing these uprooted, violent people that come from areas where they know nothing but violence and war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inevitably, these people that were allowed into these other wise peaceful countries, commit atrocities. They bomb buildings. They go on mass shooting sprees, drive into crowds of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The borders remain open, the CIA continues to disrupt otherwise at peace countries, and violence continues to erupt perpetuated by this particular eithnicity/race/religion that came from the disrupted country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viola....we hear fear, a boogie man, a perpetual wear, and a constant reason to slowly peel away individual rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Govt. can;t all our rights away at one time. But if they slowly peel our rights away, the masses of sheeple will notice. Hell, American Idol is on, why should they care what bill is before the house or senate?

       I responded already to your response to my LV question, I apologize for posting again, but it was an after thought that your kind of new. Let me tell you, this sub has changed A LOT since after the DNC. After the dem. convention, this sub started changing immediately.
      </p>

       But no, nothing major is going to happen outside of a mass shooting, bombing, or something like that. You can expect that shit to continue for years to come until we restrict the borders, and stop inciting revolt in other countries.

       Sorry man, but I can't explain it without being verbose. I guess it's a state of mind thing. So, excuse the length, Ill try to do TLDR
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Dem. Convention, r/politics did a complete 180 and went from Hated Hillary to love Hillary. The Mod's also shifted and made posting anything negative so arduous, that it wasn't worth posting any truth against Hillary. And if you did get something posted, it was down voted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldn't have any critical discussion, unless it was about sucking Hillary's ass. Sure, a few days the sub turned, like 9/11 Hillary passed out and was tossed into a van and she was bashed with so much traffic the negative got thru, for about a day. Thenit was back up her ass again.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no place for anyone not kissing HIllary's ass or on the fence about Trump to go.
       <a href="/r/thedonald">
        /r/thedonald
       </a>
       is so pro Trump, you can;t have real critical discussion and research there. So, r/copnspiracy had an  influx of people that weren't up Trump's or Hillary's ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was one of those people, but I've been a sub here for over 5 years. But I came here more for open political discussion, than to discuss conspiracies after the DNC, so I'm also guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I blame 100% that god dam bitch Hillary Clinton. She hired Correct the record to infiltrate subs, become mads, and waste our time. She really F'ed up Reddit as a whole. Anyone supporting her was a shill. Every sub was turned upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLDR:
       </strong>
       The sub became more of a place for arguing/discussing partisan politics and events than it's history as a conspiracy "whack job, tin foil hat" sub. Us folks that sub here years ago had a rep. as being tin foil hat loons. And you see partisan politics discussed and argued here now more than ever before. SOme olld timers are pretty pissed about it.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most people would say for the worse, and I agree. Partisan politics is a divisive distraction to take your attention away fro the giant red white and blue dildo being stuck up our ass. I learned in ciminology that you have to keep inmates in prison against one another, because if they unite, they come after you...the guards. The same is true in society. If we discuss how the govt. is fucking us instead of arguing about Hillary's fucking emails or Trump's Russia connections, then we have the seeds of a united revolt against TPTB. And that is exactly what they do not want.

       The elite have already planned for a violent revolt and have built underground facilities to go hide in. Therefore, a violent revolution wouldn't work. We need to slowly squeeze these rats out, but that will take a majority of people waking up to help us.

       I’m totally in favor of the 2nd and practice it every day, but do you think that it will really get us anywhere? I really think we need to evolve past that and really get the information out there and wake people up. I think threatening people with guns isn’t always going to be the best practice.

       Yes, something bigger is coming. Something bigger will always be coming, at least until the Sun goes red giant and engulfs the entire solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people in this world who want to create big, horrific events, and it is literally impossible to stop them all. There will be a much bigger Vegas. There will be a much bigger 9/11. The question isn't if, it's when.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time something big happens, probably millions of people scream out, "I knew it! I knew this was coming!" Yeah, right. Those folks knew the thing was coming like I know the number 666 will come up if I spend long enough staring at a random number generator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 24/7 news cycle provides all the material anyone needs to keep themselves worried and afraid. Everything about the human brain--everything you perceive--is a reaction to a pattern. For this reason our minds look for and find patterns even where there are none.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, everyone putting out material is trying to make money. They make money when you watch/read. You watch/read more when you're worried or afraid. So they try to keep you worried and afraid. They are very good at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I feel overwhelmed, I take a break from the news. Whatever is going to happen will happen whether I'm up-to-date or not.  I have no control over other people's actions, and none of us is psychic. Staying glued to the news, worried about or trying to predict the future, will drive anyone mad.

       That’s a great saying. I feel that the fear based media has been happening heavily since 9/11 trying to keep us in constant fear and never trusting anything, except what they say is true which didn’t work out the way they planned and people are questioning everything instead of trusting the MSM like they wanted.

       Why would you ask us? If you were given the correct answer, how would you know it was the correct answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of conspiracy theorists spend all of their time reading mainstream news publications and trying to guess at some all-encompassing theory for everything, and listening to other people's all-encompassing theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, instead, you were to focus on getting a keen grasp of history, or reading what the major think tanks are scheming about, you would be able to better understand what is going on. But, more importantly, you would be able to accurately judge if someone told you the truth about what is going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr Stop chasing "it's happening" theories. You have plenty of time to become a subject matter expert.

       Honestly I've felt this way since I joined here about a year ago, truthfully I don't know.  The content here has been eye opening, and I feel more alert and aware than ever.  I think Trump beginning to take down the Clinton cabal will dominate the headlines for the next few months.  I do have a feeling that something extraordinary will happen before the end of Trumps presidency though, good or bad i don't know.

       I mean, if you look at it, short of the return of Christ/aliens/benevolent super ai, humanity is pretty fucked. Dying planet, extreme concentration of wealth, geopolitical instability, poor career prospects for many.

      <p>
       At least for us first worlders, short of a miracle things are only going to get worse, the real question is how quickly.

       Let me emphasize, that 3.5 hour video is the bees knees. JFK, skull &amp; cross bones, Illuminati, free masons, and on. It pretty much touches on everything and how we got where we are.

        How has the sub changed?

       Sorry man, but I can't explain it without being verbose. I guess it's a state of mind thing. So, excuse the length, Ill try to do TLDR
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Dem. Convention, r/politics did a complete 180 and went from Hated Hillary to love Hillary. The Mod's also shifted and made posting anything negative so arduous, that it wasn't worth posting any truth against Hillary. And if you did get something posted, it was down voted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldn't have any critical discussion, unless it was about sucking Hillary's ass. Sure, a few days the sub turned, like 9/11 Hillary passed out and was tossed into a van and she was bashed with so much traffic the negative got thru, for about a day. Thenit was back up her ass again.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no place for anyone not kissing HIllary's ass or on the fence about Trump to go.
       <a href="/r/thedonald">
        /r/thedonald

       is so pro Trump, you can;t have real critical discussion and research there. So, r/copnspiracy had an  influx of people that weren't up Trump's or Hillary's ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was one of those people, but I've been a sub here for over 5 years. But I came here more for open political discussion, than to discuss conspiracies after the DNC, so I'm also guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I blame 100% that god dam bitch Hillary Clinton. She hired Correct the record to infiltrate subs, become mads, and waste our time. She really F'ed up Reddit as a whole. Anyone supporting her was a shill. Every sub was turned upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLDR:
       </strong>
       The sub became more of a place for arguing/discussing partisan politics and events than it's history as a conspiracy "whack job, tin foil hat" sub. Us folks that sub here years ago had a rep. as being tin foil hat loons. And you see partisan politics discussed and argued here now more than ever before. SOme olld timers are pretty pissed about it.

      <p>
       Most people would say for the worse, and I agree. Partisan politics is a divisive distraction to take your attention away fro the giant red white and blue dildo being stuck up our ass. I learned in ciminology that you have to keep inmates in prison against one another, because if they unite, they come after you...the guards. The same is true in society. If we discuss how the govt. is fucking us instead of arguing about Hillary's fucking emails or Trump's Russia connections, then we have the seeds of a united revolt against TPTB. And that is exactly what they do not want.

       Tony Podesta will be indicted soon. Eventually, lynch, Holder, and John Podesta.
