       Weird. On every other subreddit, it's essentially ignored that a lobbyist group mentioned in the indictment as company A OR B linked to the other candidate, saw its founder and president step down to face these allegations.

        Lock him the fuck up for all I care.  Conservatives have this mistaken impression that liberals care what happens to Tony Podesta.

      <p>
       I do not believe that conservative or liberal self identified persons (hundreds of millions in each group worldwide) have any same mistaken impression nor do I believe that all liberals have the same level of caring what happens to Tony Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you deny the parallel though, it's a bit cheap.  John Podesta is/ was/always will be associated with the Podesta Lobby Group.  He was managing Clinton's campaign until the very end.  Lobbyists are as successful as their connections are close to the powerful.  Having a brother working in the White House, closely aligned with the Clintons and eventually managing an all but guaranteed winning presidential campaign is the driving attraction for the Podesta Group.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Manafort is guilty of collusion and you think that also makes Trump guilty of collusion, it can be argued that the same guilt by association applies to Clinton and it really doesn't matter who we had in the White House, they were both traitors.

       As a follow up, persons from the Podesta Group visited the OBama white house as of 2013/2014 25 times whereas the acting Speaker of the House visited once.  This is right around the time frame these probes began.

       I'm not defending any side. I'm just telling you that both sides are extremely biased and almost radicalized at this point. This results in neither side being able to determine what's real and what's fake due to Voluntary Compartmentalization of information.

       You are exactly right. I don't know why more have not noticed this. Furthermore, those who have noticed it should draw the obvious conclusion that it's a distraction operation.

       He's right. Part of Trump's strategy has been to talk about Hillary, and even Obama, as much as possible. There is no logical reason in doing this unless he were trying to create a diversion from something else. He has done it consistently since his election. We are nearly a year after and that's all he seems to talk about. Surely, if he were delivering on his promises to his supporters, he would be talking about that, but no, he focuses only on attacking. That's a sign of something up to me.

       I don't really really care what Trump has to say, he's a moron.  I'm more interested in point out the flaws with both parties and getting a 3rd or 4th viable option, oppose to just choosing between Corporate Fascism or Corporate Fascism.  Obama, Hillary the DNC should be criticized, they are no better than the RNC and Trump in my mind.

       I agree; however, the party that is actually in power deserves the majority of scrutiny, wouldn't you agree? Yet, we are not seeing this from the populist.

       Are you referring to the Manafort post that’s currently #1on the front page? Or the George Pap’ story that’s at #5? Or are you just disappointed that the  Podesta one is #2?

       Well why isn't it stickied? It's obviously #1 because it's the biggest story out right now, you can't ignore it. But guess how many Podssta posts their are compared to the Manafort

       Yes, I noticed that even after Trump had won the election and he and his talking heads continued to talk about Hillary every day, even months after, that there was a massive deflection operation going on.
