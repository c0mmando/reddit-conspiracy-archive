<p>Kevin Spacey is a sexual predator, and quite possibly a full on pedophile.</p>

<p>the &quot;left&quot; side has been busy recruiting the LBLG specifically just for this purpose. the whole fear they&#39;ve been spreading about Trump and what may happen was just to get them on board with them and now it&#39;s all a mess because he&#39;s using his supposed sexuality as a shield to cover for his known predatoriness</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather treason did not take place on a regular scale. Also I hardly see how voting for Trump let to Kevin Spacey being ousted as an offender. But maybe I&#39;m too European to talk about your culture. I mean you have just now discovered that hollywood treats women very poorly, imagine what happens when you find out that these things happen on the same scale throughout the entire goddamn society. Men in any form of power abuse women (and in some cases also other men), it has always been like this and will probably not stop any time soon.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no point you stand. Is your point that women are sometimes mistreated? You&#39;ve made several blanket statements about groups of people and genetic pageant statements about how the world should be in your eyes. No point made, just observations and wishes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub seems to somehow believe that hollywood is a completely unique and seperate entity from everyday society instead of a grotesque and flamboyant miniature of society. Talk about the huge number of women claiming to be abused by men in the film industry and the sub cheers in admiration, point out that the number of women claiming to be abused in everyday society is not that much smaller and you&#39;re a crazy feminist. I may not have been very clear in my previous statements, but the mainline is this. I&#39;m done with people acting like hollywood is some sort of seperate entity from the normal world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of Americans who know this happens and how standard practice it is. It&#39;s been going on since Hollywood practically existed but on the other hand there are even more Americans who simply can not be bothered with any of it and think it&#39;s just urban tales and doesn&#39;t happen. The latter are the same that willingly gorge themselves with the evening news. And when people say how voting for Trump led to this well, all I can say on that is this is the only Presidency I&#39;ve seen really tackle pedophilia and human trafficking before. Seriously, look into the numbers of people caught and rings broke up. It&#39;s a small leak in a dam wall that is breaking bigger and bigger, no one is safe anymore. </p>
