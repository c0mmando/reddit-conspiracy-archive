        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems to me that...</p>

<p>Clinton conspiracies are real.
Russia conspiracies are real.
Pizza gate is real, they&#39;re all suck f***ers.
They&#39;re all crooks, they all take bribes.
They give favors to donors.
They&#39;re all in on it, and Trump has plenty to be held against him too.</p>

<p>Trump wants to fulfill his campaign promises to put Hillary in jail, and he wants to be liked by the people. But as he gets more information, he begins to see that if you pull on these strings too hard, the whole ball of yarn unravels... Everyone&#39;s crooked links intertwine to the point of being indistinguishable from the others... If Hillary goes down, EVERYONE goes down, and Trump goes down with them.</p>

<p>So, a deal is struck... These people are going to pay for what they did - for the really crooked things they devised, the bribes they took, etc), but the public will never know the true extent of their crimes, because... They&#39;re all going down for tax evasion. Money laundering. Misrepresentation to an official.</p>

<p>No pizzagate indictment will ever come.
Nothing on the Uranium dealings.
Nothing substantive.</p>

<p>They all serve time for lying on their taxes.</p>

<p>Easy to prove crimes, especially with yearly signed statements (tax returns) that they can demonstrate were falsified... carries a harsh sentence and fine, but gives Trump the power to stop the yarn ball unravelling whenever he sees fit... And white collar crimes should be pretty favorable for sentencing /parole so it&#39;s good to those being indicted...</p>

<p>Seems alot like Trump using his leverage, protecting the downside, and in the end getting what he wants.</p>

<p>Is this just conspiracy fodder, or am I on to something? Or is this just observing normal facts?</p>

<p>Remember when he promised to select a special prosecutor on day 1 to investigate Hillary Clinton? Then after elected he literally admitted he didn&#39;t actually care, and just said it because it &quot;played well&quot; during the campaign.</p>

<p>&quot;That plays great before the election - now we don&#39;t care, right?&quot;</p>

<p>But after he won the election, Trump said he wouldn&#39;t recommend prosecuting Clinton, saying she already &quot;suffered greatly&quot; and that it&#39;s &quot;just not something I feel very strongly about.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, found it.     </p>

<p>So the section of the speech where the cnn clip you provided is starts <a href="https://youtu.be/hq0udfhKOLU?t=57m30s">here</a>     </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hq0udfhKOLU?t=59m5s">fast forwarding a bit</a> we can see that the title for the video you linked       </p>

<p>&quot;Trump After ‘Lock Her Up’ Chants ‘Plays Great Before the Election, Now We Don’t Care’ Medi&quot;     </p>

<p>was taken out of context. There wasn&#39;t a chant saying &quot;lock her up&quot;...there was a brief booing by the crowd when Trump told  the story about how Hilary/Bill and Barak/Michelle suddenly planned an unexpected stop in Michigan near the end of the race.    </p>

<p>And it seems pretty obvious to me that Trump was saying that the booing wasn&#39;t necessary because the election was already won...that the booing played well before the election was over, but seems petty after the election was over. And that is a big difference than saying that he wont seek prosecution against HRC or Obama AFTER the election had been won....     </p>

<p>But to reiterate my original point, he has yet to go after either of them by legal means. At least not that I have heard of yet anyways...and IMO, probably wont because he probably did just say that during the race to win peoples votes.</p>

<p>Sorry, I honestly didnt hear that. At what time stamp of the video I provided did you hear that chant?      </p>

<p>I respectfully disagree. I could understand someone not wanting to encourage a group of people from being sore winners.      </p>

<p>Link to article? And again, considering the consistency of the news establishment, especially print journalism,  to skew the truth, I don&#39;t put a lot of stock into their credibility and would feel much more comfortable witnessing him saying that myself to accept that it is a verifiable truth.    </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying that Trump didn&#39;t say that he wouldn&#39;t seek prosecution, I&#39;m just saying that I have yet to see any actual proof that he did, as all I have to go on for now is instinct and hearsay.     </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Trump will go down as one of the greatest Presidents ever in the end. </p>

<p>I hope that ends up being the case. Unfortunately, it appears like he already has one of the worst Presidencies within only the first year.</p>

<p>How many people has he had to fire/replace for shady connections, lying, etc.?  It&#39;s been absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true... Even if the conspiracies aren&#39;t profev, per-se... Would seeing the perpetrators serve prison time for &quot;related offenses&quot; feel like justice? Maybe that&#39;s the angle - the other stuff is hard to prove, but we&#39;ll put them in prison either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta give it time. Been involved in this shit for thirty years, and one of the biggest pieces of wisdom I can offer is patience Never jump to conclusions too early, because nine out of ten times you’re sniffing the wrong trail. This is a spider web that has to be unraveled slowly and intricately, you cannot cut through it like a Gordon knot. Infiltrators  have to be infiltrated, enemies have to be snuggled up against, and misdirection in KEY to success. Any force of good will have to utilize the same tricks if not even more clever than the tricks being used on them. The takedown of the NWO/deep state goes back decades, it’s a slow reversal process, with two groups racing towards the same finish line. You can be guaranteed that any alliance intel online is mostly to misdirect, because they know the enemy reads it as well.</p>

<p>Like I tell everyone, time will tell all, but proceed with inquisitiveness, caution, skepticism and an open mind. Anything is possible.</p>
