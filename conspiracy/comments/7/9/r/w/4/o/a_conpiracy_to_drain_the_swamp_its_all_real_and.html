       It seems to me that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton conspiracies are real.
Russia conspiracies are real.
Pizza gate is real, they're all suck f***ers.
They're all crooks, they all take bribes.
They give favors to donors.
They're all in on it, and Trump has plenty to be held against him too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wants to fulfill his campaign promises to put Hillary in jail, and he wants to be liked by the people. But as he gets more information, he begins to see that if you pull on these strings too hard, the whole ball of yarn unravels... Everyone's crooked links intertwine to the point of being indistinguishable from the others... If Hillary goes down, EVERYONE goes down, and Trump goes down with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, a deal is struck... These people are going to pay for what they did - for the really crooked things they devised, the bribes they took, etc), but the public will never know the true extent of their crimes, because... They're all going down for tax evasion. Money laundering. Misrepresentation to an official.
      </p>
      <p>
       No pizzagate indictment will ever come.
Nothing on the Uranium dealings.
Nothing substantive.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all serve time for lying on their taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easy to prove crimes, especially with yearly signed statements (tax returns) that they can demonstrate were falsified... carries a harsh sentence and fine, but gives Trump the power to stop the yarn ball unravelling whenever he sees fit... And white collar crimes should be pretty favorable for sentencing /parole so it's good to those being indicted...
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems alot like Trump using his leverage, protecting the downside, and in the end getting what he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this just conspiracy fodder, or am I on to something? Or is this just observing normal facts?

       Remember when he promised to select a special prosecutor on day 1 to investigate Hillary Clinton? Then after elected he literally admitted he didn't actually care, and just said it because it "played well" during the campaign.

       He literally said after he got elected that he didn't care to go after Clinton, and he only kept saying "Lock Her Up" because crowds kept chanting it and it played well.

       And yet, people like OP think he's going to martyr himself to take the whole system down.

       Take a moment and enlighten yourself instead of being willfully ignorant on Trump.

       lol...well the clip starts mid sentence and ends pretty abruptly after asking a question and smiles can be seen on his face and others around him as if he was joking...so yeah, I'm gonna look for the entire speech...or at least a clip that has some context before and after what we see in the cnn clip. I'll let you know when i find it so we can get a clearer picture of whats actually going on.

       was taken out of context. There wasn't a chant saying "lock her up"...there was a brief booing by the crowd when Trump told  the story about how Hilary/Bill and Barak/Michelle suddenly planned an unexpected stop in Michigan near the end of the race.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it seems pretty obvious to me that Trump was saying that the booing wasn't necessary because the election was already won...that the booing played well before the election was over, but seems petty after the election was over. And that is a big difference than saying that he wont seek prosecution against HRC or Obama AFTER the election had been won....
      </p>
      <p>
       But to reiterate my original point, he has yet to go after either of them by legal means. At least not that I have heard of yet anyways...and IMO, probably wont because he probably did just say that during the race to win peoples votes.

       There was 'Lock Her Up' chanting. It makes zero sense to say "that plays great before the election" towards booing. But whatever, you're hearing what you want to hear.

       Doesn't change the fact that he point blank told the New York Times that prosecuting her was something he didn't feel very strongly about.

       Link to article? And again, considering the consistency of the news establishment, especially print journalism,  to skew the truth, I don't put a lot of stock into their credibility and would feel much more comfortable witnessing him saying that myself to accept that it is a verifiable truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not saying that Trump didn't say that he wouldn't seek prosecution, I'm just saying that I have yet to see any actual proof that he did, as all I have to go on for now is instinct and hearsay.

       I think they were once in the same group but some deflected. I don't believe Trump it's the most benevolent loving angel. I do believe he loves his country and the country is under covert attack by globalists. I do believe that globalists are the most evil scum and could worship ETs, AI or Satan.

       This is a reasonable conspiracy theory and should be discussed.

       My personal opinion is that the whole ball of yarn needs to be unraveled though.  Another analogy is cancer.  If we leave just a little bit of cancer in the system and expect the system to survive, we are being delusional.  The system is corrupt from top to bottom and needs a serious reformation.

       Upvote because it's an interesting thought... You might be right. It feels like something is happening, so... If he's president while it happens, he's got a huge updraft he could catch in public opinion...

       He's a reality TV star... And he's president of the US during, what looks like it will be, tumultuous times... I think that has the potential to be morphed into the perception of "the greatest president" if things go well... And I think someone like Trump would be the one who could spin it that way.

       Very true... Even if the conspiracies aren't profev, per-se... Would seeing the perpetrators serve prison time for "related offenses" feel like justice? Maybe that's the angle - the other stuff is hard to prove, but we'll put them in prison either way.

       Probably, but these are rich people. I think Manafort will do time, but I wouldn't be that shocked if they sentenced him to fines and probation.

       It would be cool if every conspiracy and code word was just a misrepresentation of secret talks about tax evasion. Imagine, tax evasion is the worst thing in government.

       While I'd usually agree, it seems Trump is determined to erase anything Obama did, Sometimes petty stuff too.

       You gotta give it time. Been involved in this shit for thirty years, and one of the biggest pieces of wisdom I can offer is patience Never jump to conclusions too early, because nine out of ten times you’re sniffing the wrong trail. This is a spider web that has to be unraveled slowly and intricately, you cannot cut through it like a Gordon knot. Infiltrators  have to be infiltrated, enemies have to be snuggled up against, and misdirection in KEY to success. Any force of good will have to utilize the same tricks if not even more clever than the tricks being used on them. The takedown of the NWO/deep state goes back decades, it’s a slow reversal process, with two groups racing towards the same finish line. You can be guaranteed that any alliance intel online is mostly to misdirect, because they know the enemy reads it as well.

       Like I tell everyone, time will tell all, but proceed with inquisitiveness, caution, skepticism and an open mind. Anything is possible.
