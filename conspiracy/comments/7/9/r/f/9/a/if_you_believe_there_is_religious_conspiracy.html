       The owner of the blog/site has a Th.D in early christian history and a phd in philosophy.  He posts around 3 articles a day. He always cites sources for everything so you can go check out the information yourself.

       Well i mean, that is technically true, even for me as a christian I personally believe humans were deceived into false religions right away, including false christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure many just end up being atheist after examining most religions and considering the 'problem of evil'.

       The Quran still teaches God tortures people in hell just like catholicism and protestants teach.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a different story that makes a lot more sense than God torturing people literally forever. That is part of the conspiracy, that there are some out there who want to make God look stupid/evil and do it through false religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the original languages of the bible hell was just your grave. That all who sin go to the grave. But all will be resurrected. Then the lake of fire is where you can die a second time. Anyone who goes to the lake of fire will know everything and be fully rejecting peace and God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev20 14
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the
        <strong>
         second death.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I could make a huge post proving all that with scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the idea of a loving God not torturing people forever makes more sense and that he actually allows people to choose death instead of life if they want to be evil.

       It will be your choice?  His goal is for everyone to embrace the way of peace. If someone wants to be evil and hurt people and cause chaos, then they will knowingly die a second time and stay dead forever. There will be no point in evil existing anymore once we all learn to hate evil.

       That makes no sense. A god would already make you with that knowledge, if he can't than he's not a god, if he does than he's not good just incapable of.

      <p>
       Don't try to excuse god, mate. If a god has
       <em>
        "goals"
       </em>
       he's not a god. If he kills me forever because I don't agree with him, Satan is my Lord and Savior and I'd be glad to be against a tyrannical guy like that. Communism has more freedom than your so-called-god.

       Well we do have the knowledge of good and evil. It now wants us to learn to hate evil.

       Which makes you see that god is not needed for us to be good and/or to realize that to be good is better than not to.

      <p>
       If god wants us to learn to hate evil, being a god, he's already capable of doing that and creating us with that knowledge already. If he doesn't it's because either he's incapable therefore he's not a god or not real at all. Failed plans, failed attempt, failed god.

       Being dead forever is after this life though. That is a second death.

       And yes a loving God would remove evil people so that nobody has to deal with that. Its just as people ask why does God not remove evil people now? Everyone wants evil people to not exist... Well one day they wont exist anymore.

       No, I expect them to exist because that's how life is. And that's how a non-intelligently-designed world is. If I believed in god then I'd expect him to not
       <em>
        create

       them, because if he wants me to have some special knowledge he could literally give/implant it in me already and if he couldn't then he is not a god.

       Exactly, mythology. You are literally saying it is mythology but picking parts that fit in the narrative you want as non mythological despite the logical conclusion. Talking snakes are fairy tales, just like jesus (and Mohammed, Harry Potter, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe in religion, you are a good person by
       <em>

       , and not choice. If you fear god you're domesticated.

       Truth might be, but religion is the opposite of that. Control, rules, hell, judgment, commendmants, exploitation, fear and faith are not liberating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faith is when you believe in something despite the lack of evidence, there's no truth in there just ignorance.

       Well i mean, that is technically true, even for me as a christian I personally believe humans were deceived into false religions right away, including false christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure many just end up being atheist after examining most religions and considering the 'problem of evil'.

       I guess i should have recommended the site for

       who see major problems and hypocrisy in most of christianity.

       Providing them all sorts of evidence won't convince them either.  They would have to be themselves "called" for them to see and understand it.  It's not up to you and a job like that would be for someone in an actual "office" of Christianity to give that speech to them.. or the books and booklets out there that exist, 'OR, as happens a lot of times' - on a second thought, rarely does one is "called" all by himself IMO, such as them reading their Bibles on their own.  Lot's of times their 'mind is opened', called, by hearing or reading some material of the TRUTH.  The actual truth, as I explained with one minor example in my earlier comment and you're aware of as well.
