<p>The owner of the blog/site has a Th.D in early christian history and a phd in philosophy.  He posts around 3 articles a day. He always cites sources for everything so you can go check out the information yourself.</p>

<p>That website has helped me the most in my journey to understand christianity and prophecy in general. Especially christian history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Quran still teaches God tortures people in hell just like catholicism and protestants teach. </p>

<p>There is a different story that makes a lot more sense than God torturing people literally forever. That is part of the conspiracy, that there are some out there who want to make God look stupid/evil and do it through false religions.</p>

<p>In the original languages of the bible hell was just your grave. That all who sin go to the grave. But all will be resurrected. Then the lake of fire is where you can die a second time. Anyone who goes to the lake of fire will know everything and be fully rejecting peace and God.</p>

<p>Rev20 14</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the <strong>second death.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could make a huge post proving all that with scriptures.</p>

<p>If the idea of a loving God not torturing people forever makes more sense and that he actually allows people to choose death instead of life if they want to be evil. </p>

<p>It will be your choice?  His goal is for everyone to embrace the way of peace. If someone wants to be evil and hurt people and cause chaos, then they will knowingly die a second time and stay dead forever. There will be no point in evil existing anymore once we all learn to hate evil.</p>

<p>And we know that because generations after generations keep passing knowledge and keep learning to live as a society. No god needed.</p>

<p>Which makes you see that god is not needed for us to be good and/or to realize that to be good is better than not to. </p>

<p>If god wants us to learn to hate evil, being a god, he&#39;s already capable of doing that and creating us with that knowledge already. If he doesn&#39;t it&#39;s because either he&#39;s incapable therefore he&#39;s not a god or not real at all. Failed plans, failed attempt, failed god.</p>

<p>But if I don&#39;t choose him, I&#39;ll be dead forever or sent to hell. Not something an actual loving god would do and definitely not something a powerful god would (since he can just give me the knowledge he reckons I should have).</p>

<p>And yes a loving God would remove evil people so that nobody has to deal with that. Its just as people ask why does God not remove evil people now? Everyone wants evil people to not exist... Well one day they wont exist anymore.</p>

<p>No, I expect them to exist because that&#39;s how life is. And that&#39;s how a non-intelligently-designed world is. If I believed in god then I&#39;d expect him to not <em>create</em> them, because if he wants me to have some special knowledge he could literally give/implant it in me already and if he couldn&#39;t then he is not a god.</p>

<p>No, I am becoming what a intelligent being would become (not that I am already), god is completely unnecessary and irrelevant for that.</p>

<p>Providing them all sorts of evidence won&#39;t convince them either.  They would have to be themselves &quot;called&quot; for them to see and understand it.  It&#39;s not up to you and a job like that would be for someone in an actual &quot;office&quot; of Christianity to give that speech to them.. or the books and booklets out there that exist, &#39;OR, as happens a lot of times&#39; - on a second thought, rarely does one is &quot;called&quot; all by himself IMO, such as them reading their Bibles on their own.  Lot&#39;s of times their &#39;mind is opened&#39;, called, by hearing or reading some material of the TRUTH.  The actual truth, as I explained with one minor example in my earlier comment and you&#39;re aware of as well. </p>
