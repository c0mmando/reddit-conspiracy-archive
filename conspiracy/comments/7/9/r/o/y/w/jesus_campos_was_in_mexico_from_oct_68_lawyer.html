      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jesus Campos’ lawyer, Frank Flansburg III, said Campos has spent most of his time at an MGM property since his name became public, except for several days in Mexico on a pre-planned and company-approved trip to visit family.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Following the tragedy, Mr. Campos’ name was publicly released, resulting in extensive and intrusive media attention,” Flansburg said. “Because of the unwanted attention days after the event, MGM Resorts offered Mr. Campos lodging for his privacy and protection, which Mr. Campos accepted and appreciated.”
       </p>
       <p>
        MGM Resorts Senior Vice President Alan Feldman also confirmed Thursday that the gaming company has provided accommodations for Campos.
       </p>
       <p>
        “When his name became public, Jesus was inundated with media coming to his home,” Feldman said. “Out of concern for our employee’s safety, we provided a room for him. This was a very unusual circumstance, and our first and only concern was his safety.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Flansburg said law enforcement officers interviewed Campos at the hospital and approved his trip to Mexico. He has been available to investigators since returning to the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Larry Hadfield, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, declined to answer questions about how many times police have interviewed Campos and whether investigators have concerns that MGM is keeping him under wraps.
       </p>
       <p>
        “He is a victim in this investigation, and he is cooperating,” Hadfield said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Campos, who has had trouble sleeping since the shooting, left Las Vegas for Mexico on Oct. 6 to spend time with family members there and returned the evening of Oct. 8, Flansburg said. Campos returned to an MGM property when he came back and was still being housed by the company as of Thursday afternoon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Security officers have often stood guard at his house.
       </p>
       <p>
        “He went from being a private citizen with no attention to suddenly being in the spotlight, and it was overwhelming while he was trying to recover from the tragedy,” Flansburg said in an interview.
       </p>
       <p>
        Flansburg said Campos, who was born in Southern California before moving to Las Vegas as a teenager, is aware that he will be dealing with the shooting for a long time, but he is anxious to return to his home and attempt to live a normal life.

       Because people who weren't aware of it were
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79jqzf/las_vegas_shooters_former_employee/dp2jawr/">
        still speculating about the Mexico trip
       </a>
       as recently as last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realized it hadn't been posted anywhere on here, or widely reported, or even mentioned by the people who brought the Mexico trip to the public's attention in the first place, so
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79jqzf/las_vegas_shooters_former_employee/dp2nzaz/">
        I said I'd post it

       Makes sense, my bad. I though this was intended to "prove" something—like foul play regarding Mexico, something this sub has
       <em>
        harped
       </em>
       on—but I was wrong.

       Oh, nope, just trying to make sure people have access to the facts -- if not the facts of what actually happened, then at least, the facts of what's actually been said! They get buried very easily.
