       I view myself as pretty moderate. I try my hardest to avoid confirmation bias by not conforming to ideologies, etc. And since it's impossible to avoid having a bias as a human being, I try to make my bias a filter of discernment. I immediately call BS on anything source with an agenda tells me under I research it further.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find a real value to frequenting the_donald. Not because I find Trump infallible, but because it is the only sub I've found which allows ANY pro-trump narrative. And there is real news/ facts reported there which don't exist anywhere else on reddit.    ...except for this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an information junkie who doesnt like group-think, this is easily my favorite sub. On an average day, I find the pro-trump vs anti-trump split to be about 50/50, which I think is an accurate representation of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my biggest beef is that any time there is news like Manaforts indictment, this sub is absolutely overpowered by anti-trump shills. To a free-thinker, it's pretty obvious that Manaforts indictment could go either way, whether it leads to damning info on Trump or Hillary/ DNC. So, why is this sub suddenly brigaded by angry, anti-Trumpers, insulting the "stupid trumpettes". Such anti-trump comments make the top of the page, while anyone expressing skepticism and logical analysis is voted down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone suggested sorting this sub by "new" to get an idea what the community is actually like. And he was 100% correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw the same thing during the 2016 primaries. Subs like
       <a href="/r/trees">
        /r/trees
       </a>
       were bought out and became moderated by Hillary/ DNC shills because they know that's where a lot of Bernier's supporter were.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think many ppl are aware of this dynamic and seek an alternative
