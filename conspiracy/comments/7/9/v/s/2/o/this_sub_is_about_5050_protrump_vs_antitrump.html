        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I view myself as pretty moderate. I try my hardest to avoid confirmation bias by not conforming to ideologies, etc. And since it&#39;s impossible to avoid having a bias as a human being, I try to make my bias a filter of discernment. I immediately call BS on anything source with an agenda tells me under I research it further. </p>

<p>I find a real value to frequenting the_donald. Not because I find Trump infallible, but because it is the only sub I&#39;ve found which allows ANY pro-trump narrative. And there is real news/ facts reported there which don&#39;t exist anywhere else on reddit.    ...except for this sub.</p>

<p>As an information junkie who doesnt like group-think, this is easily my favorite sub. On an average day, I find the pro-trump vs anti-trump split to be about 50/50, which I think is an accurate representation of society.</p>

<p>But my biggest beef is that any time there is news like Manaforts indictment, this sub is absolutely overpowered by anti-trump shills. To a free-thinker, it&#39;s pretty obvious that Manaforts indictment could go either way, whether it leads to damning info on Trump or Hillary/ DNC. So, why is this sub suddenly brigaded by angry, anti-Trumpers, insulting the &quot;stupid trumpettes&quot;. Such anti-trump comments make the top of the page, while anyone expressing skepticism and logical analysis is voted down.</p>

<p>Someone suggested sorting this sub by &quot;new&quot; to get an idea what the community is actually like. And he was 100% correct. </p>

<p>We saw the same thing during the 2016 primaries. Subs like <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a> were bought out and became moderated by Hillary/ DNC shills because they know that&#39;s where a lot of Bernier&#39;s supporter were. </p>

<p>I think many ppl are aware of this dynamic and seek an alternative</p>
