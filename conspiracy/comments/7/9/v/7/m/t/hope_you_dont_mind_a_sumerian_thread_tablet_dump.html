        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently I have researched the Sumerian myths. For those who dont know, the Sumerians were the first human civilisation starting at least 4500 bc. (6500 years ago). There have been many conspiracies about the Sumerians and their Gods, called annun (higher) and Igigi (lower), or annunaki in some sources. There are also a lot of fake tablets in circulation that give a too fanciful impression on the past. However, the real tablets still give a very interesting account of the (lost) history of man.</p>

<p>The main conspiracy theory is this: 
the annunaki came from Nib.uru to earth to mine gold so they could restore planet or athmosphere, they created humans to mine gold for them, and some theories state they created 13 hybrid bloodlines to rule mankind. These are lies, or supported by currently non-public tablets.</p>

<p>(if one of you has interesting tablets, please comment!) </p>

<p>What I did found in the Sumerian tablets, the most interesting I have added below is this:
The annunaki arrived on earth, divided the world between different gods. An is given the heavens, Enlil is given the earth and his brother Enki is given the subteranean seas. Enlil orders the lower gods called Igigi to dig the earth, presumably for rivers, canals, irrigation and agriculture. 
Eventually the Igigi revolt, and Enlil calls An down from the heavens and Enki to meet. Enki comes up with the idea to create man and the gods agree. A god is sacrificed and mixed with clay and spit from the Gods. From this mixture 7 men and 7 women are created in a large womb, overseen by a group of fertility godesses, though one tablet recites a series of failed experiments that likely preceded this. </p>

<p>Enki teaches the humans civilisation. 
Eventually Enlil grows weary of the quickly proliferating humans and sends down a disease. He follows up with a famine where the humans are reduced to eating each other. He ends with a flood. 
Enki tells a king to create an ark. the King and his family and friends survive and end up at mount Ararat (Arafat - old Armenia).</p>

<p>Eventually the Gods leave and each God destroys his patron city.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>By our hand a flood will sweep over the cities of the half-bushel baskets, and the country;
the decision, that mankind is to be destroyed has been made.
A verdict, a command of the assembly cannot be revoked,
an order of An and Enlil is not known ever to have been countermanded.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>-fragment of the Eridu Genesis tablet. </p>

<p>I will now show the Athrahais tablet, one of the longest and well preserved that feature the creation of man.  </p>

<p>Athrahasis Tablet I </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When the gods instead of man
Did the work, bore the loads,
The gods&#39; load was too great,
The work too hard, the trouble too much,
The great Anunnaki made the Igigi
Carry the workload sevenfold.
Anu their father was king,
Their counselor warrior Ellil,
Their Chamberlain was Ninurta,
Their canal-controller Ennugi.
They took the box of lots
Cast the lots; the gods made the division.
Anu went up to the sky,
And Ellil took the earth for his people.
The bolt which bars the sea
Was assigned to far-sighted Enki.
When Anu had gone up to the sky,
And the gods of the Apsu had gone below,
The Annunaki of the sky
Made the Igigi bear the workload.
The gods had to dig out canals,
Had to clear channels, the lifelines of the land.
The gods dug out the Tigris river
And then dug out the Euphrates.</strong>
...in the deep
...they set up
...the Apsu
...of the land
...inside it
...raised its top
...of all the mountains
They were counting the years of loads
...the great marsh,
They were counting the years of loads.
<strong>For 3,600 years they bore the excess,
Hard work, night and day.
They groaned and blamed each other,
Grumbled over the masses of excavated soil:</strong>
Let us confront our Chamberlain
And get him to relieve us of our hard work!
Then...made his voice heard
And spoke to the gods, his brothers:
Come, let us carry 
the counselor of the gods, the warrior, from his dwelling.
Now, cry battle!
The gods listened to his speech,
Set fire to their tools,
Put aside their spades for fire,
Their loads for the fire-god.
They flared up.
It was night, the middle watch,
The house was surrounded, the god had not realized.
When they reached the gate of warrior Ellil&#39;s dwelling,
Yet Kalkal was attentive, and had it closed,
He held the lock and watched the gate.
Kalkal roused Nusku.
They listened to the noise of the Igigi.
Then Nusku roused his master,
Made him get out of bed:
My lord, your house is surrounded,
A rabble is running around your door!
 Ellil had weapons brought to his dwelling.
Ellil made his voice heard
And spoke to the vizier Nusku,
Nusku, bar your door,
Take up your weapons and stand in front of me. 
Nusku barred his door
Took up his weapons and stood in front of Ellil.
Nusku made his voice heard
And spoke to the warrior Ellil,
O my lord, your face is sallow as Tamarisk!
<strong>Why do you fear your own sons?
Send for Anu to be brought down to you
Have Enki fetched into your presence. 
He sent for Anu to be brought down to him,
Enki was fetched into his presence,
Anu, king of the sky was present,
Enki, king of the Apsu attended.
The great Anunnaki were present.
Ellil got up and the case was put.
Ellil made his voice heard
And spoke to the great gods:
Is it against me that they have risen?
Shall I do battle...?
What did I see with my own eyes?
A rabble was running around my door! 
Anu made his voice heard
And spoke to the warrior Ellil
Let Nusku go out
And find out the word of the Igigi
Who have surrounded your door.</strong>
A command [...
To [... 
Ellil made his voice heard
And spoke to the vizier Nusku,
Nusku, open your door,
Take up your weapons and stand before me!
In the assembly of all the gods,
Bow, then stand and tell them,
&quot;Your father Anu,
Your counselor, warrior Ellil,
Your chamberlain Ninurta
And your <strong>canal-controller</strong> Ennugi
Have sent me to say,
&#39;Who is in charge of the rabble?
<strong>Who is in charge of the fighting?
Who declared war?</strong>
Who ran to the door of Ellil?&#39;&quot; 
Nusku opened his door,
Took up his weapons, went before Ellil
In the assembly of all the gods
He bowed, then stood and told the message.
Ellil [...
<strong>Every single one of us declared war!
We have put a stop to the digging.
The load is excessive, it is killing us!
Our work is too hard, the trouble too much!
So every single one of us gods
Has agreed to complain to Ellil</strong> 
Nusku took his weapons
Went and returned to Ellil
My lord, you sent me to [...
I went [...
I explained [...
[...]
Saying (the message)
Ellil listened to that speech.
His tears flowed.
Ellil spoke guardedly,
Addressed the warrior Anu,
Noble one, take a decree
<strong>With you to the sky, show your strength-
While the Anunnaki are sitting before you
Call up one god and let them cast him for destruction
Anu made his voice heard
And spoke to the gods his brothers,
What are we complaining of?
Their work was indeed too hard, their trouble was too much.
Every day the Earth resounded.
The warning signal was loud enough, we kept hearing the noise.</strong>
...] do
...] tasks
[...]
<strong>Belet-ili the womb goddess is present-
Let her create a mortal man
So that he may bear the yoke...
So that he may bear the yoke, the work of Ellil,
Let man bear the load of the gods!</strong>
...
They called up the goddess, asked
The midwife of the gods, wise Mami,
You are the womb-goddess, to be the creator of Mankind!
Create a mortal, that he may bear the yoke!
Let him bear the yoke, the work of Ellil
Let him bear the load of the gods! 
Nintu made her voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
On the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the month
I shall make a purification by washing.
Then one god should be slaughtered.
And the gods can be purified by immersion.
Nintu shall mix the clay
With his flesh and blood.
Then a god and a man
Will be mixed together in clay.
Let us hear the drumbeat forever after,
Let a ghost come into existence from the god&#39;s flesh,
Let her proclaim it as her living sign,
And let the ghost exist so as not to forget the slain god. 
They answered, &quot;Yes&quot; in the assembly,
The great Anunnaki who assign the fates
On the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the month
He made a purification by washing.
Geshtu-E, a god who had intelligence,
They slaughtered in their assembly.
Nintu mixed clay
with his flesh and blood.
They heard the drumbeat forever after.
A ghost came into existence from the god&#39;s flesh,
and she proclaimed it as his living sign.
The ghost existed so as not to forget the slain god.
After she had mixed that clay,
She called up the Anunnaki, the great gods.
The Igigi, the great gods,
Spat spittle upon the clay
Mami made her voice heard
And spoke to the great gods,
I have carried out perfectly
The work that you ordered of me.
You have slaughtered a god together with his intelligence.
I have relieved you of your hard work,
I have imposed your load on man.
You have bestowed noise on man,
I have undone the fetter and granted freedom. 
They listened to the speech of hers,
And were freed from anxiety, and kissed her feet:
We used to call you Mami,
But now your name shall be Mistress of All Gods. 
Far sighted Enki and wise Mami
Went into the room of fate.
The womb-goddesses were assembled.
He trod the clay in her presence;
She kept reciting an incantation,
For Enki, staying in her presence, made her recite it
<strong>When she had finished her incantation,
She pinched off fourteen pieces of clay,
And set seven pieces on the right,
Seven on the left.</strong>
Between them she put down a mud brick.
She made use of a reed, opened it to cut the umbilical cord,
Called up the wise and knowledgeable
<strong>Womb goddesses, seven and seven.
Seven created males,
Seven created females,
For the womb goddess is creator of fate.</strong>
He ... them two by two,
... them two by two in her presence.
(part removed, not interesting)
<strong>The womb goddesses were assembled
And Nintu was present. They counted the months,
Called up the Tenth month as the term of fates.
When the Tenth month came,
She slipped in a staff and opened the womb.
Her face was glad and joyful.
She covered her head,
Performed the midwifery,</strong>
(part removed, not interesting) 
<strong>They took hold of ...
Made new picks and spades,
Made big canals,
To feed people and sustain the gods.</strong>
...
<strong>600 years, less than 600 (?), passed,
And the country was as noisy as a bellowing bull.
The god grew restless at their racket,
Ellil had to listen to their noise.
He addressed the great gods,
The noise of mankind has become too much,
I am losing sleep over their racket.
Give the order that suruppu-disease shall break out!</strong> 
Now there was one Atrahasis
Whose ear was open to his god Enki.
He would speak with his god
And his god would speak with him.
Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to his lord,
<strong>How longwill the gods make us suffer?
Will they make us suffer illness forever?</strong> 
Enki made his voice heard
And spoke to his servant:
Call the elders, the senior men!
Start an uprising in your own house,
Let the heralds proclaim [...
Let them make a loud noise in the land:
Do not revere your gods,
Do not pray to your goddesses,
But search out the door of Namtara.
Bring as baked loaf into his presence.
May the flour offerings reach him.
<strong>May he be shamed by the presents
And wipe away his hand.</strong> 
Atrahasis took the order,
Gathered the elders to his door.
Atrahasis made his voice heard
And spoke to the elders:
(part removed)
Do not revere your gods,
Do not pray to your goddesses,
But search out the door of Namtara.
<strong>The flour offerings reached him.
And he was shamed by the presents.
And wiped away his hand.
The suruppu-disease left them.</strong>
The gods went back to their regular offerings.</p>

<p>Athrahasis Tablet II </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Twelve hundred years had not gone by;
the land had expanded and the people had multiplied.
The land was bellowing like wild oxen,
and the god was disturbed by their uproar.
Enlil heard their noise and addressed the great gods:
The noise of humankind is too loud for me,
with all their uproar I cannot go to sleep.
Cut off food supplies to the people,
let plant-life to feed them be scarce;
Above, let Adad withhold his rain,
Below, let the flood not rise from the deep;
let the wind blow and parch the ground;
let the clouds thicken but only drop drips;
let the fields lessen their yields,
let Nisaba seal up her breast.</strong> 
(large part of tablet destroyed)
They built a temple for Adad in the city.
(part removed, not interesting)
He was abashed at the gift and lifted his hand.
In the morning he rained down a mist,
and furtively rained down a dew in the night.
The fields furtively bore grain, [the famine] left them.</p>

<p>The noise of humankind has become too loud for me,
with their uproar I cannot go to sleep.
Command that Anu and Adad guard the upper realm,
Sin and Nergal guard the middle earth,
and that Ea may guard, together with his plants,
the bolt and bar of the sea
<strong>Thus no water or food escaped,
and the rigours of famine returned:
Above, Adad withheld his rain.
Below, the flood did not rise from the deep.
The womb of earth did not bear,
plant-life did not sprout.
People were nowhere to be seen.
The black fields became white, 
the broad plain was smothered in salt.
For one year they ate grass;
for the second year they depleted the storehouse.
The third year came and their features were distorted by hunger.
On the arrival of the fourth year
their long legs became short,
their broad shoulders became narrow,
and they walked hunched up in the street.
On the arrival of the fifth year
the daughter watched the mother go inside,
but the mother would not open her door to the daughter.
The daughter watched the scales (at the sale) of the mother, 
the mother watched the scales (at the sale) of the daughter. 
On the arrival of the sixth year
they served up the daughter for dinner,
they served up the son for food.</strong>
(part destroyed)
I ordered that Anu and Adad should guard the upper regions,
that Sin and Nergal should guard the middle earth,
while I myself guard the earth below,
and that you should guard, together with your plants,
the bolt and bar of the sea.
But you released an abundance to the people. 
<strong>Enlil opened his mouth to speak
and addressed the assembly of all the gods:
Come now, let us all take an oath to bring a flood.
Anu swore first, Enlil swore, his sons swore with him. . . .
Enki opened his mouth and addressed the gods his brothers:
Why will you bind me with an oath? Am I to lay hands on my own people?
Am I to give birth to a flood? That is the task of Enlil. 
The gods commanded total destruction; Enlil committed an evil act against the people.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Athrahasis tablet 3
(enki saves a select few humans, orderes them to build boat)</p>

<p>Now I will show a few select fragments of the tablet of Enki and Ninmah. Which is about failed human creations/experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>...the senior gods oversaw the work, while the minor gods were bearing the toil. The gods were digging the canals and piling up the silt in Harali. The gods, dredging the clay, began complaining about this life.</strong>
....
<strong>Let Ninmah act as your assistant; and let Ninimma, Cu-zi-ana, Ninmada, Ninbarag, Ninmug, ...... and Ninguna stand by as you give birth. My mother, after you have decreed his fate, let Ninmah impose on him the work of carrying baskets.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>failed experiments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ninmah took clay from the top of the abzu in her hand and she fashioned from it first a man who could not bend his outstretched weak hands.
Second, she fashioned one who turned back (?) the light, a man with constantly opened eyes (?).
Third, she fashioned one with both feet broken, one with paralysed feet. ?She fashioned one born as an idiot. 
Fourth, she fashioned one who could not hold back his urine. 
Fifth, she fashioned a woman who could not give birth. 
Sixth, she fashioned one with neither penis nor vagina on its body.</strong> 
...
<strong>this was Umul: its head was afflicted, its place of ...... was afflicted, its eyes were afflicted, its neck was afflicted. It could hardly breathe, its ribs were shaky, its lungs were afflicted, its heart was afflicted, its bowels were afflicted. With its hand and its lolling head it could not not put bread into its mouth; its spine and head were dislocated. The weak hips and the shaky feet could not carry (?) it on the field. She went nearer to Umul asked him questions but he could not speak. She offered him bread to eat but he could not reach out for it. He could not lie on ......., he could not ....... Standing up he could not sit down, could not lie down, he could not ...... a house, he could not eat bread. Ninmah answered Enki: &quot;The man you have fashioned is neither alive nor dead. He cannot support himself (?).</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(A fertility godess Ninmah is hunted by other Gods after trying to save a failed experiment unmul/umul.) </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>My city is ruined, my house is destroyed, my child has been taken captive. I am a fugitive who has had to leave the E-kur, even I myself could not escape from your hand.
Enki replied to Ninmah: &quot;Who could change the words that left your mouth? Remove Umul from your lap (lines fragmented)
Ninmah could not rival the great lord Enki. Father Enki, your praise is sweet!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will now show the final tablet: The lament for Eridug. Which presumably states the departure of the Gods from earth presumably shortly before or after the flood. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The roaring storm covered it like a cloak, was spread over it like a sheet. In the city, the furious storm resounded ...Eridug was smothered with silence as by a sandstorm. Its people...
Enki stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. For the sake of his harmed city, he wept bitter tears. Its lady, <strong>like a flying bird, left her city.</strong> The mother of E-mah, holy Damgalnuna, left her city. The divine powers of the city of holiest divine powers were overturned. <strong>The divine powers of the rites of the greatest divine powers were altered. In Eridug everything was reduced to ruin, was wrought with confusion.</strong>
The evil-bearing storm went out from the city. It swept across the Land -- a storm which possessses neither kindness nor malice, does not distinguish between good and evil. <strong>Subir (fiery rock) came down like rain. It struck hard. In the city where bright daylight used to shine forth, the day darkened. In Eridug where bright daylight used to shine forth, the day darkened. As if the sun had set below the horizon, it turned into twilight. As if An had cursed the city, alone he destroyed it. As if Enlil had frowned upon it, Eridug, Ec-abzu, bowed low.</strong></p>

<p>A second time the storm destroyed the city
(fragmentend lines) 
main gate. The storm dislodged its door. ...... It stacked the people up in heaps. ...... on its own destroyed it. It turned ...... into tears. ...... defiled ......
..... It distorted its appearance. ...... It distorted its appearance. It circled its ...... wall. It overturned its foundations. Throughout his city, the pure, radiant (?) place, the foundations were filled with dust. <strong>It cast down its ziggurat, the shrine which reaches up to heaven, into a heap of debris.</strong> The loftiness of its awe-inspiring door-ornament, befitting a house, collapsed. It cut down the gate, its Great-Ziggurat-of-Heaven-and-Earth-Covered-with-Terrible-Awesomeness, its shining door, and it broke through its bolt. It ripped out its doorframe. The house was defaced.
.....
<strong>Ka-hejala and Igi-hejala, the doorkeepers of the house, ....Prematurely they destroyed it utterly.</strong></p>

<p>Pain ....... The area became entangled in wild thornbushes. It ...... wild thornbushes.</p>

<p><strong>...... far away ...... the great gods. The lord Enlil, king of the lands, looked maliciously at Sumer. He demolished it. He destroyed the Ki-ur, the great place. He razed with the pickaxe all of the shining E-kur.</strong> He destroyed it but did not abandon it -- at the lunches, in his great dining-hall, they call his name. (people continue worshipping after the Gods destroyed the great cities and left)</p>

<p>Aruru, the sister of Enlil, destroyed her city Irisajrig. In Kec, the creation place of the Land, the people saw inside its holy sanctuary where daylight had been unknown.</p>

<p>The lord Nanna, the lord Acimbabbar, destroyed his city Urim. He decimated the Land with famine. He committed a sacrilege against the E-kic-nu-jal. He struck at its heart.</p>

<p>Inana, the queen of heaven and earth, destroyed her city Unug. Fleeing from the E-ana, the house of seven corners and seven fires......</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Enki does not seem to destroy his own house, but instead evildoers destroy his. Enki allways seemed to like humans, as he co-created them.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...... and may he restore it for you.
Do not hide like a criminal .......</p>

<p>At the giguna shrine, the sacred house, evildoers ....... The E-unir -- the shrine raises its head as high as heaven. Its shadow .......</p>

<p>At the great gate, the lion-faced gate, the place where fates are determined, evildoers ....... They set fire to its door. Ka-hejala and Igi-hejala, the doorkeepers of the house, ....... ...... Enki, at the ...... place, ...... its people. ...... the destroyed place, the abzu ...... the powers of the Anuna gods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so first off, you should watch or read mauro biglino, he is an ex translator for the Vatican and has translated some of the oldest texts known to man and has some very interesting information. Second, as I have seen others say, this story doesnt go back far enough to be our creation story. Look at the creation mythology from the dogon tribe in Africa. Look at their insane astrological knowledge and the nommo creation myth. They also believe other species have visited us and fucked with our DNA since the nommo left. Anyways I really liked your post and just thought you might be interested</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember when I thought like you too. I believed the gnostic teachings whole heatedly. Fell deep into the trap you&#39;ve fallen into. The haughty arrogance, &quot;sigh&quot;, the feeling of power over all religions, as you were above them all, directly &quot;in touch&quot; with God. But in all this suppression of the ego as you call it, you haven&#39;t noticed that you are more egomaniacal than ever before. Just re-read the tone of your writing. You aren&#39;t closer to God at all, just closer to your ego. God is everywhere and in all things sure, but he hates the sin and not the dinner. He has given 1000s of years for humanity to turn back to him. Yet you continue the practices if the Nicolaitians, which God hates. You remember them from the book of Revelation? </p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as a Christian &quot;Mystic.&quot; That&#39;s just another word for worshipper of secret knowledge. Jesus taught nothing in secret. </p>

<p>And you continue to twist my words, I didn&#39;t say God created all this madness on the Earth, I said we did, by following the path of your religion, knowledge as God. </p>

<p>I said the only followers of Jesus follow his teachings. Not a secret teaching. You don&#39;t believe in the words that came from his own mouth on what defines a Christian. You arrogantly remove him as the head of the body of Christ and seek to install yourself in that place bypassing the gate, whom Jesus is by his own words, and have the nuts to call yourself a follower of Christ. No man comes to God but by me. That&#39;s what he said. I didn&#39;t tell you how to worship, I said do whatever you want that&#39;s your choice, but it is 100% at odds with the teaching of Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully understand what gnosticism is. I fell for it wholly. Read every single manuscript available. Defended it just like you do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is, the true deception, which has been working mind you, is that &#39;Satan&#39; is God of this world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Jesus went into the desert and Satan tempted him with all the splendor of this world, did he not have the power to give it? He was given Dominion here as it was taken from us when we disobeyed and fell from God&#39;s grace. </p>

<p>Lucifer as Christ? You&#39;re a Mason. And what do Mason&#39;s follow? The religion of Babylon. Their symbolism is present in all religions save true Christianity. Before the flood when these beings ruled us as gods, what type of sacrifices did they require? Human. All these ancient diety worshipping religions required it. When Cain killed Abel, he had turned to these &quot;gods.&quot; He was marked so that no man could harm him. And his lineage, that of the builders, the Masons. </p>

<p>The way the world is today, especially in America though it is now global, can be directly connected to the rule of the &quot;Masons&quot; and their heirarchy. Did you know just like the Bushes, Saddam Hussein was a 33 degree Mason? They&#39;ve been playing both sides of history using the Hegelian doctrine of order out of chaos to swing the minds of men to a desired state.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence you can find the core principals of your religion in the works of Hermetic teachers, from the writings of Blavatsky, from the channellings of Thoth, from the books of Albert Pike and Eliphas Levi. It&#39;s satanism shrouded in the veil of Christ. And it is heresy of the highest level. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real god would never dare ask for sacrifice as the old testament God does.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ taught that He was the gate, the judge, that no man may come to God but through him. Gnosticism teaches that you don&#39;t need Jesus to get to God. Just a direct connection by your own actions to raise yourself into God&#39;s kingdom. It&#39;s self promotion. The same thinking of mankind when they built the tower of Babel. </p>

<p>Christ also taught nothing in secret, but the definition of salvation by gnosticism is illumination by secret knowledge and following this patg. There is no secret teaching of Christ. He taught openly, where all Jews gathered. Not in caves. </p>

<p>The actual teachings of Christ rebuke gnosticism wholly. Sorry.</p>

If you have these burning questions there are plenty of resources to find out exactly how carbon dating works and then you can really decide if it&#39;s something you can get behind. It really bothers me this notion that people need to explain to you something you already doubt then you ask condescending questions without having any knowledge of your own on the subject. You don&#39;t seem open minded yet you think you are which is probably more dangerous imo. Also wtf is &#39;Scientism&#39;? Are you antiscience because you&#39;re too lazy to look for answers yourself and if it isn&#39;t neatly packaged and delivered to you than it must be some conspiracy to trick you into believing something that&#39;s false? The reference point for carbon dating is the degradation rate of carbon isotopes. The fact that you dont know this very basic tenant of chemistry and the carbon method verifies my suspicion that you really dont know what you doubt or what you believe because you dont even try. Pls read something then come back with an open mind after educating yourself first instead of throwing stones. Fucking humans i tell ya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres fringe scientists and geneticists who believe theres evidence, this is just a Google search away to find them: </p>

<p>1) <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2011/05/scientists-alien-genes-in-human-dna.html">http://humansarefree.com/2011/05/scientists-alien-genes-in-human-dna.html</a> </p>

<p>3) <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/alien-code-in-human-genes_n_3034876.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/alien-code-in-human-genes_n_3034876.html</a></p>

<p>All I am saying is it is a fascinating theory, and I&#39;ve come across some scientists who claim humans contain alien DNA and who have claimed to identify it. Some of them are fringe, from other countries, etc. I mean HuffPost has published stories on this, this theory isn&#39;t even that outside the mainstream. Arguably, it is just as viable a theory as evolution, and hasn&#39;t been throughly investigated or debunked at this point.</p>

<p>As for Neanderthals, I think you&#39;re missing my point. EVERY human today contains Neanderthal DNA. Interbreeding doesn&#39;t make sense in many areas that we&#39;ve never found Neanderthals. For every human today to contain Neanderthal DNA that means Neanderthals needed to interbreed with every modern anatomical human in existence at some point in human history, which means we would have needed to potentially live and interbreed for many generations across the planet everywhere for this to be possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no evidence of a human living today who doesn&#39;t contain Neanderthal DNA. That&#39;s highly improbable considering almost all of the evidence indicates Neanderthals lived in medium sized groups without modern anatomical humans, and all their burial cites only contain Neanderthals. Theres no evidence they even lived together, let alone interbreed for centuries to the point where our DNA became so commingled they essentially developed some kind of new hybrid species (us). If such interbreeding took place, and our species and theres merged into some kind of hybrid wheres the missing links? Wheres the burial cites of humans and Neanderthals? They don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>My argument is merely that the mainstream scientific explanation is not logical, lacks evidence, and is incomplete given the amount of DNA each of us contain and doesn&#39;t even align with the theory of evolution. It also doesn&#39;t explain why or how Neanderthals went extinct.</p>

<p>As for your final point, I&#39;m aware theres millions of years between hominids and modern humans. What I said was poorly articulated but what I was trying to get at is there is no missing link. We have early hominids, they then completely disappear, there&#39;s a massive hundreds of thousands to millions of years gap (depends your analysis of the fossil record), then modern apes and Neanderthals, then magically modern humans appear out of nowhere. </p>

<p>The even odder thing is that many of those ape and even old world monkey species still exist or at least their ancestors do but yet no Neanderthals or hominid species remain. The only thing still present is a single hybrid species that seemingly came out of nowhere to create modern humans of which there is no fossil evidence to indicate how or where we evolved from.</p>

<p>The only true evidence we actually have is our own DNA which is a hybrid mess of DNA from everything from old world monkeys to Neanderthals with a bunch of new DNA we can&#39;t identify that seems to be responsible for our most intellectual traits which were not present in any hominid, Neanderthal, or ape / monkey species previously.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what Gnosis means? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theologians don&#39;t necessarily follow any single denomination. You&#39;re trying to imprison christians by putting them into a box</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it does matter, there are a few Masonic offshoots of Christianity, using biblical texts other than those in the textus receptus. You will find that in both the Jesuit/Catholic Vulgate, and Mormon Bibles, and Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, and now in the ASV and NIV, that words are changed and verses deleted which deify Jesus. I&#39;m not imprisoning anyone, I&#39;d just like to know what brand of Christian is ok with the worship of the serpent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I dont follow any serpents, your whole illusion that I do, is the serpent that is the ego inside of you, creating that illusion and believing in the false ego/adamic illusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you not call yourself a Gnostic? Let&#39;s read that part of the Gnostic interpretation of the Garden of Eden:</p>

<p>&quot;But what they call the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is the Epinoia of the light, they stayed in front of it in order that he (Adam) might not look up to his fullness and recognize the nakedness of his shamefulness. <strong>But it was I who brought about that they ate.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Did you miss the part where Jesus caused them to eat of this tree in the Garden? The tree of &quot;Knowledge&quot; or Gnosis? Interesting that Jesus Himself never taught about this other version of the garden story, at every asking He only confirmed the old testament God, He met the ridiculously long requirements of the messiah from this God, He lines up EXACTLY with the prophesy of all the old testament prophets of this God. The same God. It&#39;s the only reason you even know about Him today. If he didn&#39;t meet all those requirements and fulfill the prophesy he would have been lost to history, yet here we are. </p>

<p>These texts are quite interesting to say the least. You claim these beliefs are something that existed prior to Jesus, and yet the only text written of them is supposedly a vision from the resurrected Jesus. The other stories such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh is written from the point of view of the fallen angels. 1 Enoch and that story are the same pre-flood series of events from opposing viewpoints. Those beings, the Annunaki, were locked up in the abyss according to Enoch. According to the book of Revelations, during the end times one of the trumpets releases these evil spirits which again begin to propagate their Bab-el (gate to God) agenda. (interesting fact, the building the EU resides in was constructed to look like this ancient tower, and homage to the tower of babel is paid to it in the lobby.) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am the way the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to say that He and the Father are one and that He is in his disciples and his disciples in Him. The Holy Ghost. And while your definition of the Holy Spirit is correct, you go on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just dont trust the OT, Judaism (the system the killed and crucified him) and which to this day does not acknowledge him, and I refuse to believe that the god of OT, which Ordered Moses to Murder Cannanites, their children and rape the women, flooding earth, regretting it, and being jealous (a human low consciousness emotion) is the true god, compared to the loving and forgiving God that Christ talks about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Jesus However says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘The Scripture cannot be broken’ (John 10:35). He referred to Scripture as ‘the commandment of God’ (Matthew 15:3) and as the ‘Word of God’ (Mark 7:13). He also indicated that it was indestructible: ‘Until Heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law, until all is accomplished’ (Matthew 5:18).</p>

<p>When dealing with the people of his day, whether it was with the disciples or religious rulers, Jesus constantly referred to the Old Testament: ‘Have you not read that which was spoken to you by God?’ (Matthew 22:31); ‘Yea; and have you never read, “Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babes thou has prepared praise for thyself”?’ (Matthew 21:16, citing Psalm 8:2); and ‘Have you not read what David did?’ (Matthew 12:3). Examples could be multiplied to demonstrate that Jesus was conversant with the Old Testament and its content. He quoted from it often and he trusted it totally.</p>

<p>Throughout the Gospels, we find Jesus confirming many of the accounts in the Old Testament, such as the destruction of Sodom and the death of Lot’s wife (Luke 17:29, 32) the murder of Abel by his brother Cain (Luke 11:51), the calling of Moses (Mark 12:26), and the manna given in the wilderness (John 6:31–51).</p>

<p>The list of examples goes on, and the evidence is clear: Jesus saw the Old Testament as being God’s Word, and his attitude toward it was nothing less than total trust. Many people want to accept Jesus, yet they reject a large portion of the Old Testament. Either Jesus knew what he was talking about, or he didn’t. If a person believes in Jesus Christ, he should be consistent and believe that the Old Testament and its accounts are correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And your next statement is completely false:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those groups simply hijacked it</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Created</em> would be the term, not hijacked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>isn&#39;t that funny how even my username shows I&#39;m anti theosophical, anti-mason, anti-jesuit, and no matter what, you&#39;ve already created your mental illusions about me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See what you did there at the end? The allusion to mental incompetence? A few times now you&#39;ve done this. Your consistent use of both ad-hominem and shame, betray the supposedly ego-less and humble God loving enlightened illuminated character you claim to portray. Let&#39;s see what Jesus said about such condescension:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of your feelings on the subject, Gnosticism is a creation of these groups. It is their &quot;religion.&quot; Let&#39;s read some Albert Pike:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If lucifer were not god, would Adonay (the God of the Christians) whose deeds prove cruelty, perfidy and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would Adonay and His priests, calumniate Him? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, lucifer is god, and unfortunately Adonay is also God, for the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods. darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil, as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to reiterate. You take a little Christianity, Buddhism, a pinch of Catholicism (paganism), throw it into a giant bowl of Plato, mix it all up and voila... Gnosticism.</p>

<p>Lets look at the founder of this &quot;Christian&quot; brand of gnosticism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinus_(Gnostic)">Valentinus</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s quite clear that he made it all up. Jesus never spoke of &quot;Archons&quot; or &quot;Pleroma&#39;s&quot; or &quot;Sophia&quot; or a &quot;demiurge&quot; or &quot;Horos&quot; (sounds just like horus?)</p>

<p>I remember exactly the feeling I got from Gnosticism. It was powerful indeed. Felt good, almost great. But then I had an epiphany and got ahold of the real thing. It&#39;s way better. Instead of a &quot;fire&quot; inside me aching to get out, and lashing out in condescending ways toward anyone who questioned me, it is just pure love. Tear inducing love. For everyone, including you. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have wasted this much time attempting to show you where that teaching leads. I guess you&#39;ll have to figure it out yourself though. That&#39;s what it took for me. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY could have talked me out of it for years I was so engrossed. But I saw the error in the teachings eventually thanks to a great friend, who persevered through my ignorance. Jesus is the only Gate to God. </p>

<p>Actually he did:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. Matthew 13:10-11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He could have told his disciples deeper teachings, like about the soul and awakening, but to the commoners, the uneducated, those still stuck in judaism, he used parables to simplify</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. nd he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables. Mark 4:10-11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also the secret teachings that are received as direct experience from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit via soul awakening and illumination (like paul blinded on the road to Damascus) is described here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</p>

<p>AND we were warned EXACTLY of this &quot;other Christ&quot; a Christ which the disciples did not teach about!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, I have no qualms w God/Christ. My issue is with the jews saying that god is a genocidal blood thirsty jealous and angry god, instead of Christ&#39;s God of Love, forgiveness, and Prodigal Son based Father with Arms open</p>

I&#39;m not imprisoning anyone, I&#39;d just like to know what brand of Christian is ok with the worship of the serpent.</p>

<p>The debate club and theologian club I am part of there are evangelicals, catholics, orthodox, and lutheran. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you not call yourself a Gnostic? Let&#39;s read that part of the Gnostic interpretation of the Garden of Eden:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont. I call myself and Christian Mystic who studies all angles</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you miss the part where Jesus caused them to eat of this tree in the Garden? The tree of &quot;Knowledge&quot; or Gnosis? Interesting that Jesus Himself never taught about this other version of the garden story, at every asking He only confirmed the old testament God, He met the ridiculously long requirements of the messiah from this God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus was efficient. He knows its better to merge his teachings with the Jews, so they will change into the New way. He broke a ton of jewish rules that are against god, &quot;teaching on the sabbath, etc&quot;, and he never discussed what happened in the garden because it wouldnt matter. People wanted salvation and to have a way out of life/existence/the imprisonment of this world&#39;s BS and he was the answer.</p>

<p>He focused on parables, beatitudes, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debatable. You&#39;re saying the God of Love and forgiveness of Jesus is the same one to order the genocide of a whole groupd of people (Cannanites) murder of their children, rape of their women, murder of their men, flooding earth then regretting it, and being Jealous?</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t sound to you like humans attributing things to god? You know who does like that? Radical muslims praise god and say its god&#39;s will for their terrorist acts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You claim these beliefs are something that existed prior to Jesus, and yet the only text written of them is supposedly a vision from the resurrected Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re forgetting all the other religions that predate Jesus, Taoism, Buddhism, Sufism, Druids, Bon, Dzogchen, zoroastrianism and many many others who also have texts and discuss human origins. Lets take the later for example and explore shall we?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism</a></p>

<p>They also have a system of gnosis/awakening/enlightenment. What do they say about human origins?</p>

<p>We also have other views like these:</p>

<p>Biggest reason why I entertain the gnostic version of Eden and the gnostic view of the god of OT/Jews as different than Christ/God is because of Jewish God&#39;s wife Asherah which was covered up and hidden in ancient Jewish culture so they can be monotheistic.</p>

<p>There&#39;s SO MUCH MORE than meets the eye in terms of the version of Christianity you have been taught. Of course at church, they tell you not to question anything or god will be angry at you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘The Scripture cannot be broken’ (John 10:35). He referred to Scripture as ‘the commandment of God’ (Matthew 15:3) and as the ‘Word of God’ (Mark 7:13). He also indicated that it was indestructible: ‘Until Heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law, until all is accomplished’ (Matthew 5:18).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fine, except the Law is Mystical in Nature, its written in our heart/soul:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>KJV Romans 2:29 &quot;But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul was a mystic too having been illuminated by the Holy Spirit and also talks about the law being the heart, the soul, love of God and the Soul within</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When dealing with the people of his day, whether it was with the disciples or religious rulers, Jesus constantly referred to the Old Testament:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course he did, if you wants jews to leave the old way, you have to speak their language. The same thing happened in Tibet when Buddhism started taking over places that were still based on Bon. They merged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few times now you&#39;ve done this. Your consistent use of both ad-hominem and shame, betray the supposedly ego-less and humble God loving enlightened illuminated character you claim to portray. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re taking me out of context. Your ego, just like mine, is gross, a mask, a shadow. But the soul which is in you, I love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s see what Jesus said about such condescension:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re debating. Plus, I have already dealt with your type, those that call me blasphemers and having a different spirit than the Holy spirit and this and that, and then cant stick around when I discuss topics which completely changes the perspective of the OT. Those who are lesser educated on these things and are brainwashed by a literal interpretation and denomination do these things and there is no normal debate to be had. But I can have these debates with theologians and professors who openly discuss these possibilities in a calm and collective manner, without calling someone a blasphemer and name calling, You havent shown yourself to be the latter</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If lucifer were not god, would Adonay (the God of the Christians) whose deeds prove cruelty, perfidy and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would Adonay and His priests, calumniate Him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except im anti-lucifer and believe christ and his version of God is legit. So its not me</p>
