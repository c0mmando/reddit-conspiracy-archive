       Having read all 46 pages of the indictments today, and having read into the backgrounds of those indicted, I can report that we have yet another false mainstream media narrative being pushed down our throats. Surprise, surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The indictment of Manafort and Gates is centered around the lobbying practices of Manafort, who worked as a liaison between Ukraine and the Podesta Group, well before Manafort ever worked for (and was subsequently fired by) the Trump Campaign. This is an indictment of the democratic lobby, further weakening Obama, Clinton, Podesta, and the DNC. There are even some mainstream outlets beginning to admit this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also report that George Papadopoulos was a 30-year old unpaid volunteer for the Trump campaign who was repeatedly contacted by two Russian contacts who took interest in him after he told them he worked for the campaign. These two contacts attempted to set up a meeting with the Trump campaign via George, citing that they had “dirt” on Clinton, but after repeated attempts by George to set this meeting up, his requests were denied by the Trump campaign, not surprisingly. The FBI indicates no wrongdoing in George’s actions themselves, only in that he lied about when he was contacted by these Russian contacts—he said it was before he started working for the campaign, but really it was after. I’m sure he about shit his pants when the FBI showed up. If he had told the truth, there would’ve been no indictment, as the FBI has no contention with George’s actions themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never trust the mainstream media. Don’t even trust me. Read the documents themselves. Do your own research. Don’t grasp at straws just because Trump’s skin is an annoying shade of orange.

       Trump is never going to be impeached. Many of us came to terms with that a long time ago. I'm comfortable with a pile of his associates going to prison. So far we have three from his campaign, one of which will probably avoid prison by cooperating.
      </p>

       It'll certainly be interesting to see who goes down next.

       I don't know how I even implied that he's effective. Nothing about his time in office has been what I'd describe as effective.
