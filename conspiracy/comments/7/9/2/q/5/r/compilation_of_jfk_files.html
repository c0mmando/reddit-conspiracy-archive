<p>EDIT: Ruby, Oswald and Tippit possibly met in Ruby&#39;s nightclub a week before the assassination.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Only two organizations knew the Kennedy parade route, the Secret Service and the Dallas police. Ruby was in the police circle and urged Oswald to take a job at the Texas Schoolbook Depository. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32144493.pdf">https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32144493.pdf</a></p>

<p>EDIT: It is likely two people were involved in the shooting. The other being Officer JD Tippit.</p>

<p>EDIT: One bullet was shot from a bridge across the parkway in front of Kennedys motorcade according to the Surgeon Generals report.</p>

<p>EDIT: Bullet hole in the windshield of the presidents car?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the compilation. Makes it easier to dig through at work. Ive seen a few people talking about the bullet in the windshield and comments about it not being shattered. I read a while back that there was a bullet in the frame of the windshield, that could explain it. Nobody can say for sure since bush senior had the fucking car destroyed.</p>

<p>Also zapruder film was edited so it&#39;s not an entirely legitimate source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confirmed that there is a report of some guy saying at a dinner party that he saw a document that said there was a second shooter.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen his name pop up more than usual lately. </p>

<p>I would dismiss that theory but if true that Tippit and Oswald were seen at Ruby&#39;s club together I&#39;d give it second thought. There is also a documentary series on the History channel in which they focused on Oswald&#39;s escape plan. If I recall Oswald encountered Tippit near his &#39;safe&#39; house and/or a bus stop that would&#39;ve provided convenient transportation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A popular theory on that encounter is that Oswald and Tippit were working together and met at Tippit&#39;s car. Oswald figured out that he was about to be killed in a double cross, and killed Tippit and ran into the theater.</p>
