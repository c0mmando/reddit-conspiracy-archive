       Why does the assassination footage not match the autopsy? Why did none of the parkland doctors recognize the autopsy photos as what they saw? Where is the missing brain matter? Just a damn hoax. You all got Hollywood psy oped. The FBI and secret service controlled every aspect of the autopsy. You people gotta wake up. Why would you believe a word from the government or media after 9-11? Why would the CIA openely admit to telling you nothing but lies, but you believe released documents from the CIA. Wake up!

       except the vegas shooting was a false flag snare designed to trap and document those who speak out, frankly we are at the point where should ignore it and move onto the next, it looked like a hoax by design

       Are you gonna take on the government as a whole? I'm in. If we want to pretend that a small number of insiders in the dep state are responsible for everything? I say fuck that. It is the whole government. Not say just Clinton, or just trump,etc.

       you could be right, maybe they even faked his death and this is just a hoax to scare future leaders, i do see the possibility in that

       but if he is legit he is most defintely a hero to the people for speaking out against the evil that rules this world

       Yeah right. If they really killed JFK they would have strung George bush sr, and LBJ up by their balls. No way. That is why nothing makes sense. Do you see? If it doesn't seem legit, then it is not. Go watch the JFK "assassination" no blood, brain matter, and he holds for the Hollywood prop to explode that was put on his head buried under make up. It is called Hollywood prop effects. We have been fooled by them over And over again.

       JFK assassination was a hoax. It was made to look like really LBJ and bush were responsible with Oswald as a patsy. Really it was just a hoax. Creating the future "bad guys" and "good guys".

       They wouldn't really kill a white president. Maybe a brown skin guy on the other side of the world, but they wouldn't really kill him here. JFK faked his death. He was part of the entire event. Why doesn't the assassination footage match the autopsy photos? Where is the missing brain matter? Just a hoax rereleased to justify another hoax (Vegas( as a real event. Just like JFK.

       That the JFK shooting was a hoax. He faked his death. Everything is planned ahead of time. If it is to all be released they sure did stop it from all being released. The rest will get released around another hoax pre planned event. To distract from that also.

       Sir please go watch the assassination footage, and compare that with the autopsy photos. Then watch the parkland doctors not recognize the autopsy photos, and describe completely different wounds. Then verify that the secret service and the FBI controlled every aspect of the autopsy. Then check into Commander humes drawing of the autopsy which he wasn't even allowed to examine the body to make the drawing in a damn autopsy?!? Commander Humes even admitted that one day someone will find the errors in the autopsy, drawings, and assassination footage. As far as never seeing a prop explosion on someone's head it happens all the time. They fake head shots all the time. It doesn't have to be CGI, or a rubber head. It is simple friend. Done everyday in t.v. Land.

       If his head was shit with a high powered rifle it would have exploded most of his head with brains and blood everywhere. We don't see that in the assassination footage, and that footage doesn't match the autopsy. It was a hoax. How could the autopsy, and assassination footage differ to such a degree unless it was all staged?

       Not like a balloon. Fucking mist? come on. There would be blood spurting out everywhere. The assassination footage is very tame compared to the crap they tried to pull at the autopsy.  Similar to a water melon shot with and high powered rifle. None of the parkland doctors even recognized the autopsy photos. How could that be? Where is his missing brain matter? Did you see a ton of brain matter come out of his head? The autopsy shows a lot of missing brain matter.

       Oishilover75 you are stupid. Why doesn't the assassination footage match the autopsy? Why don't the doctors at parkland recognize the autopsy photos as what they seen? Why did the FBI and secret service control every aspect of the filming of the autopsy? Why doesn't the assassination footage look like a real shooting? Why didn't his head explode with blood and brains everywhere? That's what happens to a head with a high powered rifle. It is merely a hoax, and the stupid released documents will tell you nothing if any truth. How stupid are you people? They lie to you about everything under the sun and you eat it up every chance you get. After 9-11 why would you believe a word that comes from the government? Wake up!

       What? You told everyone it's convenient that the release date of the JFK files is so close to the Vegas shooting, someone points out the flaws in your statement and you switch to a different topic?
You even put 'wake up!' at the end of that statement. Are you a troll?

       What flaws you dumb ass mother fucker. You need to learn to read. Check back here in about an hour I will erase this entire post. I said the JFK files were released after the  Vegas shooting. I also said the Vegas shooting was a hoax and staged around the time of the JFK files. I really don't give a fuck anymore. Fuck you and fuck r/conspiracy. Just a bunch of clueless talking monkeys

       You specifically said the JFK files were released to distract from Vegas. 
You can't spin this in your favour. 
But talking to you is probably pointless anyway, because you're either a troll or a snowflake, so you'll just keep on talking about how you're so smart because you 'figured out' things people have talked about for decades and everybody 'needs to wake up.'
So, basically more of the same. People like you are a dime a dozen on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So go ahead and delete it if you want. I don't care. Just couldn't stand the lack of selfreflection, but I made my comment on that and now I'll continue to lurk quietly on this subreddit to laugh about people like you.

       everything that makes the mainstream media is a hoax. we all know JFK (as well as RFK) were killed by the CIA. No one ever is going to release this info, but from whats actually released, you can work it out yourself.  But who's gonna bust the CIA? anyone who tried to before has died an "accidental" death or "suicide"

       There is no need to read through pages and pages of released documents. Just look at the footage, look at the autopsy, and none of the parkland doctors recognized the autopsy photos.its a hoax if the autopsy doesn't match assassination footage. The doctors at parkland didn't recognize the autopsy photos.

       They are mocking all of you. They have you debating a hoax Vegas shooting for two weeks, then they got you debating a hoax that is over 50 years old. Congratulations r/conspiracy you haven't figured out a damn thing in over 50 years. Keep up the hoax debate as real events. It is all that is important to tptb.  You are all playing right into their hands.

       you are stupid. Why doesn't the assassination footage match the autopsy? Why don't the doctors at parkland recognize the autopsy photos as what they seen? Why did the FBI and secret service control every aspect of the filming of the autopsy? Why doesn't the assassination footage look like a real shooting? Why didn't his head explode with blood and brains everywhere? That's what happens to a head with a high powered rifle. It is merely a hoax, and the stupid released documents will tell you nothing if any truth. How stupid are you people? They lie to you about everything under the sun and you eat it up every chance you get. After 9-11 why would you believe a word that comes from the government? Wake up!

       Tbh everything you said was discounted as soon As you said "great timing trump" in the title.  That shows You obviously don't have an understanding of how or why these files were released when they were. Someone in the thread had to explain it to you.   You're either a troll or incredibly ignorant.   Nobody is taking you seriously.

       Sir please go watch the assassination footage, and compare that with the autopsy photos. Then watch the parkland doctors not recognize the autopsy photos, and describe completely different wounds. Then verify that the secret service and the FBI controlled every aspect of the autopsy. Then check into Commander humes drawing of the autopsy which he wasn't even allowed to examine the body to make the drawing in a damn autopsy?!? Commander Humes even admitted that one day someone will find the errors in the autopsy, drawings, and assassination footage.

       I am aware of him I think. I think he said it was a dummy, or something similar. No damn dummy. JFK just played dead like a good boy. I'm sure he was thoroughly rewarded for his part. It is all controlled at the top. If he believes it is a Psy Op hoax well good for. him. Now we just gotta get the rest of you on board.

       insignificant Commander Humes said one day someone will find the errors in the autopsy photos, with the assassination footage, etc. Some of us are noticing it, and piecing it together,  but very few are.

       All of which can be explained by the fact that his head did not explode from the crown... including the need to doctor photographs and cut frames from the assassination footage.  What you miss here in all of this is one very simple question:

       Why
       <em>
        not

       They wouldn't dare.Maybe some brown skin fucker of the other side of the world, but not a white man president here at home.No way. They would have strung LBJ, and Bush Senior up by the balls. No one would have participated if it was a real murder. Good luck getting people to go along with assassination of the president. It is much easier to fake it to avoid any future trouble. More work at first, but in the long run if the people become aware you can say see it was a hoax. No one died. As soon as we gather the Lynch mob for justice.

       I didn't want to get into booth or the Lincoln Assassination, but that was a Freemasonic hoax also. Where do you think they got the idea of the Kennedy assassination from? Why is their so much coincidence between the two? Lincoln was basically a man in a mask. Look up the official photo design for the penny. It is supposed to be Lincoln posing for the picture to put on the penny. Look closely to the oultine jaw area, and around his visible ear it is a man in a mask.

       Do a quick Google of battle field photos. Where is the blood, the carnage, all the bodies? Hoax! You might say Lincoln wasn't a Mason. He was a Mason character puppet. Look up Mason giving speech about Lincoln's connection to Masonry. His last now living descendants was a Mason. He said he would petition Lodge number 333 when his presidency was done. Look up the fact they fed the Civil war photos admitting it was the Smithsonian.

       You're confusing the disgusting act of posing corpses for faking photos.  Here, I can even name specific examples (which I notice you haven't).  Google, "The Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter."

       No I'm not. I said they arranged "corpses" ( just people laying on the ground, some dummies), and faked the whole thing. Battlefields where thousands supposedly died with no one there,no signs of battle, or blood, wounds, nothing,. You show me some proof of real blood she'd and war! You people believe the parts you want. You say oh they admitted to faking this,but they didn't fake that. Ok they faked this but didn't fake that. Make your damn mind up. It is either fake or not. If something was faked they could fake everything. You are being very foolish to think otherwise.

       So not only were the Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations faked, but also the entirety of the Civil War?

       Yeah the Civil war was staged also. You done good. I feel like I wasted my time talking to you. What is that unbelievable? Where is the limit on what you believe is staged?  Dismiss me instead of verifying my claims. Sounds about right. Don't waste my time you talking monkey. All you have to do is verify what I say, but you are so brainwashed you can't even fathom the idea.
