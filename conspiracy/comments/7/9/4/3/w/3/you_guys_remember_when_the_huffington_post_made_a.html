       Being part of the MSM and pushing insulting jokes is a big thing.  With that kind of comment, we should expect CNN to be allowed to toss insults as if its nothing at all......and when people complain, CNN can just tell people to grow thicker skin.

       The solution to SJW snowflake syndrome isn't to become bigger snowflakes. You're racing the perpetually offended to the bottom. You're acting the same as huffpo does but lying to yourself that you aren't.

       My response has nothing to do with protecting anyone's snowflake status.  Is that all you have?  Just claiming everyone is a big baby while ignoring the message you send by advocating for the MSM to insult large portions of the population without reprecussion?

       I didn't advocate the MSM insulting anyone, I advocated people growing up and not crying over people being mean to them. I also really question anyone gets legitimately offended by the term goy, it's made up religious bullshit anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in this context, they weren't insulting anyone but Bannon, who isn't actually antisemitic, with a reference to a Beyonce song.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only is a nothing insult upsetting people, it's upsetting people on behalf of someone else.

       See, you don't get it.  It's a principled matter.  The issue is about the standard by which we hold the MSM.  Saying people should grow up and have thick skin works on the play ground only.  In adult land we have to be consistent with a message and a standard by which we are all held to and especially the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead your message is more of the same.  Ahhh.....just a nothing burger....they can say whatever they like.  Then the media will have people mocking other groups of people entirely and using them to shame others.  As if we haven't seen a slow evolution in the media to be biased to one group or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all of a sudden you step up and speak like an adult when at first you start with the roasting of "snowflakes".  Or were you just starting with the cool easily upvoted and "edgy" comments before you laid down some truth bombs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you not see your own behavior here?  Can you not see the parallels?

       If you hold the MSM in anything other than abject disdain I don't know what to tell you. No, telling people they need to have thicker skin is a pretty standard reaction to the oppression olympics and I am consistent in calling out reactionaries from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a nothing burger, frankly, because the entire tone of this thread is people taking personal offense to an insult (really a joke, but alright) lobbed at Steve Bannon - that is virtue signaling and it's repugnant on both sides of the isle. I also really doubt anyone is legitimately offended by the term 'goy' so the outrage is completely disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't blame me for using the language that internet debate has descended into, friendo, I didn't define the terms but I'll apply them equally to either side of the stupid identity politics that is distracting the masses from actual issues. Interestingly enough, Steven Bannon is a major player in that distraction technique so this entire thread is layers of irony.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine Bannon probably laughed at the headline, if he were familiar with Beyonce's work, he does have a sense of humor.

       Germans were sent to death camps under the Eisenhower administration. Therefore goys were sent to death camps.

       Logically why did Hitler sent Jews to work camps, because Judea declared war on Germany and palnned to boycott the German economy, also becaused they needed people working in manufacturing to provide the German troops. Wow logic works both ways. Shilling hard today, aren't you?

       I'm sure you're trying to make a point here. What I'm saying is that slurs, like swears, have different strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling someone a 'goy' is super unlikely to upset them because there's no history behind it. If they're aware of the term at all, it's probably from old Dean Martin roasts.

       Quoting slogans is a poor replacement for thinking. Although 'feels over reals' is a better desciption of your own argument. You
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       like 'goy' is equal in strength (as an insult) to 'kike' or 'slant eye'.
