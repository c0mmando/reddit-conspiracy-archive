       I have come to this page everyday to hear anything new about the shooting because no one else is reporting about it. This whole thing infuriates me. 59 people dead and it's just swept under the rug? This just blows my mind how quickly people forget.

       Personally, I think what we are seeing right now is Vegas corruption in action. Full overdrive that shit is.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people want to spout theories about hoaxes, false flags, arms deals gone wrong, etc. I think it's a little simpler than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude was fucking crazy, killed a lot of people. MGM, after the fact, has realized that they severely fucked up in this situation and could have prevented it if they had done a better job with security. And now they're doing their best to cover it up, which includes the Sheriffs department and possibly, but not probable, the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       MGM just doesn't want to get sued, so everyone is withholding information.

       But why would the FBI and LVMPD let them get away with that...if that were the case? Wouldn't they want to stop all these crazy theories and just out the MGM for negligence. Cause right now it's the FBI and LVMPD that are looking negligent imo.

       Man, I'm mad too. I just don't understand with all the technology we have and the amount of cameras that should have caught this guy, they can't figure out any motives, leads, timeline, or if he had any help. It drives me crazy and makes me so mad the more I think about it.

       Agreed. There should be more answers. "Ongoing investigation" and "nothing is owed to conspiracy theorists" doesn't explain away the inconsistencies. We need to demand truth and transparency.

       Doesn't matter. The heat should be pressed on Mandalay Bay on how it happened and where is the footage and transparency on the 'worst mass shooting in US history'. It all reeks. If a love one of my actually died that day, I'd be their worst nightmare. I'd do everything in my power to question and get answers. Why are we not seeing this?

       I just assume most injuries are from the shooting and not from running away.

      <p>
       But who knows, I suppose an older crowd could get hurt just from running away.

       Found an
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-las-vegas-shooting-20171003-story.html">
        article
       </a>
       that said that a hospital with 100 injured had 80% from gunshot wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       80% of 600 is 480 which still seems high.
I'm not claiming it can't be done with the number of shots we hear in the numerous videos of the event. But it's unlikely they all came from the 32 floor of the Mandalay Bay since it is high up compared to the crowd. If a bullet doesn't hit a person immediately it would hit the groud. Plus you can't change the angle of a shot that much from that distance.

       Yeah, the Hollywood sex abusers, JFK files, and everything else has everyone's eye now. I'm more worried about why was 59 people murdered and many others injured and mentally scarred. I really couldn't care less about a rich man using sex as a tool for other rich people to get movie roles. Why were these innocent people murdered?

       Agreed. There should be more answers. "Ongoing investigation" and "nothing is owed to conspiracy theorists" doesn't explain away the inconsistencies. We need to demand truth and transparency.
