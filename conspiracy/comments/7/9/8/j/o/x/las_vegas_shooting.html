    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think what we are seeing right now is Vegas corruption in action. Full overdrive that shit is.</p>

<p>A lot of people want to spout theories about hoaxes, false flags, arms deals gone wrong, etc. I think it&#39;s a little simpler than that.</p>

<p>The dude was fucking crazy, killed a lot of people. MGM, after the fact, has realized that they severely fucked up in this situation and could have prevented it if they had done a better job with security. And now they&#39;re doing their best to cover it up, which includes the Sheriffs department and possibly, but not probable, the FBI.</p>

<p>MGM just doesn&#39;t want to get sued, so everyone is withholding information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found an <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-las-vegas-shooting-20171003-story.html">article</a> that said that a hospital with 100 injured had 80% from gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>80% of 600 is 480 which still seems high.
I&#39;m not claiming it can&#39;t be done with the number of shots we hear in the numerous videos of the event. But it&#39;s unlikely they all came from the 32 floor of the Mandalay Bay since it is high up compared to the crowd. If a bullet doesn&#39;t hit a person immediately it would hit the groud. Plus you can&#39;t change the angle of a shot that much from that distance. </p>
