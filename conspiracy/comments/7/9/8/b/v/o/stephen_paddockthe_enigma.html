<p><a href="https://imgur.com/zokEiOW">https://imgur.com/zokEiOW</a></p>

<p>Why does he have a gunshot wound to the chest with a partially drying bloodstain if he “committed suicide by shooting himself in the head?”  Why did his suicide land his body in an odd position atop an AR-15 rifle?  Why was there a bipod used for shooting in the prone position set-up over his dead leg?  Why did he choose to wear bedroom slippers and gloves to carry-out such a sophisticated operation where he planned to ultimately end his own life?   </p>

<p>Why did photos of his dead body sprinkled with shell casings get leaked immediately without a single still CCTV image of him in the hotel’s vicinity within the past 10 years turning up?  </p>

<p>Why do Steve Wynn’s intelligence reports contradict the information being dripped from government agencies?  </p>

<p>Why was his marksmanship unaffected by his alleged abuse of alcohol and benzodiazepines?  </p>

<p>Where are all the interviews with the employees and fellow customers of the gun stores and shooting ranges he inevitably patronized a la fellow “gun nut” Adam and mommy Lanza?  And, why was there such a huge stack of unused expensive ammo left piled in the corner of the hotel room? </p>

<p>Why does the LV Sheriff, who bravely spoke-out to the Feds during the Bundy Ranch debacle look like a his family&#39;s being held hostage, and why does he keep openly weeping at press conferences while an eagle-eyed agent breathes down his neck? </p>

<p>And lastly, why are these multiple agencies doing such a bad job lying to us this time?  Are they getting lazy, complacent, did a part of the plan go wrong, or is that part of the agenda this time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Maybe I wasn’t clear with what I said. I agree with the placement of the revolver if it was a suicide via gunshot in the mouth. My issue is the arms being down by his sides and the gun above the head. A gun above his head like that would result in an arm extended out wide or above his head. Just my 2 cents, and I could be wrong </p>

<p>Everything you ask is spot on. </p>

<p>I am glad you mentioned the deterioration of Lombardo. I myself wonder how the sheriff went from looking like a no-nonsense, in-charge guy to basically being Tweak from South Park, all over the course of a few days.  Maybe creepy agent-hovering-over-the-shoulder and the lying </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean just look at the stares in the two right photos.  If you really want to feel sad for the man, rewatch his first interview right after the attack.  He was confident and sure in what seemed like everything he said.  Now, he looks as though the guilt and anxiety of not being able to do his job is crippling him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told my husband that the sheriff was professional and Impressive. That was Monday morning. By Friday, my husband saw his first press conference and was like, &quot;what?

    <div class="md"><p>So I completely agree that almost every detail about this whole situation makes almost zero sense but I do have one possible theory on the odd gun placement on his legs... </p>

<p>This idea only works if paddock actually did shoot himself (which im not convinced of, but I obviously could be wrong)...If he had been sitting down with his legs stretched out in front of him, when he released the barrel after pulling the trigger, the gun could have landed over his legs while he fell backward...making the gun seem like it’s far from his hands. Doesn’t explain the weird half dried blood stains, but at least might explain the gun? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but why would a gun-fanatic who meticulously planned to murder as many people he possibly could drag a prone bipod up to the hotel room?  That mount is used by soldiers to maximize accuracy while laying flat on the ground.  It would not be helpful or appropriate for shooting out a hotel window...so why is it even there?</p>
