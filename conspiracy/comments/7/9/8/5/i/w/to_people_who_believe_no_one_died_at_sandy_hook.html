<p>Not the same because the Sandy Hook denialists hurt people. The Las Vegas shooting denialists are currently hurting people. They contact the families of victims and harass them. Make &quot;exposes&quot; that they&#39;re crisis actors by doxing them to all their buddies, using spurious evidence at best. </p>

<p>It&#39;s ruthless, nasty behavior. Someone loses a family member, and then suddenly their Facebook account is being filled up with messages by strangers like &quot;LIAR!!&quot; </p>

<p>The amount of effort to hire crisis actors and hoax pics like this (<a href="https://i.redd.it/03vee8upuipz.jpg">https://i.redd.it/03vee8upuipz.jpg</a>) would be phenomenal as opposed to ACTUALLY KILLING PEOPLE. Maybe Sandy Hook was a false flag. Maybe the real shooter was some government agent who walked in and executed all those kids. Who knows? Still, REAL PEOPLE FUCKING DIED. And attacking the family members of tragedies doesn&#39;t make you into some kind of &quot;hero&quot; out to defend the world from lies. It makes you into someone whose sense of morality is somewhere in between bathtub scum and amoebic dysentery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But no one was even talking about it. You weren&#39;t responding to someone, you created this entire situation because you wanted to lash out. You are engaging in a form of white knighting. There are no selfless reasons for white knighting. People do it because it makes them feel good about themselves, period.</p>

<p>It is frighteningly easy for the human mind to justify all sorts of nasty behavior using the &quot;well they deserve it&quot; mentality. Or by telling ourselves that our actions are OK because they protect a faceless person from an imagined attack in a hypothetical scenario.</p>

<p>It&#39;s OK to punch Trump supporters, because well, they&#39;re Nazis, and Nazis hurt people. It&#39;s OK to punch liberals because, well, they&#39;re commies, and commies hurt people. That is very flawed and very dangerous thinking. And it is exactly the thinking you&#39;re engaging in right now. You don&#39;t get to just go off on people, unprovoked, just because you&#39;ve decided that those people are less than human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody should be aware of the hybrid false flag/hoax theory or nothing makes sense and people will get stuck arguing a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that people died, yet others are faking it to push a narrative. Most Sandy Hook parents aren&#39;t 24/7 on TV pushing for gun control, yet a few of them are more vocal about pushing political agendas. The whole thing makes more sense when you consider it may be a hybrid event, with most deaths real, but a few actors to push a narrative.</p>

<p>A lot of people here remember when one Sandy Hook kid was listed as dying in Pakistan as well. It&#39;s stuff like that that causes confusion and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>[AMA Request] The &quot;Real people, Not actors&quot; from the Chevy commercials by hookahman in IAmA
[–]Cyrusk4 [-1] 1 point 1 month ago 
Well, if you live in Southern California you&#39;ll always hear the &quot;So Cal Honda Dealers&quot; or &quot;Helpful Honda&quot; ad spots on the radio or commercials. Seems similar. I&#39;m one of the &quot;Helpful Honda team&quot; -- it&#39;s pretty much all &quot;real&quot; --- we really do show up, surprise people and give away shit. But they&#39;re legitimately excited and grateful (especially if we are helping out people in need which we do a lot.) I&#39;m not so sure about Chevy, though, because there&#39;s nothing that interesting about just seeing a car with some stupid feature. It&#39;s a bad marketing campaign (not to toot our own horn).</p>

<p>Some of the people propagating this have a straight up mental disorder. Just read some of the comments here. The idea a &quot;false flag&quot; can occur that kills real people doesn&#39;t even cross their mind. I don&#39;t believe Sandy Hook was really a false flag but it COULD have been. If it were, it still involved a real shooter and / or real victims. Yet, maybe as a way of sheltering oneself from the horrors of the real world, it&#39;s necessary to pretend such victims never happened, that such things cannot really occur, that it&#39;s just some dark cabal doing it all. </p>

<p>Seriously, kick rocks dude. I think people died at Sandy Hook too, but this post is stupid. This is literally the place to ask questions like &quot;did they make the whole thing up?&quot;. That is what we do here. If you don&#39;t like it, go edit something.</p>
