<p>...What about when the statute of limitations were not in play? Did Corey Feldman name his abusers then? Shockingly, recent evidence shows that in 1993, when Corey Feldman was just 22, the child actor did indeed tell police the names of his sexual abusers . . . and they did nothing.</p>

<p>In 2013, when Corey Feldman began speaking out about Hollywood pedophilia in his book, Coreyography, Radar Online uncovered a secret police recording from 1993 in which Feldman stated he had been molested as a child in Hollywood and even named those who did it. For legal reasons, the recording had the names edited out; Feldman identifies them in his memoir as &quot;Ron,&quot; &quot;Tony,&quot; &quot;Burnham&quot; and &quot;Crimson&quot; — all pseudonyms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having just read Feldman&#39;s book, Brascia is such a close match for &#39;Tony Burnham&#39; it&#39;s very difficult to imagine that it could be anyone else. The most you could say is that Feldman is mistaken because he didn&#39;t directly see the abuse.  (Not my position!  I believe Feldman.)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The friend mentioned it, and talked about Haim&#39;s mother chasing the abuser off, but AFAICT in published interviews his mother still says Haim didn&#39;t ever say anything and nothing happened and won&#39;t you all shut up about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Impossible. He said that if he named anyone, he would be killed. </p>

<p>So now he has named several people, that were not important enough to follow for child abuse because they were going after the “big fish” MJ, yet powerful enough that the mere mention of their names would bring either a lawyer or hitman to your door.</p>

<p>Yet nothing happened to him then, but with all the attention of the world on him now, still no names.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Radar Online said they have the recording and they know the names.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feldman identifies them in his memoir as &quot;Ron,&quot; &quot;Tony,&quot; &quot;Burnham&quot; and &quot;Crimson&quot; — all pseudonyms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, that&#39;s &#39;Ron Crimson&#39;, &#39;Tony Burnham&#39;, and &#39;Ralph Kaufman&#39;.  The ones mentioned in the recording would presumably have been &#39;Ron Crimson&#39;, who abused Feldman repeatedly, and &#39;Ralph Kaufman&#39;, who assaulted him once.  &#39;Tony Burnham&#39; abused Heim and thus presumably would not be in this recording.</p>
