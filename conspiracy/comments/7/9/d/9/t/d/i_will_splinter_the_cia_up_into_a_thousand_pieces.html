       There was a huge post yesterday with some people claiming there isn't a source for this quote. This quote has appeared on this sub for at least a few years. It pops up now and again. Every single time it's posted, people claim no source exists or they claim this is just some internet rumor. That's why I posted this today.

       Yes. This quote isn't new. There's been debate about it for years. Just cause it's been used, does validate it. Just cause I say this, it also doesn't mean I invalidate it.

       There is
       <strong>
        A LOT
       </strong>
       of debate about if JFK actually said this.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Go all the way to the bottom of page 2, under "Kennedy's Bitterness")
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And President Kennedy, as the enormity of the Bay of Pigs disaster came home to him,
        <strong>
         said to one of the highest officials of his Administration
        </strong>
        that he wanted "to splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's kinda hard to disprove (and prove) that this is what was actually said. I don't doubt anything. Even the quote you have is incorrect. The only thing that –
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       – he said was "to splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds". Thats the whole quote. It could be taken out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Who was the "one of the highest officials of his Administration"?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was at least a middleman that passed the quote onto the publication. The middleman could have misheard, misquoted, or even, made it up. Even if JFK said it directly, still, you would have to trust the publication in what they're saying. Even though it would not have happened, the concrete proof and evidence is if he ever said it on record, as in, on video, voice recording, a tweet (obviously not much we could've done back then)

       Thanks for the article but it's third hand at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a newspaper article that says that someone says that JFK said something but it's posted here regularly like it was straight from his lips, usually with a picture of him and quote marks around it to add weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand there is a long audio recording of JFK saying that journalism is undermining the US cold war efforts and that is not mentioned.
