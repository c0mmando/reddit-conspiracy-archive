        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They are making traveling more expensive and more difficult than ever.</p>

<p>Last night I &quot;pre-checked&quot; into my flight only to have to pay extra for seats I already bought! </p>

<p>As people praise automation and technology, essentially I was doing the job of somebody else before I even arrived at the airport. It feels like you are saving time, but it actually made me feel more stressed and irritated. But maybe they can remove more workers as more and more people learn to check in on their own - kind of like the self checkouts at Wal-Mart.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they are making traveling harder, more uncomfortable, and more expensive every day. Every citizen is treated as a potential terrorist.</p>

<p>What would be the motive behind limiting travel to a select group of people?</p>

<p>I think that travel helps people open their eyes and mind. In order to break paradigms and learn, one sometimes must access different cultures and lives, and while the internet may allow that, it doesn&#39;t replace real life experience.</p>

<p>I remember my 10th grade teacher told us if we were to do <em>anything</em> life, we should leave our home towns and travel. We can always come back, but we need to see the world to learn.</p>

<p>Further, I feel it promotes yet another feeling of isolation. Most people work their lives to death, and vacation and travel may be the only break from the monotony and drudgery. Making it more difficult to travel keeps people feeling trapped and isolated.</p>

<p>Of course, it could just be about money, as most things are.  However, I feel they could still make their billions even without such discomfort and expenses. With that being said, I think it goes back to power. By limiting travel, &#39;they&#39; can limit our world.</p>

<p>This is a shorter post. My flight is about to take off. I&#39;m so glad I paid the 25 extra for the 6 inches of leg room.</p>

<p>Btw I&#39;m extremely petite, and I find planes very uncomfortable. I feel for people who are tall or larger!! : (</p>

<p>If you think I&#39;m wrong, explain why.</p>

<p>I never understood these comments that contribute absolutely nothing to the discussion.</p>

<p>It is absolutely forum sliding. It happens immediately when I make any post.</p>

<p>I hope that anybody who disagrees with me will be willing to actually do so without attacking me.</p>

<p>Long-range bus services are providing free drinks and snacks, free media and Wifi as well as more legroom and higher frequency schedules.  </p>

<p>Nearly all trains have been upgraded in order to expand their routes as well as meet current standards for high-speed travel.</p>

<p>This is in addition to local public transportation, where costs were slashed by almost 50% two years ago for people buying monthly (or longer) passes.  </p>

<p>While I hate Airbnb, it has also made the idea of traveling friendlier and more accessible ...</p>

<p>the geniuses behind this terminal thought it’d be a nice touch to add a screen from which oligarchs can watch and jeer at the unwashed masses. The idea clearly being that this would add to the experience and provide additional entertainment for the mega-rich.

<p>If you&#39;ve never been anywhere else in your life, you think your way is normal no matter how fucked up things are. Perfect e.g. is North Korea.</p>

<p>Another idea? Driverless cars. TPTB seem to be pushing this concept really hard. Young people are sucking it up because it seems like such a scifi thing.</p>

<p>But I can see the back end of this and it&#39;s not so great. When all cars become self-driving, nobody will know how to drive a car anymore. Imagine how easy it would be to restrict someone&#39;s mobility just by denying them &quot;transport privileges&quot;. Also will be keeping a record of every place you go, when you went and how long you were there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the world is turning into WalMart, we&#39;re the products, and management wants to keep track of us at every step from the time we&#39;re born until we die.</p>
