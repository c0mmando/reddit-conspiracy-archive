       One often hears flat earthers say that there is no curve. That if you calculate the curve and go test it out in real life, you can see things in the horizon that you should not be able to see if there was a curve. And that bodies of water dont curve either and that some laser measurements over large canals show this. And that one can see distances on sea that one should not be able to see if there was a curve. Also the balloons that have been sent up with cameras that dont have fish eye lenses show a horizon that does not curve.

       Have you looked at the way they test? For example over x amount of distance there is an y amount of curve. If the curve is such that the other shore should be hundreds of meters under the curve, how come it can be seen by naked eye?

       Oh, dear.  You really are serious aren't you?  Those laser experiments are flawed and do not show a flat earth unfortunately.  Looming is a very simple explanation for what is happening.  But you can do a cool experiment yourself tonight.  Find yourself a nice body of water and head down there for sunset.  Lie on the floor with your heard on the ground and watch the sunset.  As soon as the sun disappears below the horizon, jump up to your feet and you will see it set again.  Because the Earth  has a curved surface, as backed up by:

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we have time zones, seasons, day and night etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that if you travel in the same direction you eventually return to your destination.
      </p>

       Exactly the same thing would happen on a flat earth as well. The sun moves beyond the vanishing point of your vision which is due to perspective and when you rise up you will see farther and the sun will come back into view.

       You don't know what those words you're using mean.  If the perspective argument was true then the sun would change size greatly over the course of a day.  It doesn't.  You see more from a standing position precisely because the Earth is curved.  Eesh.

       It does change size. Have you ever looked at how small it seems when it comes into view compared to how big it is when it is right over your head? Or how it shrinks when it goes back out from view.

       It does not change size in any way like it would if any of the flat-earth theories were true.  But, the funny thing is that you've actually got it mixed up.  The Sun LOOKS bigger when it is on the horizon because of an optical illusion called the Ponzo Effect.

       It doesn't.  It only appears to thanks to an optical illusion.  Over the course of a year it appears to change size because of the Earth not having a perfectly circular orbit.

       Because for a flat Earth to work, the Sun would have to be travelling over it's surface. That means that it would get closer and further away from you at different times of the day.  So it would change its apparent size relative to your position on the Earth.

       Of course you have! You're claiming that light acts in a way which goes against our current understanding. All that science we've conducted in space is fake, so there's actually now no evidence for all that physics we've been using.

       So how do you account for light which clearly comes from a long way away?  How do you account for countless observations of the universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant have it both ways and just pick and choose your science. It's all built off of itself. One thing means this, therefore that. You throw in something like a flat Earth and the non-existence of gravity and all of our observations are null and void. All that science collapses.

       It's not just about 'frequency'. There are so many properties and different wavelengths in light. These differences give us information about where that light has come from. It is not from 'lights in the sky's.

       I think there is some merit to what they are doing but, are coming to the wrong conclusions ultimately. The earth is hollow and there are beings within in that transcend and craft our own perception of reality. We are not lowly humans on a ball earth of infinite nothingness. We mean something and are here for a reason. I'll convert any atheist or flat earther to hollow and possibly growing earth within one night of some drinking supplemented with some good weed.

       Certain 'drugs' open your mind and re-wired the brain. It's no different than being blind without correct glasses and seeing perfectly with the right prescription glasses. Give your friend your glasses and it may be blurry as all. That's there experience. They need to find the 'right prescription'. Some find it in alcohol, weed, or psychedelics. The first two will take longer but, can lead to the same conclusion ultimately. Hope this makes sense.

       Do you know what a scientific theory is?  I'm assuming you don't have a car, or ever use one.  You definitely don't use planes either do you?  Because, why would you trust your life to a mere 'theory'.  If I were you, I'd go and boil some water and put your hand in the pan.

       "Gravity" can hold all of the oceans of the earth stuck to a spinning ball that is flying through space but a helum balloon can defy it... An insect can take off but oceans are stuck.

       The reason there is an 'up' or 'down' is because of gravity.  What direction does a helium balloon go in space?  It doesn't go up or down because those terms don't apply.  Things only rise and fall in their mediums due to their density BECAUSE OF GRAVITY.  Without gravity there would be nothing to pull the objects down in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've hit on a good point though.  And that is that gravity is a very weak force.  So weak that you i can raise my eyebrows with the muscles in my head.  So weak that I can jump completely off the ground.  But not so weak that it doesn't bring me back down again.  That's the part you're forgetting about.  Gravity works because of a cumulative effect.  The larger the mass, the stronger the force.  You need a huge object to generate enough gravity to have a planet such as ours. The difference between the oceans remaining on the surface (although that's not strictly true because of evaporation and wave action) and a fly taking off is that the fly is applying a force in opposition to gravity.  The oceans are not.

       That has not been proven. There could be an up and down just because there is an up and down. Gravity has never been found or observed. Before gravity everything was explained by density and boyancy, there was no need to have any magical forces pulling objects to each other.

       Dude.  Up and down are relative terms.  Up and down are relative to the behaviour of objects on the Earth.  Objects moving up and down on the Earth do so as a result of their interaction with the gravitational force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things WEREN'T explained by bouyancy and density beforehand.  There was an attempt made by using the 'Aether' but that's outdated and proven to be incorrect.  Hey, let's go back even further shall we?  Before we knew more about science, everything was explained by Gods.  No rain?  Pray to the rain God!  Sun rises in the morning?  Being pulled on a chariot by Apollo!  But we don't believe those things any more because we learned that they're not accurate.  Just like the Earth being flat....

       And you can't prove your own existence either can you?  Gravity is a force which can be observed thanks to the way it affects objects which interact with it.  You can't directly observe magnetism but I don't hear you saying magnets aren't real (although you could be one of the ICP if your understanding of science is as it seems).

       But how can you predict your existence to me? How do I know you're not a computer? Or someone just pretending to be you? Now, it may be logical to assume that I am talking to a real person, but if I decide that I won't accept any evidence which comes from you yourself, then it becomes very hard for you to prove that you exist.

       But, you do understand about how you see magnetic fields. You're right. We don't see the field with our naked eyes. We can 'see' it by seeing how it interacts with objects. That is also exactly how we can observe gravity. We observe the effects it has over objects. Just as iron or copper filings are pulled into formation by a magnetic field, we are pulled to the Earth thanks to gravity.

       You are just assuming there is a force called gravity. You can say there is gravity but you cant demonstrate it, you can just claim that what already is happening is proving you, which is circular arguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things have always fell down in this manner, if you propose there is gravity, you need to be able to show it to me, show it affecting things. With magnets you can actually show two objects are attracted and there is no question, also you can reveal the magnetic fields themselves.

       How are you not understanding this?  The very fact that things fall to the ground is your proof. The fact that we observe the effects of gravity all through the universe if your proof. There is an attractive force is the universe which is related to mass and also to time, and we call it gravity. The word and idea didn't spring from nowhere.  Gravity is easily observable and there have been countless experiments conducted. Tesla wouldn't be arguing your points for you dude.

       Tesla had a different idea of gravity, this is what he said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "... Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing curving of the same, it appears to my simple mind that the curved spaces must react on the bodies, and producing the opposite effects, straightening out the curves. Since action and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature of space is entirely impossible - But even if it existed it would not explain the motions of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena."

       That it is completely invisible. They say all mass has gravity, yet we cant observe how this force interracts between objects. We can see that the objects move yes, but we cant see the fields of gravity that supposedly come out of these objects and attract each other towards eatch other.

       No, but you can't use a fatuous argument and not expect to have it thrown back at you. There's no proof of flat Earth. You haven't provided anything. You say you can't observe the curvature of the Earth, but only because you choose to ignore or deny the evidence. You've no proof of anything else. No pictures of the edge. No explanation for the observable universe. Nothing.

       Isn't it strange how objects on earth don't attract each other?  Take a large heavy object (lots of gravity in that) and put some small items next to it, they don't fly to it and stick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in space the moon stays in an orbit, it doesn't get closer and closer until it collides with the earth, which it should since they are both attracting each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "keeps missing the ground" explanation of orbiting is amusing, gravitational force acts on something but it doesn't get any faster or closer.

       I just realized that, when I was 16, I read a book from the hitchhiker's guide series (or one of Douglas Adam's books, at least), and distinctly recall that it was mentioned, in a metaphysically humorous way, that the secret to flying is to jump off of something and then miss the ground.
      </p>

       I think it's time to revisit that series, I was just talking about it at a halloween party the other night, coincidentally.

       Also, at what size does a large mass not have influence on a smaller one. Does the moon have smaller masses attracted to it? Or is it too small?

       We don't know everything about gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do know is that there is SOME force that makes things that are more dense sink compared to things that are less dense. We know this because, as you said, dirt sinks in water. This is something we can observe and it simply would not be possible unless some type of force was causing the movement to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the force that we call gravity. You can call it whatever you'd like really. You could call it "Banana Force" but the fact remains that we'd still be talking about the same thing.

       When I let go of a helium balloon, what force is pulling it upwards?

       It's not a force pulling it upwards. Gravity is still pulling it downwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that helium is so much
       <em>
        less dense
       </em>
       that it does not have as much of an effect on the balloon filled with helium as it does on the dirt, the water, or even the regular atmospheric air that we breathe.

       I thought you said there cant be any movement without any force acting on it. How can there be an upwards movement without it needing any other explanation than it being less dense but the downright movement cant be explained by it being more dense?

       Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. By filling the balloon in with helium you have created a new space of lower density. It has the property of being lighter than the surrounding air.
      </p>
      <p>
       The surrounding air gets pulled 'underneath' the balloon because the air is heavier. Since the balloon is filled with an area of lower density it floats on top of all the air that is being pulled down around it.

       There is only one circumstance where it can be measured.  If you do the research you will find about multiple expeditions during eclipses to try and prove that (and Einsteins theory).  They couldn't find the distortion they expected and were about to announce as much until an urgent telegram told them not to publish, the establishment had decided it was going with Einstein.

       I think I'm reading your question on a device that has a gps chip in it, which can receive timing signals sent by satellites at the speed of light so accurate that my phone can calculate the distance to those satellites based on the delay of the timing signal and then using a bit of geometry my phone can calculate my 3 dimensional coordinates anywhere on the surface of this spherical planet so accurately that some group of nerds in California was able to turn it into a game about catching Pokemon. What I'm still trying to figure out is why, with all this technology, anyone would still seriously post about flat Earth theory unless they were trying to make other conspiracy theorists look like idiots by association. Is that your goal here?

       Satelites were invented by a scifi author. Even if there are satelites, it does not explain the lack of curvature.

       A cell phone isnt a satellite phone... You can get hybrids but they are pricey. Most consumer cells phones run off of cell towers, the call clarity is better and more reliable. Satellite phones are for very remote areas or for devices that need reliable signal.

      <p>
       There definitely are satellites. This one is easy to debunk. Many people and businesses rely on satellites, I can tell you for a fact that the company I work for rents time on one and the data it provides is only possible from a very high up orbit and its moving very fast.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Even satellites with closer vantage points and higher resolutions are out of luck. NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites carry the MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument and operate only about 440 miles above the Earth’s surface.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         “With the MODIS satellite, which has a resolution of one kilometer, you’d probably barely be able to make out something like the ISS," says Herman. "If it did pass through the field of view, you might see a bright spot, but you wouldn’t see many details, so it would be really hard to identify.”
        </strong>
        And that’s only if the ISS and Terra or Aqua happened to be in the same area.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Space is big and satellites are small. Also since we all know they exist why would someone send up a satellite worth tens of millions just to get pictures of other satellites? It would be a waste of money to do so, just to prove a point that doesnt need proving. There is more than enough info that satellites exist.

       Not possible. Those balloons would have to be moving insanely fast, like impossibly fast to be possible.

        I'm not asking if they are balloons, but rather if they could be attached to balloons. Your thoughts?

      <p>
       No, I thought I was fairly clear... The speeds involved are too high for balloons or really anything in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The balloons would also be at the mercy of the winds so they wouldnt have the exact same predictable paths as we expect with a satellite. For example the company I work for rents time on a satellite and they have windows to take measurements with, requiring multiple passes of the same satellite. You can literally see it pass over the site, measure move past the site and we wait until it makes another pass from the opposite side and take more measurements. Repeat until measuring is done.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no feasible way for a balloon to replicate what that satellite does. Zero, never, no way.

       Thank you for taking the time to respond.

       I ask this because I trust that what you are saying would make sense, therefore, I'm curious what the purpose of balloon-launched satellites would be, as there seems to be solid claims that they exist. Why would they do that if the paths weren't predictable and if satellites in space could do it better? Thoughts?

       From my understanding the balloon is just to cut out a bulk of the flight. Those satellites still launch themselves from the balloon using a traditional rocket to get into orbit. There is no way for a balloon to deliver a payload that remains in orbit, its not possible.

       The only balloons we use are for weather monitoring, not geological surveying or communications. They are weather balloons.

       I'm just trying to discern where your expertise does and doesn't contribute to this, as I do appreciate the contribution. Ultimately, I'm just offering information to add to the conversation, as satellites in space may not be completely necessary to prove or disprove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that there are communication devices that do replicate what satellites do, that are strung from High-altitude balloons. And it is feasible to operate them at less of a cost than satellite tech.

       You're speaking as if you have knowledge that that is how it happens. There isn't evidence of that. How did you come to that understanding, if I may ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       The satellites that are currently tethered to balloons are not rocketed into space, they just stay attached to the balloons. They also don't require great speeds to collect or transmit data, there just needs to be a network of them, as you probably understand from your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that NWS and international weather agencies launches 2 balloons every day from over 900 locations worldwide. If they can do it, so can government agencies with deeper pockets.

       I think my post speaks for itself, 5 out of 5 dentists agree that I've done nothing but argue my position. Hopefully you'll be able to keep up next time. This post is public and everyone here gets to decide who did what, when, and how. Thank you for participating.

       I have no problem standing by my actions and words, and, as you feel the desire to call me on specific claims that I've made, I'll be more than happy to continue to respond to them.

       They used it to communicate over distances that wouldn't otherwise be possible, by sending data from a ground station and bouncing it off the balloon.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A 26 meter antenna (later named Echo) was built in Goldstone, California several miles from the Pioneer antenna to transmit voice communication. The Echo antenna included a transmitter operating at S-band (2.39 GHz), which was very sophisticated for the time. Another antenna was built in Holmdel, New Jersey to receive transmissions. Once the balloon was launched into orbit, a prerecorded message from President Dwight Eisenhower was transmitted from California and heard with clarity in New Jersey."

       I'm personally open to the idea of satellites being real but if someone wanted to fake it these could work. There are also ultra reflective blimps which I assume can be controlled better than a sphere.

       Thanks for sharing your thoughts, I can totally respect that.

      <p>
       And yes, there are facebook and google blimps and high altitude gliders among others, and, for me, I used to often ask why would they go through the trouble when...well...technology. Google owns the Cold War era NRO satellite system and shouldn't need to progress to balloons and blimps unless there was a (good) reason, R&amp;D-wise, to say the least.

       The satelloons were used by govt agencies aswell as their purported other uses.  One claimed usage was to monitor weather.

       I hear you, I find it nearly impossible to believe that bouncing signals off of its round surface produced predictable results, especially back then. But that is my un-researched opinion.

       Well, they used it to communicate long distance.  How reliably that was is anyones guess.

       If I hadn't read that article I would have come to the same opinion as you, bouncing something off a sphere seems tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you consider the signal spread though it could be that a sphere is a good way of making a narrow beam cover a larger area once it returns to the ground.

       That seems reasonable, yet almost beyond my understanding (I've studied a little bit of wave theory and radio propagation theory in my past vocation, but only paid enough attention to get the job done). I would seem to imply that there was technology to do that, wouldn't it? I don't know, I'm genuinely asking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did read that it was a passive system, which doesn't seem to support having transmitters, by definition. I am not doubting that you have seen somewhere that it does, but the NASA page at least seems to contradict that, not that I haven't seen them contradict themselves before. To be sure, I do appreciate your insight and perspective, thank you.

       Yeah I misread the beacon transmitters as comms ones.   More info:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Echo 1A spacecraft was a 30.48 m diameter balloon of mylar polyester film 0.0127 mm thick. The spacecraft was designed as a passive communications reflector for transcontinental and intercontinental telephone (voice), radio, and television signals. It had 107.9 MHz beacon transmitters for telemetry purposes. These transmitters were powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon.

       Indeed. Also, the ability to bounce radio-telephone, much less television signals off of it, intercontinentally, without a booster or repeater, is, well, also interesting. I can't get a cell signal in my bathroom, for buddha's sake (not true, but it makes for a poor attempt at comic relief, at least).

       No surprises, it goes all over the place with the slightest angle shift. But, I'm not presuming that a very strong signal does the same thing. Well, yes I am, I just don't know the facts, to be sure.

       I'm not sure if there's anything good in it, but maybe put it in your back pocket for a rainy day to see if it offers up anything about anything, whether or not it speaks to the topic at hand.

       It doesn't.  It describes the curve extremely accurately and provides ample evidence to backup the fact that the Earth has a curved surface and is generally spherical.

       Nope.  No inconsistencies whatsoever.  There are plenty of people out there doing awfully bad science.  But we shouldn't be listening to them.  The evidence is just overwhelming and has been for millennia and I just don't get how there are still flat-earthers in this day and age!

       There are flat earthers because people look up what science says for the curve to be over a particular distance and then they go out in the world and look and can see objects beyond the distance that they should see based on the amount of curvature science tells us exists in that distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are talking about people doing bad science but you are not even looked into it. Most people who badmouth these claims from flat earthers never look into them, they are so unable to even entertain the idea that they never look into the evidence presented.

       I'm sorry, but I have looked into it. I've liked into it because I have studied Geography and I have studied Physics and I understand and have tested these simple concepts.  It's bad science of the flat-earther's part because they have decided that only their own personal observations count. It doesn't matter if some incredibly intelligent and skilled pilot has flown to the edge of space and has personally seen the curvature of the Earth. It doesn't matter that brilliant engineers and computer programmers and physicists have developed satellites which have pushed human technology forward. You haven't done it or seen it for yourself and because of that, you are willing to accept all sorts of mumbo-jumbo.

       Just think. If the Earth was flat then I should be able to have a strong telescope set up on Mt. Kilimanjaro and see the Statue of Liberty. If the Earth was flat then I would be able to see the Southern Cross from anywhere in the world.

       But you say it is flat. Now,  your 'evidence' is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of perspective and the effect of topography on sight distances. BUT let's say we disregard that. Let's say that it doesn't add up and you might be onto something. So far you haven't shown that the Earth is flat. You've just shown that a calculation is off by what amounts to a pretty small margin.   So what's your evidence FOR the hypothesis?

       Not true because the air is a medium through which you cant see into infinity. You can only see so far through it. When the air is more humid and there is fog in the air the human eye cant see very far. The same kind of thing happens over longer distances.

       When there is zero measureable curve, it can be called flat.

       Erm.  There is.  It's pretty easy for any of the astronauts on the ISS to show you a curve.  The friggin Greeks figured out the curvature of the Earth in the 3rd Century BCE.  400 years ago, Isaac Newton figured out the Earth isn't a perfect sphere.

       Mate, there is so much footage and evidence out there.  You're just being willfully ignorant.  Who told you nobody 'does a 360 with the camera'?  There are multiple cameras on the ISS which film from a variety of angles.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you don't even believe in space travel, so I don't know why I'm trying to explain any of this to somebody who denies such plain facts.

       There was no 360 in that spacewalk, we never even saw the camera turn around and show us the space station and the space that is behind it.

       There are clear instances of them faking stuff. Such as wires being shown, gravity suddendly dissapearing (how is that possible if you are in space?), bubbles coming from the astronauts as if they were under water. Suprisingly they do have a space station replicant under water that they use to "train".

       I had a good search and watched a handful of videos but saw nothing at all out if the ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't find a video like the one you're describing, but that sounds like it may be a video from the KC-135 Vomit Comet which simulates weightlessness through parabolic flight patterns. Which,  by the way,  is also how they would fake it if they were going to. Which makes the wires, greenscreen and underwater tanks seem even less plausible.

       Oh, that's just part of the ruse. If all the planets and celestial bodies around us are round, it's easier to convince us that ours is round, too, right? I find the best argument to convince us it's round is the curvature of the earth.

       If we went to the moon, why are there no marks below the moon module? Why was the soft dust that the astronauts feet could stirr and leave foorprints on not affected in any way by the module descending? Even where its landing feet are there are no marks.

       We cant even get to the moon now with our technology, nasa says they "lost" the tehcnology to go to the moon. We have a bigger computer in our smartphone than the one they claimed to go to the moon with and now they claim it was some magical technology that they lost and would need to invent again in order to get to the moon...

       If it is easier than ever, why does nasa say they have lost the technology to go there? You can look up videos right now from youtube from nasa emplyees that said this, it has not been debunked as you say. They literally said it, its not something I made up.

       The ability to build machines to go to the moon still exists.  But the old technology which was originally used has been destroyed/lost. The factories were re-purposed. The moulds for the parts were destroyed.  The machines built today would use different materials and different components so we simply wouldn't be able to build a Saturn V today.  Well, you could, but it would be prohibitively expensive and a bit of a waste of time.

       In this case (with you denying historical and scientific fact), I have the luxury of being both on the side of truth and being right.

       I agree with you somewhat.  To clarify your "What?" question, I'll try to be more specific, if you wouldn't mind sharing more. Are you familiar with how light reflects off of a sphere? Does it reflect evenly or not, and is that consistent with what you observe when you worked on your project?

       Oh, dear lord, no. That's actually a question that science is attempting to solve, but with more cart in front of the horse answers. "If this is so, then this
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be the reason for it". Statements like that are purely philosophical assumptions and not based on empirical studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to argue the nature of reflectors, I was responding to the the question of "How did the reflectors get there?", and how it was an unnecessary and unproductive question.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, regardless of anyone's position of whether we landed on the moon or not, to ask a person who doesn't believe it, "How did we get the LEM onto the moon?", would be non-productive, as there is already an assumption that there can't be one on the moon, much less to answer how it got there, as proof that we landed on the moon. It's a bit circular of an argument.

       I will say that you've based some of your opinion that you've shared in our exchange on things you knew nothing about until this conversation, and it's good to continue looking deeper, if you choose to. I'm not here trying to prove anything to you, and respect that you believe what you do. I came from the same place, and to question others' ability to discern things also would be an unfortunate assumption, until they prove it to be true. There's a big internet out there, and of course a lot of it is there to make us dumber, so yay for those going into it with that concern in mind, a perspective which I'm sure we both share.

       Do you know how many of those samples that came back have turned out to be bonafide fakes? If so, would that give you something to allow that claim to be not as solid as it appears to be?

       Yes. I know exactly how many if the samples which came back from the moon are fake. ZERO.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are, however, plenty of rocks which have been sold or presented as moon rocks which have turned out to be fake.

       I'm not sure of your rationale, I am going to assume you are just under-informed. Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong has been found, on record, giving fake moon rocks to foreign dignitaries under the guise that they were real.

       There have been over a 100 rocks given to other governments by NASA, all having since learned that they are fake. It is the "who" that is doing all of the giving which should be on the table for questioning, should it not?

       Indeed there were rocks which were given to people as gifts which may not have been real. However, you will find ONE example, from the Netherlands. Not over 100. The rock that ended up in that Dutch museum was given as a private gift and was donated to the museum after the recipient's death. Holland also has legitimate moon rocks from Apollo 17 in its national history museum.

       I'm not basing my claim on one example, I just gave one example. The idea that someone will find just one example of something that could question the claim that space rocks exist is yours and yours alone.

       I think many reading this, including me, would disagree with your summary of "my articles", nor am I saying that I believe one thing or another.

       I am, however, making the claim that moon rocks are not a reliable proof that we've been to the moon, because the evidence of it shows that the rocks, handled by agents and agencies of the government (NASA, Nixon, Astronauts), were found, in hundreds of occasions, to be untrustworthy as bonafide evidence, and, also puts into question such agencies' inability to account for them.

       But that's simply not true. One rock given as a personal gift turned out to be fake. Some con men tried to sell some fake moon rocks. That's it. It had absolutely no bearing on the validity of the samples brought back from the Apollo missions.

       Not at all, many satellites are tidally locked, the moon isnt even unique in the solar system for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its called tidal locking and its relatively common. Over millions of years a little energy is lost as the larger planet tugs at its moon slowing its rotation until its "locked"

       Seriously many moons do this, its a well known phenomena.

       he first experiment at this site was conducted by Rowbotham in the summer of 1838. He waded into the river and used a telescope held eight inches (20 cm) above the water to watch a boat, with a flag on its mast three feet (0.91 m) above the water, row slowly away from him.[3] He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full six miles (9.7 km) to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical earth, the top of the mast should have been some 11 feet (3.4 m) below his line of sight. He published this observation using the pseudonym Parallax in 1849 and subsequently expanded it into a book, Earth Not a Globe, published in 1865.[4]

       It happens today, holes in formulas are plugged with fudge factors that don't even exist. The mass calculation of the universe doesn't make sense? Oh then there must be some invisible mass we can't see!  Hey presto "dark matter".

       I agree with you're call on the Universe I think there is way too much expanse for any human to measure. Even the Big Bang is all based on 'questionable' theory, However the actual fact of our planet being spherical is not base on theory it is based on solid scientific research and when a couple of people push that to the side we get crackpot theories of the earth being flat.

       I said further you move away from earths gravity the light bends differently. In a jet traveling fast light will react a certain way etc.. a balloon entering or exiting earths atmosphere will be different as well. I’m no scientist at all. But I assume everyone sees differently anyway.

       One simple way of testing this is to watch a ship go over the horizon, sailing away from you.

       It will disappear bottom first. Now if you increase your elevation even a little the boat comes back into view. This is unexplained on a FE. Elevation should have nothing to do with how far you can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good way of simply proving curvature is to do the calutlated fuel consumption of a plane or a boat on a curved vs flat plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should very simply show if you have sailed (For example) 1000 miles over a flat distance which would eat less fuel than if you had sailed over a curved surface for 1000 miles.

       You are claiming that when one is seeing ships dissapear with their bare eyes that they are going below the curve. This is not correct, if one takes binoculars and looks the ship will come back into view. If the ship was behind a horizon and you look with binoculars without rising your elavation the ship should not come back into view... but it does. This is clear proof that what you are seeing is not a ship going behind a curve.

       It would work. Perspective works in such a way that if for example you are looking at a long hall the floor goes up and the ceiling comes down and they meet in the middle and this line in which they meet is called horizon line. When you rise up you see more of the land (or water in your case) before it meets the sky in the horizon point.

       It brings objects into view that were invisible to the eye. You were saying earlier that when a ship goes invisible for your eye it goes beyond the curve. It doesnt.

       Lets say the boat is shaped like a cube for kicks and giggles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The surface area of the boat doesnt change but it still will reappear in your vision if you increase your horizon. This is also replicable with a digital camera or telescope, increasing elevation increases the amount those items can see.

      <p>
       I would argue those objects are still visible just too small to see without assistance. They would be invisible totally if completely over the horizon. Otherwise on clear days we should be able to see more than a few miles away, right? But its always the same thing curvature hides objects and increasing elevation brings them back into view.

       The vanishing point of your perspective makes things vanish before they would even go beyond the supposed curve. So what hides things is your perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were standing on a ball, you would never see the horizon at your eye level because no matter in what direction you look, all sides of the ball are bending down and away from you. Yet even if we climb to high altitudes the horizon stays on eye level. This is not possible on a ball because the horizon would not even be on eye level when you were on the ground, and it would sink down even further the more elavated you become.

       There isnt. There is some guy that put up some sticks ages ago up and after that people just believe in it. There is math but people havent actually done these things in real life. Like went in some place and looked how far they see from that place and then calculate the curve and see how far they should have seen and if these two things match. The people that have done this report that they see farther than they should.

       The Vanishing point is the horizon. Where the earth and the sky come together and meet as the horizon line.

       It should be nowhere near your eyelevel. You should be looking down. A lot. If you rise up 10 meters the horizon should go down at least ten meters. It can not go down less than ten meters because also the higher you go over a ball the farther you see and the farther you see the more the ball bends down and the lower the horizon is. If you think the amounts we are speaking of are something that need to be measured by a theodolity you are not understanding what it means to rise up on a ball.

       You dont need calculations, use common sense. Imagine you are standing over a ball. The whole surface of the ball is under you. The horizon line is where the surface and the sky meet in perspective. If you rise up a meter, the WHOLE ball is now a meter below you. If you rise up 10 meters, the WHOLE ball is now under you. How can the whole ball drop 10 meters under you but the horizon line which is where the surface of the ball and the sky meet in perspective does not drop?

       It does not matter how large the ball is, if you rise 100 meters above it, you are 100 meters above the whole ball. The whole damn ball will be 100 meters below you, how come the horizon which is where the ground (of the ball that was supposed to be 100 meters below you) is seen to be on eye level?

       "Perspective in drawing is an approximate representation on a flat surface of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The key concepts here are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Perspective is the view from a particular fixed viewpoint.
Horizontal and vertical edges in the object are represented by horizontals and verticals in the drawing.
Lines leading away into the distance appear to converge at a vanishing point.
All horizontals converge to a point on the horizon, which is a horizontal line at eye level.
Verticals converge to a point either above or below the horizon."

      <p>
       (One caution: in common speech, the words perspective and viewpoint tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an aerial viewpoint.''
      </p>
      <p>
       ''The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to foreshortening, meaning that an object's dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight.''

       Im curious as to why you dont bevel it. What tests have you run and how were the results different that what science would have anticipated.

       I appreciate the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was told all of my life to accept scientific expertise on all matters, especially of the cosmos. I was told this by being ridiculed for asking innocent questions, out of my own ignorance. It turns out that I was aware enough to see deception in the answers, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you are here on a conspiracy sub, you also surely question things. At some point, I'm sure we would agree that there is deception happening at institutional levels, whether it be media institutions, scientific, educational, financial, political.
      </p>
      <p>
       The punchline is, whatever "conspiracies" you have followed and "believe" in, whatever scientific facts you've learned through your life, I also have, and likely share a lot of that knowledge with you. I've just stopped accepting a lot of the contradictions, assumptions, and rationalizations and started looking into it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could spend hours with you sharing my story, and would love to, if you were truly interested. There is no one discrepancy in the current system, there is a multitude. The notion that we can use curvature to defend a globe earth is one of them, we can't. The only way to prove it is to show it from space. There are a lot of discrepancies for what we are being showed from space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current "system" in which there are discrepancies, isn't just referring to orbital mechanics, astrophysics, and earth science, it refers to the system of control that is inferred by almost every post on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people on this sub ask, "What's the conspiracy?", the answer is usually one and the same: OP infers that there are unspoken systems of control that deceive the public (which I tend to accept as true). Try it on for yourself, look at any r/conspiracy post, and see if that answer could be inferred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, regarding your question to me, the information is out there, yes there is plenty of bad information, but an intelligent mind, as yours surely is, will be able to find good info, if you are truly curious. You surely do that for other conspiracies, I'm assuming, as, you are investing time on a conspiracy sub.

       It would be like saying there is a system in place that forces people to believe 2+2=5, you can say that but at the end of the say we can prove that 2+2=4 regardless of what an authority says.

      <p>
       I agree with you and that is what Flat Earth researchers strive to do, as every argument about the globe and space came from an authority claiming 2+2=5, in their opinion, which, again, must acknowledge the larger system at play, as, if the larger system can control what the masses think and know about everything, history included, then we could all have been born into a world of deception and not have known it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern with gravity starts with learning about gravity and not just believing it. Newtonian gravity, which is what we all celebrate, was disproven and replaced by Einstein's theory of gravity. Many would hold the opinion that Einstein didn't disprove it, he just improved it. It is an acknowledgement that everything up to the point of Einstein, regarding gravity, didn't work as postulated by Newton.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the argument then is that for hundreds of years, a view of gravity that was not functional was good enough to celebrate and say that newton proved gravity. It reminds me of a joke regarding someone who claimed that they were as smart as DaVinci, because he
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       created plans for a helicopter that did not and could not fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Proofs" of gravity seems to put the cart before the horse. For example, before the supposed discovery of gravitational waves this year, at one time in the past, they didn't have an answer to
       <em>
        96%
       </em>
       of what should be out there IF gravity existed. So they had to name that 96% dark matter and dark energy. They did not "discover" these elements of nature, they had to name a thing couldn't explain the failure of gravity's "math".

       False. You can prove a globe Earth without NASA or the government. Im not sure what led you to believe all data comes from NASA.

       Im sorry but this doesnt actually seem to address the argument at hand. If anything you just praised the scientific process for doing what its supposed to do.

       As for proofs putting the cart before the horse, Ill have to disagree.

       We know exaclty how objects interact with each other under gravity. Can you offer an alternative that can model our universe even remotely close to what we observe?

       There is plenty out there about the world to learn about, if you're not interested in it, it's no harm to anyone to let them investigate. It is integral to the knowledge of the larger systems of corruption, so the idea that we must chastise those who seek and ask questions, or that it is a PSYop to distract and to make the "truth" community look bad, is an unfortunate position to take.

       If it means anything to you I also think that the FE movement is bad for humanity as a whole. It reinforces anti-intellectualism and teaches people to abandon the scientific method i n lieu of their feels. You literally have to ignore entire sciences and arguments to make a FE work. I could go on and on about the issues with FE but since you would rather sling mud and make up bunk positions with no support Im out.

       Some would call that a straw man argument, unless you are telling me that you are unaware that there are a multitude of high altitude balloon shots from non-rectilinear lenses (or footage with the videos corrected for the fish-eye effect, unless you'd also tell me that you don't believe in those).

       I have said this many times.. they can show me articles of whatever. I don’t believe any of it.. I just don’t trust anything and don’t believe shit. Just try to make logical reasoning in my own head. I don’t have a stand on either side here.. just don’t put my money on anything being real..

      <p>
       But just on the topic of that specific lens camera.. I could easily say they didn’t use that type of lens.. as the other side of the argument they did.. where is proof.. I’ve never seen these cameras to be honest.. I didn’t do the experiment I’ve already stated I don’t put my money anywhere.. I don’t believe shit.

       I was someone before that was funneled into a way of life and thinking. Basically who my parents raised me to be.. forced into church etc.. but as you get older you start to wonder what’s going on. I’m also investigative and like to problem solve and when things don’t add up or make sense and people want me to believe things it’s super tough. When secrets are held from the people I also just believe that there is nothing we know as real.

       Bodies of water, minus wind and gravity waves, are level with the center of gravity of Earth. Earth is an oblate spheroid, so the top of large bodies of water will be tangent to the center of gravity. That means curved.

      <p>
       Again, seems like some easy science to point to. Links? Large bodies of water curve with the tangent to Earth's center of gravity. This is easily demonstrated by standing on the beach in Key West, looking south, and NOT seeing Cuba, just 90 miles away. Meanwhile, you can stand 100 miles from Mt. Rainier in Washington and see its top. So there is no "perspective" or "atmospheric" limitation. The limitation is that water is in the way because you have to look down to see Cuba.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also the balloons that have been sent up with cameras that dont have fish eye lenses show a horizon that does not curve.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The horizon will not be curved. The horizon is a 2-d shape. A circle. You are at the center of that circle. It will not curve, it will be flat. The ground, however, will be curving away from you to the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again. And this cannot be stressed enough. THE HORIZON IS FLAT. IT IS A CIRCLE. It isn't going to bend away from you, it's going to be flat, because it's a circle and you are at the center of the circle.

       The ability to build machines to go to the moon still exists.  But the old technology which was originally used has been destroyed/lost. The factories were re-purposed. The moulds for the parts were destroyed.  The machines built today would use different materials and different components so we simply wouldn't be able to build a Saturn V today.  Well, you could, but it would be prohibitively expensive and a bit of a waste of time.

       And you can't prove your own existence either can you?  Gravity is a force which can be observed thanks to the way it affects objects which interact with it.  You can't directly observe magnetism but I don't hear you saying magnets aren't real (although you could be one of the ICP if your understanding of science is as it seems).

       There isnt. There is some guy that put up some sticks ages ago up and after that people just believe in it. There is math but people havent actually done these things in real life. Like went in some place and looked how far they see from that place and then calculate the curve and see how far they should have seen and if these two things match. The people that have done this report that they see farther than they should.

      <p>
       It should be nowhere near your eyelevel. You should be looking down. A lot. If you rise up 10 meters the horizon should go down at least ten meters. It can not go down less than ten meters because also the higher you go over a ball the farther you see and the farther you see the more the ball bends down and the lower the horizon is. If you think the amounts we are speaking of are something that need to be measured by a theodolity you are not understanding what it means to rise up on a ball.

       Just because its of a different frequency does not imply distance.

        Oh, dear lord, no. That's actually a question that science is attempting to solve, but with more cart in front of the horse answers. "If this is so, then this must be the reason for it". Statements like that are purely philosophical assumptions and not based on empirical studies.

       No, but you can't use a fatuous argument and not expect to have it thrown back at you. There's no proof of flat Earth. You haven't provided anything. You say you can't observe the curvature of the Earth, but only because you choose to ignore or deny the evidence. You've no proof of anything else. No pictures of the edge. No explanation for the observable universe. Nothing.

       That's strange. Perspective is very important in architectural drawings.
So you say you never heard of this "perspective" you don't even want to name in your own comment, while you boast about being an expert on the subject?

       "Perspective in drawing is an approximate representation on a flat surface of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The key concepts here are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Perspective is the view from a particular fixed viewpoint.
Horizontal and vertical edges in the object are represented by horizontals and verticals in the drawing.
Lines leading away into the distance appear to converge at a vanishing point.
All horizontals converge to a point on the horizon, which is a horizontal line at eye level.
Verticals converge to a point either above or below the horizon."

       ''In art, especially painting, aerial perspective refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       (One caution: in common speech, the words perspective and viewpoint tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an aerial viewpoint.''
      </p>
      <p>
       ''The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to foreshortening, meaning that an object's dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight.''

       Isn't it strange how objects on earth don't attract each other?  Take a large heavy object (lots of gravity in that) and put some small items next to it, they don't fly to it and stick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in space the moon stays in an orbit, it doesn't get closer and closer until it collides with the earth, which it should since they are both attracting each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "keeps missing the ground" explanation of orbiting is amusing, gravitational force acts on something but it doesn't get any faster or closer.

       I'm not sure if there's anything good in it, but maybe put it in your back pocket for a rainy day to see if it offers up anything about anything, whether or not it speaks to the topic at hand.

       I just realized that, when I was 16, I read a book from the hitchhiker's guide series (or one of Douglas Adam's books, at least), and distinctly recall that it was mentioned, in a metaphysically humorous way, that the secret to flying is to jump off of something and then miss the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's time to revisit that series, I was just talking about it at a halloween party the other night, coincidentally.
