    <div class="md"><p>No consensus. Split between the &quot;NWO puppet who&#39;s going to kill us all&quot; and &quot;America&#39;s savior, playing 5D chess.&quot; </p>

<p>My personal feeling, which is based on my personal hopes but somewhat backed up by what we&#39;ve seen thus far:</p>

<p>He&#39;s a &quot;Reality Show&quot; President. He&#39;s acting, sort of, except that he&#39;s always kind of playing himself. The real power is the military, which performed a coup in the last election to fuck over Hillary, who is the satanic high priestess Guccifer warned us she is. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of fascinating though, because with Hillary you knew exactly what you were gonna get. With Trump, I really still have no idea for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>used to think he was a joke, steered clear from any news about trump, didn&#39;t take him seriously, thought he was the worst because I bought into the propaganda, I cried on election night and wore black for weeks &quot;mourning the death of america,&quot; was equally relieved that Hillary didn&#39;t win, wanted to laugh in the face of any and all Hillary supporters I knew, thought Trump was the lesser evil, but Bernie should have won, then someone convinced all the shit talk on Trump was propaganda and I realized it was true, the more people shit talked him and hyped #resist, the more I appreciated him as a politcal outsider. Then learned of meme magic and the great meme war, the synchronicities of the 7, and the time travel conspiracies, and I almost love the dude, think he&#39;s halarious, and love and everyones upset about the silliest things he does like post that meme of Hillary getting knocked over by the golf ball. all in all, I think we&#39;re on the better timeline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a conspiracy here to make it seem like we are in favor but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true. This is a conspiracy forum after all, do you think conspiracy minds are ever in favor of government at all? Idk, but definitely not me. They&#39;re all in it together, and they certainly aren&#39;t working in our favor.</p>

<p>The whole election was once again a dog and pony show. Tricking people into loving the government by having a common hate for the &quot;opposition.&quot; There is no opposition in US govt, there&#39;s a singular path made by those who are psychopathic enough to reach the top. They work together to make a scheme to get us (slaves) to actually support them (not that they need support, it just helps for appearance).</p>

<p>If you wanna figure out the truth from lies you need to realize that the truth will only ever come from within yourself because you are the one that determines what you are going to believe. If you don&#39;t want to be misled, I&#39;d highly recommend taking up meditation as a hobby. Not only will it calm you down from the stress in life but it will open up neural pathways that may not have been there before. Things that are important will become more clear and things like desire and greed will fade away.</p>

<p>Having money and influence does not make you a better leader, just the opposite. People who empower themselves at the expense of others are nothing but evil. People who crave power are the ones that get it. The whole thing is just ironic and slightly funny because it&#39;s all just a big paradox.</p>
