       Kevin's smiths a good dude it's a joke about the rich and famous lifestyle a lab Charlie sheen or what people know about it. Even if he had Kevin's Smith wouldn't know, and if he did he certainly wouldn't entertain it, he has a kid and sound character.

       I'm implying that since the majority of his films were made with Harvey Weinstein, he knew exactly what was going on and said and did nothing.

       He probably did know, but also, basically all of Hollywood knew. There's no safety net for your career, there's no union to protect you, if you spoke out, your career ended. That's the problem with power and money and the safety of a rape culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you didn't say that. You used his vulgar language in his films as an example of how he's "not who we think he is". Anyone who's seen his films knows he isn't afraid of foul language. That's not proof of anything.

       Kevin Smith is as fat as Harvey, and a man. I highly doubt he was put in the same situations as pretty starlets are. Its entirely plausible that he didn't know until years later. Also, worth noting that Kevin hasn't worked with Harvey for a decade precisely because of Harvey's behavior. So there's that. But don't let facts get in the way of your little pitchfork circlejerk.
