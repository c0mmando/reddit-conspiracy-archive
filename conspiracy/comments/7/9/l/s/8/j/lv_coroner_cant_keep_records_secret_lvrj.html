       Interesting first paragraph for an article dated 9/28/17.
       <br/>
       At some point in the very near future, somebody is going to request these.  It may not solve exactly what happened but it would put to rest that no one died.

       I probably should edit the title so it's not click bait, but I don't know how.  Nevertheless, the ruling should apply to this attack.

       Clickbait in this sub would be "BREAKING! IT'S THE SMOKING GUN! IRREFUTABLE PROOF THAT VEGAS WAS A HOAX AND THE GOVERNMENT IS COVERING IT UP!" You literally just copied over the original article title. That's not clickbait.
      </p>

       That said, thank you for sharing. I find it interesting that the suit was brought by LVRJ, and that it's been going on since July (considering my suspicion that the owner of the LVRJ had something to do with the shooting)...
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if the judge had ruled the other way, I don't think it would make a difference in how the Oct. 1 shooting investigation is reported. Every single victim/victim's family is going to sue MGM and anyone else they can make a case against. Every family gets an autopsy report, every family will share that report with their lawyer, and their lawyers will leak those reports to the press if it serves their case.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have victims and families suing casinos for billions of dollars, I honestly don't know how anyone could think no one died.

       I went to the memorial for someone killed in the Vegas attack.  It would be difficult for me to believe only one or two people were actually killed.  I suppose I can see 15-20, but keeping another 40 people quiet who are supposed to be dead seems almost impossible.

       Interesting... Why would they withhold that information? The truth has to come out eventually, right? What's the value in waiting to reveal it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how does that even work? The families don't get to announce the deaths, or hold funerals? I assume if they did, it would have leaked and circulated by now, like all of the unrelated deaths have been.

       In his last press conference (10/13), Lombardo said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Fifty-eight is still the number of individuals that have died. Now, this is an important piece. 45 individuals that are still hospitalized. Some of those are in critical condition. So 58 may raise. By the grace of God it doesn't, and we shall continue to move forward, the medical profession will provide all the medical care necessary, but sometimes it's – people meet their demise outside of our control. So I'm hoping that number does not raise, but today's number is 58."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since then I've been expecting the number to rise, and kind of surprised that it hasn't.

       That is just what I think. No one has said it. The families can be kept quiet. Esp if they want to file a lawsuit. And they haven't been telling us anything on the news...they could tell us more people died when they feel like it...like they did with hard drive info and the timeline bs
