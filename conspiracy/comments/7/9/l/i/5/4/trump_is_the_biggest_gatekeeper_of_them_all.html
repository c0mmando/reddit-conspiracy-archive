       Since he's been President he has:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Promised to release ALL the JFK files.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Only released SOME, which included absolutely no new information that we didn't know before.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Claims on Twitter that by his doing he "finally" put an end to the conspiracy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All the conspiracy theorists who are also President Trump supporters buy it, and will therefore believe anything that comes out of his mouth.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is a one hundred percent gatekeeping tactic, and since he's the President he can use that power to abuse and influence other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President of the United States has unbelievable access to archives that contain many of the secrets we in this sub are trying to figure out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet some still continue to blindly worship him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop using feelings to worship the guy, use critical thinking, and you'll release that he's a complete fraud, the biggest gatekeeper of the entire history of gatekeeping.

       This is my biggest issue with the conspiracy community.  Ever since the election they have been predominately republican/Trumpers when they used to be against both parties.

       Now the former group is somehow convinced that this silver spoonfed, narcissistic, never broke a sweat, draft dodging billionaire is somehow for the working man, the military and a real Patriot fighting against the establishment.

       This JFK gambit could be the final nail in the coffin of the truther movement. Nobody talks about 9/11 anymore, and now, because of Trump and Roger Stone, looks like we are all going to be forced to forget about JFK.

       I’m glad to see this at the top. As far as I’m concerned they are all corrupt and Cheeto and old lady Hilary were no different. I’m just shocked that Trump has the blind following that he does.

       I mean a Manhattan real-estate big shot who talks out of his ass won the hearts and minds of small town America. It’s insane to me.

       I’m a yankee living in little Oklahoma. When I moved here and people heard me talk, found out I wasnt from Oklahoma, I swear the whole experience changed. Why is it he gained their trust? When I would call people on shit I was a yankee asshole.

       Trump has the following that he does largely because of techno bots. However, he also has a following because COINTELPRO in the alt media, like Israeli agent Alex Jones, have been priming their audiences to accept Trump's false populism.

       Remember, Trump himself is tied to the organized crime syndicate that helped pull off the JFK assassination. He has a lot of motive to further the coverup. Glad to see that you see this for what it is: a limited hangout operation.

       Trump can’t make them release anything.. he can demand or order or request.. but jeez.. he’s not all powerful all mighty. He’s just a president. Pretty powerful.. but still checks and balances.  If he could just force people to do whatever we would be saying that’s bad.. give it a rest..

       Not quite as good as he predecessor though, in my opinion.

       But wouldn't that make it better then just releasing nothing like everyone before? I mean he released most of them, so is that not better than none?

       I did. But I'm not sure how he can abuse others just by "gatekeeping" JFK files. The CIA and FBI HEAVILY suggested he shouldn't release the rest. And then he has said he wasn't happy about what went down. White House also said they will eventually get released "on a rolling basis". The FBI also announced they are releasing it all now.

       This JFK gambit could be the final nail in the coffin of the truther movement. Nobody talks about 9/11 anymore, and now, because of Trump and Roger Stone, looks like we are all going to be forced to forget about JFK.

       I’m glad to see this at the top. As far as I’m concerned they are all corrupt and Cheeto and old lady Hilary were no different. I’m just shocked that Trump has the blind following that he does.

       I mean a Manhattan real-estate big shot who talks out of his ass won the hearts and minds of small town America. It’s insane to me.

       I’m a yankee living in little Oklahoma. When I moved here and people heard me talk, found out I wasnt from Oklahoma, I swear the whole experience changed. Why is it he gained their trust? When I would call people on shit I was a yankee asshole.
