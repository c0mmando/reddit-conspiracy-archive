<p>Jesus...we can&#39;t let them merge our culture with the retarded republican ideology, which is what the social engineers are trying to do. Alex jones is in on this shit too, he&#39;s a plant. Ever wonder why he all of a sudden is like a super pro Fox News anti Hillary shill ? He&#39;s a puppet, a gatekeeper. </p>

<p>We need to get back to our roots and expose this plan by the social engineers to destroy our effectiveness as a resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have long histories of supporting establishment Republicans like George W. Bush, and many others too like James O&#39;Keefe. These people did not suddenly become &quot;woke.&quot; Republicans are <em>using</em> conspiracies and skepticism to lure independents to support their party. This is not the first time they&#39;ve tried it. Before Donald Trump was the outsider, they did the same thing with the Tea Party. </p>

<p>The Tea Party was discredited and Donald Trump will be too. It&#39;s just a matter of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you said, but there have been conservative people like Alex Jones and Glen Beck spinning crazy conspiracies for a long time. Have you seen Maddow&#39;s show since the election? She goes on some crazy rants and is starting to remind me of Glenn Beck a lot. The scary thing to  me is seeing people who would never believe some of the crazy shit Hannity says react as if she&#39;s preaching the gospel truth. Absolute madness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic answer, yes he was. Yeah she did a segment last week about how Russians were using Facebook ads to get people to name Pokemon after victims of police violence and put them in a gym where it happened for a chance to win a $50 Amazon card. It was a tiny ad-buy that hardly anyone probably even saw. The theory was that Russia was trying to sow division by pointing out the very real issue of police brutality in America....I guess, thanks? Haha it just pisses me off that she loves to deride other things as crazy conspiracy theories like the uranium one deal. She tried to say the Russians paid too much for a house 11 years ago as a broke to Trump for when he became president. No one thought that was going to happen in fucking October.</p>

Nobody thinks the sweet real estate deals were prepayment for him becoming president a decade later. Where did you get that?

<p>What they are really doing is selling you Republicans, but that was my original point.</p>

<p>Someone could say that George W. Bush did bad things in the past but he is speaking truthfully now when he talks about Donald Trump. Cone to think of it, there are people doing that. </p>

<p>Wrong-- Their stories/views now vs. 15 years ago -- they&#39;re far different. </p>

<p>People &amp; parties do change (verified throughout history)-- and the Republican party is changing dramatically.</p>

<p>The power in the Republican party has shifted toward those in favor of  independent, anti-establishment, populist, less traditional-conservative views. Less religious influence, and more populist. Elites are under attack. McCain, McConnell, Bush etc. are heavily criticized by Republicans. </p>

<p>The Tea Party is in power. They have not been discredited by any means-- they are winning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People used to not talk about politics much.  You used to vote, go home and shut up.  Now everyone feels the need to be a victim and conspiracy culture has gone mainstream with social media.</p>

<p>Now your grandma who has been a republican all her life is getting into alternative news sources.  This made people like Alex Jones need to evolve their angle.  Instead of being against both parties were going to rally behind Trump, because both parties disliked him and he was the underdog.  Trump was the best pick for anti-establishment.  Mainly because he has no political experience whatsoever.  </p>

<p>Fast forward a year after Trump has been elected and spent that time bashing all media that is critical of him (Including SNL which has literally made fun of every president since it&#39;s premiere).</p>

<p>How do you stop the flow of information in the information age?  Muddy the waters!  Russia comes in with its misinformation/fake news campaign which creates scandals for both sides.  Now your Everyman doesn&#39;t know what to believe anymore and just picks a news source that &#39;feels right&#39;.  However, the anti-establishment conspiracy crowd is now split into groups because all the offbeat news sources have become partisan bullshit.</p>

<p>The propoganda machine is real.  Fake news/alternative facts/spin are more prevalent than ever.  The problem is the two major political parties are the ones creating the stories now instead of the outsiders.</p>

<p>Trump has been surrounded by NWO globalists, but he was able to get rid of several of them.  Reince Priebus is one, but there are many others.  Comey is another.  Trump wanted Flynn, but the NWO globalists insisted Flynn not be selected.  Trump got the NWO globalist McMaster instead.  </p>

<p>Trump won the last election unexpectedly so the NWO globalists have been surrounding Trump with their people.  Trump has been isolated, except for Twitter.  LOL.  </p>

<p>Draining the swamp will take time because it is more deep than anyone expected.  </p>

<p>I will begin to worry when the MSM starts to praise Trump.  This will indicate that Trump has gone to the dark side.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people understand that the two party system is indeed corrupt. But you&#39;re not thinking properly - hardly anyone is.</p>

<p>You all have built a ton of erroneous presumptions based on logical fallacies.</p>

<p>The left has grown particularly bad and cancerous, so to hate them more than the right is to be labeled right wing. This is false, but people do it anyway because people can handle only chew small, simple bites of logic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s people themselves who need to label left and right, and they don&#39;t have the logical tools to do so accurately. Much of it stems from the misuse of language, and the inherent double think of political labeling.</p>

<p>Take the concept of &quot;liberal&quot; for example. If one goes to look at the language definition of liberal, and apply it in a political context, its mostly positive. However, the actual liberal ideologues do not manifest in positive ways. &quot;I want to be liberal, therefore I am, but those who are liberal stirring up all this crap are not real liberals.&quot; Another logical fallacy.</p>

<p>Then if you look at conservative, and take all the steps you did with the previous example, the exact same double think reveals itself.</p>

<p>Another example would be the Trump phenomenon. Left side lumps him into the right side. The right side lumps him into the independent category running on the right side. And all sides are hedging their bets as if he is or is not part of the establishment respectively. But, once again, people just aren&#39;t smart enough to recognize the complexity of all these perspectives. So, in the effort to dumb it down into bite sized bits they can intellectually handle, everyone is hosting a deformed sense of the truth which they use to project and lash out.</p>

<p>Instead, my solution is to forget all the social problems. They&#39;re not important in the least. If we follow the constitution and basic common sense, most of these measures will necessitate a proper fix of other issues. </p>

<p>We need to recognize the true problems: alphabet agencies, political lobbying, big pharma, monsanto, our infrastructure (roads, power, bridges, water, education, food), the federal reserve, the Utah Data Center, military spending (missing trillions), D.C.&#39;s sovereignty, our sovereignty, restoration of power to the state, the shrinking of government and social programs, taxes, the Patriot Act, Civil Asset Forfeiture, getting money out of law and politics, creating jobs, healthcare and insurance.</p>

<p>If we can afford everyone realistic paths to a middle class lifestyle (while letting people burn for their choices - minimal socialism) then we can cure to the greatest extent possible the social issues about which stupid people bicker with their feeble grasp of reason and language.</p>

<p>I apologize for making assumptions but I mistook this as a &#39;liberal tears&#39; type dig.  So we both made assumptions about each other.  I don&#39;t see how my first comment on this post is high and mighty, or how your response has much relevance though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, I&#39;m sure at some point MSNBC and CNN probably reported that the allegations of NYC illegally purging voter rolls to help Clinton win the primary was a crazy conspiracy theory being pushed by the racist/sexist Bernie bros, and the alt-right lol. It&#39;s effective though, people hear the word debunked and just accept it 9 times out of ten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right about those people, but even if they&#39;re &quot;undesirables&quot; who have done bad things in the past, they&#39;re speaking truthfully in the here-and-now. I think it&#39;s important to keep that in mind, because although I probably disagree with a lot of O&#39;Keefe&#39;s personal political opinions, his recent work with Project Veritas has been some damn good investigative journalism exposing the reality of the corporate media that usually goes unseen. </p>

<p>Wrong-- Their stories/views now vs. 15 years ago -- they&#39;re far different. </p>

<p>People &amp; parties do change (verified throughout history)-- and the Republican party is changing dramatically.</p>

<p>The power in the Republican party has shifted toward those in favor of  independent, anti-establishment, populist, less traditional-conservative views. Less religious influence, and more populist. Elites are under attack. McCain, McConnell, Bush etc. are heavily criticized by Republicans. </p>

<p>The Tea Party is in power. They have not been discredited by any means-- they are winning. </p>
