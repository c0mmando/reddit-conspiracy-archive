<p>I became a flat earth believer and advocate almost two years ago; I started seeing some of my friends ridiculing flat-earth on twitter and it caught my attention.</p>

<p>I was already a believer of other hoaxes like 9/11, the JFK assassination, Sandy Hook, the moon landings, the mars rover, etc... </p>

<p>One day I decided to look up some Youtube videos and that’s when I got sucked deep into the rabbit hole! At first I didn’t want to believe it...I honestly used to believe NASA’s propaganda/lies... </p>

<p>I felt hurt by being lied to my whole life... My entire perception of humanity and the universe was altered... Suddenly there was a mystery to be solved; there were so many questions I craved the answers to... I was starving for the truth and no amount of knowledge could satisfy my need.</p>

<p>As I pored through all the data, I ran through the numbers, and the truth became abundantly evident to me...</p>

<p>We are indoctrinated with the heliocentric model of the universe before we even learn how to walk...</p>

<p>From the moment of birth we are desensitized and indoctrinated; we are poisoned physically, mentally, and spiritually...</p>

<p>Nothing is more important than the flat earth; it is the mother of all conspiracies... they’re hiding more land and they’re hiding the truth...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? Flat earth predates modern history. Also, for the most part the masses already see us as &#39;crazy&#39; and don&#39;t care to be &#39;waken up&#39;. Sounds like you have a bit of grandeur going on. Take a step down from your made up pedestal. I&#39;d rather talk to a flat earther than a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; who talks about government and if we could just get the right people in everything would be farts and lollipops. At least the flat earther has an open mind to the far out.</p>

And to be honest I don’t believe shit.. flat earth regular earth.. old earth.. new Earth.. I don’t believe shit. Why it’s warmer closer to equator.. Alaska has months of low light and in the summer it’s completely daylight for about 23 hours almost 24 in one day. I lived there.. saw it with my own eyes.. don’t jump too deep before you’ve traveled your flat earth. But again.. I don’t believe shit </p>

<p>no. Flat earth was accepted science for millennia. And since the introduction of globe earth theory, the debate has never stopped, regardless of how many times globe earth has been debunked....the debate has been ignored and suppressed by TPTB though, especially since the fraudulent space programs started. It only seems more prevalent these days due to the internet and the rate at which information can be exchanged.     </p>

<p>And if you objectively look at the science behind flat/globe earth...you will come to the correct conclusion that it is in fact the <strong>globe earth</strong> that is the psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many years is &quot;last few years?&quot; Have you heard Owl City&#39;s Firefly? That song is about flat earth. Without a doubt, Very sutterly. Even the fucking train set on the floor in the video is in the shape of the flat earth model. </p>

<p>And so many of NASA&#39;s ISS videos have things that either look or sound bollocks. Like so many. Go on Nasa&#39;s page and watch them yourself. The Italian astronaut even talks about AVR and demonstrates the technology in another vid. So its surely not that stupid to assume they can use it to fool the public? </p>

<p>Im not saying its flat. Im saying alot of things about NASA seem bollocks and there are clear Flat earth references from 2009 and earlier so im asking you when did this psyop begin? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe. </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just finished watching/listening to that and I have to say, I was very impressed. Especially with the commentary that started at about 16min 30 secs. Was the guy speaking reading from the Edward Hendrie&#39;s book, &#39;The Greatest Lie on Earth: Proof That Our World Is Not a Moving Globe&#39;, or was he giving his own commentary?      </p>

<p>The part when he rightfully compares math to a language, and says that math can be used to tell people things that do not coincide with physical reality, or to put it another way, math can be used to lie...that really hit home.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will almost always get a response like this when flat earth is mentioned. Even here of all places.     </p>

<p>Flat earth is probably the most attacked topic i have seen. Far more so than many topics that have 0 science to back it up.       </p>

<p>It was the amount of attacks it got that really caught my eye before I woke up to it. It took some time and study...and a long denial phase, but I eventually could not deny the science.        </p>

<p>I admit that my mistrust for the establishment encouraged me to consider the possibility of a flat motionless earth, but the science behind it was the nail in the coffin. Its really obvious when you allow yourself to be objective and ignore the lifetime of brainwashing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not, and before you go any further.....       </p>

<p>Though I am unable to verify it my self, I think that the stars and planets and &quot;space&quot; are much much different than what is generally believed.       </p>

<p>I tend to lean towards the idea that &quot;space&quot; is actually filled with a liquid...or perhaps a dense gas of some type. That though it&#39;s obvious that we can see something up there, I lean towards the idea that the size of said objects and their distance from earth is nowhere close to what we are told.... that they are instead, much smaller and much closer. I also lean towards the idea that there is a physical barrier that separates &quot;space&quot; and the earth/earths atmosphere. The &quot;dome&quot;, if you will.    </p>

<p>But again, I do not have the means to verify this myself, so I would be happy to look at the material you are referring to.  </p>

<p>But that would be like saying there is a math conspiracy because people attack you when you say 2+2=5</p>

<p>It isnt a conspiracy is just so incredibly inaccurate that most people can debunk FE claims pretty easily. </p>

<p>The fact there are no north to south, south to north circumnavigations is not in itself proof of flat earth, as they could have simply not decided to do one, but it is suspicious.

<p>More likely, the truth is that other planets are teeming with life, but are outside of our perceptible spectrums. What good would it be to create 7 planets and have all beings be able to interact from the get-go? There would be interplanetary wars for sure, because we can&#39;t even be at peace with ourselves. Therefore it&#39;s likely that a planet has to ascend from the heavy, dense, low vibratory states of unrest/violence/hate/fear, which is a limited, restrictive spectrum, and ascend into a spectrum beyond those things. Entering the plane of love-of-all-life would make a species/planet able to interact with other planets/beings that have also achieved that frequency. The world is not material, it is energetic and of frequencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will be tons of questions with any theory, a lot of which are unnecessary to ask, because many can be lost in &quot;time&quot;. I didn&#39;t say that others would experience things like we do. But it&#39;s to be assumed that they too would be at a state of unrest of some sort before coming to a state of love.</p>

<p>What good would it be to make all beings of planets of a solar system on a single plane if war within a planet weren&#39;t over yet? War would become planet vs planet and life would just keep wiping itself out. Science (being theory, not law) as we know it isn&#39;t so much a belief system, but a disbelief system. Other planets would have a different set than ours. How long they live would depend on a number of things, just like for us. They could potentially mature fast and live a shorter life or mature slowly and live 200 years.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more important than figuring all those things out though, is figuring out <strong>our own</strong> true history</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Motive is usually going to be speculation. But IMO, the <strong>primary</strong> objective with this conspiracy is to put doubt into peoples heads about the existence of God and His creations.       </p>

<p>For those of you who believe that TPTB have a goal of creating a one world government/religion/currency, the globe earth conspiracy would tie in perfectly with that. Most people who frequent this sub can accept that TPTB worship satan, even if they themselves don&#39;t believe in God and satan. But they hesitate to believe that what TPTB have taught us about the nature of earth and physical reality since birth is a lie.     </p>

<p>Once people allow themselves to let go of what they &quot;know&quot;, to unlearn what they have learned, and really look at flat earth science objectively, there is no doubt that the earth is in fact &quot;flat&quot; and stationary. Objectively observe and experiment yourself and you will be able to see the truth.      </p>

<p>If a real honest to goodness omnipotent God existed why would he lock us in a terrarium that perfectly simulates an infinite universe? </p>

<p>Why wouldnt he actually make an infinite universe? If its beyond him he isnt God and if he did it to fuck with us he isnt worthy of worship and most likely isnt God.</p>

<p>God is a dick if he partly recreated an infinite universe for us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whateva, I believe in the metaphysical, but if all I have is youtube vids and no real world data, how am I expected to be believed.  There is even a point that 911 theorists cant even budge without more proof.  This is the difference, how sure are you in the end.  I believe in a possibility myself, but to say its true, or a better explanation, is reaching too far, as a honest person.  Its the approach.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We aren&#39;t here to do your work mang.  When you find something, we will replicate, apply it and take the next step.   But you cannot come in half ready with only vids, talkin about truth.  Ive done tests, called relative across the world comparing shadows, understanding how moon phases and eclipses work.  Are blood moons even possible on flat earth?  So please, atleast don&#39;t assume that we, on this forum, havent put in work.  Plenty of interesting FE research, but nothing really sticks, and most of it doesnt work well with each other, imho.  </p>

<p>And check it out, im a subscriber to the expanding earth theory, it makes sense, to me.  Enough sense to buck typical scientific theories, not even close.  At this point, I stay in my lane until I have enough evidence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only experiments that you need to do in order to know for sure that the earth is &quot;flat&quot; and motionless is a line of sight test at a modest distance of a mile or two...though people have done them at much greater distances, and a motion test. You could safely perform this test with something as common as an escalator...or if you have one at your local airport, use one of those moving sidewalks.       </p>

<p>Its really that simple. You can prove that the earth does not have curvature and prove that it is not spinning. Therefor, the earth is not a globe and the earth is stationary.      </p>

<p>Once you can accept those results, then we can talk about the movement of the heavens above us.</p>

<p>I suggest you click on some of the links that flat earthers have been posting in this thread. All the evidence you claim to seek is at your fingertips. You just have to look at it objectively. And as I said, perform simple experiments for yourself and you can see that there is no curvature and that there is no movement....its not hard if you want to do it.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can it fly in a vacuum? A 3:53 second video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8-pxkaipcg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8-pxkaipcg</a></p>

<p>Let’s start with <em>Gravity</em> by way of the <em>dome or Firmament</em>. Iru Landucci is from Brazil speaking in this quick clip about SF6: </p>

<p>General Description. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an excellent gaseous <strong>dielectric for high-voltage power</strong> applications. In its normal state it is <strong>odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, non-corrosive, nonflammable, and chemically inert</strong>. SF6 serves as an <em>insulating and arc-extinguishing media</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHq8gl5eb3c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHq8gl5eb3c</a></p>

<p>Iru and others theorize that this <strong>Gas</strong> is in the upper atmosphere by way of escaping as gaseous element from Volcanic eruptions. That it is heavier than air by 6 X’s and that it does have a freezing temperature,  as well as lower temperatures where meteorites might be suspended and then release as the gas warms? When these fast rockets attempt to go through this gas at 120,000ft they do make a funny sound and they bob around…the German rocket was “suspended” for aprox 6 mins.</p>

<p>So, the gas puts out <em>flames</em> but what effect does it have in Electric Lighting storms? </p>

<p>A fast (1:16) video of Sprites in the upper atmosphere (turn off the sound and just observe!) Read the quick graphic and observe what these Powerful charges do wayyyy up there! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uo4nZtxMow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uo4nZtxMow</a></p>

<p>This is (2:15) of Sprite images with a music cover, no dialogue. Again just to observe how high up this is and which directions it goes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqeHudoWeqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqeHudoWeqg</a></p>

<p>This  7 min video (skip halfway) to see that SF6 actually can be poured over 300 tea lights and extinguish the flames: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGh91oRdPDc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGh91oRdPDc</a>  </p>

<p>Questioning The Shape of our Realm makes people angry and crazy mad! It serves as a fantastic exercise in Self Exploration, not to mention honing skills of communication on so many levels. It encourages a thoughtful person not to neglect ones’ own <em>inner dialogue</em>, IMHO.</p>

<p>ODD Reality vid (runs 21:23) TPTB or high elect Hide the Truth in plain site or is it Predictive Programming? ODD really presents thoughtful content and his voice is easy on the ear. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve no talent or interest in producing videos, a radio show, book or rocket launch. I do not pay for any of them or vice versa. There are some very talented, sincere people. </p>

<p>Honestly, my own motivation was simple: I needed a mental exercise away from all of the ugliness. Politics. Deviants. Corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word, I&#39;ve been trying, for years, to get on with reading the Bible and other texts, I hope to make time for that sooner than not. I am not a religious person, but an observer of others&#39; beliefs (religious and otherwise), which have served me well learning about them, I guess I could say.</p>

<p>FE is an interesting beast, as all of the conspiritainment goes by the wayside, for me at least, and there is much more agreed upon regarding so many ways we&#39;ve been deceived (that is still taboo in conspiritainment, for good reason by those that are doing the deceiving, as it gives away &quot;the game&quot;), in my opinion. It&#39;s helped me not put time and energy to the fear-porn and surface-level narratives, and start seeing why the narratives are introduced and pushed into the public conversation, from which point one is better able to discern reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met the smartest and kindest people, but, at least from my perspective, it is diverse as reddit is wide and, in the end, is just a bunch of humans trying to make sense of the world they live in.</p>

<p>Maybe you should reach out to brap and see if he will invite you into the private sub, it&#39;s not just FE, but, well...you get it, I&#39;m sure.</p>

I take the things that I do with my hands very seriously.  I am bound to be rewarded for being awesome soon, too.</p>

<p>I realized one of my biggest advantages in life today while spend the first four hours forgetting my cell phone (MUSIC PLAYER) at home...one of the things I taught myself is how to learn things efficiently.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, a drone in a vacuum simply has no air resistance, hence wont fly.  The blades have nothing to hit, no air, vacuum.  The fact gravity is still acting on it confirms s few things, but, why show me this?  Whats the point made that we dont already know?  </p>

<p>We use nitrogen in the coffee business, to displace oxygen, its inert and better for preserving the grinds.  Is this what happening with the flames, displacing oxygen?  Cool, i guess.  </p>

<p>ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION concerning that rocket video.  You trying to tell me, a rocket going however fast to reach the atmosphere, would &quot;hit something&quot; and it not shatter, break apart, camera still works?!?!   They need to make football helmets out of that rocket material, its THAT strong, million dollar idea.  Noone is saying slowed down, its suspended, or hit the firmament, uh i guess so, pillow soft firmament, or a &quot;hard&quot; gas.  Im not doubting the gas up there, just this case as to it existing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll not watch hidden hand stuff and just agree with you on it, it is indeed the name of the game, knowledge.  And thry are HEAVY into the metaphysical, truth stranger than fiction.  </p>

<p>What does gene editing have to do with anything?  Ide rather not watch it all for a couple of sentences, if you mind, a little more specific plez.  </p>

<p>Nothing here really related to up top conversation.  My one wish is someone prove flat earth exists, and stop trying to disprove stuff we already think we know.  Prove the ice wall, the dome, dont stop at trying to disprove curvature or sun cycles, prove YOUR side, pretty please.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look... a youtube video that doesnt have any sourcing... Color me surprised... </p>

<p>There were multiple problems with what that video said. First was rotation, they dont randomly decide to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, it depends on the hemisphere. </p>

<p>Doesnt it bother you they left that out? Do you not care at all you are being lied to by a youtube video?</p>

<p>It says the rotation of the Earth is inconsequential to the pendulums swing but it doesnt bother you that it takes exactly one day for the pendulum to make one rotation? </p>

<p>That video is lying to you! </p>

<p>It also says the rotation is dependent on how it was started but we know this is false, we know the direction will change to correlate with the earths rotation. </p>

<p>How does it feel to be lied to?</p>

<p>You have to apply a force other than earth supposed rotation to start the pendulum in the first place. If the earth was in constant rotation, you would not need to apply another force to start it. And before you disagree with that, you just said that the rotation of the earth will change the direction of the pendulum....so doesn&#39;t it bother YOU that that supposed force doesn&#39;t start a stationary pendulum to begin with? I mean ffs...if the earth really was in constant motion, free energy devices would be in use all over the world. All one would have to do is rig a turbine and flywheel up and place it on the surface of the earth....go ahead and give that a try, lemme know how that works out for you.        </p>

<p>Maybe try watching and listening to what is being said in the video OBJECTIVELY instead of just preaching false doctrines at me? </p>

<p>We can speculate all day on what is past the furthest we can see or go, but there&#39;s no point. I couldn&#39;t imagine infinity so I&#39;m not implying that, I have no idea. And, again, I can&#39;t assume defined boundaries that haven&#39;t been found yet, I&#39;m not implying that I know any of that.</p>

<p>I am saying that you are assuming that there is purpose in theorizing one way or another about a theoretical end of an unknowable space. So, I was implying that there are likely better questions to ask than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That requirement? There is no single recorded other celestial body of decent mass that is flat. Furthermore there is no credible model to support how a flat earth could form and conform to laws of physics etc. Thus the only recourse for flat earth is religion. God is the reason the earth is the only body to be flat in the known universe. Of course in theory you could not recourse to religion but the only way to avoid that is to not discuss the issue of why only the earth is flat.</p>

<p>This of course is only one of the many many crippling holes in the FE &#39;theory&#39;</p>

<p>So any evidence you&#39;d like to present of similar flat celestial bodies? </p>

<p>See, you&#39;re the one making the claim that it must be that religion is required AND that in your &quot;model&quot;, there is a notion that celestial bodies must conform to the same laws. You are assuming <em>your</em> model when asking me to prove that a different model conforms to a rule that you seem to have made to fit your model. I&#39;m just saying.</p>

<p>The buoyancy force on an object is equal to the <strong>weight</strong> of the fluid displaced by the object, or the <strong>density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravitational acceleration, g.</strong></p>

<p>No, that&#39;s your pretend definition that you use to maintain your delusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buoyancy has nothing to do with ‘gravity’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it&#39;s literally defined by gravity. Buoyancy on Earth is different than Buoyancy on Mars, because Mars&#39; gravity is less. But both are 100% predictable with conventional physics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity doesn’t exist in the flat earth model as it’s unnecessary! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean conventional gravity doesn&#39;t work in a FE model so you pretend it&#39;s not relevant. Yet here I am, not flying off the planet when I get out of my chair.</p>

<p>I believe we stick to the earth because air is our medium which is always lighter than most living organisms. Lighter and less dense objects fall because everything isn’t relative.

<p>Obviously it&#39;s a real definition. I mocked you because you leave out the scientific definition of buoyancy because it includes gravity. But since you need to believe your delusion that gravity doesn&#39;t exist, you have to pretend it isn&#39;t part of the definition. </p>

<p>Try calculating the buoyancy of an object in a fluid. Guess what you need?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buoyant Force = fluid density * displaced volume * <strong>g</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I&#39;m the ignorant one? Archimedes in the 3rd century figured it out, and he didn&#39;t even have Google.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity is an arbitrary/fictional concept which has no relation to our reality. And please don’t start talking about gravity on other planets... you literally have zero empirical evidence that Mars is even composed of physical terra firma. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, the old &quot;if I can&#39;t touch it it doesn&#39;t exist argument.&quot; Classic.</p>

<p>I have a telescope and can see the planet. When you discard observation because they don&#39;t fit your model, you aren&#39;t a scientist, you&#39;re a preacher.</p>

<p>I can look at the ground, and see that it&#39;s there. I can look at the moon and see that it&#39;s there. I can look at Mars and see it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>I can actually do the math, and calculate with a remarkable amount of accuracy exactly where Mars will be in the sky at any given moment. I can only do that because we know Mars&#39; orbit and the Earth&#39;s orbit, which is, guess what, a function of gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe we stick to the earth because air is our medium which is always lighter than most living organisms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for at least taking a stab. I don&#39;t know what that means, exactly, but hey, you tried.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lighter and less dense objects fall because everything isn’t relative. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep using the word &quot;fall.&quot; Fall toward what? How come I don&#39;t fall sideways through lighter air? I ALWAYS fall in a very specific direction: toward the center of Earth&#39;s gravity well. But in a flat earth and no gravity there is no &quot;center of gravity&quot; obviously. So you suggest that we all fall in perfectly parallel lines toward ... what? And why that direction?</p>

<p>Gravity can explain that. Can you?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, electromagnetism plays a role; every living organism create a bio-magnetic field which literally attracts to Earth’s magnetic field. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Electromagnetism is very real, and has measurable effects. And predictable, of course, using conventional physics. But how does it play a role in keeping me on the planet? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity doesn’t exist and your argument falls under the fallacy of appealing to authoritative figures in Physics. Einstein was wrong; gravity and relativity do not exist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. I can observe, measure and predict events using gravity. With 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>Good word, though, &quot;fallacy.&quot; Makes you sound <em>smart</em>.</p>

<p>Your inability to understand gravity and relativity do not mean they don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Quit your FE religion before they ask you to drink the Kool aid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe. </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

<p>Calculate expected fuel consumption of a plane flying a few thousand miles over a flat surface vs a curved one. The curved one will have to fly further and will consume more fuel. Works with a boat too.</p>
