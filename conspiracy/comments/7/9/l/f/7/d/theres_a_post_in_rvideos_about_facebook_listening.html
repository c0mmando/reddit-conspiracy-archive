<p>So I was at a wedding yesterday and of course I&#39;m gonna drink. My go to drink is crown and coke <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KtahVNM.jpg">proof</a> from my snapchat. I had about 4 of them. So I&#39;ve I&#39;ve mention the words &quot;crown and coke at least 4 times to the bartender and must have been asked 5 or 6 other times that night what I was drinking. So the words &quot;crown and coke&quot; was tossed around quite a few times last night. So after watching the video. I was curious and checked my feed. Didn&#39;t see anything familiar related to the last 24 Hours at the moment. But about an hour later I see it on <a href="https://i.imgur.com/O50PlGz.jpg">my feed</a> Couldn&#39;t believe it at first but not surprised either. Be on the look out people! It may be time to delete Facebook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, go through your post history, and see if you&#39;ve ever posted about crown and Coke. Or anything that mentioned your drinking habits.. </p>

<p>Next question, Android or iOS? Because most phones that can be rooted, you can control app permissions, some normal phones you can deny certain permissions..</p>

<p>This has been used on open source Android devices that you can deny permissions to debunk this.. over the course of years, you&#39;ve given them huge amounts of information that allows them to narrow down what your preferences are.. it&#39;s highly likely that&#39;s the reason.</p>

<p>Wanna prove something? Make a brand new account, then do exactly what you claim you did, and see if they miraculously know what you like. Why do I suggest this? Because people did this and nothing suggested was like anything they said.</p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m a tech guy, and this is easy to explain bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally talked with a mod of that sub yesterday and decided to subscribe.. I&#39;m sorry if I know more about technology than you do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I can describe a simple experiment where you create a brand new account, with absolutely no information except the obvious voice input. Go ahead, prove me wrong.. make a new account, post nothing, like nothing, just literally talk after making the account.. then post your findings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know my comment is coming in late, but I was a bit skeptical about this topic. About 24 hours ago, I overheard my aunt talking to my mother about compression socks that my grandmother wears. I went about my business, and didn&#39;t think much of it until a few minutes ago an ad for compression socks appears in my Facebook feed. I hadn&#39;t  searched or posted anything  about compression socks.</p>
