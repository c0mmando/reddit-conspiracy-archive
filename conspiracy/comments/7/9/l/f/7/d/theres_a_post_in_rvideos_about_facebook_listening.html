       from my snapchat. I had about 4 of them. So I've I've mention the words "crown and coke at least 4 times to the bartender and must have been asked 5 or 6 other times that night what I was drinking. So the words "crown and coke" was tossed around quite a few times last night. So after watching the video. I was curious and checked my feed. Didn't see anything familiar related to the last 24 Hours at the moment. But about an hour later I see it on

       Couldn't believe it at first but not surprised either. Be on the look out people! It may be time to delete Facebook.

       Now, go through your post history, and see if you've ever posted about crown and Coke. Or anything that mentioned your drinking habits..
      </p>
      <p>
       Next question, Android or iOS? Because most phones that can be rooted, you can control app permissions, some normal phones you can deny certain permissions..
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been used on open source Android devices that you can deny permissions to debunk this.. over the course of years, you've given them huge amounts of information that allows them to narrow down what your preferences are.. it's highly likely that's the reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanna prove something? Make a brand new account, then do exactly what you claim you did, and see if they miraculously know what you like. Why do I suggest this? Because people did this and nothing suggested was like anything they said.

       Sorry, I'm a tech guy, and this is easy to explain bullshit.

       I literally talked with a mod of that sub yesterday and decided to subscribe.. I'm sorry if I know more about technology than you do.

      <p>
       I'm sorry if I can describe a simple experiment where you create a brand new account, with absolutely no information except the obvious voice input. Go ahead, prove me wrong.. make a new account, post nothing, like nothing, just literally talk after making the account.. then post your findings.

       just throwing this out there but your snapchat is probably linked to facebook right?  i mean you typed it into your phone either way so it doesn't really prove they heard you say it. just that they are tracking you.

       THIS happened to me just now! Only it wasn't facebook. It was Pinterest. Late last night my husband and I were discussing how we can organize our medicine and he asked me if I'd ever thought about getting a pill organizer. Enter today. Pinterest served me some sponsored content about, you guessed it, a pill organizer.

       I know my comment is coming in late, but I was a bit skeptical about this topic. About 24 hours ago, I overheard my aunt talking to my mother about compression socks that my grandmother wears. I went about my business, and didn't think much of it until a few minutes ago an ad for compression socks appears in my Facebook feed. I hadn't  searched or posted anything  about compression socks.
