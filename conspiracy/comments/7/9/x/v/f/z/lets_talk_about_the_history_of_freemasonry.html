       Freemasonry is a popular pi√±ata around here, but so much of what is said about it is factually lacking... I thought it was high time that we have a frank chat about what we do and do not know about its history.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Who Am I?
      </h2>
      <p>
       Why do I think I can speak to such matters?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Freemason, have been for some years. I've occupied many officer chairs and have dozens of titles (titles are a dime a dozen in Freemasonry, so don't let that impress you). I'm certainly no great authority within Freemasonry, but I do run a Lodge (actually, it's alternately called a Lodge or a Chapter, and falls within what's called the "York Rite", more on that later) currently. Mostly, I come at this from the angle of amateur historian.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one asked me to post this (or
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5lvgbk/freemasonry_my_time_inside_the_fraternity_as_a/">
        my previous, more general post
       </a>
       ), and frankly, I'm not sure how thrilled my Grand Lodge would be with me for doing so...
      </p>
      <h2>
       Foundations
      </h2>
      <p>
       The earliest records we have are from the 16th century. At that time, it's pretty clear that what we call "speculative" Lodges existed, that is Lodges that were not merely initiations of stonemasons into their professional guild, and that they dealt with moral and philosophical issues much as modern Freemasonry does.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have almost no records of that time, and piece together what we can from a few scraps recovered after the fact. Claims that we know that Freemasonry arose from stonemason guilds are often exaggerated. What we know is that there were initiations among stonemasons, but whether Freemasonry arose directly or indirectly from those is unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also claims that Knights Templar fled persecution and the disbanding of their order in the 14th century to Scotland, and became a seed of influence for the founding of early Freemasonry. This claim is made with extremely thin support, and though it's clear that there were people in Scotland who believed this to be true as early as the 19th century, it's just as likely that it's almost entirely fabricated. There is no evidence that there is any real link between the Templars of history and Freemasonry (despite Freemasonry having a group named Knights Templar in the modern day).
      </p>
      <p>
       What we know for sure is that, in 1717, several Lodges in England got together and formed what they called a Grand Lodge, the first of its kind. But, because Freemasonry already existed at that time in Ireland and Scotland, when they also formed Grand Lodges (along with France and the American Colonies among the early Grand Lodges) it was deemed that England had no particular centralized authority. This lead to the decentralized nature of Freemasonry where every Grand Lodge (usually on a nation or territory/state/province level) was considered a sovereign and autonomous body.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Administration and Degrees
      </h2>
      <p>
       There is no central administrative body of Freemasonry, though the United Grand Lodge of England is often seen as a sort of figurehead of mainstream Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very early on there were two degrees of initiation into Freemasonry. The "Entered Apprentice" and the "Fellow Craft". These degrees taught what is referred to as "system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols." There were also many other variant and local degrees which were conferred. These additional degrees, sometimes collectively referred to as the "high degrees" varied wildly. Shortly after the founding of the Grand Lodge of England, one of these other degrees (the "Master Mason") was formally added to the two, to form the now widely recognized three degrees of Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Additional Degrees
      </h2>
      <p>
       But there were still many others, and the continued to be conferred in an unorganized, locally varying way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to a complicated disagreement during the late 18th century, the standardization of these other degrees didn't really get under way until the early 19th century. Among them were:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Mark Master Mason degree
       </li>
       <li>
        The Holy Royal Arch degree
       </li>
       <li>
        The "Scottish degrees" that evolved in France and were, in part, related to the Royal Arch
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The first two continued to be conferred essentially as-is in England, though in the US, they were merged with several other degrees to form the 3-part "York Rite" system which also includes the modern Masonic Knights Templar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last evolved into a system of a bit over a dozen initiations that would mutate in the US into what is now called the Scottish Rite. Originally, the Scottish Rite was a wholly intact system of 32 degrees, but eventually dropped its version of the first three degrees to become a high-degree appendant body of mainstream Freemasonry, a peer in the US to the York Rite, and an invitational side-body in some other countries such as the UK.
      </p>
      <h2>
       American Freemasonry
      </h2>
      <p>
       From here on, I'm going to focus on the US, because that's mostly what I know... just keep in mind that the US isn't the whole of Freemasonry, so some of this will be a bit skewed...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just before the formal start of the US Revolutionary War, a small number of African Americans, including one by the name of Prince Hall, were initiated by an Irish military Lodge stationed in Boston Massachusetts. After the war, there were attempts made to establish a new Lodge for African Americans in Boston, and eventually it had to stand on its own, gaining a Charter from England as a Provincial Grand Lodge. This began the segregated history of Freemasonry in the United States where white men joined Lodges that were entirely (almost always) white and (almost always) black men joined what came to be called Prince Hall Lodges, organized as the white Lodges were, along state lines in locally autonomous Grand Lodges.
      </p>
      <p>
       This system of dual Grand Lodges continued to the modern day. Today, segregation is over and although the Prince Hall Lodges maintain their unique tradition of Masonry in the US, as is their right, of course, so-called mainstream Freemasonry has members of every race and creed, and in some states one can even be a member of both, while in others, both are seen as peer Grand Lodges whose members freely attend each other's meetings as they wish.
      </p>
      <h2>
       The Golden Age
      </h2>
      <p>
       In the late 19th century, a boom in fraternal organizations called the "Golden Age of Fraternalism" lead to a vast expansion of the number of members of Freemasonry, along with the founding of many new fraternal organizations (including men's, women's and mixed-gender initiatory societies). During this expansion, a new appendant group was formed within Freemasonry: the Shrine. The Shrine began as an Arabian-themed social outlet for Masons. But after some controversy due to their perception as a drinking club, they began to focus more on philanthropy. Thus originated what is probably the best known philanthropic arm of Freemasonry: the Shriner's Hospitals. Indeed, the philanthropic outlay of Freemasonry totals over $2million per day, worldwide!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also during that boom period, the first Masonic youth group for boys was founded: DeMolay. Again founded on the idea of the theoretical tie to Knights Templar, DeMolay was named for Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the historical Order of Knights Templar. DeMolay still exists today. It is not considered a Masonic organization, but is patterned on its initiations and customs and many (but certainly not all) DeMolay members choose to become Freemasons later in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional youth groups for girls were also formed including the Job's Daughters and Rainbow Girls (now called Rainbow International).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also during the late 19th century some uglier cropped up. A man by the name of Leo Taxil attempted to bait the Catholic Church after a sudden conversion to that faith, by claiming to have secret documents from Freemasonry that proved they were, in fact, worshiping Satan. It turns out that he was a con man (Leo Taxil was even an assumed name), and he admitted that his publications were a fabrication, but the Taxil Hoax became the seed from which much of modern Masonic conspiracy grew...
      </p>
      <h2>
       War and Postwar Periods
      </h2>
      <p>
       After the Golden Age of Fraternalism, in the early-mid 20th century, Freemasonry contracted. Specifically, during the Great Depression, numbers dropped dramatically, but were buoyed by a new influx of members during and after World War II, returning it to and ultimately surpassing the earlier peaks of membership. In 1960, the number of Freemasons in the US peaked, but it had already started to decline as a per-capita number in 1955 and from then to the early 2000s, the drop was surprisingly flat as the subsequent generations simply did not seek out Freemasonry as they had before. Indeed, it has become clear that nearly all social institutions suffered a similar decline from parent-teacher groups to religious organizations to fraternal societies (not including college frats).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 2010s, the numbers began to show some signs of a change in slope and there is some speculation that a new surge may be in the wings, as millennials begin to take over. The millennials are certainly more curious about the social institutions of their grandparents than their parents were, but only time will tell what that translates into...

       In Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
       Thanks for entertaining my attempt to dispel some myths and illuminate some of the history. I know that many here will never believe that Freemasonry isn't some den of secret conspiracies and ne'er-do-wells, but if I've at least given some food for thought, I feel I've done good work, here.

       Please, ask me anything, but I only have limited time and will be travelling today, so my answers may come slowly.
