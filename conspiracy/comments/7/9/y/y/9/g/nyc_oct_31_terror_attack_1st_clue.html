<p>Archive this photo or any other photos that show the same scene:</p>

<p><a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/nyc-bikes-nocops-wabc-171031_4x3_992.jpg">http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/nyc-bikes-nocops-wabc-171031_4x3_992.jpg</a></p>

<p>There is a bike wreckage in this photo that appears to at least have the rear wheel removed as well as the bicycle seat.  The front wheel I believe is also off as per different photos of the same scene I saw initially on the “breaking news”.  </p>

<p>As somebody who has worked on bikes my whole life...  This looks fishy.  The force required to rip a wheel and the seat off of a bike would be immense.  Certainly it would deform the frame.  In fact, I do not think it is possible for an accident to pull the rear wheel off a bicycle without completely destroying the bike frame.  The seats stays, chain stays, and top tube all look to be pristine. </p>

<p>Conclusion: This is “bike wreckage” was placed here intentionally for this photo and staged as a ruined bike from being run over by a truck.  Try and imagine how the rear wheel and seat would be forcibly pulled off a functional bicycle without damaging the frame or the seat post?  Quite hard to imagine how that would happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see any of what you&#39;re describing.  That bike with the missing seat does appear to have its rear wheel still connected.  It&#39;s just bent massively out-of-shape.  I certainly don&#39;t see enough detail in the photo to make any sorts of conclusions like the one you&#39;ve offered.</p>

<p>How are there witnesses to people on bikes being hit by a car, but none of people swooping in to plant fake wreckage?  I&#39;d say that is much, much harder to imagine than a bike seat coming off in a crash that killed 5 people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try this photo from a different angle.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000363857166.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960">https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000363857166.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960</a></p>

<p>The black bike frame is the one of interest.  It clearly has no wheels and from the other angle we can see it has no seat either.  Yet the frame is grossly intact.  There is no obvious major damage to the frame or forks.  So my question is; how do both wheels and the seat get ripped off a functional bike in a crash without deforming/destroying the frame?  Bike wheels don’t just fly off a bike.  After a wreck, they typically look like the other bikes in the scene.  I.e. the wheel is bent and deformed around the frame, but the wheel is still attached to the frame.  If the wheel is off the frame, the frame has usually been completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a bike that has ben locked up to a rack in a city, but then stripped by thieves?  They remove the wheels and seat if the lock doesn’t pass through a wheel and leave the frame locked to a rack.  This bike looks exactly like one of those stripped bikes we’ve all seen abandoned locked to a rack somewhere.  The question is; how did it get into this accident scene?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have worked on and built hundreds of bikes. There are many ways this could have happened. For instance, the bike is being dragged by the truck, the quick release scrapes on the ground and pops open, the wheel comes off. Or as the person is knocked off the bike, they get tangled in the wheel and knock the release open, and the wheel comes off. Same for the saddle. Further, the force to just pop the saddle or wheel off is not &quot;immense,&quot; especially given that a lot of people don&#39;t tighten them properly. Hell, I have seen wheels come off in races!</p>

<p>Many, many people witnessed this, it is in a very populated area. You are really reaching for something here.</p>
