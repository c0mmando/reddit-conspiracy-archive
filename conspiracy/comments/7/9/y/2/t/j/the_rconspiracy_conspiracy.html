        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all, </p>

<p>Last night, instead of going to sleep early and being a responsible adult, I decided to instead browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I ended up discovering some interesting posting behaviors that I continued to compile this morning. I&#39;ve decided to post them without interpretation for anyone who is interested in looking at (potential) forces attempting to exert control (sloppily!) over the sub. </p>

<p>I have no explanation as to who is doing this or why. I don&#39;t know if OPs are honest-but-lazy, shills, or alt accounts, nor what their motivations are.</p>

<p>All I know is that I found <del>3</del> <del>4</del> 5 users who are all 17/18 day old accounts whose entire post submission histories are taken from the_donald. Often times they do not change the title or if they do change it only slightly so as not to break the rules of the sub. Admittedly, a small few of these examples are just auto taken titles from the article, but most appear to be copy-pasted and only slightly edited. I have also included one 3 month old account who is currently on the front page and shows similar behaviors, covering just their past few days of activity. *added four more 3 month old accounts I came across as I went along. </p>

<p>No OPs have confronted me about this, but they <em>have</em> deleted posts after I commented about the patterns. </p>

<p>I have included here archives of the first page of each users history as well as an archive of the &quot;other submissions&quot; page for each of their posts. </p>

<p>Make of this what you will. But for your continued information Here are some links to a past, similar discovery 5 months ago. All the found accounts involved for banned or deleted. 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ebt7a/duplicate_comments_replies_on_this_sub_and_rthe/">1</a>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ebj2n/we_found_the_shills_may_be_bots_theyre_getting/">2</a>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6fvgo4/the_accounts_that_were_copying_comments_from_td/">3</a>  </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>I&#39;m just going to copy paste a previous comment I was adding to here:</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: also noticed this was posted to the Donald an hour ago and a duplicate thread here just 30 minutes ago but both ops use <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1Jilo">similar language</a> in their comments: Here are the audio files. Have fun, guys/pedes. Link. </p>

<p><strong>Furthermore</strong>: The other OP, <a href="https://archive.is/rcTKF">Sineseta</a> (Redditor for 17 days), who posted this same link apparently just lifts things directly from t_d, sometimes just barely changing the headline <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ahiCq">https://imgur.com/a/ahiCq</a>. The language that op used is also a bit strange; &quot;the California politicians&quot; rather than just &quot;California politicians&quot;. Like a lazily done madlibs.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Lol, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/k5BpJ">this one</a> he just changed the formatting to not break rule 6. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QXzxN">This one</a> couldn&#39;t be found in &quot;other discussions&quot; because it&#39;s a self post but a quick search of the title found <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/79o2f7/ok_manafort_if_youre_reading_i_know_exactly_how/">where</a> he got it from.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kRYzW">here’s a fresh one</a> *Now deleted. And <a href="https://imgur.com/a/t4uvs">another</a> *Also deleted now.</p>

<p><strong>At this point, I want to note that now that I have these people tagged in RES, it’s obvious how all over each other’s posts they are.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Every one I&#39;ve found so far</strong> (except Jborg007 whom I chose at random from the front page) <strong>I found because they were <em>solely</em> commenting on each other&#39;s posts.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Again, make of all of this what you will. But if anyone else is interested in finding more of this behavior, it&#39;s as easy as checking out the &quot;other discussion&quot; tab, looking at someone&#39;s post submission history, and also noticing which users are always quick to comment and defend on each other&#39;s posts. </p>

<p>Also, I am posting from my main account and know I am potentially breaking some rules, but damn this behavior was blatant and sloppy so mods, please show leniency on me! I didn&#39;t want to use an alt because I want people to know I am a real person, with a diverse comment/post history. </p>

<p>Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>*I made some edits to grammar/spelling  </p>

<p><strong>Some patterns</strong>: The accounts appear at the same time. They copy post titles and sometimes comments from various users of the_donald; they sometimes make small edits to the post titles/comments. They only post in conspiracy and rarely, deeply engage with other users. They will only comment on their own posts and sometimes on each others&#39; posts. When looking at snoopsnoo, their word clouds and posting times are similar.</p>

<p>Compared to the hundreds to sometimes thousands of blatant ass shills that popped up around Pizza gate that started screaming about how the government are <em>totally</em> not corrupt guyz! And trying extremely hard to take over this sub and replace the mods. I still remember that first brigade. It was absolutely fucking ridiculous.</p>

<p>And now they are doing it again here and &quot;&quot;&quot;Proving&quot;&quot;&quot; Russians are manipulating this sub because they found 4 dudes reposting from T_D. Seriously do you think OP could do ALL that work and not realize how fucking dumb that is?</p>

<p>Reminder: No evidence of Russian shilling or even them favoring one side in the election. Turns out they favored the left with their Facebook ads. And it been proven quite a long time ago that their is a shilling organization (Used to be known as Correct The Record) that is called ShareBlue. And evidence came out such as list of their names and how much they got paid and (a classic) the &quot;Nerd virgins&quot; email.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did nothing of the sort. In fact, in some other comments I admitted it could just as well be someone pretending to be a t_d user. I only found 11 users, a similar network was actually found about 5 months ago. It could be more, and furthermore, all accounts could be controlled by one person. And as I clearly stated in my post, it could be a shill, a troll, or one honest-and-dedicated-but-sloppy real person. </p>

<p>I&#39;m aware that CTR/Shareblue exists, yet you have provided no evidence that the recent increases in activity are due to their efforts. I would love to see that evidence if it exists or if you decided to actually do something about your suspicions. Btw, I realized looking back at this chain that you essentially called me a shill in your first post. Reported, though I doubt much will be done about it. </p>

<p>Have a nice day and take care of yourself. Internet outrage is fairly futile overall. </p>

<p>Jee I wonder who has the numbers in the hundreds to thousands that could do it.</p>

<p>Yea you definitely weren&#39;t implying I was a shill either with the &quot;You really are just exposing yourself&quot;. Lmao fuck outta here dumbfuck.</p>

<p>In what world would Putin be stupid enough to participate in that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putin wouldn&#39;t be the one to start it. Have you not been paying attention the last few years? The US has tried to <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/392531-elections-cyberattacks-putin-stone/">overthrow</a> the Russian government, and the governments of virtually all of their allies:</p>

<p>&quot;The US has repeatedly meddled in Russian politics, “especially aggressively” in the 2012 presidential elections, President Vladimir Putin told Oliver Stone, while dismissing allegations that Moscow hacked the US elections as lies from Trump’s opponents. </p>

<p>In the final part of US filmmaker Oliver Stone’s documentary series, Putin Interviews, which was aired on Showtime on Thursday night, the Russian leader told the Oscar-winning director about how Washington has attempted to interfere in the Russian electoral process through US diplomatic staff and by pouring money into NGOs.</p>

<p>“[They did it] in 2000, and in 2012, this always happened. But especially aggressively in 2012. I will not go into details,” Putin said, adding that all of the other post-Soviet republics have also been subject to US meddling.&quot;</p>

<p>This included things like the US installing <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/02/25/is_the_us_backing_neo_nazis_in_ukraine_partner/">Nazis</a> in Ukraine, with the senior State Department official (and long-time deep state operative) being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-phonecall-idUSL2N0LC1E120140207">caught</a> discussing which crazies they would replace the lawful government with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably with not running my scraper is not limiting it to the top 1k active subreddits.

I might still try to tackle this, but it would have to be after this kaggle competition I am in. </p>

<p>Here is some information to tide you over though.</p>

<p>Getting a list of author creation dates might take some time, but it is also probably the most important piece. </p>

<p>Side note: It would also be good to look at how many of the authors are submitting in other subreddits, and maybe even a 3rd degree of separation. Worth continuing, but if anyone else wants to pick it up from there. </p>

<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<p>Oddly enough, there is far more discussion happening in relation to upvotes than I thought. That could be explained through genuine engagement, or bots getting smarter. One thing I will have to look at is if posts from authors linked to posting history in other subreddits are getting upvoted more in relation to comments. Sentiment analysis should also be done to see if it causes deviation in engagement, as well as key terms. </p>
