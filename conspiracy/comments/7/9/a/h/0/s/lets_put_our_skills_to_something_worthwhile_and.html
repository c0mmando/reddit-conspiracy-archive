        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a lurker for years and recently started to actively post. I&#39;ve been amazed by some of the sleuthing, critical thinking and general skepticism that i have seen on this board. You guys have broken open the Seth Rich thing, this Vegas shooting, JFK just to name a few. But to what end? The MSM won&#39;t cover it, normies don&#39;t care that our government agencies have been conspiring against them for decades, and i feel that a lot of what we discuss here goes unnoticed and doesn&#39;t affect the lives of actual people in any meaningful, lasting ways. We have been demonized by the mainstream as being trolls and conspiracy theorists, how about we show the world what we are really capable of. </p>

<p>Kids go missing all the time in our communities and the cops are more concerned with traffic stops, throwing minorities in jail, harassing minor drug offenders than putting the necessary resources to finding the real criminals lurking all around us. I also don&#39;t think the individuals tasks to finding missing children are bewildered and overwhelmed, possibly short sighted and overall incompetent. We have nothing to do with our time than generally regurgitate theories we ourselves already know to be true so why don&#39;t we fucking help out!</p>

<p>Lets put our virtual heads together and assist law enforcement do their damn jobs and find missing children. Pedophiles are fucking stupid and sick and they need to know that there&#39;s no where to hide especially when the fucking internet is on the case. This is a serious problem and it saddens me that so many go missing and so many seem unconcerned. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the missing persons registry site:</p>

<p><a href="https://namus.gov/">https://namus.gov/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the FBI site:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap">https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap</a></p>

<p>We could start with the most recent, narrow down to those in your area perhaps, contact LE and post details so we can find these kids and the sick fucks who think they can get away with this. </p>

<p>Let me know what you guys think</p>

<p>Edit: Well apparently due to doxx potential seems this idea wouldn&#39;t get off the ground on Reddit. That&#39;s really fucking sad but i understand nonetheless. Anyone else with ideas, please share. I don&#39;t plan to have kids but i know i would turn over the world to find my missing offspring. </p>

<p>If it happens enough here, this sub will be banned. You want that? </p>

<p>Reddit has a shit history on this, most infamously, the Boston marathon bombing where redditors passed around personal information on family members of a missing teen, people harassed them like crazy, made death threats, etc. The teen turned out had committed suicide weeks prior to the bombing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree reading and education yourself and waking up toward truth is great.  But being great would be to organize and get people of this sub and other like minded people that are fighting for the country to come together and work on subjects and issues and attack that issue or subject on a much more coordinated effort.  Posting and commentating the truth and having discussion is wonderful but almost turns into a echo chamber here.  Just a thought . You already  know the enemy is attacking on a coordinated level for a long time and have infiltrated many groups and the government at the the highest level make no mistakes we are fighting evil.</p>
