       Playboy got away with selling child pornography. They had pre pubescent children in their magazines posing nude. The children were sexualised and pimped out by their own mothers to porn magazines. Nobody went to jail. This is concrete proof pedophilia has been no secret in Hollywood and the entertainment industry.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The original picture, for which Shields was paid $450, was taken by fashion photographer Garry Gross in 1975 for a Playboy publication titled Sugar and Spice. It was one of a dozen images of Shields designed, according to Gross, to reveal the not-so-latent sexuality of the prepubescent child.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those photos can be found uncensored with a quick google search. They are regarded as legal despite being blatant CP.
Brooke Shields was later casted in Pretty Baby where she played the role of a child prostitute. She had nude scenes in the movie despite being 11 at the time. She was chosen for the role after the director saw her nude photos.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now her photographer mother Irina has been ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages to Eva for taking the explicit pictures of her in the 1970s, when she was between four and 12.
She made her movie debut at the age of eleven in 1976, playing a child in Roman Polanski's movie The Tenant. In 1977 her mother lost custody of her children and Eva was brought up by the parents of footwear designer Christian Louboutin.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Her mother took explicit pics of her since she was a toddler and sent her to work on a movie made by a known pedophile.

       Bro, nude kid pics are not cp.  They have to be sexual in nature.  Hell, most people have pics of their children taking baths as infants.  I wouldn't call them cp producers.

       Are you fucking retarded? There's a big difference between a parent taking a picture of their own baby in a bath with absolutely no intention to publish it to the world and an innocent 10 year old been forced to look incredibly not innocent, make up, NAKED for PLAYBOY. You're either a 12 year old kid who has absolutely no idea what play boy is or you're just next level stupid.

       Ok you incredibly condescending little man, let's look to at the definition of child pornography as described by the DOJ
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/child-pornography">
        https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/child-pornography
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Child pornography is a form of child sexual exploitation. Federal law defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (persons less than 18 years old).  Images of child pornography are also referred to as child sexual abuse images.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In other words, child porn is any material that is SEXUAL in nature.  This would mean the following :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Any touching of the child, especially in the genital areas, or any child touching another individual a sexual way.
       </li>
       <li>
        Any arousal of either the subject or any other subject in the material including, but not limited to any adults that may be in the picture.
       </li>
       <li>
        Any picture that is suggestive of the genitals that is portrayed as a sexual object (i.e. a close up of the genitals with a pose that is suggestive of sexual references)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I referred to the bath picture to make a point.  Just because the children in a picture is nude, it does not make it child pornography.  If any of the Hollywood or Playboy pictures included any of the criteria I have listed above, then yes, it would be pornography and law enforcement should be contacted and the producers be put in jail.  Now shut the fuck up and show me an instance where any of the above 3 have occurred in any of the material posted in Playboy.  When you do, I'll contact the FBI and make a complaint.

       Consider this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         During the witch trials of Salem, the typical argument went like this :  You deny that this woman is a witch, when she obviously is.  Therefore, you support witchcraft.  Therefore, you are a witch.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The argument presented in this post :  You deny that this is child porn, when it obviously is child porn.  Therefore, you support child pornography.  Therefore you are a child porn producer.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is the exact line of argument that is being present here.  Without actually examining the evidence, everyone is boarding the "Yes, child porn is heinous.  Burn the fuckers.  Nevermind examining the actual material."
      </p>
      <p>
       Child pornography is the most heinous, most disgusting crime I can think of.  I would say maybe even worse than murder.  So if we are going to accuse people of committing it, we better damn well make sure we are correct in our accusations.  If you're making up your mind before examining the evidence, you are just as ignorant as those who sent all those women to the burning stake simply because they were labeled a witch.

       There are 10s if not hundreds of people on this sub who have seen the photos who would be willing to claim they are of sexual nature and by the definition is child porn. I am simply not willing to look at them because they make me sick. Go take your empathy towards these monsters elsewhere.

       Not who you responded to, but we talked earlier and I think we ended up mostly agreeing view wise.. I've read a bunch of articles, and it seems that the pictures were originally taken by a photographer that intended them to be art..
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an older article that shows a judge finding them not to be sexual in nature(1983), while also showing a pretty damning (in my opinion) quote by the photographer aptly named Garry Gross.
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/6248757/Brooke-Shields-photographer-disappointed-by-police-pornography-claim.html">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/6248757/Brooke-Shields-photographer-disappointed-by-police-pornography-claim.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Wednesday night Mr Gross told the Daily Telegraph: "The photo has been infamous from the day I took it and I intended it to be," he said, adding that he once sent a copy to Switzerland only for it to be seized in France.(no NSFW photos)
       </p>
       <p>
        "she was supposed to look like a sexy woman,”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That last quote is definitely disturbing to me, but apparently his intent was "art". Also, mind you, the judge said that the pictures are legal as long as they weren't featured in pornographic publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something of note, many other countries have much less problems with nudity, it's shown on public TV, nude beaches are common, etc. I think that here in the US, because nudity has a long history of being inherently wrong, probably based on Christianity's long strong influence.. and nudity is seen as morally wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's an important distinction, that we as Americans automatically associate nudity with sexuality, because we are so sheltered from it, until the internet at least. But I can see plenty of the world doesn't make that same association.. and we have to consciously try to do the same in cases like this.

       This is clearly some type of loop hole that they exploited and it doesn't make it right. Yes it may be legal based on the def of CP but any decent human being would agree that having a 10 year old oiled up and posing in Playboy(of all magazines) is incredibly disturbing.

       You are wrong.  It's not a loophole.  Child porn is precisely defined in legal term for two very important reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Producing child porn is one of the most serious offenses on the planet.  The punishment can be life sentences.  This is on par with murder.  So if a person is going to be this severely punished (and rightly so since child porn is absolutely abhorrent), then the law better damn well not be ambiguous when it comes to defining what constitutes child porn.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         To protect true art.  For instance, Michelangelo's work, as other masters, often portrays nude children with their genitals in plain sight.  If the law was ambiguous as to what constitutes child porn, there will be people who use that law to censor and destroy art.  Again and again throughout history we have observed the use of misconstrued or misinterpreted law of the day to destroy.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Your negative view of Playboy as a "porn magazine" is understandable.  However, you must understand that since its first publication in 1953, Playboy has NEVER lost an obscenity case.  The reason was that it had very strict rules concerning actual sexual acts.  It was a NUDE magazine, that's all.  Now, I must admit, to compete with the onslaught of video porn in the 90's and the development of the internet, the content has gotten racier and more degenerate.  But up until the 80's it was just pictures of naked women.  That's all.

       I am saying does it break any laws?  If so, then whoever took those photos and the publishers should be sent to jail.  If you don't like the law as it stands, that's okay too.  You should write your congressmen to change the laws to be more encompassing.  But I guarantee you that Playboy still exists is because it didn't break any laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws exist for 2 reasons.  One is to punish the guilty.  The other is to protect the innocent.  The by-product of this arrangement is that sometimes grey-areas exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the child porn laws were all encompassing, meaning anytime a nude child is photographed a crime is committed, the following people would be in prison:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        A mom who takes a photograph of herself taking a bath with her baby so she can show it to her when she grows up.
       </li>
       <li>
        A dad who takes a picture of his son using the toilet for the first time because he is so proud of him.
       </li>
       <li>
        A physician who records a procedure on a minor's genitals so she can instruct others.
       </li>
       <li>
        An artist who uses oil paints to express the delicate nature of a nude young subject.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is why child pornography laws are VERY precise in its definition and why specific criteria must be met before it is considered child pornography.  It is there to protect the innocent as much it is there to punish the guilty.  And believe me, I'm all for punishing the vile producers of child porn.  It is one of the most despicable crime a person can commit.

       And if that's what you believe, then you should do everything you can to change the law to be more accommodating to your view of what constitutes obscenity and indecency.  I have no problem with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are others who would argue that art and porn are different things and that Playboy did not cross the line.  Who's to say who is more correct?  What makes one opinion more valid than another?
      </p>
      <p>
       The line has to be drawn somewhere, no doubt.  So the lawmakers of our country DREW the line the best as they could.  They put down in writing specifically what makes a material child porn vs art.   Without the specifics of what makes something actually pornographic, the law would be immensely abused.  A malicious prosecutor could, for instance, put people in jail that they don't like simply because she had a video on her phone of her changing a baby's diaper that happen to show the baby's genitalia.   Laws need to be extremely carefully worded and unambiguous as possible.  That is the only way to prevent abuse.

       I think it's grey.  It's inappropriate no doubt.  It's definitely something that I would NEVER allow my daughter to participate in.  But at the same time, I do not think it's pornographic in nature.  Who am I to tell Brooke what she can or cannot do with her body?   Who am I to tell Brooke's mom what permission she can give or what permissions she can't give?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's against the law, then yes, I would have every right to prevent them from doing it.  But if it's not, then I really don't see why I have the right to tell them or prevent them from doing anything they wish.  What gives me the moral high-ground to be able to say you should go to jail for this?

       Sigh..... And that is the crux of your argument, isn't it?  What was their intent?  What was their motivation/agenda?  Well, I'll tell you.  Their agenda was to make money.  Pure and simple.  They could care less what you think of their publication.  If they sell their mags and they don't go to jail, they're happy.  You think their ultimate motive is to sexualize minors?  Nope.  They want to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the next logical argument would be, did they use Brooke to generate money from perverts that enjoy maturbating to minors?  Or, did their pursuit of money lead to perverts and child pornographers?  Well, here's my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't blame creators for how that creation is used or what degeneracy arises from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case 1:  Einstein created the theory of relativity.  This was used to 1. make the atomic bomb.  And 2. to make nuclear energy.  Now if you blame Einstein for all the Japanese that died, I would say you are wrong.  Einstein provided content that was used in ways he never dreamt of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case 2:  I take a picture of my kid's foot because it's really cute (and it really is), and I post it on facebook.  Some pervert takes that picture and masterbates to it.  The foot fetish gets so strong that he eventually becomes a serial killer.  Am I responsible for creating a serial killer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Case 3:  Horror movies in the 70's depict psychopaths enjoying dismembering people.  The rise of serial killers who decapitate and dismember victims throughout 70's and 80's is undeniable.  So the movies of the 70's is responsible for the rise of serial killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see where I'm going with this?  No.  Of course you don't.  Because you're completely engrossed with your vendetta against child pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me finish by saying this.  You and I both agree that the Brooke photoshoot on Playboy is immoral.  No doubt about it.  I agree.  But what makes our morals more "correct" than other people's morals?  Hmmm?  Do you know what it is?  Well I'll tell you.  Laws.  Yup.  If it's illegal, then put them in jail.  If it's not, then let them be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, this is why I am so strongly against drug laws.  I find drug laws COMPLETELY ridiculous.  Who the fuck are you to tell me what I can and can't imbibe?

       So morals should be reflected in law?  You fucking idiot.  This is how we got the inquisition.  This is how we got the holocaust.  This is how we got discrimination.  When morals overcome logic we get injustice.  Everyone has a right to say and do whatever the fuck they want. 
You think a few pictures of a nude girl oiled up is child porn.  Great.  You have every right to think so.  Why do you deny my right to say, no, I don't think it's porn? Why do you deny my right to say, it's disgusting, sure, but it's not child porn.

       Laws should be neutral.  It shouldn't incorporate morality.  If you do me no wrong, then it shouldn't be against the law.  Period.  Why is that so hard to understand?

       I understand what Psy was saying. He's saying that just because I deem something as being immoral, it doesn't give me the right to condemn other who disagree. And the only way that I can I justify doing so is if it gets codified into a Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that I don't understand his point, it's that I'm disagreeing. There have been plenty of times in history when something that should have been illegal was legal and vice versa. So are you telling me when slavery was legal, an abolitionist didn't have the right to condemn it, simply by virtue of it being legal?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about when two different countries have opposing laws. It's illegal for a woman to drive in Saudi Arabia. Can a progressive Saudi not hold the position that women should have equal rights and therefore condemn those support the ban? Isn't this based on a moral argument just like I'm arguing that 10 year old should not be sexualized for monetary gain?

       The first few sentences are the meat, purely morals guiding laws having lead to atrocities.. they argued about how witch hunts worked before, etc. That's what you didn't respond to. Morals tend to be emotionally driven, not just rationally.

       Perhaps read my other comment that has an article that gives much more detail, where I also make a case of what's considered sexual, etc.

       I feel my other comment does respond to what you said. In America, we tend to look at any nudity as inherently sexual, while in other parts of the world where nudity is referred to as normal, it's on public TV, there's no age requirement for nude beaches, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That post also linked to an article you surely didn't have enough time to read.. and that article goes over how a judge in 1983 decided the pictures themselves were not sexual in nature. The article points out that it was intended as art, and that the pictures weren't taken by the pornographic magazine, but they were featured there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also showed the actual photographer said something along the lines of "she was supposed to be sexy" which is inherently creepy. But I also think that to "sexualize" someone involves some sort of sexual act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff they show on TV in other countries that feature nudity aren't sexual in nature, you might see someone get out of the shower naked, but they aren't spreading their butt cheeks or doing anything sexual, to the best of my knowledge that isn't allowed on their public TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen enough censored pictures that I can say I can see why a judge would say they aren't sexual. I think most non weirdoes would agree that putting lipstick or makeup on a kid doesn't make them "sexy", and I think you're thinking from the perspective of the would be criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think it's objectively "art" when the old man referred to a kid as "sexy"? No. But I can also imagine the judge saying there was no sexual poses or anything that makes it inherently sexual. I'm not sure that adding makeup to the equation makes it sexual either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess you should make a better case that it's been sexualized, or is all nudity inherently sexual? I still agree that I think it's morally wrong to be in a porn mag, which the judge said is illegal.. but if those photos were in an art exhibit instead, are they still wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this whole thing ruined the guys career, art exhibits didn't want him there, so in a way, justice was kind of served.

       Whether it was sexualized or not was not even in debate. This is a new argument that you are bringing up now, whether it was sexualized in nature or not.

       That was exactly what you said, exactly what I answered, and exactly what you just said wasn't in the debate. So I'm not sure what you're trying to say now was the debate, I replied exactly to what you said.

       Consider this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         During the witch trials of Salem, the typical argument went like this :  You deny that this woman is a witch, when she obviously is.  Therefore, you support witchcraft.  Therefore, you are a witch.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The argument presented in this post :  You deny that this is child porn, when it obviously is child porn.  Therefore, you support child pornography.  Therefore you are a child porn producer.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is the exact line of argument that is being present here.  Without actually examining the evidence, everyone is boarding the "Yes, child porn is heinous.  Burn the fuckers.  Nevermind examining the actual material."
      </p>
      <p>
       Child pornography is the most heinous, most disgusting crime I can think of.  I would say maybe even worse than murder.  So if we are going to accuse people of committing it, we better damn well make sure we are correct in our accusations.  If you're making up your mind before examining the evidence, you are just as ignorant as those who sent all those women to the burning stake simply because they were labeled a witch.
