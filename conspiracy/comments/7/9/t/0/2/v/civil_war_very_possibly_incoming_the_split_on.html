       I've been predicting this for the past year or so. It's gonna happen soon, pretty obvious. I swear every single day there's a new protest or riot or w/e.

       John Titor predicted this would happen, followed by World War 3. Predictions just came a bit late haha. Fascinating.

       Well before the election it was pretty tame. Protests and such sure, but not that often, and certainly not clashing between the left and right.

       No one is going to get into a civil war over the left-right paradigm. That's not going to happen; people are not THAT dumb--no one believes in the system that much.

       Cool. But, that doesn't not mean civil war!!! Civil war means people arming themselves and killing their neighbors. It's not a north south thing anymore. Who's the enemy? Who are people supposed to go kill? Democrats vs. Republicans? Stop it. That is ridiculous. People don't care that much. I don't know anyone that is willing to bare arms right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only possible way this could go down is the people vs. the government. And, with that comes secessions--no one is prepared for that.

       It could be a race thing, party, class....lots of options.  Also maybe not a physical was but possibly an economic war or mental?  Keeping people divided is good for big businesses/government

       I am no way advocating violence and my thread was just figuratively stating the situation as extreme and obviously it being r/conspiracy I wanted to see if anyone has thought about the possibility.

       A left-wing protester was killed by a nazi. Both the left and right inflict violence on each other. Both are arming with guns. Leftists constantly engage in violent conflicts with police. Police regularly kill protesters.

       I believe that life is too comfortable for a Civil War to occur. A few opposing sides may clash in the streets, but... The American prison system in it's draconian glory or remaining in the free world enjoying hot pockets and McRibs (Insert favorite Netflix show).. P.S. There is no Rick And Morty in the big house.  Say I'm lying.

       I don't think life is quite as comfortable for everyone...sure some you or I may be doing good.  But the majority of Americans don't even have $1000 in savings let alone a couple hundred bucks in the market to see any returns that 45 has been boasting about all year..

       I used to say, "there's no way we could have a civil war with the NFL being on Sundays". Better lace them boots.

       In reality, there will be no civil war on a mainstream scale. If I go to war, I won't be able to pay my mortgage and will lose my house. American's have netflix, cell phones and porn. Why would they wanna go fight in trenches?

       What I can see is more rallies vs counter rallies and I can see these getting deadly fast. I can find a gullible idiot in a group of 1,000 people and that's all it takes to kill serious people.

       Random but to bring up NFL I think attacking the league was one of the dumbest things he's done so far to incite such division.

       I support the troops for most of them don't have the choice, but damn there's not a lot more American than football/free speech

       It was a great idea. Almost all of us Trumpers hate the anthem protests and I think a lot of Dems don't like it either. We didn't have anyone speaking up for us about our thoughts on it, and now we have President Trump doing it for us.
