<p>Either way, I&#39;m interested in how people point to him as a savior, let&#39;s donate 10 million to him.. while he works against your very interests(for those it applies to).</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think you should, but the very idea that we had a debate and you conceded rather than argue into oblivion is the very simple basis that you aren&#39;t crazy.. and neither am I, if I&#39;m wrong or someone shows me my perspective is flawed, I concede.</p>

<p>I really wish more people in this sub see themselves as fallible, and every idea they put out there as an opportunity to grow by learning how they&#39;re fallible.

<p>He talked about it and could have released names before. I believe what he says is true. I just question his motive for exposing it. And now he is asking for money to release names in order to keep him safe. </p>

<p>I saw him on Celebrity real life or something like that, which is far form real life. Anyway, it&#39;s show where a bunch of washed up celebrities live together. And the guy was a real tool. Complete drama queen, attention whore, narcissist - you name it. You&#39;d just have to see it for yourself.</p>

<p>Then I also watched that &quot;2 Coreys&quot; show. Guilty pleasure and he exhibited mass tool like properties. I know editing can do a lot but you kind of see the real person shine through. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally subscribe to the pizzagate idea, but someone who blatantly calls am entire idea lies.. in my opinion, it seems like he&#39;s more focused on keeping our attention on what he&#39;s saying, than investigating more recent things that can lead to a conviction.</p>

<p>Maybe he will name names.. but the fact that he&#39;s looking for 10 million before he does.. to name people from over 20 years ago, while claiming anything newer is lies.. yes. It reeks to me.</p>

<p>Perhaps. Since you&#39;d need to cover more ground realistically.</p>

<p>Yeah, electoral college worked fine back when it was a pain in the ass to communicate. But now? You could literally do it online with no problem, and just count votes. The movie &#39;the circle&#39; had proposed something like that. Everyone just goes online and can vote on any issue instantaneously as soon as it&#39;s put up to vote. And you&#39;d get instant feedback and results.</p>

<p>There&#39;s problems with digital security, but still. We can have <em>much</em> better systems than the crap we&#39;re stuck with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree actually. It&#39;s just that the original idea was based on the idea of checks and balances. California is the state that seems most often attacked about voter fraud. If we go purely off of the popular vote, any one state can influence the election.</p>

<p>The only way the electoral college negates that, is that each state is given a different amount of influence.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll concede, no one man or womens voice should count more or less than another&#39;s, based on where they live. That&#39;s simply absurd. But.. there still needs to be a better system to make sure no one can game the system.. and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s voter ID. But.. there has to be something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I&#39;m against it, is simply because I&#39;m a technology guy.. there&#39;s plenty of ways to track people, that&#39;s how companies like Google or Amazon can accurately guess at most of are life, from aggregate data.</p>

<p>I feel like physically creating new forms of tracking us is moving a step closer to having microchip implants.</p>

<p>Put it this way, your argument that we should be able to track data technologically is on point, and my only argument is that if the data can be manipulated simply on numbers alone, it destroys the system.</p>

<p>But from a tech guys perspective, you can be recognized based on your speech patterns alone, whether spoken or typed. While people are arguing about whether Facebook is listening to you.. the real question should be about the chip in your credit card that is legally required.</p>

<p>The more we try to physically track people, the simpler it is to control people. No analysis required, you simply had your bar code (prisoner number in Nazi days) scanned, and you can be identified as.. what?</p>

<p>When our credit cards can already be used against us, any form of physical identification is already sliding towards the same.</p>

<p>I will literally kill myself the day mandatory microchips are required, and I feel like voter ID is simply a step in the direction.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m just a tech guy, what do I know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s late, I&#39;m tired, but if you want me to give evidence about how the new credit card laws, or more accurately how the credit cards are being used against the people.. I&#39;ll link it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Simply put, creating another way of physically tracking people, like voter ID, is just another way of skipping over the red tape. Why would they use a lesser jumping off point, than the easily hackable information already legally required by credit cards?</p>

<p>Given our already legally required physical tracking, why would voter ID start at a lesser jumping point?</p>

<p>Bottom line, voter ID is already going to start at the technological point we are at. So.. how is this not a step towards transdermal microchips that can easily be logged?</p>

<p>That&#39;s my entire point, making our info easier to track isn&#39;t better for us. Want to walk into a gas chamber? Make it easier to categorize you. That&#39;s how so many Jews did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally copied and pasted the actual tweet. This rule seems kind of ridiculous when you&#39;re attempting to be as accurate as possible about the source. Do I have to retype every word they said to be able to post? Or can you click the first link and see that&#39;s literally how the information was presented?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I don&#39;t agree with what they said, so it would feel like even more of a punishment to have to retype it in non angry words, lol.</p>

<p>Also, I feel like their tweet belongs in r/totallynotrobots</p>

<p>But honest question, can the rule be modified for cases like this, where you&#39;re literally quoting verbatim? No offense, but if you clicked the first link, you&#39;d see the robot posting exactly what I posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because he doesn&#39;t buy pizzagate doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have a legit claim. He was saying his claims long before pizzagate was thought of. I don&#39;t agree with the amount of money he is asking for tho. A lot of us here don&#39;t support the same causes but I don&#39;t think that should discredit us to each. Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying he doesn&#39;t have a legitimate claim either.. it&#39;s simply the idea of cognitive dissonance. There&#39;s many people here likely promoting the idea that they should fund him.. while he&#39;s possibly trying to promote the idea that they are wrong.</p>

<p>Do you want to contribute money to someone that&#39;s trying to get money to fund what happened two decades ago? Or are you better off trying to talk about crimes happening, right now, by people that aren&#39;t asking you to donate money.</p>

<p>I&#39;m totally all for Corey to name names right now, maybe help corroborate ongoing investigations.. but he&#39;s being dismissive of anything that&#39;s currently happening.</p>
