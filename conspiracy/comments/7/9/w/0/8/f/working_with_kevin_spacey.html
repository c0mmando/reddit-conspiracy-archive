       Just a short anecdote from when I worked on HoC in Baltimore with Spacey. I'm sure this will not surprise anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worked as a freelance PA... running around doing multiple jobs for cast, crew, extras, office. I interacted with many of the cast members. All (for the most part) were very nice. A couple times I was asked by Spacey's assistant (who was a gay male) to fetch something for the star. However, right after Spacey caught wind there was another
       <em>
        very young
       </em>
       male PA, I specifically told to let this young man handle any requests for Spacey. No matter what, I was supposed to get that PA-- even if he was right in the middle of another job.
      </p>
      <p>
       One night, KS (kind of oddly) came out with us to a bar in Adams Morgan. He wasn't invited, pretty much just crew members. It was weird...but who was going to tell Kevin Spacey he couldn't join us? The entire night he was all over the young PA and just about every other young guy there. I never heard this myself, but a male co-worker told me Spacey asked him to his hotel, whispering "how would you like your first time to be with an Oscar winner?"-- or something to that effect. I guess he just assumed he was a virgin. LOL I have no idea why-- he was 25.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many ppl from the set will probably come out with stories like these. Or already have...

       Just my opinion, but I don't know if this had much to do with KS gaining the satisfaction of "turning" a guy. More to do with the power aspect. He seemed to use the Oscar thing as a way to feel more important...on more than one occasion. I'm not saying any of his behavior was "right", but he did come to work prepared and didn't delay filming at least-- which is a personal pet peeve.

       This is not a fake story. I lived in DC/Baltimore/Arlington/Alexandria for over 7 years. I made the commute (along with many other local actors BTW) to Baltimore daily. If you've ever lived in the area, you'd know it's not exactly that far. There's a reason many people refer to it as DC/Baltimore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you've ever been to Baltimore you'd know it's not really the type of city where people "go out" (with the exception of the Inner Harbor).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, do you REALLY think celebs don't go to bars/restaurants outside of Hollywood? Do you think it's always the "talk of the town"? The National Enquirer doesn't report every time RW or KS goes anywhere in DC or Baltimore. There wasn't anything ABNORMAL about KS being seen out in DC. Everyone knew he was filming HoC at that point. And, as I mentioned, his homosexuality was an open secret on-set. The pass he made wasn't announced to the entire cast and crew for heaven's sake!
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and this was posted on r/conspiracy AFTER I posted on this board.

       Sound familiar?

      <p>
       I understand this is the "conspiracy" board. But, I really don't think my experience is that hard to believe. Especially because I'm not claiming he molested little boys in front of everyone. I just thought this was an interesting story I would share. Believe it, don't believe it. But, I don't really think your reasoning is all that solid-- especially after my explanation above.

       I wasn't really saying that there was anything "wrong" with it...I'm sorry if I portrayed it in that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do believe it does show he had a propensity for hitting on underage looking men. I only know him from these brief encounters, but I wish he had the courage to come out in a way that the LGBT community could be proud (and these allegations weren't true for that matter). It must be incredibly difficult for anyone. But, this isn't the way to do it IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, his actions made my co-worker very uncomfortable and I cannot imagine KS wouldn't see that. Yet he continued his pursuit.

       Hey, thanks. I really appreciate your response on this. I do think there's some (a lot?) of exaggeration going on here made by straight males...I'm taking it all with lots of salt.

       I'm not gay myself and not really plugged into the community. I was just curious if it was actually "a thing".

       Please see above. As I understand it, there's many other stories that have been posted on the internet that posters have found to be cut and paste from somewhere else or just plain far out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish more people understood the Baltimore/DC area and it's not exactly like saying we were filming in Hollywood and we went out in Vegas the same night. The 2 reasons the above poster gave are quite ridiculous and don't disprove anything. Granted, I have given you no photos or anything. And, it's up to you to believe it or not. However, it's really unfair to do that based on the fact the above poster thinks Baltimore is so far away from AM that my story is impossible to believe. And/or the paps (that I've never seen in DC) would be all over KS...
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you will reconsider, based on what I've just told you. I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
