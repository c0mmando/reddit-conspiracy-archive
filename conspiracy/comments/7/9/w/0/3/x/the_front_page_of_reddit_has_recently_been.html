        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the recent political/Vegas/Hollywood conspiracies, for the first time (perhaps ever) people are realizing that they can no longer dismiss these conspiracy theories outright because &quot;someone would have talked.&quot;</p>

<p>Average Joe has now been repeatedly exposed to conspiracies that lasted for decades and that involved hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of individuals. Their entire paradigm has been altered.</p>

<p>This is why the latest push back against conspiracies has been increasing in intensity. </p>

<p>Yesterday, numerous threads on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> (including the #1 post) were about pedophilia in Hollywood, Kevin Spacey, and the odd predictive nature of TV shows like Family Guy. </p>

<p>There was even a clip (on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>!) from Family Guy that showed how unsettling it was that Osama Bin Laden was depicted trying to get through airport security, when the episode aired in 2000.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/79u0sv/til_gary_webb_the_reporter_from_the_san_jose/">the top post</a> on TIL is about the &quot;suiciding&quot; of Gary Webb, and it currently is on the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and is approaching 30k upvotes.</p>

<p>Again...we have a <em>long</em> way to go, but I can&#39;t help but notice that there has been a shift, and it&#39;s becoming more than just subtle.</p>

<p>Keep your wits about you <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. As more people wake up, TPTB are going to become increasingly desperate. </p>

<p>There are currently 9,000 users here right now...welcome to the newly woke!</p>

<p>O Brave New World that has such people in &#39;t...</p>
