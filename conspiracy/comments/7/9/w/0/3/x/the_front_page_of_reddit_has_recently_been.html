       With all the recent political/Vegas/Hollywood conspiracies, for the first time (perhaps ever) people are realizing that they can no longer dismiss these conspiracy theories outright because "someone would have talked."
      </p>
      <p>
       Average Joe has now been repeatedly exposed to conspiracies that lasted for decades and that involved hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of individuals. Their entire paradigm has been altered.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the latest push back against conspiracies has been increasing in intensity.

       Yesterday, numerous threads on
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       (including the #1 post) were about pedophilia in Hollywood, Kevin Spacey, and the odd predictive nature of TV shows like Family Guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was even a clip (on
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       !) from Family Guy that showed how unsettling it was that Osama Bin Laden was depicted trying to get through airport security, when the episode aired in 2000.

       Today,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/79u0sv/til_gary_webb_the_reporter_from_the_san_jose/">
        the top post
       </a>
       on TIL is about the "suiciding" of Gary Webb, and it currently is on the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and is approaching 30k upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again...we have a
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       way to go, but I can't help but notice that there has been a shift, and it's becoming more than just subtle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your wits about you
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . As more people wake up, TPTB are going to become increasingly desperate.

       There are currently 9,000 users here right now...welcome to the newly woke!
