       evidence that Trump is a puppet. And honestly Trump is probably our last hope no matter your opinion on whether he's a puppet or not. They held back in rigging it this election they will never hold back again. And theirs absolutely NOTHING anyone can do to the deep state without having the power of the president. It's impossible to get a civil war going either.

       That has  nothing to do with the voting system. At all.

       The voting system we have results in a two party system every time, with the growth potential of minority views severely restricted. If you're not with one of the two major parties, you're nobody.

       If a legal deal bothers you, why aren't you screaming purple murder at our POTUS for scheming with a known enemy of the state? Then lying about it at every opportunity. Did you forget about Eric Prince, as a Trump surrogate, trying to set up a
       <strong>
        back channel
       </strong>
       of communication with Russian operatives in the Seychelle Islands for the express purpose of bypassing the US intelligence net?
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither HRC nor Obama ever did anything like that. At the same time, if the Uranium One deal broke the law, fucking prosecute anyone involved. I don't give a shit about defending HRC. But if breaking the law is what upsets you, apply your zeal equally.

       Who gives a shit that he said that?! We all know Trump has an inartful way of speaking. I care about whether or not his actions back up the anti globalism foundation he campaigned on and they do: Trump killed the TPP and withdrew from Paris Climate Accord. Neither of these actions would have taken place with HRC, and we all know it whether or not shills attempt to gaslight this fact. So Trump's words, actions and his we-will-never-surrender-to-the-false-song-of-globalism supporters are consistently against globalism.

       Who cares about an inarticulate sentence from Trump? He has an inartful way of speaking, as we all know. I care about his actions and they have been decidedly anti globalism and NWO, which is all that really matters, isn't it? Also, his supporters are fiercely against globalism and NWO, and they will hold his feet to the fire if he wasn't already taking anti globalism actions.

       I phrased it like that because people tend to use different names and have different theories on how everything is really organized.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding is that there are at least two factions, and they do not see thing the same way.  One faction wants to continue gutting the U.S. and the other faction wants to save it.  You can guess which faction supported Trump over Hillary.  Hillary is a NWO globalist, and their agenda is to have a one world government.  I am guessing that Carter was the last President that was not a NWO globalist, but I would have to check.

       I think the US constitution needs to be made MORE democratic. We know more since the writing of the document and I would be comfortable with there being some sort of national conversation about reforming the document. But not anytime soon, with the current leaders and the current sociopolitical climate. Like maybe in a couple decades after we've ridden out this storm.

       Sarin gas, that one seems like it would be a war crime at best. We don't acknowledge that kind of stuff as a country. I would love for the globalists to take over and make the United States adhere to that stuff. But it does not apply.

       Wiping the server is not a crime since she did not actually do anything. There is no evidence that she ordered them to do anything. At best she violated code, but not criminal law.

       You're here.  On r/conspiracy.  Saying that Hillary has even a shred of honesty in her at all.  When there's massive amounts of evidence posted here every single day proving you wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You actually believe that one of the most brazenly corrupt politicians who has a pretty well-known reputation for being a lobbyist and banker puppet - who operates a pay-to-play scam using her charity as a slush fund cover - is being even remotely honest when she says she wants to "restrict money in politics" and "regulate banks"?

      <p>
       If you judge a candidate only on their platform, then you're an easily misled fool and you are honestly better off somewhere other than r/conspiracy, where you can put your limited mental faculties to better use. I look at their patterns of behavior instead, because I wasn't born yesterday and I've learned enough about the world to know that the platform a politician runs on is 95% crowd-pandering bullshit to shill for votes.

       Hyperbole. Many people of this country have plenty of intellectual capacity. That's not even debatable. Also, okay, we're in a bad patch in certain ways. Sticky problems. But get out among ordinary Americans and you'll discover a bedrock of moral fiber that you should be proud to be part of. Travel abroad.  Some other places have lots of decent human beings too. Yes, life is quite difficult. And tragedy and injustice and evil -- yes, I'm going on record to assert that evil is a reality -- are too common. But our society most likely isn't going to completely collapse. Yes, buckle up. But also join up...with most of us who are doing the best we can with it all.
