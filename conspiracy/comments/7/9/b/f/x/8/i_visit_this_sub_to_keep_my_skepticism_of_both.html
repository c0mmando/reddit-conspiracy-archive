<p>A businessman, who isn&#39;t a politician, is operating under the capitalistic assumptions under which the US people like to consider themselves part of. His goal is to make money and make good deals for good returns on investment.</p>

<p>A career politician who sells out natural resources for pennies on the dollar and participates with the intelligence community in elaborate schemes to gradually assert authoritarianism is another animal, entirely, and should be executed for treason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my sentiments. I wish there were more people in the middle like us (am I assuming correctly that you consider yourself as more of a moderate with a leaning toward one side or a third party?). The moderates and &quot;third partiers&quot; are really the ones who decide elections. I too prefer Trump over Hillary, but I don&#39;t blindly agree with everything he says, does and believes. I also like many ideas the left has, but I feel like the left is failing the citizens right now by succumbing to the wants of corporations and elites. My support of Trump is due in part for the way the left is acting. 2 years ago I actually leaned left. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really happy that Trump is stirring up Washington and for the promise of holding everyone accountable for their actions. He is putting a spotlight on all the uglier things in Washington.</p>

<p>There are no absolutes here and normal people don&#39;t think in the black and white terms that you are laying out. It is possible to want to see Hillary in prison and not be a fan of Trump. It&#39;s also possible to like some of the things Trump has done and not trust him on the whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, you too. I try really hard to bring reason and unity to this sub and a few others where I know that people from all parties frequent. I want people to realize that it&#39;s possible to see and understand both sides, that coming to the middle actually helps hold our government more accountable. If everyone we&#39;re moderate, we would have much more reasonable legislation passed and it would promote more unity amongst the citizens. The extremes on both sides are what is killing this country.</p>

<p>If people would just realize that our fight should not be Democrat vs Republican, it should be citizens vs government / corporate corruption. We, as citizens, sit here and blame each other for everything and the people at the top (both sides) just watch us fight amongst ourselves while lining their pockets and gaining more power everyday. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s all learn how to think for ourselves, let&#39;s all have our own opinions on each issue instead of just voting on party lines, let&#39;s all take a stand against greed, corruption, and unchecked power. Let&#39;s all realize that racism is actually perpetuated and made worse by politicians and partisan politics. The first step is to figure out what we agree on, and not focus on what we disagree on. If we can do all of this, we can have a government that actually works for the city ensure and the rest will sort itself out.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant lol</p>

<p>What&#39;s going down is an elite and elaborate military operation that&#39;s been planned for a long time. I&#39;m not convinced this isn&#39;t going to get better and better and better until suddenly it&#39;s a long con that turns catastrophic, but I&#39;m willing to ride it out because what we&#39;ve got now is pretty close to country-ending catastrophic anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, relatively new account with LOTS of post karma but very littel comment karma (suspicious) - I&#39;ll reach out for this &quot;olive branch,&quot; but I&#39;m going to stick to my long-held belief that you&#39;ve been co-opted since you say you prefer one of the two options. That&#39;s a part of the plan and a part of the problem. Trump is of the system, has benefited by having cronies work within the system, and is not changing anything on his own that is worth any veneration.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a part of the show. I&#39;m not attacking you, I just follow my compulsion to point out that if there is anything he is doing, it&#39;s playing his part for the true powers of US royalty and world partners. That&#39;s it, and that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>So yeah, branch held. Drain the swamp and all that. Pretty sure we all agree on that &quot;black lives matter&quot; cornering-level of sentiment. When he starts draining the cronies of their military bloat and exposes the continuity of (shadow) government, I&#39;ll buy one of his fucking steaks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been here exchanging my thoughts for a long time, and I read between the lines, especially when there is an appeal to emotion in a self post title. I hope and know that others hold me to that. I mean, take it how you will, but a relatively young account with juuuuust enough post karma to look legit but no real wit behind the un, and limited interactions across subs... it&#39;s worth skepticism. As in, you are. To me, anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be antagonistic, but I have studied enough material to know that this is either intentional propagandizing, or subconscious promotion of Trump, but it wasn&#39;t a slip-up either way.</p>

<p>&quot;I visit this sub to keep my skepticism of both sides healthy. I still prefer Trump over Hillary. The connections to Russia on both sides runs deep. This is my olive branch to the lefties here — I hope we drain the fucking swamp of all on both sides that are attempting to destroy this country.&quot;</p>

<p>You could have said:</p>

<p>&quot;I visit this sub to keep my skepticism healthy. The connections to Russia on both sides run deep. I hope we drain the fucking swamp of all on both sides that are attempting to destroy this country.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s either latent disgust with &quot;lefties&quot; that you can subdue enough to bravely say that you hate corruption, too, but have to grit your teeth while doing it - or it&#39;s an attempt at Trump promotion while wearing the mask of an olive branch extender.</p>

<p>I <strong><em>am</em></strong> telling you what you should have said in that instance, I&#39;m not hiding that because I am real person with vested interests. It&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to do as &quot;real&quot; people - it&#39;s how cultures are formed and how we shape things. Inherent to that and my points is language, and what I did was say yours sticks out para-linguistically as that of someone who doesn&#39;t actually care about extending olive branches. </p>

<p>Were you an olive-branch-extender prior to November 2016?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, this is how the waters have gotten muddied.
Most Democrat politicians are NOT left wing or even centrist.
Most Republican politicians are NOT moderate right wing.
The VAST majority of both parties are made up of EXTREME right wingers (EXTREME corporate capitalists) and authoritarians.</p>

<p>Both parties are:
NEOliberal (deregulating the market to give corporations more control) and NEOconservative (warmonger foreign policy).
Crony capitalism is also a type of NEOliberalism, it involves using the state to be favoritist
towards their crony corporations like giving free subsidies to corporations from our tax money.</p>

<p>Liberal vs Conservative is corporate marketting bullcrap:</p>

<p>Say someone identifies as a &quot;liberal/conservative&quot;
but they&#39;re sick of the lying Dems and Repubs,
they&#39;ll come crawling back because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been
brainwashed to identify themselves as. Identity politics stereotypes propaganda.</p>

<p>Dem vs Repub:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jLNnO7O.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/jLNnO7O.jpg</a></p>

<p>Lib vs Con:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hdh0EEf.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/hdh0EEf.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is how the media (controlled by 6 corporations)
pretends the spectrum is like:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kwb0zXJ.png">https://i.imgur.com/kwb0zXJ.png</a></p>

<p>What the real U.S. spectrum looks like:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png">https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png</a></p>

<p>Clinton, Obama, etc. are not left wingers and never were (although Obama
was more moderate in his 2008 primaries campaign but flip flopped a lot).
Corporate media shits on real left wingers.
Bernie&#39;s policies were of NON-authoritarian social democracy (mixed economics, not extreme socialism and not extreme capitalism)
but the corporate media still tried to imply he was a crazy communist dictator and other propaganda against him.</p>

<p>This is how I think the elites are trying to achieve the NWO conspiracy,
they&#39;re trying to get extreme right wingers or extreme authoritarians or both elected in order
to increase corproate-banker control over the people:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good you&#39;re offering an olive branch to people of different political leanings, I&#39;ve tried to do the same by explaining (to the best I can)
how the anti-establishment region of the spectrum is likely
moderate libertarian versions of center left, centrist and slightly right (beyond that is NEOliberal/NEOconservative corporate banker shill extremists).</p>

<p>Another example of the corporate media lying about politicial leanings
is the French election: Macron is a (literal) Rothschild banker shill
(they even pulled this illuminati style stunt: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cBCIkE5.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/cBCIkE5.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>who is extremely right wing (nearly to the edge of the European spectrum
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/4GBqQRg.png">https://i.imgur.com/4GBqQRg.png</a>)</p>

<p>but the corporate media (even RT and BBC who are not usually as bad as CNN/Fox News/MSNBC)
repeatedly called him a &quot;centrist&quot;....lol.
No one in political science calls &quot;between libertarian and authoritarian&quot; as centrist.
Centrist only refers to the center point of the economic axis, not the (libertarian-authoritarian) social axis.</p>

<p>But even if I was wrong about this, if the media calls Macron a centrist,
then Bernie Sanders qualifies as centrist even more so,
yet the corporate media tried to imply Bernie was a dictator or something, and that Macron is a centrist. Both are massive lies.
Pure hypocrisy...or at best, lazy copy/paste type journalism.</p>

<p>Macron is trying to get rid of worker rights (hence protests against his labor reforms),
calls hard working workers lazy and &quot;slackers&quot;, and wants to give tax breaks to billionaires while
not helping the poor.....this is nowhere near centrist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unbelievable how they try to normalize extremes.
If more people can see that the two party system is a scam
of corporate extremists, and that more moderate politics tend to be
anti-establishment, we can agree on many more things and push the elites out.</p>

<p>Other things we could do: end the CIA, nationalize the FED,
use debt-less gold/silver backed currency rather than Rothschild toilet paper money,
boycott or pirate stream the corporate media, get money out of politics (reform political campaign finance),
encourage grass roots movements with no corporate donors, etc.</p>
