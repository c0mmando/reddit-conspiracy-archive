       If it was, there wouldn't be a silence. They would be promoting some agenda with it. As it stands, we are just seeing something gone wrong, probably inside our intelligence branches, or the complete ineptitude of law enforcement in the United States. Neither one is that good of a scenario. They are wanting to hush it up rather than promote an agenda, and that tells me that it wasn't a planned false flag or hoax as some conspiracy minded people think. Just my two cents.

       You're in the realm of speculation, not evidence. Look for new legislation involving body scanners in public venues, and new gun control proposals. Even if the event doesn't directly precipitate an obvious agenda right away, the hoax will have already proven extremely lucrative for the perpetrators. Look at the Go Fund Me sums for example.

       You're speculating that since the outcome of the event isn't unilateral gun confiscation or something obvious like that, therefore we know it was not a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, in the realm of evidence, we look at the event itself and see if it has the 3D appearance of a real shooting, and of course it does not, for many reasons, not the least of which being that there is still literally no evidence of anything or anyone having been shot.

       Except for all of the people who died and were wounded... some still in the hospital. YOU are speculating that people weren't shot simply because you refuse to accept any video you see of it or the words from people who know better. One of the victims could walk right up to you and show you the wound, ticket stub, hospital bill etc and you would swear to fucking hell it is all fake. There is no evidence to convince people like you. You are simple minded and live in a state of paranoia. I feel for those that have to actually interact with you in every day life.

       My suggestion to you is simple. Go take a few psychology courses. Go sit in on some victims groups. Go fucking educated yourself on tolls of grief. While you are at it...educate yourself on grieving while in the spotlight. Do something other than assume you know wtf is going on and calling victims liars. It is VERY common to laugh through tears...I'm sure you have even heard the term before. Fuck of all with all this bullshit. There is video of people getting shot. There are lawsuits. Wtf more do you want? Nothing would change the thoughts of the demented. And that is what you are. You must be to call victims liars when you have absolutely ZERO proof other than YOUR sick ass opinion.

       Look, everyone grieves differently.  For example, if you're a crisis actor claiming to have lived through the most sad and harrowing experience ever, you're going to be fighting back smiles, laughs and giggles.  Especially with all that COLD HARD CASH from the gofundme page!!!!

       If you are a crisis actor and you perform that badly...then I suppose you are out of a job huh? You are very obtuse. Do you really think that the government or whoever would use someone who couldn't pull off a simple cry and act sad? You are dense. Like I said...go educate yourself. Get out of your own head and learn something other than your own opinion.

       No, jackass. I operate on facts. Do you have any facts to back what you say? No yt videos or other bullshit. Real hardcore facts? Do you have proof that dead victims are alive? Do you have proof that shot living victims arent actually shot? No, you don't. Until you have either of those two things...you have ZERO fact. What I have? I have people that treated the victims and saw some of them get flown home in caskets.

       No, you are playing by YOUR rules and preconceived "facts" with no basis in reality. If all you have is a slight smile and nervous giggle while on the verge of tears...you are a fool yourself to let that be enough to convince you that people didn't die. How many times are you going to link to that same exact thing?? Doll, no need to say "fuck you" to me...you have already fucked yourself in this game called life by being unable to use deductive reasoning and adequate fact gathering. Dont fuck anyone...you don't need to procreate.

       These are things based in FACT no just some idea that people are crisis actors. Psychology easily explains what you keep trying to assume isn't normal..when in fact it is one of the most normal of raw emotions. You are doing a disservice to yourself by relying on yt to reach you things. Get up, get out and go learn it in the real world. There are a million sources that explain to you what you see in the video you love to reference. However, your crisis actor bullshit is conjecture and has no reality behind it.

       You dupe yourself by relying on yt as your educational source. Surely you must realize that anyone can make a video and call it fact. However, psychology is based on years of research and human behavioral studies that show without a doubt that nervous laughter in the time of grief or stress is 100% normal. Anyone that is an objective thinker would put some research into the flip side of their own ideas. Which you clearly haven't done. You only source yt videos that aren't at all related to the events in question. You can't prove their were crisis actors there. You need to have facts to back up your theory and you have nothing other than opinion and conjecture. Until you can show that the person you are calling a crisis actor is 100% a crisis actor by proof..then you are only assuming based on your opinion. Find a video, website, photo of the person you make the claim against being a known crisis actor then you have a leg to stand on.

       Sorry not sorry, but you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. If you're suggesting bullets DID NOT enter/wound/kill a lot of people on 1 October, then you're force feeding yourself blue pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe try stepping out of your shadow box and consider the question of what. went. wrong. Because whoever was in charge of the thing clearly dropped the fucking ball, bigly. To suggest the entire event was successfully choreographed between multiple LE agencies
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       Mandalay
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       ISIS
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       Event Security
       <strong>
        ALL TO FAKE KILL PEOPLE?
       </strong>
       then I think maybe you should take a creative writing class because that shit stinks.
      </p>

       Before bringing your "skeptical mind" to a conversation how bout running your thoughts through a "but why?" filter. Sure would save a lot of fucking wasted time.

He is stuck on crisis actor theory too and keeps posting a video of the girl who giggles while turning her head....tried to school him but he is dense. Go back and read the rest of this thread...it is pretty telling at how thick headed some of these people are.

       Yeah, absolutely they were added later even if they are bullet holes, which is extremely unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assumed at some point we would see pictures of things with holes n them, but that is even weaker and less convincing than I was expecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the carnage and damage at the site where thousands of high-caliber rounds rained down for ten minutes, and all the innumerable bullet holes in wild patterns and lines there would be.  This doesn't even come close.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire event is about the mind control tactic known as the power of suggestion: show a bunch of people running and screaming, show a thing that's supposed to be a bullet hole on a water tower, and let people's imaginations fill in the rest so that they are convinced there was actually a horrific mass shooting on this grand scale.

       I agree. Even if those marks are on the Vegas fuel tanks, there's no reason to believe they were caused by live rounds and no reason to believe they weren't either already there, or added later by some other means.

       Someone needs to think of your children if this convo is any indicator of how close and simple minded you are. Once you decide something that is what it has to be huh? Evidence to the contrary be damned. Even if it is a topic you know not a single thing about. You have taken zero real world steps to back up your ideas.

       "High powered assault rifle" sounds real scary...until YOU actually get off your ass and do the research into how the weapons operate once a bump stock is applied, how does the distance effect the severity of damage done, the amount of damage the specific bullet is designed to cause. That weapon with those bullets isn't even approved for deer hunting because they are designed to injure not kill (am I lying? Telling the truth? You wouldn't know because you won't learn). Stop being an internet parrot and educate yourself. A shot from that distance is not as deadly as you may think. It would need to hit major areas to cause immediate death. Please, go learn something. I'm not going to keep schooling you asshat.

       Lmfao. Wow...you really rely on yt for your answers to life huh? Well, there are a few variables that your precious video didn't include. How about the fact that the shooter was on the 32nd floor shooting down into a crowd from a building over 300yds away? Or...how about the fact that the targets were MOVING? Oh, and lets not forget about the bump stock. Ffs you can't use this video to prove shit. Same gun perhaps but not a single one of the variables are the same. Hitting someone straight on is going to do more damage than hitting at an angle. Get off the internet and go learn some shit from source other than yt.

Idgaf where you grew up or what you say you shot...or as you say prove it?? Lmao. I'm pretty certain you have never shot at 22,000 people from 32 floors in the air over 400yds away with a bump stock attached while those people were all faced different angles and moving. Nope, you haven't. Nothing even remotely close. You can't compare any of the shit you are spouting to the events in Las Vegas.

       The fund was set up by city council not the victims themselves (but they should). Welcome to 2017...instead of sending the donations to a bank account set up for the victims or to the Red Cross for the victims...they now use gofundme....wow that is such an indicator that the whole thing never happened!! Wtf ever not. Victims funds have been set up for tragic events for decades. This is nothing new...just a different form of making donations. Next....

       Your own video evidence discredits your entire point. Here let me educate you so you don't look stupid again ok? That area where the is a huge white bandage (can't miss it right?) that is in fact part of the NECK! FOR FFS DO YOU NOT KNOW BASIC ANATOMY?? Why would he need a sling? A brace? Please explain? The bullet obviously didn't affect his range of motion. The last thing you want to do is restrict movement if it isnt necessary. You know what that does? Decreases muscle mass which makes it take longer for the wound to heal! Not ever single gunshot is deadly nor does it do massive damage. Most gunshots are none lethal and very treatable. Stop watching movies and YouTube. Honestly, if you want to educate yourself on things of this nature...go interview a doctor..I'm sure a lot of them would be willing to speak to u if they have time. Also, unless a bullet is subject to cause more damage they don't remove them. There are many people walking around with bullets in them.

       That was a waste of time watching.   A lot of work went into stopping and replaying footage just to try and force their perspective and frame it in the way they want you to see it.   To think that someone who went through a grisly scene would be eloquent in recalling the situation... try listening to a ‘Nam vet recount stories all these years later and then you can call them crisis actors as well.

       Noticed. Which is one of the only reasons I don't think false flag. I don't buy for one second that he didn't have documented mental issues (just my opinion). One reason they may have swept it away to cover the fact that our mental health system is horrible...most mental health professionals no longer take insurance (a lot of plans don't cover it anyway) and if they do cover it ...you have to pay the doc and file the claim yourself to get your money back..which isn't easy to do if you don't know what you are doing. Another thing to is that this happened in Vegas...the cliche that what happens there stays there...well they kinda aren't joking. Did you hear about the shooting at Planet Hollywood there a few yrs back? Or all of the drug snuggling bust at the airport? The bombs at Luxor yrs ago? Vegas keeps their shit quiet. And when something does hit the news...it is a blip and done. Google and see...I'm not joking.

       Hmm I have no reason to lie about this but I do find it out that there are many really shilling for there were no victims.

       I do think it was a false flag. Some type of psyop. But I think people died.

       I'm not much of a faith-based kind of person, so I'll wait for evidence.  So far there's not been anything offered up other than smiling and giggling crisis actors with lucrative gofundme pages.

       No matter what you show they won't believe you. Don't bother. A victim could walk up to them and show them the wound, ticket stub, hospital bills, pics from the event and they would still swear that person was lying and it was fake and they were a crisis actor. The idiots that want to say no one died are mentally incompetent.

       No, dude. It was a FF, not a hoax, and it went really wrong somehow. One of their biggest fuckups yet. The reason nobody's making a huge antigun thing out of it is because they don't want anybody thinking about the Vegas thing AT ALL. That's how big a fuckup this was.

       If you are a crisis actor and you perform that badly...then I suppose you are out of a job huh? You are very obtuse. Do you really think that the government or whoever would use someone who couldn't pull off a simple cry and act sad? You are dense. Like I said...go educate yourself. Get out of your own head and learn something other than your own opinion.
