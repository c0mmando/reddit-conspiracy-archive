       I'll be the first to admit to doing shit like this in the past, largely deflecting certain narratives and overly promoting others. The "conspiracy community" has been divided along partisan lines like most other sectors of American life-- I'm not sure if it's always been this way but it's impossible to ignore now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with this persistent weaponizing of politically-motivated conspiracy theories (by various oppositional forces, basically the Trump camp v. Clinton camp, still), basic facts are being massaged and/or fabricated, and the full truth is being deliberately obscured. Whenever this happens, the people suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of all the developments the past week has provided, and with seemingly "big things" soon to come on these fronts as soon as Monday, it's a crucial time to take a step back and try like hell to find objectivity in all the propaganda swirls and counter-accusations. I feel it's our burden to present everyone's potential crimes and wounds as they are, regardless of which "side" you support.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hasn't been easy to stay the course in this regard, but neither politicized MSM nor politicized independent media will do it for us. It's up to us to process all this shit and provide a clearer, unbiased picture of things. I will try to do so, and I hope you will too.

       <li>
        <p>
         An investigation into Trump and crew Russian collusion has been ongoing since July 1016 and has produced no charges and no real evidence.

       <li>
        <p>
         Uranium one info comes out showing collusion between Clinton and crew with Mueller past involvement in what he is currently investigating.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Russia collusion narrative is quickly flipping onto the ones that have been promoting it against Trump for over a year.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because of Mueller's involvement in Russian collusion WSJ calls for his resignation.

       It's funny that you pretend there is no bias here. You just stated a list of Trump supporter talking points and then say it's common sense. If meeting in Trump tower and delaying sanctions isn't evidence of cullsion, then the uranium deal isn't one either. Up until two weeks ago, everyone here was defending Russia. But I guess democrats aren't allowed to make deals with them.

       Like what? The reality is the whole Trump Russia narrative has swung full circle on the accusers for the sole reason of their own past crimes and collusion with Russia. It's so obvious that the deep state PR teams are working this sub hard core to shift blame and minimize the ridiculous irony of it all.

       Did you know that the current sanctions on Russia have been quite good for the country, helping them to get off the export oil, import nice things path.
The other side is the sanctions moving Russia away from trading west and instead trading east, moving the trades away from the dollar and into the new gold backed yuan, this is bad news for the US (an the UK and EU).

       I will certainly try. I definitely thought Clinton criminality wasn't going to end up being the case after Clinton Cash/the election/multiple investigations didn't end up producing any charges, just more suspicions, but I'm sensing something's there that various forces have tried to bury for years now.

       While I voted for her (considering the alternative), nobody elite and influential is immune from corruption, and I have no problem with her, Billy, or any other "Democrat" going down if they were involved in shitty things. Ditto Republicans and the Trump camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we step away from corruption consideration and move into outright ideological propaganda territory (the recent "the goal of LGBT movement is legalizing pedophilia" post), obviously my beliefs come into play. My point is we cannot afford to do this when actual crimes and conspiring is on the table, across party lines.

       It has been like that for decades...I've lived it.  It will likely always be this way.  Why? because there will always be people who deny conspiracies exist, they're hidden and therefore easily dismissed and people generally want to believe in good triumphing over evil.

       We could start by discussing the myth that "This sub has been taken over by T_D." It's one of the most parroted myths in this sub and about this community in other subs. Pretty much nobody questions is. We have a subreddit here that is largely divided right down the middle. Half of this sub is anti-Trump. The other half of pro-Trump (I will prove this in a minute). The main difference is that the anti-Trump users constantly claim that their anti Trump comments won't get upvoted (they usually do), that this sub is a mirror of T_D, etc. The other side just takes it and never questions it, allowing all of these people to shit on us on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that there are a lot of different groups in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware that anti Trump posts get upvoted into the thousands?
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/">
        Here is a list of some big anti Trump posts that I found from a quick search.
       </a>
       From 1,000 to 26,000 points, and these are just
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       examples. They go up to 94 percent upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on pro-Trump posts, the comments are usually dominated by anti-Trump comments. Some people have claimed that this is due to users from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       posting those comments and upvoting, so I also included  examples of regular users in this sub (not from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ) posting anti Trump comments and receiving tons of upvotes. In fact, most of the anti Trump threads I cited never made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but I was conservative at the bottom and only cited ones below a 1000 points. A post at 1000 cannot reach
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , therefore this sub's core userbase must have posted and upvoted those comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people need to explain how these anti-Trump posts can get upvoted so much
       <em>
        and with such high percentages.
       </em>
       Some of them are 90 percent upvoted. In most anti Trump threads and most pro-Trump threads, anti Trump comments are usually at the top. How can this all possibly be true if "this sub has been taken over by T_D?" There must be a pretty even split between anti and pro-Trump people here, otherwise the anti Trump posts and comments would never have a chance.

       The reason this place gets called T_D 2.0 is because they
       <em>
        literally crosspost their BS, non-conspiracy posts WORD FOR WORD here
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Because mods here have openly admitted to banning users and manipulating posts that are critical of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I have witnessed people calling for brigades from there, here and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what leads people to call this place a T_D 2.0.

       I have noticed that when I point all of this out, these users always deflect, change the goalposts, etc. It's rationalized because they want to continue to defame the subreddit despite all of the evidence to the contrary. Some people are just so stubborn that it doesn't matter how much information you provide, they are still right 100 percent.

       You're talking about this sub's mods, not the users. They got rid of flytape, and one of the bigger anti Trump threads on this sub was posted by a mod and received over 90 percent upvotes:

       It’s often called The_Donald 2.0 because you have this giant portion of the community here cheerleading for a fucking New York real estate mogul, with over a DOZEN rape and sexual assault allegations against (including against children), who BRAGGED ABOUT EXPLOITING THE 2008 HOUSING CRASH (which, excuse me, but I was under the impression that this sub HATED that sort of corrupt, predatory corporate behavior), who hung out and praised well known pedophile party boy Epstein, who continues to beat the drum of nuclear war... who lies CONSTANTLY and has gaslighted this entire country on a daily basis, who expressed his affinity and admitted to his close relationship with the fucking Clintons, who promotes a cult of personality
      </p>
      <p>
       And the people here deflect for him. Jump through hoops. Turn on whoever their corporate pimps tell them to on a dime. I mean, literally you have people here who will praise people like Comey, Joe Scarborough etc one day and completely turn on them the next. By the way, that’s happening with Manafort right as we speak. Lol it’s fucking amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then these people are not only tolerated in this sub, but they’re allowed to literally shitpost here, break rules, cross post their political narratives here ...?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you wonder why?

      <p>
       You are CLEARLY either not a critical thinker or you’re not participating in this conversation in good faith. In fact, you’re probably pushing a narrative yourself now that I think about it....

       Here's the problem. You assume that I am a trump supporter. You probably also assume everyone who dislikes the mainstream media are Trump supporters. Anyone who criticizes Hillary must be a Trump supporter. You look around and see this type of content on this sub and assume there are Trump supporters everywhere. It's a paranoid delusion. Get rid of the binary worldview and accept that reality has nuance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also assume that anyone who believes the media has been witchunting Trump to some degree must support him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do some users support Trump? Well, why do some users in this sub support Bernie Sanders? Why do some users support Ron and Rand Paul? Why do some users support Trey Gowdy? It'e because these politicians have marketed themselves as "outside of the establishment." There are tons of Trump supporters who are not conservative. They just think Trump is crazy enough to make waves. Is it true? Is Trump "anti establishment?" That's a good question. You have to ask yourself why the FBI, CIA, NSA, and the majority of the mainstream media is united against Trump if he is part of them. I think it's better to say that Trump is a conman real estate billionaire (probably racist and definitely misogynist as well) but he's certain not part of the "Deep state" or "Establishment."

       That would be a great thing to say if we didn't see blind partisanship on both sides in every single fucking post on this sub. Trump supporters thinking he gives a shot about them and isn't owned by the same people clinton is.  Clinton supporters ignoring all her crimes. Literally every post in this sub is that way

       I barley see any Clinton supporters in this sub maybe during the election, but they're all gone now. I don't think she even has any supporters left

       Damn you're making shit up now. Please note my posts where I've defended the Israeli state and constant illegal occupation/subjugation of the Palestinian people. Nonsense.

       You’re a scoundrel. What is your agenda here? How can you just lie with no hesitation like that? Dude, I BELIEVED you before the other dude defended himself and I dug for myself.
