       So according to multiple news outlets, a British newspaper got told about something big going to happen, 25 minutes before the JFK assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a "lone gun man",
how can someone know and leak it?
Therefore it must have been either the "lone gun man"
leaking it himself (unlikely?), or multiple shooters (and one of them alerting a newspaper)
or even more so a bigger conspiracy effort probably including the CIA
and other scum alphabet agencies where one person thought it
was moral to give JFK a chance at surviving by leaking "something big's going down".
Who knows but this makes the lone shooter thing less likely IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why wasn't JFK stopped, surely someone would have
the intelligence to put two and two together
"hey something big going to happen in 25mins....oh and JFK driving through this place in 25mins, nah just coincidence" lol come on.

       I don't know, it seems like the president is about always somewhere that he could be shot or something. It wasn't a big event so why would anyone think to connect the two?
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is why did someone alert a British reporter? Most likely it was a return on a favor but there are many other possible reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has turned out to be an A+ plan for political distraction.

       How did the collapse of WTC7 manage to get into the BBC news script about half an hour before that happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       We often talk of predictive programming tipping us off to some impending unpleasantness that the PTB have cooked up for us somewhere down the road while we remain in a state of denial until it hits us right between the eyes and that only strengthens the determination of far too many to simply deny that such people could exist or do such things even more than they previously did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our psychological responses follow a very different logic of their own and in many cases are just the very opposite of what more ordinary logic inclines us to believe they should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Patty Hearst joining and helping the very people that kidnapped and were holding her for ransom and yet the psychologists that testified on her behalf explained that the likelihood of hostages coming to sympathise and even identify with their captors isn't actually all that unusual under such stressful situations and went on to site numerous other cases where it had happened as well.
