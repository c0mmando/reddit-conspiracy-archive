       I agree. I always suspected it but the JFK stuff solidified it.. and anyone who ignores this is suspect to me now - David Seaman - Alex Jones. They were suspect before but now I don't have much hope.

       Yes on the occult ritual. Have you read "The Most Dangerous Book in the World" by SK Bain? Essential.
      </p>
      <p>
       The really fucking scary thing is that with JFK, 9/11, a few other things, all the pieces are so arcane, occult and seemingly inexplicable, that it starts to dawn on you that maybe this conspiracy, or whatever the hell it is that's going on, ISN'T LINEAR. Then it gets really fucking spooky.

       I'm totally with you - haven't read that book though. I have seen enough stuff to tell me that there seems to be some really weird stuff going on. Many of these people involved are not stupid people at all. I also don't understand how something this big could work if these people were just scum. There is something else going on here. We are so in the dark though it's tough to make sense of it all. I tend to believe the person called "Svali the illuminati informant" was legit though.

       I've read Svali's stuff. Her story is similar to others'. Kerth Barker's first two books are similar and even more insightful, IMHO. Especially the "Cannibalism, Blood Drinking &amp; High-Adept Satanism." That's a must-read, along with "The Most Dangerous Book in the World."
      </p>
      <p>
       If we ARE dealing with a non-linear...experience? Conspiracy? Entertainment for beings unknown?....it only reinforces my Christian faith, frankly. All that's happened has already happened.

       He goes into great detail about satanism and its beliefs. Basically relentless consumption, right up to and including cannibalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talks about reptilians, but not with any level of confirmation. He didn't make it to the top of the satanic food chain, so to speak. He talks of high-level spiritual evil, what many call "demons" and such, but is unsure whether they are interplanetary beings, inter dimensional beings, or differently evolved beings from planet earth.

      <p>
       I read those first two books a few months ago (1: "Angelic Defenders &amp; Demonic Abusers" and 2: "Cannibalism, Blood Drinking &amp; High Adept Satanism") and don't recall all of their content.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I want to inform you (and anyone else following this thread) of a few key points that will help you and maybe assist in convincing you to buy at the 2nd book, which is the most informative. The first book is informative, but it is also more of a personal story and that personal story is sickening in spots with its depiction of child sexual abuse, torture and murder (not that the 2nd one is barrel of laughs).
      </p>
      <p>
       One key element of satanism is "The Judas Principle" and
       <em>
        betrayal.
       </em>
       Kerth says there is an "easy" A-B-C to understand "The Judas Principle" ("To satanists, Judas Iscariot is a hero, not a villain," Barker writes).
      </p>
      <p>
       A- Always tell the truth unless there is some substantial advantage to telling a lie. In this way people will assume that you are honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       B- Be careful to only tell a lie when you know you won't be caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       C- Cash in on your reputation for being honest only when there is a substantial gain in wealth or power to be achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This segment of the book uses a couple examples, Mark Zuckerberg among them. Not only did he betray his friends, he betrayed society by making Facebook a defacto spy tool for NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another essential principle of satanism is "Devourment," according to Barker. The Sphinx is a symbol of that, and cannibalism is one expression of “devourment”:  "The Illuminati wants to devour all the resources of the world. It wants to devour all the nations to create one nation. It wants to devour all individual freedoms and human rights. It wants to devour all wealth. Cannibalism could be considered to a form of devourment, and as such it was an acceptable Satanic practice."
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, there is an entire chapter devoted to blood-drinking and adrenilized blood-drinking in the 2nd book, as well as a chapter specifically directed at blood-drinking addicts explaining how they can kick their habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I want to help, but not spoon feed. My object is to get you (and others, especially but not limited to other Christians) to read Barker's 2nd book, because it's so informative and insightful. You can buy it for $9 new on Amazon, and if you have Prime, there's no shipping.
      </p>

      <p>
       I have nothing financial to gain from this, have never met Kerth Barker (though I have emailed him three times through his website, to no avail), and have no affiliation with him in any way other than spiritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can read the first 40 pages of the book in pdf here:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple final notes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "MK Ultra’s real purpose was to take traditional Satanism and turn it into a scientific method." — Angelic Defenders &amp; Demonic Abusers
      </p>
      <p>
       Barker also had a book called "Psychic Development for Prosperity, Self-Defense &amp; Political Influence" that I wanted to purchase, but it was listed as "sold out" on Amazon. Now it's no longer on Amazon or even his personal website at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck. Thanks for your interest. I don't think I'll answer any more questions, but you never know. Please strongly consider buying Kerth Barker's second book.

       I will definitely get that book when I can. Thanks so much for the information. I really appreciate it too. One of the big problems for people is trying to get all the info necessary while sorting through disinfo. To me that is the biggest thing preventing people from finding the truth. So having people like you who spread important info is so great.

       I find it funny when I see some old tv show talking about Trump as president. I wanted to watch some Will Ferrell era SNL and the first episode I came across was the 1999 first episode. It was a skit that was insinuating American needs a crazy reformist. Of course Trump was in the sketch.

       Of course he's a puppet. But for who? Was there a military coup? Why did they all line up behind him on inauguration day? That's still never been explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt he's a puppet. Not sure he's a puppet for the same puppeteers the last five or six puppets danced for.
