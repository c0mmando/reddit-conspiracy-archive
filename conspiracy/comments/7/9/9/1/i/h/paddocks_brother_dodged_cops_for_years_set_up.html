<p>From the article: &quot;The tactics Stephen Paddock&#39;s brother used to avoid authorities are being described as &quot;evil smart&quot; ... and have disturbing connections to the Vegas shooting.
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ... Bruce Paddock has been on the run for more than 2 years prior to his arrest this week for child porn. We&#39;re told he changed his appearance and moved often to keep cops off his tail ... and took drastic measures to avoid getting nabbed. 
Our sources say Bruce rigged up places he was living with booby traps that included propane tanks tied to doors ... and used cameras to create homemade surveillance systems around his properties.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Maybe Stephen was an asset they had to get off the radar for some reason. They use his real pedo brother or falsey accused pedo brother as someone they can get rid of without anyone caring as the dead body. This doesnâ€™t explain why hundreds of people needed to be shot up though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya it does.  Seeing as how they said Paddock&#39;s vehicle had a ton of explosives in it.  Didn&#39;t they say his home got broken in to?<br/>
Stephen&#39;s hotel room was setup with cameras.
What if Bruce was being supported by Stephen who was this autistic, legendary video poker player.  Stephen mentioned to Bruce he was in his will.  Maybe Bruce and Stephen both shot in the hotel room.  When they tried to escape, Bruce made it, but Stephen didn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t believe Stephen shot himself in the heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does this justify the LVMPD&#39;s waiting an hour to breach his brother&#39;s suite? I say yes. The shooting had stopped, there were no more shots coming out of the room, but there were cameras and cables going into the room, and also other guests on the floor. They said they anticipated booby traps, and if this new insight about Bruce is true, they were right to. </p>
