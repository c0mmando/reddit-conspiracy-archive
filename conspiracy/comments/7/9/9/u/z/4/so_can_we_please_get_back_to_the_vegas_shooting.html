Hell, it makes more sense for the <em>NRA</em> to have carried this out, because it allows them to resurrect the spectre of gun control, driving stocks and sales way, way up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of whether or not SH was a real event or a staged one, the purpose of them isn&#39;t immediate gun-control. That could NEVER work in America and TPTB are well aware of that. And yet, no public armament is obviously the goal. So they get there through incrementalism. We&#39;ve seen ever-increasing horrendousness acted out using autos and semi-autos, and whether or not they were real, they are given ever-increasing presence on TV and news media. </p>

<p>Each event has been followed by numerous bills invoking tougher gun restrictions (of which many are actually reasonable, such as waiting periods, safety courses, and background checks to some degree).</p>

<p>Incrementalism is how we got from the land of the free to a quasi-police-state and it will move us farther along that path if we don&#39;t pay it any mind.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just how this game is being played because it has to be played this way. Perhaps you think it&#39;d be good if the public had no weapons anymore. I don&#39;t think it is. To each their own, but that&#39;s the game. </p>

<p>Whether or not they would go as far as producing those events themselves (either real or staged) is also for each individual to judge. I am convinced that they do (both kinds), you may not be, and that would be fine too.</p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;ever-increasing?&quot; The single worst mass shooting (discounting massacres like Wounded Knee) happened less than 4 weeks ago and it&#39;s already become a non-topic. The NRA put an 8-day moratorium on their ads after the shooting because <em>that&#39;s how long they calculated it would take for people to forget</em>. And they were <em>right</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And they all fail. Even the bump stock ban that the NRA <em>endorsed</em> is dead in the water. The lobbying money is too appealing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t presume to know my feelings, it&#39;s insulting.

<p>I mean exactly what I said and what you describe. We&#39;ve had bad shootings, which were followed by worse shootings and there will be another before the end of the year that has an even bigger toll attached if the trend holds steady.

<p>It&#39;s the frog in slowly heating water from Al Gore&#39;s mockumentary. Just enough to put us on the edge, grasping for every &quot;helping&quot; hand, but not enough to make us leave the pot.</p>

<p>Federally, at this point, sure. But states have been implementing lots of new rules to be tough on guns.</p>

<p>If I wrote &quot;perhaps you aren&#39;t seeing it happen because you aren&#39;t looking&quot; you would presume that I&#39;m presuming this to be the case. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m suggesting it. Perhaps you do pay attention and we&#39;re just looking at different parts of the same elephant.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t think it&#39;d be good if the public had no weapons anymore. I didn&#39;t mean to insult you.

<p>I&#39;m not sure where you read anything of the sort. Jones is a fucking shill, but come on, man, he talks loudly about wanting Trump to kick down the doors of Podesta and the Clintons, not yours.

<p>No one is grasping for helping hands, though. There&#39;s some calls for gun control, any bills die in committee, and three weeks later, everyone&#39;s moved on. The frog&#39;s not being boiled. The water&#39;s getting colder.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Only in states were gun control was popular to begin with. We haven&#39;t seen a wave of gun control sweep the country, it&#39;s been mostly confined to liberal states where there was already decently strict legislation. New York, Cali, Massachusetts, etc.</p>

<p>We are. It seems like you&#39;re focusing more on the efforts (which are considerable), and I&#39;m looking at the results: i.e. <em>absolutely nothing</em>. Whatever your feelings on the NRA, their influence and objectives cannot be discounted.</p>

<p>Points for not being a dogmatist. I&#39;ve seen televangelists who&#39;ve said point blank that gun control is satanic because Jesus would want christians to own AR-15s. My position is in line with the great socialist George Orwell&#39;s: &quot;That rifle on the wall of the labourer&#39;s cottage or working class flat is the symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there.&quot;</p>

<p>Re-read the article. He talks at length about how he&#39;s prepared to round up &quot;10,000 of these people and have trials and hang their asses.&quot; <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/07/10/alex-jones-prepared-shoot-people-race-war-he-wouldn-t-enjoy-it/217194">Jones has been explicit that he plans to kill people if there&#39;s severe unrest.</a> <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/10/04/alex-jones-everybody-needs-be-packing-because-get-ready-democrats-are-going-be-killing-people/218136">He&#39;s been adamant that democrats/liberals will need to be killed.</a> <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/02/06/alex-jones-i-m-ready-die-trump/215248">And he&#39;s been open that it will all be in the name of Trump.</a> You may not listen to him, but there are millions that do, and you can bet that they&#39;re armed.</p>

<p>And on Jones... You&#39;re probably right that I shouldn&#39;t ignore him just because I think he&#39;s a fuckwit, because the fact is that so many think he&#39;s the real voice of America or some shit like that, and he&#39;s espousing some pretty vile and violent shit right there.

<p>Let&#39;s take an obscure device pretty much unknown by the public at large, that even most gun enthusiasts looked at as a novelty item that was ineffective and only good at wasting $0.30 a round in record time, that had never been used in a crime in this manner, that was just federally reviewed and approved by the previous administration, and kill 58 people. Let&#39;s then tweet about a bill they are shaping and then show 0 resolve trying get the bill passed or get public support.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason was, from a crazy rich dude who wanted to go out with a bang, to a foreign intelligence entity, to our own three letter agencies getting bored, gun control was not it. Well, bump stock control was definitely not it lol.</p>

I think it&#39;s mostly older people who maybe lived through that era that go balls deep in to it (yes, I know there&#39;s younger people too that get involved, please don&#39;t point out the obvious).</p>

<p>But there&#39;s 58 people dead from some asshole&#39;S in Vegas, which should get a shit ton of mention.  JFK from what I know of it all, is pretty much a &quot;We know what happened, but we want a piece of paper to tell us we are right&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your viewpoint and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that some of us (and maybe it IS the older part of our group) has been on this journey long enough to realize it&#39;s a continuum, which, while it didn&#39;t start with JFK certainly first became obvious to a large enough portion of the public that they needed to give us a name – the henceforth to be branded as conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>I&#39;d call the JFK assassination a foundation stone upon which all the decades that followed were built. Conspiracies existed for millennia before it, but never has the public (or at least such a significant part of it) really been aware of it. And that only happened because 1) the entire operation was a clusterfuck (like LV), when it should have been simple. They had to cut corners everywhere in the cover up, which is why we&#39;re still talking about it. And 2) there was already TV, so there were witnesses describing things on live TV that they shouldn&#39;t have seen, and all that. The internet only makes our curiosity more potent, and our minds more connected, but the rulers of the continuum have learned their lessons too, and actively counteract our progress.</p>

<p>Proving with pieces of paper and a sound argument that connects them all together, that JFK was IN FACT killed by people who would later become president themselves and who defined the foreign and domestic policy for every single decade that followed up until right about now – that would be the most powerful force for mass awakening we&#39;ve come across.</p>

<p>Everything else can&#39;t be proven (even with solid proof) if this one can&#39;t be proven in the public mind. If people forget about the JFK files, they&#39;ll only remember that nothing came of them, so they will no longer seriously question the official story. And once that conclusively happens, they won&#39;t ever consider 911 being a part of this continuum, or Sandy Hook, or Las Vegas. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so dangerous to dismiss (again, not claiming that you did so consciously or with ill intent).</p>

<p>But as I said, there isn&#39;t a reason to choose. LV is a big piece of the puzzle. Sometimes it&#39;s just more helpful to know where the edges are first before trying figure out where this new piece goes. Again, I don&#39;t mean to criticize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a video where a man attempts to direct medical attention to potential survivors.. Most definitely looked like a warzone. Multiple people shot in the head, blood &amp; bodies everywhere, significant others screaming and bawling there eyes out over their fallen loved ones.. Pretty horrific, and also pretty messed up how easily people can write something off as a total fake story just cause they&#39;re distanced from it. I know people first-hand who were actually shot there, and survived, but there were a lot who didn&#39;t survive and that shit was very fucking real.. now as far as paddock being a patsy, that&#39;s open for discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ideally, I&#39;d want a panel of experts to evaluate whether the psychiatrist is fit or not to practice. If not, they could suspend his/her license while he/she seeks treatment. Psychiatrists have huge responsibilities, this is quite literally a life or death situation, they can&#39;t be allowed assess people&#39;s mental health and prescribe drugs if their judgement is severely impaired. I don&#39;t know how it works in the US, but in my country, the psychiatrist would be compensated by his/her insurance for the duration of the treatment. I won&#39;t entertain the possibility that nothing happened in Las Vegas. If the psychiatrist believed in a conspiracy theory that&#39;s more reasonable and more difficult to disprove, no one would suggest suspending his/her license in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care what people believe as long as they aren&#39;t trying to  push impressionable minds towards dangerous ideologies.</p>

<p>I replied to the first comment because I was shocked that anyone could believe that the Las Vegas shooting was a hoax. I think that it&#39;s fascinating, but also really sad, that some people could be so divorced from reality. You&#39;re obviously unable to grasp just how insane these claims sound to reasonable people. It&#39;s at the level of people who believe that the Earth is flat, that the Moon doesn&#39;t exist or that the Earth is only 6,000 years old. My theory is that your brain is trigger-happy with the feeling that something makes sense. Many people, me included, have experienced this with LSD. It has to be extremely compelling if it can convince you that clear evidence is fabricated. Or the brain might be just as trigger-happy with the feeling that something is fake. Some people look at the Moon and claim that it&#39;s fake. This isn&#39;t something that could be explained by simple gullibility or scientific illiteracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think your intention is to use emotion and social pressure to get me to shut up.  You won&#39;t even allow for the possibility of Las Vegas being a hoax, so to me I instantly think shill. Of course I am not accusing you of that. Which leaves me to believe you must be really really guliible and easily emotionally minuplated. It might be from too much lsd.  I&#39;m not sure. That fact that you were so shocked to find people didn&#39;t believe the shooting was real yet you refuse to even acknowledge the possibility they may be right makes me not respect your opinion as much.  If you ever want to take that red pill, just type in &quot;Boston Unbombing -how and why it was a staged false flag event&quot;. Watch the first 1-2 hours and you&#39;ll see that Boston was staged and you&#39;ve been duped.  The last 2 hours go into Manchester,  pulse, London bridge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment history is proof enough that I&#39;m not a shill. I never posted a comment in this subreddit before the shooting. The only conspiracy theories I believe are the death of David Kelly, the death of Gareth Williams, the Russian apartment bombings and the theory that the Kremlin has journalists executed.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find the video you mentioned, but I watched a couple of conspiracy videos about the Boston Marathon attack just to indulge you. They were terrible. From a teen in his basement to Alex Jones in his studio, they see what they want to see in pictures and make weird logical leaps that just make them sound deranged.</p>

<p>No video on this topic needs to be 1 or 2 hours long. A single convincing piece of evidence would vindicate your theories.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that it&#39;s incredibly weird to believe that most — if not all — high-caliber terrorist attacks are hoaxes? Do you believe that the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris were hoaxes too? My buddy just left his loving girlfriend, his family, his friends and his cool job working with artists he loved, some of whom he worshipped growing up, to hide under a new name god knows where?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling you to refrain from sharing your theory if you believe in it with so much conviction, I definitely don&#39;t want to reinforce someone&#39;s paranoia. The fact that the vast majority of people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> think that you&#39;re nuts should tell you something though, considering that the vast majority of people outside of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> already think that the people who post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are nuts to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to find it, I couldn&#39;t. It may not be on YouTube anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad that I got to talk to you, although I wish I could have learnt something about this condition. It&#39;s scary that obvious crackpot theories can become deeply-held beliefs, that clear evidence can be wished away by calling it fake and that reasonable views get dismissed as the opinions of shills. And while this happens, you get rewarded with a feeling of enlightenment, the certainty that you&#39;re able to see something that others are not able to see.</p>

<p>I really believe that your brain is firing like a brain under psychedelics. It makes so much sense in view of my experiences with LSD. I&#39;ll try to talk about this with a psychiatrist I know just to see if there&#39;s an accepted theory that explains this or if they simply treat it like they would treat schizophrenia. Hopefully she won&#39;t mind talking shop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was finally able to ask my friend and she told me that she never met someone who believed that large-scale attacks were hoaxes in her 20 years as a psychiatrist, but that she has had plenty of patients who believed in far-fetched conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>She told me that these patients are almost always suffering immensely and that she works on this pain to get them to open up.  She said that there are two categories of conspiracy theorists, the ones with delusions (which can be treated with medication) and the idiots. She implied that it was very difficult to make patients abandon their conspiracy theories of choice, which makes sense since it&#39;s a deeply-entrenched worldview. It&#39;s so entrenched that some people can believe in theories that are incompatible with one another and it&#39;s common for them to dismiss the evidence they&#39;re shown as planted or invented to silence conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Anyway, she didn&#39;t tell me anything groundbreaking, but I thought I&#39;d share it with you since I asked her about this because of you. I wonder if you&#39;re isolated and suffering, but I wouldn&#39;t expect you to share something so private.</p>

<p>Take care!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I wouldn&#39;t take someone&#39;s guns or have them committed to a psychiatric hospital for believing in conspiracy theories. I don&#39;t think that anyone is advocating for this. It just isn&#39;t reasonable. These restrictions should only be applied to people who are a danger to themselves or others. The guy who went looking for a basement at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria with a rifle belongs in jail, but I don&#39;t think that most conspiracy theorists would threaten someone with a firearm.</p>

<p>Not believing that we went to the Moon isn&#39;t a manifestation of a mental illness, it just shows that the person making this claim doesn&#39;t know much (if anything) about rocketry, radioactivity, photography and a few other disciplines. These are the people the psychiatrist qualified as idiots. I collect American and Russian space-flown artifacts, from the Apollo Program to the International Space Station. I have intimate knowledge of the manned flights to the Moon and every single conspiracy theory I&#39;ve read about it was silly as hell. The conspiracy theorists always embarrass themselves.</p>
