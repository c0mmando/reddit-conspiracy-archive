        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My guess is that so-far redacted files will indicate CIA/FBI failures in some capacity that will make the organizations look bad (worse) to the public, not revealing they were behind it in some way. And/or rabbit hole investigation angles that were pursued but ultimately abandoned, deepening conspiracy theories about the assassination instead of revealing reality (which I assume the release of these files was meant to do). The US federal government and it&#39;s handlers do not want us to distrust them more, and certainly the Trump administration doesn&#39;t want this while they&#39;re in power. </p>

<p>A couple thoughts about what we&#39;ve seen so far:</p>

<p>The Soviet belief in a fascist CIA faction coup/LBJ stuff is interesting but not new in the slightest-- KGB and associated entities always promoted the inside job narrative, which has proven quite durable with the public (I still think there&#39;s something there re: the Bushes and the CIA in some capacity, but like the Soviets and the rest of us, there&#39;s no evidence of this ). More honest is their fear that they&#39;d ultimately be blamed for the assassination, and it&#39;s persistently surprising this endgame wasn&#39;t manufactured and pursued by JFK&#39;s US opponents and Hoover. </p>

<p>I found it fascinating that Hoover rightly viewed Oswald&#39;s killing by  Ruby as inside-job conspiracy fuel and a major security failure. But how much do we trust Hoover?  </p>

<p>This was a smart move, because if they did accuse the Soviets, then a whole lot more resources would have been invested by them attacking the official story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s because Bush is still alive. 
Long story short:
The Texas connected did it. His death benefited Johnson and Bush and Nixon. But Hoover wrote a letter that he was visited by Bush from the cia a day after the assassination. Bush claims he wasn’t in the cia at that time. Ford who pardoned Nixon and admitted that he lied on the warren report named Bush the head of the cia - basically to clean up hid own mess. Bush signed it into law that the full docs wouldn’t be released until later, and every president since has held back info that they could have released, because Bush is still alive. That’s the real hold up. 
The whole “bay of pigs” thing is always attributed to Kennedy, but it was really Nixon who started it when he was still VP and thought he would be a shoe in to win the election against Kennedy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if it was released while he was still alive then people like me would call for him to be prosecuted. After he dies they will have the excuse that he is dead already, move on. I&#39;m thinking that is the thought process as to why it is being held up until after his death. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that in the real world it is going to make a lot of difference either way. The truth that he was involved will be just as true after he is dead. Then how will his heirs justify covering up for him all these years? GW Bush started the war in Afghanistan in order to resupply his father&#39;s opium supply. The entire family is corrupt and actively committing treason by supporting their father&#39;s corruption and covering up for each other. </p>

<p>That mess is going to be exposed sooner or later, I don&#39;t think it is going to make a lot of difference if it happens before or after &#39;Poppy&#39; Bush dies. It is not really about him anymore, it is about his entire crime family. GW Bush did 9/11. That is actually an even bigger story than his father murdering JFK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just learned that trump plans to release everything. He says the only part that would be redacted is addresses and names of ppl who are still alive. Even if you average the age being 30 of the ppl involved, that would mean anyone alive would be at least over 80. Bush must be shaking in his seat now. </p>
