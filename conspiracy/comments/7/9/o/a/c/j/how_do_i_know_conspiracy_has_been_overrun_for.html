       So, if Trump leaves office, then the NWO globalist Pence takes over.   That is not good, right?

       I will assume you know about the NWO globalist agenda.   It is not good for any of us.   Whether you like it or not, we are all on the same side.  We all either defeat the NWO globalists, or we end up even more enslaved by them.

       All the charges are for things he did before Trump hired him.  Not saying that Trump is innocent, but it seems like this is more to do with the timeframe when he was helping Hill and the Podestas commit treason.

       Did I even mention the Trump Campaign in my response? I simply said that it is untrue that "all the charges" are for things before Trump hired him. One of his charges is up to and through 2017. Just pointing that out.

       The story broke a couple hours ago and the posts on the front page were upvoted yesterday and late last night. Check "rising" for a better indication of how much traction the story is getting.

       And, regardless, it's a conspiracy forum, not the "Manafort was arrested" forum. How many threads do you want about it? It's an important topic but not the

       You mean Trump, right? And his family? And his staff? All known liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most Trumpers don't know about a little legal term called "libel". It means that the press can't just report whatever lies they want, unless they want to get sued. Notice how CNN, WaPo, NYT, etc... haven't been sued?

       Hint: it's because they are not lying.

       Obama made it legal for the MSM to disseminate propaganda to the American people.   It is why people fled to the alternative media.  Once this happened, they started pushing the fake news narrative to discredit the alternative media.

       All propaganda is bad.  They should be required to present both sides of the story, and to allow public debate.  The problem with this is that the public would be informed and less susceptible to manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when CNN.com first went online and they allowed public comments.  It did not last too long because people would call them out on their bullshit.  They saw that they could not control the narrative if people can comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look what just happened with the JFK release.  They KNEW right after it happened that JFK was hit from the front, but they suppressed that information.  The Warren Report was bullshit and they knew it.  Yet, the CIA started to propagate a "conspiracy theory" meme to discredit people who refused to accept the conclusions of the Warren Report.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect they knew that the last election was going to be much closer then they reported.  They probably even knew that Trump was likely to win.  However, you never got that impression from the MSM, and people were genuinely confused and upset on election day when Hillary lost.  It is like people still have not accepted that the MSM lied to them.  Instead, it is Russia's fault that Trump is the President.

       I agree, if it was about Hillary there would be 100s of "obvious" connections, and how "liberals are too blind to see". One example how this could play out is that the indictment reveals only a part of what the investigation brought to light. There are connections between Manafort and Yanukovych, who in return has deep connections to Russia. With Hillary there are always "obvious connections" like this, here it's apparently not even worth mentioning. Then, Trump hires Manafort, is there a reason why some people absolve Trump of any knowledge of this? "He commited this crimes before the met with Trump", yeah and with Hillary it's suddenly relevant who she randomly met 1989, and that guy then met someone in 1978, it clearly means something! Not saying Trump is involved with all this, but it's clearly a double-standard.
