    <div class="md"><p>All propaganda is bad.  They should be required to present both sides of the story, and to allow public debate.  The problem with this is that the public would be informed and less susceptible to manipulation.  </p>

<p>I remember when CNN.com first went online and they allowed public comments.  It did not last too long because people would call them out on their bullshit.  They saw that they could not control the narrative if people can comment.  </p>

<p>Look what just happened with the JFK release.  They KNEW right after it happened that JFK was hit from the front, but they suppressed that information.  The Warren Report was bullshit and they knew it.  Yet, the CIA started to propagate a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; meme to discredit people who refused to accept the conclusions of the Warren Report.  </p>

<p>I suspect they knew that the last election was going to be much closer then they reported.  They probably even knew that Trump was likely to win.  However, you never got that impression from the MSM, and people were genuinely confused and upset on election day when Hillary lost.  It is like people still have not accepted that the MSM lied to them.  Instead, it is Russia&#39;s fault that Trump is the President.  </p>

<p>Why do the American people tolerate being abused by the government, corporations and banks?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, if it was about Hillary there would be 100s of &quot;obvious&quot; connections, and how &quot;liberals are too blind to see&quot;. One example how this could play out is that the indictment reveals only a part of what the investigation brought to light. There are connections between Manafort and Yanukovych, who in return has deep connections to Russia. With Hillary there are always &quot;obvious connections&quot; like this, here it&#39;s apparently not even worth mentioning. Then, Trump hires Manafort, is there a reason why some people absolve Trump of any knowledge of this? &quot;He commited this crimes before the met with Trump&quot;, yeah and with Hillary it&#39;s suddenly relevant who she randomly met 1989, and that guy then met someone in 1978, it clearly means something! Not saying Trump is involved with all this, but it&#39;s clearly a double-standard.</p>
