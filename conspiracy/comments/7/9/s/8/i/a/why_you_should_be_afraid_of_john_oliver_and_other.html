        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><blockquote>
<p>These &quot;clowns&quot;, Oliver, Stewart, Colbert and Maher shape and form public opinion and thought, particularly on the political left. These guys and their imitators are insidious because they use the ruse of being rebellious comedians who scrutinize authority to actually cover their vehement defense and cultural enforcement of all things establishment. It is all the more insipid because these men are held up, and hold themselves up, as a vital check and balance to establishment authority. These clowns only play the role of court jester, but never have the courage to actually speak the truth to the ruling powers or challenge their authority. They are less like the court jesters of old and more like the court eunuchs. They are more interested in staying relevant and in good graces with the establishment than in growing a pair of balls and telling the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: More:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oliver sells himself as the brave and noble truth teller, a much needed check to the power of the mainstream media. But Oliver only mimics speaking truth to power and standing up for the little guy. He appears to plant his flag on the high ground of rational thought, moral superiority and common sense, and waves it with a robust sense of self-satisfaction. This is all little more than theatrics though, because the reality is that John Oliver doesn&#39;t speak truth to power, he is merely a puppet of power, a useful idiot, a weapon they use to pacify and control those who believe themselves to be well informed and deeply critical thinkers. The stark truth is that John Oliver doesn&#39;t stand up for the little guy, he consistently kisses up and kicks down. And as for being a symbol of rational thinking, Oliver instead waves a red flag of emotion in front of liberals in order to get them on his side and then feeds them misinformation, disinformation and propaganda while they are in their highly emotional state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re missing is &quot;the establishment&quot; is more than just political advisers, think specialists from every field imagined. Statisticians, social psychologists, analysts, etc. pooling together resources in an attempt to predict what &quot;the masses&quot; crave and which way they are likely to lean.</p>

<p>Just as Obama&#39;s &quot;Hope and Change&quot; was the popular driving force behind his initial popularity, so too was Trumps &quot;Drain the Swamp&quot; pseudo-anti-establishment approach. It was not by happenstance that his rally cry was that of what the people wanted the most.</p>

<p>Just as his predecessor, he has no intention on delivering on those expectations. The backlash is a charade, meant to keep appearances and fan the flames of division.</p>

<p>&quot;The Establishment&quot; has not lost control, only some of its lackeys who believe they deserve to be in the spotlight more.</p>

<p>What exactly am I supposed to see that is damning except for the fact that i hadnt really gotten a lot of karma as I never post until i put my 50 cents forward on two days, being a month back and today. Almost a month ago the Catalonian referendum and all its consequenses took place, and as you might have noticed from my interest in words and legality I am a lawyer that deals with both political and international law, so I decided to stop lurking and give my 50 cents for what it&#39;s worth. Then i crawled back into my cave, also called real life, until today an incredibly interesting thing takes place: the mueller indictments, so there I go again: full force with my 50 cents. And yes I have been told that I tend to be a bit obsessive over certain subjects in the past. </p>
