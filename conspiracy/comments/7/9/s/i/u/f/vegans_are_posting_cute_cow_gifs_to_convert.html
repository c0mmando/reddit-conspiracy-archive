    <div class="md"><p>So this entire line of arguments is pointless then. I said eating meat was natural, he said only for predators, but humans are at the top of the food chain and are most definitely predators.</p>

<p>Humans are omnivores. Humans eat meat just like chimps and every other primate is capable of doing. Saying that we as humans are the only ones in our evolutionary class who are <em>not</em> meant to eat meat makes no sense.</p>

<p>The only logical arguments for vegetarianism and veganism are animal rights arguments. There is nothing detrimental to the human body by reasonably consuming meats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most herbivores can digest meat. It doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t harmful to their biology. There are people who eat metal. If they were able to sustain themselves on it that wouldn&#39;t be an argument that it is healthy. Human biology is much more characteristic of frugitarians and herbivores. Namely our teeth and intestines. Omnivores have short intestines meant to process things very quickly. So that meat doesn&#39;t sit and rot inside them. One of the key biological markers of a frugitarian, along with herbivores, are intestines many times longer than the body itself. Meat sits in our intestines too long and rots. Over the years the chemicals from this rot builds up slowly poisoning you creating cancer, usually bowl cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw your post on the top and agreed with a lot of what you said, but I just don&#39;t buy that sitting in the colon theory. Could you link me something on it with more information? It sounds like a neugenics commercial, &quot;pounds of rotting food and sludge in your intestines&quot; etc. Also, as far as I&#39;m aware, the people who eat metal don&#39;t actually digest said metal, which is a big difference IMHO.</p>

<p>I can be on board with <em>too much</em> meat being a bad thing, but then again, so is too much of anything. </p>

<p>Your arguments about hormones and chemicals in meat, I 100% agree with.</p>

<p>My only argument in this race is that humans can benefit from reasonable amounts of meat, preferably meat that isn&#39;t processed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may have been a bit over zealous with the metal analogy because I couldn&#39;t think of a better one at that moment. Here is a moderate article about the topic. As I was saying though most animals can process meat. But I don&#39;t think that it is meant to be a staple diet. More of a last ditch survival mechanism for non-carnivores. Meat nowadays is a totally different subject though. I&#39;m interested in things like Memphis meats but, but quite cautious given the sub we are in haha.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2015/10/red-meat-and-bowel-cancer-risk-how-strong-evidence">http://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2015/10/red-meat-and-bowel-cancer-risk-how-strong-evidence</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2011 a report from the Continuous Update Project was published. It found strong evidence that eating red meat or processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer. The analysis of eight cohort studies showed a 17 per cent increased risk per 100g red meat per day (RR: 1.17 (1.05-1.31)). The analysis of nine cohort studies found strong evidence that eating processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer by 18 per cent per 50g processed meat per day (RR 1.18 (1.10-1.28))</p>

<p>Maybe if the meat magically showed up in the supermarket, but a human somewhere killed an animal and put it through the process of being in the supermarket.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying when a cat brings another cat a mouse, that cat is no longer a predator since the other cat caught the mouse.</p>

<p>So dolphins aren&#39;t predators because they use bubbles to corrall fish, Archer fish aren&#39;t predators because they shoot water out of their mouth to knock insects into the water, Otters aren&#39;t predators because they use rocks to break open shellfish..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That changes the argument from a scientific one to a moral one.</p>

<p>You may think that it&#39;s morally wrong to eat meat if you don&#39;t absolutely need to. Some people think its morally wrong to eat food <em>period</em> unless you absolutely need to.</p>

<p>These are moral arguments and have no place in a conversation about logic. Humans and other primates are designed to be able to eat meat. The evolution of humans has enabled us to make food distribution extremely efficient, including with meats. The predatory aspect of humans is intelligence beyond that of any other animal on the planet, thats why humans are at the top of the food chain.</p>

<p>I could argue that huge farms are morally wrong because they wreck natural habitats.</p>

<p>naked? in winter? are you sure?</p>

<p>hunting to survive doesn&#39;t make you a predator, without cooking you can die after the hunt.. which is again, kinda unnatural</p>

<p>if you are using wikipedia definition for predator as someone who can hunt, then yea, human can hunt, if we use reality, human is a very shitty predator without tools, so he is either not a predator, or mother nature fucked up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a very interesting point, and one of the biggest flaws of christianity. Genesis inorrectly points that men is the top of the food chain and therefore can rule over land and animals as he pleases. </p>

<p>The idea that we are the top of the food chain makes no other sense than a conditioned one. I mean evolutionary it makes no sense, as a matter of fact the less meat you eat the stronger your genetic chances probably are as meat is pretty unhealthy and all and has therefore a rather negative correlation to your reproduction rates.  </p>

<p>You might say hey emaged, this sounds like a load of bull, but before christianity, which other society believed that mankind was on top of the food chain? I have tried to find one for a long time but have not been able to find one that was so destructive to other animals as Christian society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the conspiracy that meat is slowly killing you. 
1. Being that human anatomy is not meant to process meat at the volume that an average person consumes it. Omnivores biologically have short intestines meant to process things very quickly. Most apes are frugitarians, one of the key biological markers of a frugitarian, along with herbivores, are intestines many times longer than the body itself. 
2. The meat they sell you if chok full o&#39; hormones, antibiotics, pus and other lovely things that are 100% fucking with your body.</p>

<p>Im trying to cut out meat not just because I dont believe its something were built to survive properly on, but also the contamination of it as you mentioned plus I just dont want to support those mass market slaughter houses, the storys ive heard and videos ive seen are horrible so I cant sit there and moan about it and continue eating meat.</p>

<p>Im in a difficult position on this because of my work, its catering, I have to supply other people with meat, but at least I can do my bit personally. NGL I eat chicken more often than I would like which im trying to cut out but waaay less than I used to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys explain what the conspiracy is here like are corporations trying to get people to go vegan cuz they&#39;ll die? There&#39;s legit no evidence in this thread not even speculation of motive or anything it&#39;s fucking stupid do some research...veganism is taking off and this thread definitely isn&#39;t gonna stop it without any research</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly you&#39;re an idiot. Fact: eating meat is bad for your body, bad for your wellbeing, and horrible for the animal. There is no conspiracy other than vegans, of which I am one, genuinely like animals. The cure cow gifs are to highlight that animals are the same and worthy of the same treatment ie it is to counteract the attention dogs and cats get on this website simply because most people like them arbitrarily. You&#39;re so deep in the denial of your meat eating you think there is a conspiracy to post cow gifs by vegans, as if vegans don&#39;t like baby cows holy shit get a grip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if ppl had to raise &amp; kill their own animals to eat, they (we) probably <em>would</em> eat less meat. Most everything we consume has <em>something</em> that isn&#39;t considered healthy. More ppl to feed, corp. farms&#39; need to profit &amp; keep up to produce. </p>

<p>Have you seen the price of meat lately? It&#39;s increasing; for a reason, I think. We&#39;re slowly being weaned to <em>synthetic</em> meat, or something else.</p>
