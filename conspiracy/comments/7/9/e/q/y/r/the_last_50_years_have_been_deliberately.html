    <div class="md"><p>November 22, 1963 is <em>never</em> referred to as a Coup d&#39;Etat.</p>

<p>It is always &quot;the Kennedy assassination&quot;. Because &quot;Coup&quot; denotes a <em>change</em> in government. Which there was. Kennedy was going back to the Gold standard, and had become convinced of the fruitlessness of Vietnam.</p>

<p>So they killed him. You can&#39;t do that without willing co-conspirators. Like LBJ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the change in subject matter across all conspiracy across all conspiracy forums in the last 10 years. Then the change in the last 5 years. The emergence these grandiose, irrational topics that wouldn’t even be entertained on a conspiracy forum a decade ago. As we drew nearer to the possible release date of 2017 the more outrageous and non sensical topics have become. The surge of vitriolic comments that make rational discussion either impossible or drown it in a sea of irrelevance. I am being very careful as to not single out any specific topics as this is how legitimate discourse is infiltrated and thus obfuscated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. One of the disturbing conclusions I’ve drawn from within these documents is the sheer number of informants / agents the alphabets had in place as a fly on the wall before and after the assasination. It’s obvious this process only became easier with the internet. The most difficult pill to swallow is acceptance that there is no sense in trying. They won. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim that &quot;there would be too many people involved, it could never be kept secret&quot; has been disproved by this very incident.
The one thing that (other than the audacity of the daylight, public murder of a sitting POTUS who was <em>waaay</em> more popular at the time than, say, Donald the Dotard is right now) that bothers me perhaps the most naggingly since I first viewed it, it the SS stand down coming, I believe, out of the airport. One agent even give the &quot;raised shoulders arms extended at the elbow from the waist palms up with raised eyebrows and surprised expression&quot; to indicate &quot;WTF?!?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing the unedited Zapruder and reading about the process by which it was undertaken was, as is all new hard data associated with the Coup, bittersweet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this 100%. Why?</p>

<p>Because, unlike other nations, the US has a Constitution. Also, people are educated/conditioned to strongly uphold the Constitution. </p>

<p>In other countries, you can have a coup and people will accept the new government after a while. But the US Constitution requires a legitimate succession (ie. lawful transfer of power) A coup is not a legal transfer of power. Anyone looking to overthrow the government know they face resistance from the general population that believes in upholding the Constitution.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re going to have a coup, you have to conceal it and maintain the appearance of a lawful succession. If it was a coup, the people behind it needed to have LBJ on side.</p>

<p>Remember, the CIA is all about regime change whenever the leadership of a foreign country won&#39;t go along with the program. So when Kennedy didn&#39;t go along, when he threatened their very existence... is it so hard to think that the CIA pulled off their own little regime change inside the US itself?</p>

<p>They planned everything out. Get rid of the leader. Make it look like there&#39;s a Constitutional transfer of power. Set Oswald up as the lone gunman (the patsy). Kill off all the inconvenient witnesses in the following years and make sure the media goes along with the official narrative.</p>

<p>And discredit anyone who thinks otherwise &quot;as a kook&quot;.</p>
