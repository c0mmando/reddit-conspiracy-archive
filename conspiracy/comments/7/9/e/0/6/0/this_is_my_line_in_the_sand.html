        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We live in a constitutional republic, which requires two necessary things: the acceptance of the result of an election, and equal justice under the law. 
Currently, we have both under attack. The ridiculous &quot;resist&quot; movement from the Left and subsequent Russia collusion hysteria has put an administration headed by a man who never held a public office, has signed no legislation that has made anyone&#39;s life suffer. Yet, before even taking office, &quot;impeach Trump&quot; already was being chanted. The Swamp; D.C. and the Intelligence/Military Industrial complex communities, lobbyists, pundits, et al., have created so much chaos that the administration has 114 vacancies (last verified 7/20). 
A known fraud was committed by FBI and CIA/NSA etc, then by media, pop culture and Congressional Democrats-all knowing full well it was based on less than credible sources. Add to that, the Uranium One crimes, this has led us up to the event horizon: if NO ONE goes down for Uranium One, and/or if Trump goes down by Mueller without some SERIOUS evidence, it&#39;s time to do what is directed by the Constitution, and shake the etch n sketch. 
From JFK to Sandy Hook, 9/11 to Vegas, chemtrails to mass surveillance-What more abuse will we take? I SAY NO MORE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t even the first time I&#39;ve talked to you under the &quot;invictus_excelsis&quot; username, but whatever.</p>

<p>The US Code is the official codification of the statutes of the United States of America. The laws Congress passes are called &quot;statutes at large,&quot; and they&#39;re too disorganized to be useful--a single law might be amended over a dozen different sessions of Congress and statutes at large. The US Code collects and codifies those enactments so that they&#39;re legible.</p>

<p>In other words, when you read <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1">26 USC 1</a>, you&#39;re reading the law that imposes an income tax on individuals. Down at the bottom of the page are all the &quot;Pub. L.&quot; citations to the statutes at large.</p>

<p>The US Code is therefore the statutes of the United States of America. Statutory law is one sort of law; constitutional law, treaties, even regulations are other sorts of law.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re going to explain why we&#39;re actually under Roman law and you don&#39;t need to read no stinkin&#39; books, right?</p>

<p>These guys love to talk about how they have secret uber-cool law knowledge, or even (like the lady you linked to) pretend to be judges. But it&#39;s all fake, self-aggrandizing bullshit. It never works, and it&#39;s totally inconsistent with actual, written law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There not only is such a thing as &quot;Common Law&quot; as well as Common Law Courts, they take precedence over all subsequent and statute laws and the courts that exist to enforce those but you have to be very careful about how you establish your right to pursue justice under that Common Law&#39;s jurisdiction and protections without getting tangled up in how you tacitly &quot;contract&quot; with the Commercial legal system that you happen to think is only one in existence. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about a web of very convoluted &quot;contracts&quot; written,  spoken, and implied whether you are aware of them or not. </p>

<p>Mostly not because by not knowing there is an alternative or laying proper claim to your God-given right to settle any complaints or grievances against you under it&#39;s superior jurisdiction and protections you automatically give your consent to the Commercial courts to do whatever they will with or to you under their laws instead.</p>

<p>Think you have a deed that says you own your own house and the land that it sits on? Then why does it not clearly state that but instead list and describe you as being it&#39;s &quot;tenant&quot;? </p>

<p>Do tenants usually own the property they occupy or aren&#39;t they merely it&#39;s temporary custodians and caretakers who have accepted the responsibility to shoulder any liabilities and costs that are levelled against it while they inhabit it, or lose and have it taken away from them if they don&#39;t? </p>

<p>Who&#39;s the real owner, you or the state? What exactly did you buy? The house and property that you got a piece of paper that confirms you&#39;re not it&#39;s owner at all but actually it&#39;s tenant, instead so the state can come and reclaim it if you don&#39;t comply with any conditions they may subsequently impose on <strong>their property</strong> at any time they like and there&#39;s nothing you can actually do about it because of that? </p>

<p>That&#39;s just a small taste of countless things that infringe on very real rights you happen to have but have been stripped of by way of contracts you never adequately understood at all in the first place and they have you six ways from Sunday when it comes to what if anything you can do about it if you don&#39;t or can&#39;t comply no matter how unfair or disproportionate their judgements and penalties are compared to what you&#39;ve supposedly or actually done. </p>

<p>The primary tenet of Common Law is that no penalty can outweigh the harm that has to actually be done to someone else who must personally establish and prove it and the extent of it for the court to admit and adjudicate it. If they throw it out for failing that essential requirement that dismissal is valid and pre-empts any commercial courts from trying to pursue it any further.</p>

<p>In order to actually succeed you must refuse &quot;to consent&quot; to contract with that commercial law system and systematically withdraw and &quot;refuse the benefit&quot; that is considered to be a fair exchange for that consent whether you realized you have given it or the way in which that court interprets certain actions on your part that demonstrate that you have that gives it absolute authority over you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last comment said that the Magna Carta &quot;still holds force in the US.&quot; That&#39;s false. The &quot;fundamental principals enshrined in the Magna Carta&quot; are not the same thing as the law itself. We enshrined those principles in American laws, which hold force in the US instead of the Magna Carta.</p>

<p>The difference is that you can&#39;t go to court and complain that the US government violated your rights under the principles of the Magna Carta. You&#39;d lose with that argument, because the MC doesn&#39;t restrict the US government in any way. Instead, you&#39;d go to court and argue that the government violated your rights under the Constitution. The Constitution holds force in the US, not the MC.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything you wrote is wrong. You don&#39;t understand very much about American law. Common law doesn&#39;t trump statutory law--the other way around. You say &quot;commercial court&quot; like that&#39;s a term that means something. No one&#39;s parents contract them in any way with regards to jurisdiction. Etc. Etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This president is using Twitter as a weapon. He&#39;s using his powers to attack the very things that help us.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t get insurance until the ACA. I&#39;m a conservative, but I simply couldn&#39;t get insurance until there were protections against pre-existing conditions.</p>

<p>Is it all bad? No.. because I literally and quite simply couldn&#39;t get insurance, for reasons that didn&#39;t make sense to me.. I didn&#39;t have any pre-existing conditions that made sense to block me from getting health insurance.</p>

<p>Under the ACA, I was able to get insurance, good insurance, and I was able to get treatment that actually helped.</p>

<p>For me, the real conspiracy was how many years it took to get a doctor to finally realize what the issue was.. most wanted to treat the symptoms, give drugs for the pain.. when over the course of at least 5 years, it was finally figured out I had gull stones, and even later figured out I had stomach ulcers creating similar pain after my gull bladder was removed.</p>

<p>Simply put, before pre-existing conditions weren&#39;t a legal reason to deny me insurance all together.. I would have simply died, in immense pain from two different sources.</p>

<p>All Trump has done is make it so I can&#39;t afford insurance now. I&#39;m lucky that I know what over the counter medicine helps with the still occurring ulcer pain.. I just can&#39;t afford the insurance because he&#39;s attacked the entire industry.. what used to be around 100 a month, would now cost over 300 a month, which is just over half of my rental costs.</p>

<p>I do have new issues, but because I can&#39;t afford insurance now.. who knows. Either way, even if I could afford the insurance, it&#39;s taken years for doctors to find the original issues, and there&#39;s no incentive for them to work harder/faster to find the issues now.</p>

<p>Fuck the medical industry first, but fuck the guy who makes it impossible for me to even afford to go to the doctors. I&#39;ll just die in silence, just like you.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a partisan issue, people should have a right to medical help.. But the industry is corrupt regardless of you being able to afford it. Money above all things I guess?</p>

<p>Because of his meddling my insurance company has pulled out the market place and now I&#39;m stuck with a super plan. </p>

<p>Are you <em>sure</em> that was due to Trump&#39;s meddling? Because most insurers were pulling out of the market regardless of Trump (or Clinton if she had won) because of the economics of ACA were <strong>unsustainable.</strong></p>

<p>The bill was shit from the jump, but people fell for the promises of it hook line and sinker. Even now you are still under the delusion that HMOs and PPOs equal health care, where in reality they are are the middle men between you and your doctor. </p>

<p>I used to show graphs, charts and figures about why the ACA was unsustainable to begin with, but I just don&#39;t care anymore: the chickens have come home to roost. </p>

<p>I do feel sorry for you though so here are some things for you to do now that will help you with your tumor while you continue to see your doctor:</p>

<li><p>Rick Simpson Oil </p></li>
<li><p>Intravenous Vitamin C</p></li>

<p>The idiocy of this comment is telling.  You are wither 15 years old and are extremely ignorant, or you are trolling.  The only chaos has been caused by the guy you are drawing a line for. The reason people are hard on him is because he wrote a BIG ASS check with his mouth that so far he has been unable to cash. He talks a big game, he hasn&#39;t delivered.  We are always hard on our leaders, and they should expect it.  We&#39;re supposed to be the greatest country in the world and our pussy president has a melt down every time his feelings are hurt. Fuck that.  Grow a pair and do your fucking job. Uranium one is a joke, they had 7 years to impeach/investigate Obama, and Obama had the only say to approve the U1 deal, so if anyone would go down for it it would be him, but they didn&#39;t investigate, because there was nothing nefarious.  So you go ahead, draw your line.  You try to sound like a bad ass but cry victim at the same time.  Take control of your life and do something POSITIVE instead of being angry all the time. </p>

<p>A fraud was committed by pop culture?  Get the fuck out of here with your bullllll shieet. </p>

As far as him not delivering, just killing TPP is better than the previous 3 ever did. The list is too long, but if you think just cause the guy is trolling the media and left, while exposing the right for the fakes and liars and warmongers they are, is a problem-perhaps you need the safe space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There not only is such a thing as &quot;Common Law&quot; as well as Common Law Courts, they take precedence over all subsequent and statute laws and the courts that exist to enforce those but you have to be very careful about how you establish your right to pursue justice under that Common Law&#39;s jurisdiction and protections without getting tangled up in how you tacitly &quot;contract&quot; with the Commercial legal system that you happen to think is only one in existence. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about a web of very convoluted &quot;contracts&quot; written,  spoken, and implied whether you are aware of them or not. </p>

<p>Mostly not because by not knowing there is an alternative or laying proper claim to your God-given right to settle any complaints or grievances against you under it&#39;s superior jurisdiction and protections you automatically give your consent to the Commercial courts to do whatever they will with or to you under their laws instead.</p>

<p>Think you have a deed that says you own your own house and the land that it sits on? Then why does it not clearly state that but instead list and describe you as being it&#39;s &quot;tenant&quot;? </p>

<p>Do tenants usually own the property they occupy or aren&#39;t they merely it&#39;s temporary custodians and caretakers who have accepted the responsibility to shoulder any liabilities and costs that are levelled against it while they inhabit it, or lose and have it taken away from them if they don&#39;t? </p>

<p>Who&#39;s the real owner, you or the state? What exactly did you buy? The house and property that you got a piece of paper that confirms you&#39;re not it&#39;s owner at all but actually it&#39;s tenant, instead so the state can come and reclaim it if you don&#39;t comply with any conditions they may subsequently impose on <strong>their property</strong> at any time they like and there&#39;s nothing you can actually do about it because of that? </p>

<p>That&#39;s just a small taste of countless things that infringe on very real rights you happen to have but have been stripped of by way of contracts you never adequately understood at all in the first place and they have you six ways from Sunday when it comes to what if anything you can do about it if you don&#39;t or can&#39;t comply no matter how unfair or disproportionate their judgements and penalties are compared to what you&#39;ve supposedly or actually done. </p>

<p>The primary tenet of Common Law is that no penalty can outweigh the harm that has to actually be done to someone else who must personally establish and prove it and the extent of it for the court to admit and adjudicate it. If they throw it out for failing that essential requirement that dismissal is valid and pre-empts any commercial courts from trying to pursue it any further.</p>

<p>In order to actually succeed you must refuse &quot;to consent&quot; to contract with that commercial law system and systematically withdraw and &quot;refuse the benefit&quot; that is considered to be a fair exchange for that consent whether you realized you have given it or the way in which that court interprets certain actions on your part that demonstrate that you have that gives it absolute authority over you.</p>
