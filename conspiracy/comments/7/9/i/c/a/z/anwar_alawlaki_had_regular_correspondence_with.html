       Judicial Watch just published emails they obtained through FOIA request. They are a number of emails between the FBI and Anwar Aulaki (American-born supposed influential member of Al Qaeda). One email from Aulaki to the FBI:
      </p>
      <p>
       "On October 23, 2003, al-Aulaqi wrote (after first leaving a voice mail) to an unnamed official at the FBI Academy:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I was astonished by some of the talk circulating in the media about me. I was even more surprised to know that the congressional report on Sep 11 had alluded to me as being a “spiritual adviser” to the hijackers. The Guardian newspaper in the UK mentioned that the US authorities are looking for me in the UK while Time magazine mentions that they are looking for me in Yemen. Well in both countries I could be easily accessed. Even though I have nothing more to say than what I did at our previous meetings I just wanted to let you know that I am around and available. I am amazed at how absurd the media could be and I hope that the US authorities know better and realize that what was mentioned about me was nothing but lies."

       Anwar Aulaki was killed in a drone strike by the Obama Administration. Isn't this very strange for a "known terrorist on the run" to be having regular correspondence with the FBI? Here's the whole Judicial Watch article:

       There was a post/comment years ago with sources that showed the FBI tried to get him to be an FBI informant and he declined and left the US out of fear.  This was a year or so after he attended the Pentagon.  I'll see if I can find it.

       I don't think Anwar al-Awlaki = Anwar Aulaki.
