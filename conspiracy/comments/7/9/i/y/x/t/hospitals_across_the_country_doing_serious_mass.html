        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>An old friend of mine who now lives in the mid- west has written me 3 times over the last six months to tell me of strange things going on at the hospital he works at. I posted his first message to me back when he sent it in April.  I&#39;m posting it again and adding on his last two messages to me.
(some info is redacted to protect privacy of person). </p>

<p>April 21st, 2017</p>

<p>Friend: We have had some strange things we have been doing here the last week with Joint Commission. We are _____ hospital in ____ (somewhere in the Midwest). We have a lot of BLSII and BLSIII stuff here and have gone on lockdown 3 times in the last week...What&#39;s going on ? We are using alot of our emergency systems like Communication to communicate with other Hospitals and Police Depts and Fire Depts as well our emergency room has had to use their MCD Mass Cauality Disaster system which we have never done before.</p>

<p>Joint Commission is the controlling system that controls all Hospitals and Medical Colleges...In the lockdowns we are going to full code Yellow Which is Mass Casualty Disaster status.</p>

<p>Things have really been crazy with this stuff the last week..  Then I see about operation Gothic Shield is next week...Makes me go HMMMMMM</p>

<p>Something else that happened​ that&#39;s not normal...We only test our back up power once a month and only switch a unit or 2 over.... We have tested it 5 times over the last 2 weeks with last week going to Full code Orange where we move the entire Hospital over to back up power and go completely off the grid. And they are giving NO reasons for all of this.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he messaged me again last month</p>

<p>Sept 8th, 2017</p>

<p>Friend: Hey lady... Something strange is going on again here. We&#39;ve had two mass casualties exercises and an active shooter drill this week... We had a full switch over to generator power last night went completely off the grid included Communications using joint commission satcom. But probably one of the strangest things that I have seen in my 3 yrs as a supervisor here happened Wednesday of this week. We are part of the FOP Fraternal Order of Police and are under that contract. On Wednesday they added MC-33.3 in which in an mass casualty or natural disaster we can be sworn in as peace officers by the chief of ______ police at any given time for the needs of the safety of the ______ Medical College. That&#39;s unprecedented language and almost CRAZY</p>

<p>Me: What happens if you get sworn in as peace officers? What does that mean exactly?</p>

<p>Friend: Means we are now officers of the state of _____ and will also become armed...it would more than double the number of armed officers we currently have.&quot;</p>

<p>And then he messaged me again last Wed:</p>

<p>Oct 25th, 2017</p>

<p>Friend: Things are getting trippy at my work again</p>

<p>Me: What&#39;s going on? Sorry meant to share your last story but got really sidetracked</p>

<p>Friend: We are doing things we have never done before. Testing communications with short wave radios. Added 3 more vehicles and 4 more guards to our staff.</p>

<p>We have had several active shooter drill and lock down drills over the last 2 weeks.</p>

<p>They made one of our rooms in our dispatch and HQ a secure room with a double locking system that only the Director of Security and University Chief of Police can open. No one including mgrs or shift supervisors know what&#39;s in there. Not even the lieutenants on the University police know but the University Police just got all new radios, tasers and sidearms... Suspicious minds think it&#39;s all the old equipment but don&#39;t know for sure or why it would be on our campus.</p>

<p>All of our DLAR labs have gone on lockdown and are back under badge only access.</p>

<p>DLAR is where we hold all of our Radioactive stuff and all of our bacteria is like Eboli measles mumps Anthrax and so on... It&#39;s where we do all of our testing on lab animals.</p>

<p>All of our ER nursing staff just had to go thru skills training for Mass Cauality effectiveness. I also found out we have underground cold storage to hold up to 350 casualties in our health and science building... That building has limited access.</p>

<p>That building is very strange...the ground level is actually floor 6 and as you go down underground 6 floors down you get to the first floor.... The last four floors are key and badge access only. </p>

<p>Does it fit with anything you know of that might be coming?...because it&#39;s almost like we are preparing for something.</p>

<p>Me: Yeah...it sounds like there&#39;s some wicked stuff that goes on in your hospital. Many hospitals do mk ultra experiments, tune ups, if they&#39;re experimenting on &quot;animals&quot; it prob means they&#39;re creating hybrids and monstrosities.  Sounds like your hospital links into the underground tunnels which connect underground...theres a high speed rail that is like technology we have never seen which goes across the country through these underground bases. There are underground cities all over. Hospitals...esp in big cities are linked up to these.</p>

<p>Friend: This tunnel system you are talking about has me intrigued..all of our buildings connect via tunnels and Sometimes when your in them you feel this shaking like a bus is going over and making the tunnel shake but there are no buses on our campus. It&#39;s really strange.</p>

<p>Me: Yeah that&#39;s the underground rail system they have that you&#39;re probably feeling.  It&#39;s kind of like light rail but faster. They move all sorts of stuff that way beneath the country. All super Wal-Mart&#39;s and home depots have underground hubs. Connected to the tunnel system...and many hospitals..and colleges. </p>

<p>Friend: We are both a hospital and a college. We are a life sciences facility.</p>

<p>(I sent him this link</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arrl.org">http://www.arrl.org</a> /news/communications-interoperability-training-with-amateur-radio-community-set</p>

<p>which is about the nationwide test the DOD is doing which reads like this):</p>

<p>&quot;Communications Interoperability Training with Amateur Radio Community Set</p>

<p>10/24/2017</p>

<p>Elements of the US Department of Defense (DOD) will conduct a “communications interoperability” training exercise November 4-6, once again simulating a “very bad day” scenario. Amateur Radio and MARS organizations will take part.</p>

<p>“This exercise will begin with a national massive coronal mass ejection event which will impact the national power grid as well as all forms of traditional communication, including landline telephone, cellphone, satellite, and Internet connectivity,” Army MARS Program Manager Paul English, WD8DBY, explained in an announcement.</p>

<p>During the exercise, a designated DOD Headquarters entity will request county-by-county status reports for the 3,143 US counties and county equivalents, in order to gain situational awareness and to determine the extent of impact of the scenario. Army and Air Force MARS organizations will work in conjunction with the Amateur Radio community, primarily on the 60-meter interoperability channels as well as on HF NVIS frequencies and local VHF and UHF, non-Internet linked Amateur Radio repeaters.</p>

<p>“We want to continue building on the outstanding cooperative working relationship with the ARRL and the Amateur Radio community,” English said. “We want to expand the use of the 60-meter interop channels between the military and amateur community for emergency communications, and we hope the Amateur Radio community will give us some good feedback on the use of both the 5-MHz interop and the new 13-MHz broadcast channels as a means of information dissemination during a very bad day scenario.&quot;</p>

<p>After my friend read it he said &quot;Wow..that fits right in with what we have been preparing for.&quot;</p>

<p>Another friend on my fb page works at a hospital in Denver and said they&#39;re running almost the exact same drills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, from your &quot;friend&#39;s&quot; initial email: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friend: We have had some strange things we have been doing here the last week with Joint Commission. We are _____ hospital in ____ (somewhere in the Midwest). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Friends don&#39;t usually start out emails so formally, like “We are _____ hospital in ____ (somewhere in the Midwest).” If you&#39;re actually friends, and this friend is confiding in you, I&#39;d assume you already know where he works and he shouldn&#39;t have to tell you. Also, to say “We are _____ hospital” is strange because you think he&#39;d just be like “I&#39;m still at X hospital” and leave it at that.</p>

<p>Second, you and your “friend” also use similar formatting, cadence and phrasing in your writing style. </p>

<p>For example, you both use ellipses in place of proper periods and spaces (for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rf4g0/z/dm097x4">this comment</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rf4g0/z/dle2fv8">this comment</a>) and have the same cadence in how you randomly break up your text into short-sentence paragraphs (in “his” emails and on your blog, which you mention in your Reddit comment history). </p>

<p>You also use similar spelling, grammar and phrasing. </p>

<p>For example, you both say “alot” instead of the grammatically correct “a lot”: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his 4/21/17 email</em>: “We are using <strong>alot of our emergency systems</strong> like Communication to communicate with other Hospitals and Police Depts and Fire Depts as well our emergency room has had to use their MCD Mass Cauality Disaster system which we have never done before”</p></li>
<li><p><em>You in your 4/4/16 blog post</em>: “About a year ago one of my best friends from high school tried to have a “talk” with me saying “So what’s going on with you? <strong>Alot of people</strong> have been telling me they’re concerned.” (Because of my Facebook posts.) I couldn’t help but laugh at her genuine concern….just wow…every day is just so bizarre…knowing and seeing these things plain as day and watching those right next to you see absolutely nothing.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>You in your 9/17/16 blog post</em>: “And it kind of made me stop and think…because <strong>it would actually explain alot of things</strong> (disregard the “right wing extremist” part).” </p></li>
</ul>

<p>You both say “Make me go HMMMM”</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You in your 10/12/17 blog post</em>: “Also I would love people who have worked onstage professionally, worked as model, or worked on film, TV, or music video sets to share any observations they might have about weird “things that <strong>make you go ‘HMMMMM</strong>?”” </p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his 4/21/17 email</em>: “Things have really been crazy with this stuff the last week.. Then I see about operation Gothic Shield is next week...<strong>Makes me go HMMMMMM</strong>”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Similar phrasing, like: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You in your OP</em>: “written me 3 times over the last six months”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his email</em>: “have gone on lockdown 3 times in the last week”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his email</em>: “have tested it 5 times over the last 2 weeks”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And you both speak of a “fraternal order”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You in your 8/6/17 blog post</em>: “My grandfather was a Freemason. This means “Member <strong>of fraternal order</strong> that has Certain secret rituals.”” </p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his 9/8/17 email</em>: “We are part <strong>of the FOP Fraternal Order</strong> of Police and are under that contract.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I&#39;m feeling pretty confident that you made this friend up, and that you&#39;re the one writing these emails as alarmist propaganda, like everything else on your Reddit, blog and social media accounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all, from your &quot;friend&#39;s&quot; initial email: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friend: We have had some strange things we have been doing here the last week with Joint Commission. We are _____ hospital in ____ (somewhere in the Midwest). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Friends don&#39;t usually start out emails so formally, like “We are _____ hospital in ____ (city/state).” If you&#39;re actually friends, and this friend is confiding in you, I&#39;d assume you already know where he works and he shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that. </p>

<p>Also, to say “We are _____ hospital” is strange because you think he&#39;d just be like “I&#39;m still at X hospital” and leave it at that. There should be some air of familiarity in how he addresses you. </p>

<p>Second, you and your “friend” use very similar formatting, cadence and phrasing in your writing style. </p>

<p>For example, you both use ellipses in place of proper periods and spaces (for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rf4g0/z/dm097x4">this comment</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rf4g0/z/dle2fv8">this comment</a>) and have the same cadence in how you randomly break up your text into short-sentence paragraphs (in “his” emails and on your blog, which you mention in your Reddit comment history). </p>

<p>You also use similar spelling, grammar and phrasing. </p>

<p>For example, you both say “alot” instead of the grammatically correct “a lot”: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his 4/21/17 email</em>: “We are using <strong>alot of our emergency systems</strong> like Communication to communicate with other Hospitals and Police Depts and Fire Depts as well our emergency room has had to use their MCD Mass Cauality Disaster system which we have never done before”</p></li>
<li><p><em>You in your 4/4/16 blog post</em>: “About a year ago one of my best friends from high school tried to have a “talk” with me saying “So what’s going on with you? <strong>Alot of people</strong> have been telling me they’re concerned.” (Because of my Facebook posts.) I couldn’t help but laugh at her genuine concern….just wow…every day is just so bizarre…knowing and seeing these things plain as day and watching those right next to you see absolutely nothing.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>You in your 9/17/16 blog post</em>: “And it kind of made me stop and think…because <strong>it would actually explain alot of things</strong> (disregard the “right wing extremist” part).” </p></li>
</ul>

<p>You both say “Make me go HMMMM”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You in your 10/12/17 blog post</em>: “Also I would love people who have worked onstage professionally, worked as model, or worked on film, TV, or music video sets to share any observations they might have about weird “things that <strong>make you go ‘HMMMMM</strong>?”” </p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his 4/21/17 email</em>: “Things have really been crazy with this stuff the last week.. Then I see about operation Gothic Shield is next week...<strong>Makes me go HMMMMMM</strong>”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Similar phrasing, like: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You in your OP</em>: “written me 3 times over the last six months”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his email</em>: “have gone on lockdown 3 times in the last week”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his email</em>: “have tested it 5 times over the last 2 weeks”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And you both speak of a “fraternal order”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You in your 8/6/17 blog post</em>: “My grandfather was a Freemason. This means “Member <strong>of fraternal order</strong> that has Certain secret rituals.”” </p></li>
<li><p><em>Your &quot;friend&quot; in his 9/8/17 email</em>: “We are part <strong>of the FOP Fraternal Order</strong> of Police and are under that contract.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I&#39;m feeling pretty confident that you&#39;re a LARP who made this friend up, and that you&#39;re the one writing these emails as alarmist propaganda, like everything else on your Reddit, blog and social media accounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you really put alot of time into that. Think what you want. I&#39;m not here to convince you. He&#39;s a friend I used to work with and then he moved to the mid west maybe 6 years ago.  We rarely message each other but we&#39;ve stayed in contact via FB. I surely haven&#39;t kept up with the details in his life so yes of course he&#39;d tell me the hospital and state. The other things like we both misspelled alot....im sure many ppl do...its certainly too common to be an identifying marker of any kind. My 8/16 blog you mention about grandfather being a freemason and the &quot;fraternal order&quot; phrasing...i didn&#39;t even write that...that&#39;s a  reblog of someone else&#39;s story which is clearly sourced in the beginning. My 10/12/17 post about &quot;things that make you go Hmmmm&quot; again is not my writing.  It&#39;s a reblog of an even DIFFERENT writers work...again clearly noted and sourced in the beginning..easy to follow the source link back to the original post by the original author. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re REALLY reaching friend.  My intent is not to convince those who are committed to spending hours trying to debunk me...you have no life...get one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you follow this friends page but don&#39;t know where they work? Bullshit</p>

<p>You just happen to reblog things from two different other sources that speak exactly like your &quot;friend in the emails&quot;? More bullshit</p>

<p>Everyone misspells words...yep they sure do. Most people misuse the same words over and over again or as you would say ALOT. </p>

<p>You say your friend is head of security? Why is he sooooo freaked out over normal drills? Who do you think would act as officers in an event that would cause such a clause? </p>

<p>Either your friend new to his job, works in a shitty non compliant hospital or you are full of shit.</p>

<p>I say you are just full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing strange to me. I work in hospital administration on the regulatory and risk side. Starting in October or November (can&#39;t recall exactly when) of this year, new federal regs went into place for hospitals and more emergency management drills are required. Also with Joint Commission recently at that hospital, I&#39;m guessing the hospital was cited for emergency management standards being out of compliance so now playing catch up on drills. Hospitals are required to perform drills and have extensive emergency management plans. Any smart emergency management coordinator at a hospital should be doing frequent drills and are required to anyway. Active shooter is a huge risk as all hospitals are essentially public access and it&#39;s wise to prepare. Nothing strange here. </p>

It seems prudent to ensure folks know what to do when the stuff hits the fan.</p>

<p>The DoD connection...shouldn&#39;t that be thru the National Guard side of the house?  This helps the State as the State owns/shares the Guard with the DoD.  Since the Guard needs to know DoD systems and the hospitals need to talk to the State for emergencies, why pay for a standalone system that might not talk to the DoD also?  Two birds with one stone kind of thing...think the most elegant solution folks.  </p>
