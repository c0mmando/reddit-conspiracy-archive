        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">335</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-09-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/mindhawk.html">mindhawk</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After a long, too long, period of testing the waters here, I have decided that there is no way to further use this site to get information to people.  It has become infested with institutional propaganda accounts and is used by actual government agents to actually interrogate people without their knowing.  </p>

<p>If you do post about this aspect, or anything related to, for instance, The Global Intelligence Files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak</a>), your account and posts are siloed and put in a queue for response from an actual agent or two.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile FUD(Fear, Uncertainty, Distraction) posts dominate, and the most important issue, Israell&#39;s war for expansion and their dirty tricks to achieve their goals, including 9/11 is actively muted.  It is like the biggest gaslighting operation in history, that this sub and it&#39;s posters get so few upvotes despite it being the most interesting place on this site, and the obvious efforts of machine voting and shill factories which could be easily ended by actual moderation. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, mods like sarah_connor play games with the system and even though they have lost all credibility other mods do nothing, and don&#39;t respond about the issue, indicating to me that the entire mod team is comprimsed, at least enough.  </p>

<p>As such, be warned.  I have a huge amount of ideas and information posted on this account, which is now just gifted on the public, and the Law enforcement/privatesec trolls who now run and inhabit the place. </p>

<p>I started writing in the early 00&#39;s about how a site like this could either become the best, or worst thing in the world.  I gave it a try, and now it has demonstrated it is the worst.  </p>

<p>So keep your ads, and all the fake karma, and totally rigged views/votes system, and direct line to the police state, and zionist agenda based censorship and agitprop.  </p>

<p>I take some comfort in the fact that I have warned a lot of people, many more probably than my upvotes show, about many aspects of the police state.  I stand by my statement that I am being observed and followed by strange people who bait me into crimes.  And the rainbow gathering is now run by cops completely, and all protests are going to be full of undercovers as well.  Pizzagate is real, Epsteins island is close to mara logo, that is no coincidence. So beware out there.  It is a worst case scenario situation, and Trump has something really bad planned just around the corner.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol says everyone is fear mongering, leaves the post with a vague warning about how terrible things are coming from the president soon with no further details. If you were actually trying to warn anybody you would give information that may be vital to them preparing, but that&#39;s just the thing, you don&#39;t have any actual information of proof. The entire post is not even a notch above basic common sense. Of course reddit is controlled, the entirety of the internet which was created by the military is watched and controlled, along with all other communications. I would hope everyone here would live their lives accordingly. The thing is, you giving up on reddit even under these assumptions is exactly what the system wants, and to be honest if you really think intelligence officers are interrogating you here then you&#39;re going to have to show some proof or even reasonable suspicion that you would think so. I hate to sound like a dick even more, but you&#39;re just not that important, buddy. Nobody is forcing you into crimes either, that&#39;s way out of left field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. What we have seen on Reddit is really unprecedented in history. I&#39;ve been here for nearly 10 years, and its hard to believe just how it has changed.</p>

<p>If you had told me that there would be shills advertising and doing damage control for big corporations, I would have believed you. But shills for the corrupt Government Establishment and Deep State? And shills who try to shut down conversation of certain conspiracy theories? That would have been hard for me to fathom.</p>

<p>It may sound cliche, but this whole thing has become very Orwellian and dystopian. I honestly wonder how the shills live with themselves. I guess they are convinced that they are fighting against people who are mostly conservative, so they are doing a good thing? Regardless, they are pawns for TPTB so that they can retain and consolidate power and wealth at the common people&#39;s expense. Its really a disgusting job.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered leaving but that essentially means that the pro-censors and authoritarian types win. Eventually, no one will have access to what is really going on and what has actually happened in history. The government&#39;s official narrative will be the only narrative that anyone is aware of, whether its based in reality or not.</p>

<p>I believe that we truly are in an &quot;Information War.&quot; If they win, and the pessimist in me says that they will because they control the power and the infrastructure, there will be no hope of breaking out of this form of slavery that we are currently in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the proof is in the putting, buts obviously not very convincing. I know botnets are a reality, mostly for spamming content, rather than commenting or debating, but I do speculate that more advanced AI is being used too. It&#39;s merely based on what seems to be technologically possible, the exchanges I&#39;ve experienced personally and a clear motive to go ahead with AI rather than people who may eventually develop a conscience. </p>

<p>Often when a user latches onto a single buzzword in a good comment while ignoring the whole rest of the conversation, it strikes me as too formulaic to be a person&#39;s genuine reaction. But yes, all that is just speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can we tap that, or maximize the accuracy of handwriting recognition leveraging Google tools? Taking a selection of samples and passing it through google drive for recognition on their side results in fun assortments of wing-dings. </p>

<p>Exploring this space my methodology was essentially write out a few things, upload a scan, and turn it into text and see what was generated.</p>

<p>Tried a few different samples. Pure text printed then scanned back in was recognized accurately. Handwriting alone came out wing-dings, less than 5% successful translation. Testing mixed (both text and handwriting on the same page) was especially unusable output.</p>

<p>Playing with open source ML databases I&#39;ve seen out there can get some satisfactory translation on a well defined training set. But then turning it loose on a larger database with handwriting of a few hundred distinct people performance falls back off.</p>

<p>Would be cool to find some new direction to delve into. I haven&#39;t been able to break the puzzle to my satisfaction from home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those APIs are a mere sample of machine learnings capabilities. </p>

<p>You need a fairly large data set as well as some serious hardware to do anything useful. Not to mention Google actually has access to machine learning hardware including quantum computers that can create far more advanced algorithms. Plus development platforms and processes that are well beyond any open source code available.</p>

<p>Handwriting analysis and translation would get fairly accurate with enough data.</p>

<p>I suppose you could pay for a bunch of GPUs on Google Cloud, but it would literally set you back thousands of dollars per month to do anything meaningful. You’d also have to write your own custom software or use open source solutions and customize them.</p>

<p>With all that said, what’s publicly available are stepping stones to what these companies can accomplish merely because they have access to so much compute now. It would set you or I back about $16k to buy the hardware we’d need to even remotely fool around with the mach be learning functionality the tech giants have and even then we’d have only one machine matched against tens of thousands of theirs networked into a single cloud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quantum computing has been around a while, it’s likely what Google’s been using to build its algorithms since the early 2000’s even. More recently they’ve been using it for projects like Google Glass (the algorithm to determine a wink from a blink was calculated using a quantum computer). They’re heavily invested in quantum computers and the advancements that have been made hardware wise in the past 3 years are substantial. </p>

<p>The problem is quantum computing is incredibly limited right now due to a lack of software. They’re excellent at very specific tasks but useless for most other computing tasks. In the future we’ll likely see hybrid systems that use both quantum computing and silicon computing for more complete solutions and advanced capabilities. </p>

<p>These systems are very real, and have been used to create advanced algorithms that are then later applied in traditional computing environments. They have the potential to push AI forward significantly in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s quantum physics. </p>

<p>Quantum computing is totally different. Traditional computing is based on bits either a 1 or a 0. </p>

<p>Quantum computing is based on qubits which can be 1, 0, or both 1 and 0 at the same time using quantum entanglement. This extended variability allows quantum computing to consider a wider depth of possibility and probability beyond that of a traditional computer. How it works is still somewhat of a mystery as it does involve some innate quantum process that is still theoretical but does work in certain instances even if we don’t understand fully why. </p>

<p>Bringing up cars for no reason doesn&#39;t help you.  If I search that &quot;car&quot; it doesn&#39;t even bring up internet hits, so, yeah, &quot;30xL turbo&quot; isn&#39;t even a car.  More normal people don&#39;t give a shit about cars anyhow, but they care about people.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, majority and &quot;never&quot; are two entirely different concepts...maybe scale back the rhetoric a bit Trump.  :)</p>

<p>Hey, I&#39;m here all the time, and even I don&#39;t haven&#39;t looked into the hologram thing enough (not like I don&#39;t know about HAARP).  It&#39;s easy to tell and show people about the &quot;squibs&quot; because they are super obvious in slo-mo.  </p>

<p>Hey, a &quot;majority&quot; of people don&#39;t take 9/11 conspiracies seriously either...does that mean that I should help discount it like you are doing with Pizzagate?  The reason your hologram argument doesn&#39;t matter is because we know 9/11 did not go down like the official narrative.  Pizzagate is far more nebulous of a subject, and even murkier waters...and it&#39;s not the name that&#39;s bad, it&#39;s the stone-walling about the subject that is bad.  Can&#39;t you understand that it&#39;s not the name that is doing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people need to focus on is the numbers. It doesn&#39;t matter if a tiny percentage of people have the access and motivation to seek truth. If the majority of people get sidetracked too often and spend all of their free time thinking and debating about divisive issues (men vs. women, republican vs. democrat, etc), we won&#39;t be able to come together to solve real problems. That&#39;s why we need more people to go out of their way to spread the truth as best they can. These demotivating posts aren&#39;t going to help our situation, but I understand why it gets frustrating at times. </p>

<p>On certain political topics, I just assume the voting isn&#39;t real. If someone responds to your comment with a logical fallacy and gets double the upvotes as you, then it gives the impression that there are a lot of really dumb people who were convinced by some charlatan shill. That could really do some damage to your motivation and make you want to give up. However, if you realize the voting isn&#39;t real, then you may realize that there really weren&#39;t that many people who fell for the logical fallacy. For all you know, your comment that is stuck at -2 convinced nearly everyone who read it. </p>

<p>You could try using a different account, or try that with a different IP address. If you are a prolific poster who they consider to be a thorn in their side, disrupting their propaganda from time to time, then they very well might be monitoring your account or may have placed some kind of handicap on how many votes you accumulate. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/PoUMo">&quot;Once we isolate key people, we look for people we know are in their upstream -- people that they read posts from, but who themselves are less influential. We then either start flame wars with bots to derail the conversations that are influencing influential people, or else send off specific tasks for sockpuppets (changing this wording of an idea here; cause an ideological split there; etc).&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Just keep sharing information. If you source your posts/comments well, and if you get occasionally lucky, you can negate all of the propaganda that many thousands of people have consumed on a topic. It takes a lot of effort for propagandists to bring darkness to a topic, but all it takes is a single candle to light the room. </p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/65vk6j/what_are_people_slowly_starting_to_forget/dgdiwit/">https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/65vk6j/what_are_people_slowly_starting_to_forget/dgdiwit/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4psqmu/til_kim_kardashian_was_paid_to_post_a_selfie_on/d4nji6n/">https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4psqmu/til_kim_kardashian_was_paid_to_post_a_selfie_on/d4nji6n/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/65d2mu/fed_up_2014_revealing_a_30year_campaign_by_the/dga36qd/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/65d2mu/fed_up_2014_revealing_a_30year_campaign_by_the/dga36qd/</a></p>

<p>The manipulators can&#39;t control every single thread every hour of the day. Just because you were hammered with downvotes a few times doesn&#39;t mean you should give up. </p>

<p>I think the prolific posters and truth spreaders should consider which topics should be a priority and which ones are counter productive (like divisive issues). A few examples of topics that I personally believe are priority are information on internet shills and information about toxins, particularly those toxins that affect the brain. If you have a population that is exposed to lead and other contaminants, then it might be pretty difficult to get them motivated to seek and accept the truth. Similarly, if you have a population that is mostly unaware of how social media is manipulated, they might trust whatever the highly-upvoted and unsourced Reddit comments claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you could just covert to Islam and preach it on Reddit.</p>

<p>In Islam:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only Gold and Silver is allowed to be used as currency. No paper money.</p></li>
<li><p>Usury (interest) is not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>Spying is super forbidden and has such a broad definition that if you did not know someone was watching you then that evidence would be rejected. In certain cases the spy would be punished.</p></li>
<li><p>Food, Clothing, and Shelter is guaranteed for all its citizens. So there is no reason to commit crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Stealing carries the penalty of losing your limbs. No banker would steal if that was the case.</p></li>
<li><p>Islam has proportional penalties. If you are sued and you are wealthy your penalty is higher if you are poor the penalty is lower.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural resources are owned by the people. The government&#39;s job is to manage the resources and distribute it. You cannot profit directly from a natural resource (Cough Cough Nestle...).</p></li>
<li><p>The Sharia does not change. You won&#39;t gradually lose your rights. Whatever not illegal is allowed by default and the burden of proof is upon the one claiming the action to be illegal.</p></li>
<li><p>Items that are deemed a necessity cannot be priced higher if the demand suddenly rises.</p></li>
<li><p>It is legal to kill the leader if the leader does not rule and judge by the Sharia. No politician would screw up.</p></li>
<li><p>No preemptive strikes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are some of the major things that conspiracy theorists complain about in western society. Islam&#39;s Sharia is the only solution to the problem. I don&#39;t think you should leave reddit just change your message.</p>

You can take the term quite literally and the goal is to isolate a person to such an extent that he&#39;s either very vulnerable and easy to exploit or to do away with altogether, either directly or through psychological no-touch-torture. Infuse that inhumanely vile and cowardly act with the bureau-technocratic surveillance state and all of the deadly &quot;trinkets&quot; at their disposal and you have total control over any human being however you see fit. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll ruin a person&#39;s reputation. That&#39;s usually all it takes to commence a snowball effect of losing face, jobs, friends, family and induces a complete social death. Most people are acutely aware that their life is pretty much ruined from the very get-go when things just start to go awry. That&#39;s when you see a lot of suicides etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those APIs are a mere sample of machine learnings capabilities. </p>

<p>You need a fairly large data set as well as some serious hardware to do anything useful. Not to mention Google actually has access to machine learning hardware including quantum computers that can create far more advanced algorithms. Plus development platforms and processes that are well beyond any open source code available.</p>

<p>Handwriting analysis and translation would get fairly accurate with enough data.</p>

<p>I suppose you could pay for a bunch of GPUs on Google Cloud, but it would literally set you back thousands of dollars per month to do anything meaningful. You’d also have to write your own custom software or use open source solutions and customize them.</p>

<p>With all that said, what’s publicly available are stepping stones to what these companies can accomplish merely because they have access to so much compute now. It would set you or I back about $16k to buy the hardware we’d need to even remotely fool around with the mach be learning functionality the tech giants have and even then we’d have only one machine matched against tens of thousands of theirs networked into a single cloud.</p>

I know botnets are a reality, mostly for spamming content, rather than commenting or debating, but I do speculate that more advanced AI is being used too. It&#39;s merely based on what seems to be technologically possible, the exchanges I&#39;ve experienced personally and a clear motive to go ahead with AI rather than people who may eventually develop a conscience. </p>
