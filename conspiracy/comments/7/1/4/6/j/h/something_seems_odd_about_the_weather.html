       How does Maria go from a category 1 storm to a CAT 5 hurricane in a 24 hour period. Born and raised in the Caribbean and I've never heard such a thing.
These are the sort of things that make a person go mhmmm.

       I always wonder why they don't try to weaken the storms when they are just tropical depressions.  Especially after having two wreck the coast.  It's not like they don't see them forming out at sea.

       That's debatable, but we do know for sure they can weaken storms with cloud seeding.  I'm surprised more people aren't asking why they don't weaken / kill them early.

       The only problem I have with his argument is "right-wing" because of the obvious collusion on both sides in regards to this.  I don't think the "enrichment" angle is that convincing...TPTB are going to profit regardless.  Maybe you'll be able to trade carbon credits for food someday! /s

       I'm not gonna tell you not to believe in the equivalence of elected representatives regarding climate change and relationship to the fossil fuel industry -- but I do ask that you consider the possibility that there are measurable differences in behavior between elected members of the major parties, that there are likewise differences between the preferences and behavior of individual people operating within this system, and that it is reasonable for a person to believe that not all elected officials are completely interchangeable.

       If they are both being paid by the same person, then it doesn't really matter much what they say then.  The seesawing of control of the executive branch is a ruse.  And obviously, I believe that not all elected officials are interchangeable.  That's why Sanders couldn't have changed places with Clinton and won the election, right?

       I know weather manipulation exsists, cloud seeding has been a known thing for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm having a hard time believing is that the technology exsists to manipulate hurricanes. Just because a patent exsists does not mean the technology is available to use, you could go get a patent for a time machine...that doesn't mean you have a working time machine.

       To "manipulate" a hurricane, you just have to steer it in the direction you want it to go. HOW do you do that? Create areas of high and low pressure AROUND the hurricane and it will naturally head in the only direction that it can. For example, take a look at this weather chart during Hurricane Irma:
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iFwtzfP.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/iFwtzfP.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       IF there is a high pressure zone sitting above where the hurrican is located, it can't move. It just sits in one place and spins. As soon as you move that high pressure zone, it continues its natural course. Creating these high and low pressure zones is relatively easy with HAARP-like technology and cloud seeding with aluminum particles being sprayed into the atmosphere.

      <p>
       This is hurricane season in the Atlantic, so nothing seems odd about them. Their courses don't seem different than hurricanes of past. Nothing seems odd about Irma, Jose or Maria IMO.

       Creating strings of 'natural' disasters takes it's toll on the people and the economy. It also pushes globalist agendas like: funding for FEMA, UN involvement, dependence on central government, debt, depopulation, etc. It also serves to 'weaken' a base. Texas is usually thought of a self-governing, free wheeling, bastion of freedom and individual liberty. But, when people are busy rebuilding their lives, they don't have time for activism or national-level political involvements. It helps to destroy nationalism and steers us towards globalism.

       I'm just a dude bored at work stating my opinion online. I haven't gone through all that data and I don't have the time to. I'm pretty certain that the data would reveal past hurricanes that have followed a similar path.

       I'm on the fence as far as the HAARP conspiracy goes. I do believe governments have tried to manipulate the weather, but I'm not sold on it to this extent yet.

       It's actually pretty simple. Warmer than usual waters, good humidity, and low wind shear. That's pretty much all you need to make powerful hurricanes. Meanwhile the Atlantic subtropical high is the main guiding force, as you can see by Irma following its edge and turning North after reaching the southwestern point. A mid latitude trough pulled in right after Irma driving back the subtropical high. This is why Jose and subsequent hurricanes are turning North sooner.

       Not directly related to hurricanes. But I've been thinking about how the Earth is clearly changing and it is effecting the seasons and when they typically occur. I believe in a few years we will have to readjust when winter is or summer is, shifting away from the time periods we think of them in.

       I'm certain they have all kinds of weather tech available but lets also not forget that we as ignorant humans don't fully understand what nature is capable of here on earth, and it definitely seems like our overall climate is shifting somehow which could have unpredictable outcomes.

       If you think HAARP is responsible for these, do some quick math.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rough estimation for an average Category 3 Hurricane consists of 6.0 x 10
       <sup>
        14
       </sup>
       Watts of energy. That's 600,000 Gigawatts of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       HAARP operates with 5 2500 kilowatt generators. That's 0.0125 Gigawatts.
      </p>
      <p>
       0.0125 Gigawatts into 600,000 isn't going to change a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is little chance that HAARP has enough energy to do anything to a hurricane, let alone grow it to Category 5 from 1.

       HAARP, although I'm not sure where it's located now. They took the one in AK down. I think there's one in greenland? If it's not HAARP now, it's the lasting effect of HAARP's 1 BILLION watts of power being shot into the ionosphere to heat it up over the course of the last 10 years.

       Creating strings of 'natural' disasters takes it's toll on the people and the economy. It also pushes globalist agendas like: funding for FEMA, UN involvement, dependence on central government, debt, depopulation, etc. It also serves to 'weaken' a base. Texas is usually thought of a self-governing, free wheeling, bastion of freedom and individual liberty. But, when people are busy rebuilding their lives, they don't have time for activism or national-level political involvements. It helps to destroy nationalism and steers us towards globalism.
