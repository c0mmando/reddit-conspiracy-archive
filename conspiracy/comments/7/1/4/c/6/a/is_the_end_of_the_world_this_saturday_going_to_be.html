       I do not believe in any divine or paranormal based apocalyptic prophecies. I do believe in self-fulfilling prophecies though, or rather, humans making decisions to act in a certain way, or time their actions in a certain way to materialize a prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else have any thoughts on the idea that N. Korea is going to launch some nukes and cause the end of the world this Saturday (especially after Trump's speech at the UN yesterday) which may just end up being exactly what was predicted?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, before you go saying "ha! see! it was predicted by (so-and-so) and now its going to happen"...don't. North Korea could very easily want to launch on Friday, and one of Kim's minions might whisper in his ear "your divine holiness, if we launch tomorrow instead, we will be fulfilling the damned Yankees prophecy of their own destruction on September 23rd if we just delay one day, imagine the irony in that my lord!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously has me a little worried. Trump didn't pull any punches. This shit is gonna escalate, and quick.

       I hope you're right. I'm just afraid Kim is mentally unstable enough to do it. The guy literally throws threats every month. The US, Japan, Guam, South Korea... Can you really trust a guy that makes that many warmongering threats to act sanely? He is straight up nuts for causing so much chaos with his rhetoric.

       I think he's trying to use the nukes as political leverage. If the US invaded or tried to have him overthrown and he knew his end was coming, then he'd pull the trigger.

       A lot of people call him insane. People who are not qualified to draw those conclusions. I mean I guess he could be, but is he?

       I honestly don't know enough about the guy to draw conclusions on his sanity. But if those are the charateristics of an insane person, then the US has been run by insane people since at least WW1.

       Ok, let me clarify.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No one wants to use nukes.  But let me spell out dilemma that war-hawks find themselves in.  North Korea has survived up to this point because of deterrence that nuclear weapons have, meaning that if you pursue military action against them, you are providing them with the only justified course of use, which is defensively.   If the US attacks a nuclear power preemptively than the very concept of deterrence, which the US has used to justify having a nuclear arsenal is undermined.   North Korean leaders are not crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, we do have a country, which claims every opponent is a lunatic.  There is Saddam the monster, Assad, Qaddafi, etc.  The obvious implications here is that they were not the crazy one's, the lunatic is us.

       You down voted me when youre ignoring what it is I am saying. Lame. Even up to this reply, youre still saying Kim is rational. Just because one is using what you define as a "rational plan" to stay in power does not mean you aren't batshit crazy. The man makes people refer to him as a god my man, and feeds family members to dogs. Ignore everything else he has done or said and he is still a freaking lunatic. And I would attribute his stay of power as probably more the work of his underlings rather than his own divine intellect. But whatevs bro. Youre clearly very learned.

       Considering the first dinosaur certainly did not lay an egg containing a chicken; I think it's safe to say the egg came first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering dinosaurs came from aquatic creatures that also laid eggs; it pretty safe to say that the egg came before the chicken. My point is thank "which came first" is a useless euphanism at best.

       Trump sucks Jew cock. He strips down naked, and then tenderly places the circumcised Kosher log into his mouth and begins to suck with sincerity and unconditional love. Now, when you suck a cock, and your "daddy" is "ready", you turn around and he will stick his cock into your ass.. But, it isn't Trump who gets fucked in the ass. It's the American Gentiles who are probably the most helpless, stupidest, dumbfucks on the planet. Why are Gentiles fucking stupid?

       I have always supported gay rights. As a heterosexual, liberal Jew, I have actually marched in gay rights parades. But, when I see American Gentile politicians tenderly, and lovingly suck Jew cock for their own gain, I get a little bit frustrated. Jew cock is tasty, but not that tasty.

       The "end of the world" is more correctly understood as the end of an era.  The closing of the Age of Pisces will occur this Saturday, per the Biblical astrologers.  The Mayans said 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a big deal for the direction of society at large, but not terribly salient for any single individual. You, dear reader, will not have to dodge fire and brimstone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Age of Pisces was marked by Christianity.  As that age closes, so does, in theory, Christianity.  The next Age is the Age of Aquarius, with whatever that brings us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Age of Taurus (before Pisces) was marked by the worship of bulls.  The Golden Calf from the Bible showed people worshipping the old way.  All the Bull cults in Roman times reflects this.

       Any ideas on what Aquarius might be? I am liking the part abut the end of the age of Pisces. Any alien/ET references to Aquarius? Any significant star systems related to aliens or ETs that you're aware of.

       None that specifically relate to Aquarius.  The Pleidies (sp?) would be the star system to look check out.  Maybe that star system has transited into the Aquarius "house."
      </p>
      <p>
       This wouldn't be the first End of/Beginning of moments.  They occur about every 2000-2400 years, so aliens wouldn't necessarily be connected to these moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only guesses on the coming New Age of Aquarius (yes, this is where the New Age movement stems from) is depicted as a Man with a Pitcher of Water, and is called the Water Bearer (or Water Bringer, but Aquarius is an Air sign, not a Water sign).  Given the noise about climate change and all that, I'm wondering if Man will be the next Idol (after Bulls, then Fish) as the one powerful enough to make the heavens rain through the power of intellect.  This would be the Sons of Cain worshipping themselves.

       Great observations. THIS is the most important component of things, in my view. All of this stuff the world and the people in it are going through right now seems to be transitory events ending Pisces/entering Aquarius. Will we see an official end of Pisces/actual beginning of Aquarius in our lifetimes'? That is a question I've been asking myself. Who's to say the transition period between the two ages will be so quick? It could last for a hundred or two hundred years, in actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Age of Pisces, the opposite sign on the zodiacal wheel is Virgo. Looking at the religious aspect of things, Jesus the Fish was born via the Virgin Mary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, for the coming Age of Aquarius, the opposite sign on the zodiacal wheel is Leo. As to the belief system or new religion that may form in the coming years/decades, the real question we should be asking ourselves is what Aquarius, the water-bearer and Leo the lion will represent. Water and the sun? I have been asking myself this question for a couple of months. I just can't tell so far.

       I actually think the Book of Revelation will be an important guidebook for coded happenings in the years to come (trumpets / Trump-Pence and the alignment described in Revelations 12 happening this Saturday being but 2 of many indications).

       I do think we are in the middle of the transition between Ages.  I do not think it's an instant, like Happy New's Years clinkclink woot!  Maybe the astronomers do, but the energy is gonna be more over-lapping.  The Rev 12 writings show they thought around now would be the End of the Age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus being born of Virgo is likely the fact that sunrise comes through the Virgo house.  All peoples, all continents, have a virgin birth of a "son" (sun).  Mary, Isis, Ishtar being the more well-known "virgins," but they are personifications of the sunrise.  That aspect of the opposing signs prolly doesn't have legs, but there might be something there overall.  Like... life was savage and sexually wild, then Christianity came and tamped some of that down.  That might be the "virgin" energy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Leo is the Lion of Judah, which might be an interesting thought tree.  How would that sign oppose or balance Aquarius?   IIRC, the Lion of Judah is claimed by Sons of Abel, and is a Sun sign.  You connect Aquarius with Water, but it is an Air sign.  Aquarius brings the water, but is not the water.  Hair-split.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leo wants to lead.  Aquarius wants to be humane.  Maybe Aquarius quenches mankinds desire to be on top.  Or Leo is Christianity, Lion of Judah, and Aquarius will drown it out.

       The purpose of the Zodiac Wheel, with the sun being in the center, is that it serves as a display for which house the sun will rise in during both equinoxes during the entire age. So for the entire age of Pisces, the Sun rose at a different degree in constellation Pisces for the Vernal (Spring) Equinox and rose at a different degree in constellation Virgo for the Autumnal (Fall) Equinox. For the Age of Aquarius, it's expected that the sun rises in Aquarius for the Spring Equinox, and rises in Leo for the Fall Equinox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some good insight on the Equinoxes, and also possible characteristics of the coming Age of Aquarius/Leo:

       I just finished reading a book called Jesus Christ: Sun of God. I highly recommend it. It explains much of what you wrote about the Ages of Taurus, Aries, Pisces &amp; Aquarius, how each related to the Sun, and how religion and belief were formulated around most of these natural occurrences.

       Revelations 12 has the words.  Youtube has plenty of visuals showing what the book talks about.

       The books speak in metaphor and describe the celestial alignment that will occur on the 23rd.
      </p>
      <p>
       This marks the biblical astronomer's thoughts on when the Age of Pisces ends, and the next Age begins.  The Mayans thought 2012.  I think the difference shows a difference cuz it isn't an exact moment, a la New Years Eve.

       No. If it were to happen they would have canceled my deployment in November.

       Great observations. THIS is the most important component of things, in my view. All of this stuff the world and the people in it are going through right now seems to be transitory events ending Pisces/entering Aquarius. Will we see an official end of Pisces/actual beginning of Aquarius in our lifetimes'? That is a question I've been asking myself. Who's to say the transition period between the two ages will be so quick? It could last for a hundred or two hundred years, in actuality.

       In the Age of Pisces, the opposite sign on the zodiacal wheel is Virgo. Looking at the religious aspect of things, Jesus the Fish was born via the Virgin Mary.

       Now, for the coming Age of Aquarius, the opposite sign on the zodiacal wheel is Leo. As to the belief system or new religion that may form in the coming years/decades, the real question we should be asking ourselves is what Aquarius, the water-bearer and Leo the lion will represent. Water and the sun? I have been asking myself this question for a couple of months. I just can't tell so far.

       I actually think the Book of Revelation will be an important guidebook for coded happenings in the years to come (trumpets / Trump-Pence and the alignment described in Revelations 12 happening this Saturday being but 2 of many indications).
