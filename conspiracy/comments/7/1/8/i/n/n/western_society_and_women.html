       It's just a cultural thing "have very angular facial features, muscular (way more muscular) " 
Yeeeahhh let me help you there: western women also use a shit load f makeup and it's currently very trendy and considered beautiful to contour your features to appear sharper and more notciable. 
Same with the muscle mass. Gaining muscle and lifting weights is a western craze right now, its overwhelming how many people are into it but this very much explains the more muscular bodies in western culture.

       But do Caribbean girls have the new Naked pallet?!? lol joking.
I mean yes I'm not denying hormonal differences because it is known that the meat industry is flooded with extra hormones that are very much altering our bodies. I think it's a combination though because the beauty standards of this culture definitely play a huge role

       Ok let me try again. Perhaps it was your lack of positive examples when speaking of American women, you flattered the international women but not those of your own country, which is why at first it didn't seem like the USA was your home.

       oh sorry...american women are by far better than caribbean women (in almost every way after interacting with both)

       My point was basically that maybe there may have been messing with the hormones or chemicals (GMO foods etc) in Western culture that made them like that.

       I'm sure it has something to do with how much stress western women have put themselves under.  All that cortisol and testosterone probably affects our features and physical makeup.

       Western liberal women

       . Plain and simple. Lots of things going on. Brainwashing, propganda, retardation, chemicals, hormones, etc etc. This stems from western men becoming more feminine. Western women are like children lashing out.

       Men like pussy, so they succumb. This is the opposite of what the actual female mind wants. Western women are [meta] shit testing men, and they are failing. There is a broader conspiracy behind this (ie. the feminization of men), but.. yeah.

       It's true western culture is feminized. The meat we eat is all female animals with the exception of poultry and fish. This is because the males in western culture are not raised for meat. I wonder why, could it be natural testosterone in the diet? Russia for a fact I know does the opposite. Russian diets have most testosterone than western diets. Everyone knows how crazy things get in russia, just look up russia dash cam videos. I wonder why it's so crazy could it be because the men have actual balls unlike western cultures. I think so. A feminized population is also more easy to control. Just another fact. The western diet is also high in soy, which feminizes. Then there is the flouride, which is part of prozac, that also has a hormone disrupting effect.  So yea, wake up people stop eating garbage.

       Cattle and chicken are the females, bulls and roosters are the males. All milk and eggs come from females.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fish, however, are just caught in nets, chopped up, and delivered as such.

       I'm not taking sides in this debate, but what he said about most of our food supply being female is true.
