       Religions seem to fit the definition of being a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition (as noted  on the right side of this subreddit) is:  A belief that some covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event.

       Ehhh. At a certain point all religions are just a set of laws or norms to control people, but at the same time churches do a lot of good for a community. Even just getting older folks out of the house once a week and it's something. There are shitty churches and people who twist religions to be more controlling than others but IMO it existing is probably better than it not.

       At multiple levels. It's a conspiracy at face value and also things like the Vatican controlling society as well. Any cult is also a conspiracy.

       The Vatican in itself is a very popular conspiracy among baptist and non denominational churches. Due to the fact some believe the pope is the anti christ.

       Well you know one of the major reasons for the reformation was the fact that, due to the printing press, millions of people read revelation, and saw the reference to the "city on seven Hills" (rome) equated with anti christ. I forget the exact character, i think it's a woman riding a beast with ten horns

       The conspiracy of religion is the ongoing act of a priestly class indoctrinating people into superstitions and literal interpretations of misrepresented mythological literary systems.       In other words,  a conspiracy to delude followers into absurd beliefs.    And state protections and state benefits to those institutions.     And indoctrinating the youth against the wishes of the parents in some cases.

       Same thing can be said of the Atheism movement. To frame it in a larger context, what we are talking about are cults and cults of personality and the indoctrination into belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern day 'science' [as it's perceived and as it's framed to the majority of people] is no less a belief system than religion. If you happen to find some science books pre-1900 there is a frank distinction where the only way for the reader to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       something is to perform the experiment themselves - and the books themselves were mostly experimental designs/plans (intending for the reader to perform them). The writers assumed it would not be believed unless it was verified by the reader. With very limited or flexible hypothesis explaining the function (open to interpretation). That is science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today "science" [as it's digested and promoted by certain media personalities] is
       <em>
        "this stuff we are doing is way too complicated so believe us"
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        "this equipment is very expensive so let the 'experts' handle it."
       </em>
       It's all a projection of a logical fallacy that is Appeal to Authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even touching on peer review which was originally an internal review system for the Royal Society and does not adhere to any scientific principles once it ended up in mainstream use. It's the best/worst example of Appeal to Authority in constant use.

       There was a conspiracy to take philosophy out of the k-12 public school curriculum.    Most people are ill equipped to sort through information without getting snagged.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my favorite examples of the information wasteland is the debate on carbon while we keep shitting in our bed by poisoning the  environment,  but vaccine abuse,  retarded approaches to alternative energy,  allowing technology implementation to be dictated by scoundrels without exposing them,   the selective implementation of rule of law and thus the explosion in corruption,  even in science and medicine,   everything is affected.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many signs such as addictions,  obeisity,  suicide rates,  changes in employment (part time/no benefits) and the list goes on and on,   people often turn to religion when pressed to the limit.    Or I should say,  turn to ideologies that may or may not include god,  but do elevate authority of priests and their "scriptures" and idols.    Fun times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all of this is necessarily planned.   A lot of it happens as a result of a world reshaped very quickly by evolving technologies.    The time to adapt to civil aviation,   electron microscopes,  cars,  cell phones etc has been a lot shorter than the time we have had to adapt to settled agriculture,   but even that was a short time compared to the time humans had to adapt to  fire and clothing.

       Christianity may fit the text book definition of a conspiracy, although as a Christian I believe everything the Bible says. In no way was it a conspiracy, if we count the amount of prophecies the  bible discusses there's a 1x10
       <sup>
        40
       </sup>
       chance of the whole thing being a hoax. I recently heard this figure from a mathematician news source, that actually calculated everything.

       There are tons of Christians that are also big time conspiracy theorists. It's kind of hilarious.

       Yes that's definitely a major point in being a conspiracy theorists. Although, you can just pick up a bible and declare yourself Christian. I get where your going with this and it's a good argument. I will now just declare my self a Christian who believes in government led conspiracy theories.

       I believe that the people who actually penned the words were inspired by God, which could mean God spoke to people directly like he did with Moses, God changed their hearts and minds to believe like Saul/Paul, God influenced the people who assembled the texts to include in the Holy Bible etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I take it all on faith currently, after questioning its validity.  I don't have physical proof as required in the scientific-method to determine the authenticity of the Holy Bible.  However, I can't prove the year 1888 occurred either with the scientific-method (as that would require reproducing the year 1888 to prove it).  I've never denied I have faith in Jesus and God, and their Word (I did try to suspend my beliefs at one point in my life and view life from an atheistic view, but it led me back to Jesus and God).

       I don't, it's believed on faith.  Actually, I believe this very argument will be used by Satan and demons (calling God and Jesus evil and demons and 'satan' (adversary)) to get people to believe in themselves and worship them, rather than God-the-Father and God-the-Son.

       I've researched how the New Testament was put together, and who decided which texts to include, and which texts not to.  I've researched the book of Enoch and why that's not considered "cannon".  How the first five books of the Holy Bible, the Torah, were written in Hebrew (arguably Phonexcian first), then translated to Greek, then Latin, then English, etc.

       You need to look a bit further back for the true roots, google Utnapishtim for an interesting ride. It always amuses me that one of the bibles most famous stories comes from Babylon, though it was based on an even earlier Sumerian legend, of Ziusudra. The majority of the Hebrew roots of the bible is a bastardisation and deliberate mistelling of far older work.

       Well, here's the thing.  Even knowing the history and evidence doesn't mean someone is bound to accept the Babylonian interpretation of what "the gods" really are or to assume that the Bible is somehow wrong for telling the story as it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, there is by no means any proof that the text was merely copied.  What you're presuming to be correct is an academic hypothesis,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panbabylonism">
        Panbabylonism
       </a>
       , which claims that the entire Old Testament was written in Babylon.  That hypothesis might be feasible but it also has its detractors.  Certainly many academics with an ax to grind against Judaism and Christianity seem to prefer it, but it's not as damning as they think.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to detraction, it is entirely possible that the Enuma Elish and the stories of Genesis shared a common original source or a common oral tradition which avoids the entire "bastardization" claim you've made.  And there's countermanding evidence to the Panbabylon hypothesis that must be taken into consideration because of the archeological evidence we do have from the pre-Captivity Levant.  We know, for example, that the siege of Jerusalem is chronicled from the perspective of the king of Assyria in the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sennacherib%27s_Annals">
        Taylor Prism
       </a>
       .  We also have the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_letters">
        Amarna Letters
       </a>
       which confirm the existence of a YHWH-ist religion in the Levant at an early period.  There's also the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketef_Hinnom">
        Ketef Hinnom scrolls
       </a>
       [6-7th century BCE] which source at least part of the book of Numbers and directly cite YHWH in a religious manner well before the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity">
        Babylonian Captivity
       </a>
       [387 BCE].  And there's a myriad of other pieces of confirming evidence which show that there definitely was a YHWH-ist religion before Babylon that probably had a religious scripture and chronicles of its history.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is an assumption of your worldview.  Even if I took the most damning claims of the Panbabylon hypothesis and assumed they were correct, there's no justification for your pejorative claim that the Bible is a "bastardization" because this term implies the Bible's worldview is inherently an invalid one.  You've shown nothing to this effect.  The only basis for that claim is your own antipathy to the Biblical religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you would be correct in saying is that it would be a polemical writing if this hypothesis is correct.  Certainly, one technique of polemics is rewriting a story from another perspective.  In that way, a writer can highlight what they believe is incorrect in the original perspective and retell the parts they agree with from their own perspective.  It would seem reasonable that a Biblical writer who had been uprooted from the Levant and taken to Babylon would understand the Babylonian texts to be a chronicle of historical events in the ancient past.  However, they would still have a reasonable motive to adjust its theology to accord with their own beliefs without rejecting the story entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, we would see this Hebrew writer would simply remove the perspective of "multiple gods being buttmad about people being too noisy, so they just drown out the problem" and replace it with his or her own henotheistic-monolatrist conception that centers on his or her God which strongly emphasizes morality.  (Probably with strong backing, after Cyrus came in... since he worshipped Ahura Mazda and there was a similar monolatrist conception behind Zoroastrianism...)  His or her criticism, then, would be to oppose the more selfish convenience motives of the Babylonian gods while deriving a moral objection.  The writer's God was also, at some point (whether before or after) also understood to be the God of Reality itself which further shifted the perspective away from the tribal gods inherent in the original narrative.  But, consequently this became a more generalized universal morality context which was expanded on in the Christian New Testament which used this case as an example of cleansing judgment and redemption of the elect that is reflected in the Christian Sacrament of Baptism.  (cf. 1 Peter 3)
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, my point is that your conflation of the Enuma Elish and Genesis isn't really a valid method of discrediting the text from a religious standpoint.  From the perspective of someone who has come to believe in the monotheistic God of Reality which Christianity believes in, we already implicitly agree with those adjustments (if that was what really happened) because they are inherently reflecting the same worldview (albeit, possibly less developed) that we now have.

       Adding on to this, is the story of Lucifer's fall to Earth.  Which means God of Reality/God-the-Father didn't destroy Lucifer for his pride, but allowed him to live here on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Lucifer deceived Adam, Lucifer became the rightful manager of Earth/this-world.  Which is the one of the reasons Jesus Christ was manifested, as well as to reconcile humans to God-the-Father and be allowed in Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to Lucifer's fall, apparently God-the-Father showed Lucifer His plan for His creation/mankind/this-world.
      </p>
      <p>
       When God-the-Father didn't destroy Lucifer right then and there, and allowed Lucifer to live and work, God apparently gave Lucifer a set timeframe to live; Lucifer began revenge and working against Him, thus being the 'adversary'/'accuser', aka Satan.
      </p>

       If this is correct and true, this means that Lucifer, knowing God-the-Father's plans, and being a great creation of God-the-Father, worked in the hearts and minds of mankind to spread false religions, copied after God-the-Father's Hebrew people.  What better way to spread false ideas than to incorporate the true ideas of the way, then slightly alter those ideas to sow doubt and disbelief.  Which then explains the similarities of the other early religions, such as Sumerians, Babylonians, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whichever way it occurred in the past, and only God-the-Father, God-the-Son, and Satan know (or the Sumerian gods/Babylonian gods/Egyptian gods), it must be taken on faith, as none of us  discussing this who are not one of those listed, were there to confirm.

       The Holy Spirit (ruach ha'Qodesh) also knows by virtue of being God.  Without His work none could ever confess "Christ is Lord." (1 Corinthians 12:3)  That is why Christ promises that the Father would send the Paraclete (John 14:16) to the Apostles.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the work that Satan attacks when undermining a person's salvation.  Hence the warning of Jesus to the Pharisees in Mark 3:29.  They blaspheme His work by calling good evil and evil good.  If a sinner is capable of repenting, however, His work is restored and He had not yet abandoned them to their rebellion.  But whether or not someone is abandoned thusly is not a judgment we get to determine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan tricks people into thinking falsely about the Holy Spirit.  They attribute their desire to resist evil to their own powers which falls into the trap that Satan has constructed.  Our natures are fallen and our sin alienates our nature from the possibility of accepting God's grace without God's own Spirit raising a new nature that can trust Christ and follow His teaching.  Therefore, Paul wrote: "do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption." (Ephesians 4:30)
      </p>
      <p>
       Each willful dishonor we commit is a potential risk that one may blind oneself from hearing His Call.  But God is also patient and recognizes when it is our weakness succumbing to error versus our real intent acting on its own fallen desires.  (Thus, many people who despair of sinning in this way demonstrate themselves to have not committed such a sin because the Holy Spirit is the source of that repentance...)
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All Satan really does here is undermine the work of the Holy Spirit.  His prior work of corruption of human nature which has bound man to put his fallen desires on a pedestal is what alienates human nature from God's grace.  It would be much simpler if we realized the simple truth of Providence and grace that God sustains our being at every moment through His love.  Yet, we feel a foolish desire to justify ourselves by works or merits by which we imagine we earn that love.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what keeps people of different religions from realizing the salvation of Christ.  This creates an unhealthy spiritual atmosphere, which is what results in condemnation.  Christ's work restores a healthy communion with God as His Word lives within the believers' heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan obscures the key details which results in other religions missing the vital truths.  Even so, the same call of the Holy Spirit goes out to all people.

       Funny thing is if you even question evolution you get ridiculed hard. It's one of those conspiracies that really works people up. It seems the younger people are taught something, the harder they hang on to it as a belief.

       Oh yeah, believe me I've experienced it.  It's a bit ironic in this sub if you ask me.  Users vehemently defending a theory, with zero observed science, that is pushed with veracity by the public education system.  So yes, I believe you've hit up on the nail.  Users are taught not to question topics that dear big daddy govt instills unto them elementary thru high school.  u/i_am_unikitty statement is also relevant.  The theory of relativity is the same shtick and receives equal if not more backlash from indoctrinated society.  I swear, it's as if science is being pushed as a replacement religion for the normies.

       Then, my friend.  We see the same outcome.  I see it as the slow, gradual, moral devolution of society.  Aimed at the greater goal of, as you put it, the new majority religion in western society.

       <p>
        Religions seem to fit the definition of being a conspiracy theory.
       </p>
       <p>
        A belief that some covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By definition, I don't think the terms are commensurate if Christianity is considered as a gestalt.  Some elements of Christianity might be commensurate, but the entire system has a principle that prevents this.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I'll need to purge the ignorance for observers who are deceived by propaganda about what a conspiracy theory is.  (those who understand this disclaimer already can skip it...)  It goes without saying that conspiracy theories can be true.  There's a connotation that implies otherwise which is fostered by the agents of deception [i.e. alphabet agencies] that needs to be eschewed here.  Secondly, a conspiracy theory is not necessarily about a
       <em>
        malicious
       </em>
       conspiracy.  The intent of the conspiracy could be benevolent or neutral.  With those points clarified, we can continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, to illustrate the incommensurate nature of Christianity itself with the concept of a conspiracy, consider that a core tenet of Christianity is a belief that God is the Creator of reality.  This might have an "X is responsible," but it lacks the
       <em>
        organization
       </em>
       because in monotheistic religions like Christianity God is a
       <strong>
        single being
       </strong>
       .  Such a claim invalidates the absolute use of the term conspiracy which was implied.  Or, to put it more elegantly: "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? (Romans 11:34)"  With whom would God conspire?  Himself?  Were that the case, our every thought is a conspiracy for we consult with ourselves constantly in our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there's definitely some conspiracy theories that fit within the scope of the belief system of Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these are doctrinal elements:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Jesus claimed that the Jewish leadership wanted to kill him.  (cf. certainly malevolent intent; probably true)
       </li>
       <li>
        The concept of faith as a believer conspiring with God.  (cf. intent seen as benevolent by believers, seen as indeterminate by non-believers; assumed true by believers, rejected as false by non-believers)
       </li>
       <li>
        The idea some conspire against God. (cf. intent seen as benevolent by non-believers, seen as likely malevolent by believers; indisputably true [whether or not someone believes in a God, some people oppose the very idea])
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Others involve events and people that surround Christianity:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The gathering of believers for the faith.  (cf. intent seen as benevolent by believers, seen as indeterminate by non-believers; certainly true)
       </li>
       <li>
        The idea that the Vatican has evil secrets by which they conspire to deceive others.  (cf. certainly malevolent intent; truth value assumed true by many non-Catholics, rejected as false by Catholics and those that see Catholic leaders as benevolent)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gestalt of Christianity can't fit the definition, however.  I'd rather call it a worldview or, to be more pithy, a "conspiracy theory attractor" because it's evident that some conspiracy theories are
       <em>
        generated
       </em>
       merely by Christianity existing.

       First of all, thank you for providing more insight into this question.    Regarding the statement above, wouldn't the "conspiracy theory" of Christianity not only include the god, but also the actors that brought the conspiracy to life such as different authors of the bible?  Also, christianity has other players such as the devil, angels, demons, etc.  My apologies if this doesn't make sense, didn't get much sleep!

       Well, as I had originally presented it, I thought that I had included the writers and prophets in Doctrinal statement #2: "The concept of faith as a believer conspiring with God. (cf. intent seen as benevolent by believers, seen as indeterminate by non-believers; assumed true by believers, rejected as false by non-believers)"  My parenthetical addition is meant to be flexible enough to handle the possibility for alternative hypotheses like your implicit claim that the people initially promoting these teachings were doing so disingenuously.  (N.B. I'm going to take a presumption of the "false" fork for the purpose of the next paragraphs, even though I'm personally of the "true" fork here...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think that what you're digging at here is ultimately something that will give an odd answer.  Let's analyze the actors (writers and/or oral prophets) that, as you say, "brought the conspiracy to life."  What motives would they have had?  Deceit for power gain?  Honest mistake?  Metaphor for explaining things that were not understood?  (N.B. assuming "false")  Who can really guess?  It's rather hard to discern what that motive might have been without knowing the individuals involved.  And this is where a lot of people stop because the next argument gets into the worldview differences that arise from questions like these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not these motives are "true," however, it turns up another interesting set of questions: We can analyze why such a thing as this claim was even possible.  Why would any shyster think a "god" might be a good con game?  Why would anyone ever believe in such a thing?  Why could such a thing as a conscious entity be proposed to explain the mysterious?  And here is where we get into evolution and psychology.  Evolution has equipped humans with a mechanism to detect and observe agents.  That mechanism functions even if the entity in question isn't a biological entity.  Drawn eyes, for example, generate the illusion of being watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well aware of the possibility of deceit, many people are content to assume it's all just a mistake.  But what, specifically, is being described as an agent by people that believe in God?  We know, from the description, that God is called "the creator" which implies that "reality itself" is the consequence of this being's action.  It's worth noting that evolution and psychology are side-effects of reality.  So, the proposition is an "entity that causes reality being permitted to be observed as an agent by creatures in reality."  That's where it becomes an odd kind of "chicken and egg" situation.  If we suppose such a thing were merely a human invention, humans can only do what reality permits.  Some humans, somehow, have come to understand that God causes reality.  Eventually, humans recognized that the only reason that humans would even be able to arrive at such a concept was that reality caused them to do such a thing.  So, is it false to say that God inspired such a thing if reality is the effect of God?  If we assume false, how would such a thing arise.  If we assume true, it reveals an "infinite recursion" issue that resembles what happens when we ask what the "first cause" of the universe is.  And, if we take the position of people who understand the belief system, it will be that our understanding is an imperfect reflection of the actual reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, amongst other people there's an assumption that
       <em>
        non-biological entities
       </em>
       like that aren't actually valid agents to be described in such terms.  So, they berate the religious for believing in such things and claim they are fairy tales.  But, either way, human psychology and evolution have caused humanity to somehow introduce a
       <em>
        meme
       </em>
       that reflects the reality of the universe itself as a personification.  Some humans are evidently more comfortable interfacing with reality that way than others are, however...

       Well, I figure these can be categorized loosely under Doctrinal #2 and #3, but I can formally expand this if you'd prefer.  These certainly do generate their own sets of conspiracies.  Especially Satan which is a figurehead that is implicated in all kinds of things that are understood to alienate people from some aspect of God's benevolence: Whether charitable behavior, acting justly, or doubling down on serious errors rather than changing one's mind, or even a willingness to rely on God's compassion for oneself... all are intertwined in the same metaphysical construct of sin (aka "missing the mark") which implies alienation from God.

       Yea but you're taking that on faith based on what people / a book told you. Unless you're saying that God and or Jesus appeared to you and explained everything personally. But even in that case how would you know for sure that they aren't demons or something trying to trick you into worshiping them.

       Then, my friend.  We see the same outcome.  I see it as the slow, gradual, moral devolution of society.  Aimed at the greater goal of, as you put it, the new majority religion in western society.
