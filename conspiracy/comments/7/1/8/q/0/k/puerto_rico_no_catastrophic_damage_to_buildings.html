        Puerto Rico: there will be no catastrophic damage to buildings as footage of Dominica hit by Cat 5 proves.

        So why is the government implying the opposite?

       It's part of the "evacuations" psy-op, setting the stage for the BIG BANG (when the "relocations" under martial law will start).

       For the time being the hurricane evacuations are "just" used for this:

       Sep 19, 2017 - French police evacuate 557 migrants from makeshift camp
       <br/>
       Migrants have been staying in the Puythouck area since an official camp of wooden shelters housing some 1,500 migrants burned to the ground in April.
       <br/>
       Aid groups and journalists at the scene were not allowed to enter the clearing during the eight or so hours police were removing people.
       <br/>
       A huge makeshift camp in Calais, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Dunkirk, was emptied of at least 7,000 migrants in a mass operation in October.

       <strong>
        BASICS
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Genocide of homeless ongoing for years now:
       <br/>
       <a href="http://global-genocide.blogspot.com/2012/07/homeles-demonize-roundup-legalize-psy.html">
        http://global-genocide.blogspot.com/2012/07/homeles-demonize-roundup-legalize-psy.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Duterte's genocide in broad daylight: dissidents, Christians and poor (relabeled as "drug dealers") executed at gunpoint also at night in their homes.
       <br/>
       But genocide the Auschwitz way started earlier: refugees gassed in Europe since Oct 2015.
       <br/>
       Mamma Merkel under fire for welcoming refugees: what this THEATER mocks:
       <br/>
       Illuminati used termination of "food stamps" in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, to set multitudes unknowingly yet voluntarily marching from refugee to extermination camps.
       <br/>
       Sep 25, 2015 - Illuminati media, from BBC to German TV, reporting death trains to extermination camps as "very orderly and organized relocations", AGAIN, 80 years later.
       <br/>
       It didn't start with a TOTAL BANG, as it will be the case for blacks in the US after the "US shutdown".
       <br/>
       Reason: the process of feeding Europe's extermination camps with refugees and migrants is based on a steadily flow.

       Unlike the case of non-human cattle, you are part of the only group of human cattle that has ever existed, those which can be fattened as cattle.
       <br/>
       Those humans reduced to beasts (a subtype of animal) have almost no limits for what it will digest each time it's fed with illuminati garbage "science" (man comes from ape hoax, etc.) to scripted "news".

       You used the "argument" that I didn't link to a dictionary.
       <br/>
       Stop pretending you would even bother to click it.

       Google returns plenty of dictionary definitions for words, but you'd rather spam nonsense than search.

       "Spam" because you've yet to actually reply (refuting with facts) to what this thread exposes.

       No, that's impossible.

       Impossible because I was referring to the dictionary link you criticized me for excluding.

       I said "Stop pretending you would even bother to click it", meaning even if I did humor you with a dictionary link, that you would just ignore it.
       <br/>
       It's why I never did post a dictionary link for the "beast" word, which you claim to have been able to click anyway.

       Talk about "illiterate" ...  if you weren't then this entire reply would be unnecessary.
       <br/>
       It's obvious you're not referring to the same link as I am.
       <br/>
       So, why did you attempt to change topics to a separate previous "link" and explain how it "did not match the description"?

       It's been admitted not only long ago but also identified as one of the KEY features of the Web of TRUTH located in End Times: 
a scarce as TRUTH became, the supply has always been in excess of the demand.

       Sad really. You know nobody is reading your posts yet you refuse to try and change your writing style to make your content more accessible. It’s like you don’t WANT people to actually READ what you have to say.

       Except I have replied to every "issue" (read: criticizing writing style) you've attempted as an argument, which "coincidentally" doesn't include any real arguments about the OP's content since you'd prefer not to confront anything that matters.

       It's the correct term to classify irrelevant, disruptive, and unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, for the purpose of distracting, diverting, and discouraging online.

       That describes your posts, as not a single reply attempts to refute anything that I explained but rather you "argue", with no specific examples much less evidence, about what is supposedly "inarticulate".

       I've addressed your criticism, which amounts to nothing more than complaints about being "inarticulate".
       <br/>
       You make no effort to specify examples or explain what it is that you don't understand about those examples.
       <br/>
       You then offer the illogical "argument" that it's "everything" I posted that cannot be understood, supposedly because of the writing style, but that can't be true since other posters have vouched for the readability of Last Prophet's words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's your chance to make History, prove the Web of TRUTH is wrong:
       <br/>
       all you need to do is debunk anything I've exposed, which in your opinion are just my opinions, by refuting any of those "opinions" with facts.

       <br/>
       2.  Same as almost all the rest of the human cattle around the world, has either never seen or saw it for a second only to forget it the next minute, what rebel-held and "liberated by Assad forces" Syria now looks like.
