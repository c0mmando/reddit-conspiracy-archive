        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The earth being flat is a very controversial topic. It is often made fun of and called a government psyop by many.
According to this newspaper <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90060625/1900-04-21/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=04%2F21%2F1900&amp;amp;sort=date&amp;amp;date2=05%2F21%2F1900&amp;amp;searchType=advanced&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;sequence=0&amp;amp;lccn=&amp;amp;index=19&amp;amp;words=&amp;amp;proxdistance=5&amp;amp;state=Minnesota&amp;amp;rows=20&amp;amp;ortext=&amp;amp;proxtext=&amp;amp;phrasetext=&amp;amp;andtext=&amp;amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;amp;page=1">article</a> from 1900 the spherical earth was considered a heretical doctrine by some and teaching it could get you in serious trouble.
<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:15-16</a>  A vision showing sun worship in the inner courts of Gods temple and it was considered an abomination. There are still examples of sun worship today. Sunday worship was introduced by the sun worshipping emperor Constantine, who wanted Sunday to be the day of rest. Many believe that Christmas is a Christian holiday when it’s the celebration of the roman sun god Sol Invictus, which was held on the winter solstice December 25. Heliocentrism is the model where the earth and the planets revolve around the sun which is the center of our solar system.  All the planets are named after the gods of legend and myth, along with the months of the year and the days of the week. 
Nicolaus Copernicus, a Catholic cleric is the person that had the most influence in the heliocentric model. In 1533 when Giulio di Giuliano de&#39; Medici’s (Pope Clement VII) secretary Johan Widmanstetter explained Copernicus’s model to him, he received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#Work">valuable gift</a> because he was so pleased with the work. 
The Medici family, a rich and powerful banking family that has produced three popes was a patron and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici#Legacy">close friend</a> to Galileo Galilei. Medici family offered Galileo a safe haven for many years and he tutored multiple generations of Medici children. Galileo named four of Jupiter’s biggest moons are named after four of their children.
Isaac Newton was not only a mathematician, astronomer, and physicist, but an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies">alchemist</a> as well and placed high emphasis on rediscovering occult wisdom of the ancients. Isaac Newton has often been associated with various secret societies and fraternal orders throughout history.</p>

<p>Newton along with other influential people of the heliocentric model can be seen <a href="https://thenarrowgateweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/freemasons-1.jpg?w=564&amp;amp;h=548">here</a> posing for a painting while holding a set of compasses, which is on the freemasonic logo.
 Nasa the same people that name their rockets after ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_rockets">gods and creatures</a> are the same people that give us the information of earth and pictures from space. Numerology is very important to them, it’s basically part of their religion.  According to the Nasa <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/facts">website</a> earth is spinning at 66,622 mph ~ 66,6. The tilt of the earth is 23.4393 degrees ~ 23,4 and 90-23,4 = 66,6. The curvature of the earth is 8 inches per mile squared. 8 inches = 0,666 ft. Most of people that Nasa sent to space were <a href="http://freemasoninformation.com/masonic-education/famous/masonic-astronauts/">freemasons</a>
Space X, who is working to colonize Mars is said to be a private owned company, but they seem to be with in some <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yYgLg">secret society</a> as well.
The institution that brought sun worship into Christianity and was against translations of the bible from Latin, is the same that is pushing this heliocentric model.  The Roman Catholic church was also responsible for the big bang and the expanding universe theory which was created by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre">catholic priest</a>, Both of these makes the belief in a creator less plausible.</p>

<p>Is a flat motionless earth, something most of us would have believed if we weren’t taught different really that crazy and laughable, compared to a spherical earth orbiting around it’s own axel at over 1000 mph, while orbiting around the sun at 67,000 mph in concert with the solar system spiraling 500,000 mph Milky Way and shooting across the expanding universe away from the Big Bang at 670,000,000 mph? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post.  I believe the heliocentric model is a lie, and that in reality the other celestial bodies are rotating about the earth.  Of course, that is a separate issue from whether the earth is flat or not.  </p>

<p>Pseudo-scientific theories such as the theory of evolution, big bang, and the heliocentric model were not advanced by people genuinely interested in science and the advancement of knowledge.  They are part of a religious (Satanic) agenda, seeking primarily to put forward ideologies to cause people to reject the Bible and belief in the Creator.    </p>

<p>I have read that many of these ideas (evolution, heliocenrism, big bang) originated in the jewish system of Kaballah.  And, of course, the religion of Judaism is actually hardcore Satanism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve googled aparently in the King James Bible you can interprate a few passages of what Jesus said to say that the Jews worshiped the devil. My interpretation is that Jesus was sick of the people in the temples shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All three mainstream religions that came from the middle east worship the same Abrahamic god - exact same origin story. That story takes place when Jesus and his followers go to Jerusalem, which at the time was a major hub of the region with people coming from all over, bringing different currency. Money changers were that, traded currency and acted as bankers. Jesus took issue with them doing this outside the temple (and merchants from all over) as he called it his fathers house, a place of worship not commerce. He flipped tables because it was sacrilegious.</p>

<p>Jesus&#39; mother and father were jewish, they weren&#39;t worshiping the devil. The angle that went to Mary was from her God, so unless Jesus is the son of the devil, this interpretation doesn&#39;t really make sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many sources of evidence.  The Messiah said that the jews are a &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; (Rev 2:9), &quot;children of hell&quot; (Matthew 23:15), and &quot;of their father the devil&quot; (John 8:44).  If one investigates the religion called &quot;Judaism&quot;, they will discover that it is <em>not</em> the Old Testament, but is actually based in the Babylonian Talmud (occult) and Kaballah (a system of witchcraft and Satanism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But do you understand why I or others would come to this conclusion? It is not like we woke up one day, and started blaming Jews for everything.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an ex-muslim and even in my family, I know what motivates the antisemitic conspiracies some of them hold. On one hand, they cannot admit or choose not to admit that groups like Al-Qaeda or ISIS are actually committing atrocities. To them, the entire muslim population itself must for some reason be innocent. </p>

<p>This first belief leads into the second where there is much scapegoating to Jews. Granted I understand that what is happening in Palestine is another apartheid and is absolutely disgusting. It makes me sick to think that the entire global community stands by doing nothing as Palestinians are more and more made prisoners in their own country.</p>

<p>This naturally leads to blaming the West and Jews for all of the problems the Muslim community is facing right now. The reality is much more complex with bad actors on both sides. Obviously, Western imperialist foreign policy is the root cause of all of the instability in the Middle East. The U.S. and Britain, among others, have worked to overthrow governments as they see fit and propped up the corrupt Saudis. That said, they ignore the fact that groups like ISIS exist and are doing real genocide - this is not some Mossad false flag group, it&#39;s a cult that is killing primarily Muslims. </p>

<p>The Muslim community <em>does</em> have a problem with far right views. You will probably disagree with me, but these views have to change. There is natural antagonism to it, especially among liberal Europe. It&#39;s a culture clash that is in no way instigated or perpetuated by Jews.</p>

<p>Finally, scapegoating the Jews has led many muslims to believe racist and idiotic right wing conspiracies involving the Holocaust. Just because the occupation of Palestine is vile, does not mean you have to start believing that this group was victim to targeted genocide.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy that. I believe we are designed with a purpose, we are special. We are not the only beings in the universe, in fact most of the others out there despise us. We&#39;re special, man, I promise you. The earth is the center of Out universe and we are the focus. We are celestial beings but because of beliefs like yours we have forgotten what we are capable of. </p>
