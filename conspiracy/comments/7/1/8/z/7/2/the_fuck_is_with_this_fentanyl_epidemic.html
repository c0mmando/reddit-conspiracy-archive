        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw a post on the FP about NYC seizing 190 lbs of fentanyl in a single bust. Enough to overdose like 32 million people or some shit. And it&#39;s not just in dope now. Coke is being cut with it too. I&#39;d imagine other things as well considering the dose is so small it wouldn&#39;t be hard to conceal. From here I just wanna spitball with you guys and get your take.</p>

<p>Now. I&#39;ve heard China is pumping this shit out on the cheap. Which is something that could happen. But seriously. It seems like large dealers would need a plug for their dope <em>and</em> their fent now which sounds counterproductive.</p>

<p>Could it be the CIA as usual? They already got the heroin in Afghanistan. Why not just make the product last longer? They don&#39;t care if some Americans die. And as per tradition the DEA plays gatekeeper and runs interference for them. Makes sense.</p>

<p>The only other thing I can think of (which, ironically, sounds too optimistic) is that the DEA and such have realized that the War in Drugs has been lost and have decided in a last ditch effort to try to scare the absolute shit out of the public by making sure as much of the drugs as possible are pumped with a very dangerous drug with a very low dosage. </p>

<p>What do you guys think? Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Also. PS: if you do drugs then PLEASE, buy test kits and get Narcan trained. Be safe everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s honestly a beautifully efficient design in its macabre and warped little way. Go to a doctor or just be an impressionable dipshit who likes to socialize and go to parties. Get addicted to painkillers and advance to heroine. Or try a line of coke because you&#39;re a weak-willed person who needs friends and to be liked.</p>

<p>Before you know it you&#39;re off the wagon, liquidating your assets until you&#39;re broke, then you die.</p>

<p>Population control, wealth collection, and no need to waste money from social programs to keep you in your older years. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite a mechanism. I&#39;ve witnessed it in play often.</p>

<p>I knew directly two brothers who just a few months apart from binging on a cocktail of drugs, after numerous incidences with law enforcement. One of them literally passed out at the wheel and ran into someone over yellow, drove into a ditch and had bags of pills laying everywhere when the Sheriffs arrived. They didn&#39;t see a day of jail time.</p>

<p>When he, like his brother died, there was a rapid and half-hearted investigation. Drugs weren&#39;t even mentioned on the coroner report. &quot;heart failure&quot; was the cause of death on both brothers.</p>

<p>Now, I already knew this, due to the sudden and &quot;mysterious&quot; heroin epidemic going on around me, and a little logical leap to military occupation of Afghanistan that it was happening by design. I just didn&#39;t realize it was so brazenly open.</p>

<p>At times I feel like everyone is in on the plan but me. The one brother who wrecked and didn&#39;t see an minute of jail time had a record, but the incident and all the evidence didn&#39;t mean shit. It was supposed to happen. All this is meant to happen. The police don&#39;t give one shit about it. It&#39;s like they know something. They&#39;re being told something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just don&#39;t know what they are getting, can&#39;t even get coke anymore. In my part of the country people die everyday that are my age, and the news just says &quot;heroine over doses on the rise&quot; now I get that you can OD on heroine. Yet, it&#39;s so obvious these people are getting dirty product cut with fent. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your neighborhood dealers are cutting stuff either with fent. I think we&#39;re talking about the plug of the plug of the plug of the plug aka drug lords/cartel cutting shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little ridiculous to morally crusade against the &quot;financing&quot; of one thing and at the same time be ok with it towards a much larger scale form of a similar situation. Are you responsible for what your government does when you pay your taxes or buy something locally that includes sales tax? Or you responsible for bank fraud when your banking institution is caught up in a scandal? I&#39;m just trying to follow the line of thinking here. If someone wants to use blow, or smoke pot, or even shoot heroin into their feet in a Walmart parking lot...they&#39;re directly financing drug cartels?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opiates.  I have ADHD and for a while it was fucking nice to be able to settle down and not worry about everything.  Or anything for that matter.  An addict really just wants to escape from reality so I&#39;ve done about everything you can imagine, but my go to was opiates.  </p>

<p>I only smoke once in a great while.  The only thing I&#39;ve noticed while smoking that I like is the reality reset.  Other than that, I feel like I&#39;m back in gradeschool: &quot;Does this person really know who I am?  Do they like me?  Am I convenient?  Why am I thinking this?  Is my heart beating really fast?  What&#39;s the matter with me?&quot; And on and on and on until I realize that I was part of a conversation and people are now staring at me waiting for an answer that I don&#39;t even remember the question to.  I fucking hate constantly analyzing everything.  Breeds paranoia for me.  </p>

<p>I know that others like smoking bowls and it&#39;s enjoyable to them.  Honestly, when I was in full-on addiction, that made me really jealous.  It still kind of does.  The only way I&#39;ve been able to enjoy weed is to take a xanax/valium/drink along with it... and that can get hairy.  Cause then I&#39;d have to take an upper to not fall asleep, but that would make me jittery so I would have to take something to stop the jitters, etc.  Addict behavior.</p>

I enjoy it very much but I go back and forth from quitting cigarettes... thats why i like to have a bowl ready to go sometimes even though i don&#39;t really wanna get high. anyway when I get to the point of the high not doing it for me or whatever, its time for a break, go hike and stop for whatever is an extended period of time for you. Or switch to a dif connect/strain because our bodies can get used to the same one pretty easily. also if you know you love indicas and thats all you smoke, switch to a sativa for fun to trick yourself it works like that for a few people i&#39;ve talked to... it&#39;s like the same for allergy meds when claritin stops working for someone they tell em to switch to zyrtec for a week and go back to claritin... something about switching makes it work better or something. </p>

<p>I wish for our kids to learn about the positive effects from marijuana just as much as they hear the negative effects of alcohol and tobacco. Instead of teaching our kids what &quot;not&quot; to do, we should be teaching them what they supposed to be doing. its hard for me to explain in words i guess... marijuana education as in we just need to ask each other and be honest with each other about our own experiences with marijuana so we can all better understand it, its all we can do until the gov lets us study it openly and the medical journals start scientifically mapping each strain (i believe each strain does certain things like combat pain or create hunger in a cancer patient or make an insomniac rest... etc) and literally making wonder pills.... this is the next best thing we can do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but its a two way road, another thing you can mention to anyone wanting to try cannabis, is that some strains add to axiety, some take it away... its like alcohol, you can&#39;t just go out and pound beer, you gotta learn how to enjoy whiskey, cigars, etc... marijuana is the same way. Like some people don&#39;t want to enjoy any drugs except caffeine, the most abused drug in the world... to each their own. </p>

<p>Aside from being a endocrine disruptor, it is a wonder drug for millions of people, and it has been for thousands of years... </p>

<p>where&#39;s your research that people with chronic liver disease should be more responsible, or why are bringing liver disease up? lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people talk about cults or religious fervor, and by far, weed is the most beloved topic of this sub. I&#39;m convinced some strains have been intentionally bio-engineered and the elite are definitely pushing a pro-weed agenda. Just think... how many here regularly purchase weed, but don&#39;t own thier own home? Don&#39;t work in an industry that drug tests? Ever question your spending or free time, based on your weed habit?</p>

<p>THC is fat soluble, so that means brain and liver tissue. I&#39;m simply pointing out that while organic, heirloom varieties might be of great medicinal value, it&#39;s not ideal for everyone, nor does it stand up to the claims made here almost daily. Large amounts may shrink a tumor, but it will not cure cancer. That idea is scientifically ridiculous. </p>

<p>Fuck. All. That.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve dealt with my share of heroine addicts directly and indirectly. I used to live in a fairly safe, small town. Then I had recurring incidences of stumbling druggies trying to pry my car doors open when I go out at night.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care one bit if these scumbags are dropping dead from laced junk. Therefore, their well-being is not my concern and I&#39;m not interested in paying so they can marginally improve the safety of doing drugs. That&#39;s absurd.</p>

<p>I&#39;d sincerely rather they drop dead than have to deal about the safety of my lucid existence. </p>

<p>Especially the crack heads and heroine addicts. They destroy families, they steal from anyone, exploit everyone who shows them a bit of sympathy or interest in help. They damage property and vehicles. They steal your bikes. They pass out on sidewalks. They run around spreading diseases, hepatitis, aids, and STDs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s better that they die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can&#39;t be fixed no matter how much money you throw at them.</p>

<p>There are two scenarios only in which it is even a remote possibility:
1. They actually want to quit (rarely the case)
2. Or they go to prison and are forced to dry (usually results in relapse because condition 1 isn&#39;t met)</p>

<p>Maybe electroshock therapy. But you can&#39;t help addicts. I&#39;ve been down that road. It just leads to destruction. They thieve, carry their baggage with them, force you into situations and dealings with people you neither want or need around. People come looking for them, you assume their liabilities. Then they get worse and they threaten and they try all kinds of tactics to screw you over for their temporary and useless benefit.</p>

<p>They cannot be salvaged unless they want to be in their own way. And even then it&#39;s usually a crap shoot.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve experienced enough of it to know that &quot;fix this person&quot; is idealistic bullshit. They&#39;re not people anymore. They&#39;re junkies, robots willing to do anything to get a fix. A constant state of desperation that will pillage anything around it. They&#39;ll even go through trash cans and string your shit all over the yard for a fleck of copper to pawn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I think prison always results in a relapse 
2) I AGREE, people have to want the change. You can only help yourself. I just wish there was some way the government could step in a little bit more. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s really plausible. Rehab is expensive, and some insurance doesn&#39;t cover it. I&#39;m not really knowledgeable on the government funded rehab programs in my area, other than they just give you pretty much legal heroine. It&#39;s stupid BS</p>

<p>Yeah man, the world is just a rough place. I do know two addicts who have recovered from H, but now they just smoke week, drink, and occasionally do xanax. I guess it&#39;s better than H, but you make some pretty valid points about the junky type. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah but I doubt anyone in Canada is getting enough to kill 32 million. The person in NY who got caught with possession had to have ordered it from a lab directly for him to have that kind of weight. No one person or even a group of people could get that much going through the proper channels (ie prescriptions) or stealing it directly from a medical facility (an individual hospital wouldnt have much because of its potency, Id wager 30 hospitals collectively wouldn&#39;t even have that much at one time).</p>

<p>My guess is this may be some stuff left over from before the US govt put its sights on it. You could order fentanyl and other opiate analogues very easily from the Netherlands and China up until very recently. It was only declared schedule 1 in June. Youd be surprised how often people exchange drugs through the mail. </p>

<p>Do you not realize that cocaine is a completely different drug than opiates? As someone who used to do hundreds of dollars of coke and oxy a day, I can tell you that no dealer is going to cut coke with fent. You cut coke with something so that it weighs more. You&#39;re going to kill a person long before you add enough fent to add weight to coke. 
Not only that, but you would make a ton more money just selling the fent by itself or in fake oxy pills than mixing it in with coke. 
Your comment is like saying that you could like some shitty bud light beer and just add enough meth &quot;so they like it&quot;  Make no sense. </p>

<p>Yes, but that obviously weakens it. So you add the fent to pep it up again. I think what&#39;s confusing you is that he didn&#39;t mean they cut it with just fent, they cut it with their standard bulker first and then they add the fent to it too to make it seem stronger again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fent will make coke seem weaker, not stronger. Fent is an opiate(depressant), coke is a stimulant. It is like mixing alcohol and adderall. You dont feel the alcohol as much because of the stimulating effects of adderall, so you can drink a ton more. </p>

<p>People enjoy mixing uppers and downers(speedball) but as someone who loves a good speedball, I can tell you that mixing opiates with coke will make the stimulating effects of cocaine much weaker and vice versa. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They cut shitty heroin with it to make it stronger, and they press it into fake oxycodone pills. Example: <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900000059/from-mormon-kid-to-alleged-drug-kingpin-inside-the-rise-and-fall-of-aaron-shamo.html">https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900000059/from-mormon-kid-to-alleged-drug-kingpin-inside-the-rise-and-fall-of-aaron-shamo.html</a></p>

<p>You can buy a kilo of fent from china for around 5k, and make up to 2.5 million after pressing it into fake oxy pills with a $2.5k pill press bought online. </p>

<p>The reason it usually gets &quot;cut&quot; with coke is when dealers are buying bricks of coke and fent and heroin, then when they are breaking it up into smaller amount even a tiny bit a fent powder left in the scale or on a table will get mixed in with the coke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years back I heard that people addicted to opioid pills were turning to heroin because it was cheaper and easier to get. </p>

<p>Then heroin started getting laced with fentanyl and overdose deaths became common.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see the <em>business</em> case for drug cartels switching to fentanyl because of its potency and resulting volumetric efficiency.  If 100 kilos of heroin takes a truck to smuggle, you could move 1 kilo of fentanyl in a suit coat and face far less risk.  Plus it can be made in a lab, where heroin production has usually been dependent on an actual agricultural base -- opium plants, harvesting, conversion to heroin -- with a lot of labor and exposure.</p>

<p>What I find mysterious is why they&#39;d want to basically toss grenades into their user population by passing off poorly cut fentanyl.  It&#39;s so powerful you can&#39;t just dry bulk cut it with lactose like with heroin and get a reasonable outcome.  You would think they would come up with some method of cutting it that resulted in a more consistent concentration to avoid massive overdose deaths.</p>

<p>Plus, the hysteria that&#39;s resulted from all the overdose deaths MUST mean increased scrutiny and all kinds of other problems.</p>

<p>About the only explanation that makes any sense is that heroin use spiked so much after access to pharmaceutical opioids got much more restrictive that the market dried up and lots of &quot;freelancers&quot; moved in with cut-rate Chinese fentanyl to satisfy demand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Provided they cut the product to heroin-level doses.  Fentanyl already exists as a prescription drug in patch form, so it&#39;s certainly possible to use fentanyl without dying provided the dose is right. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some trivial pharmacological difference between heroin and fentanyl, but for drug abuse purposes those don&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>The real question would be why would cartels and high level dealers who are basically running a business want to kill their customers? </p>

<p>In this case, for every death of a heroin addict that China causes through fent, it&#39;s one less person paying the CIA for their Afghan heroin. Dark theories all around but I think there&#39;s truth to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to spend an enormous amount of time at r/darknetmarkets and that stuff is the cheapest way to go and you get the most bang for your buck. I&#39;m a former opiate addict, and somehow stayed away from it. It&#39;s crazy the sheer amount you could buy in bulk from china, though. Pills just got so expensive, so for a while I looked into buying fentanyl. Thank god I never did, and after rehab last year for prescription opiates, I&#39;m doing good. There were quite a few people in rehab with me that were there for just fentanyl, all of which had OD&#39;d multiple times.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fun fact: carfentanil, a fentanyl analog, is even cheaper than regular fent on the darknet. Carfentanil is some 1,000 to 2,000 times more potent than regular fentanyl. It&#39;s a chemical weapon basically, it&#39;s lethal in aerosol doses. You can literally touch a bump onto a person&#39;s skin and their body will absorb it and they will die. How long until we start finding shit like this in dope bags on the street?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, we will.. I was around in the original Silk Road days and didn&#39;t exit the scene until last year. I can&#39;t count the number of requests for carfentanil there were on the site message boards. I remember looking it up and being like omg it&#39;s literally elephant tranquilizer and there was not a &quot;safe&quot; human dosage. Like it doesn&#39;t exist. I couldn&#39;t ever imagine what they even wanted it for. If my memory serves me right, when people did order it, it could only come from Russia. I don&#39;t know why I remember that, I just do. Can&#39;t tell you what I ate earlier but where certain things come from on the darknet? Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom died last year after a quick bout with cancer. She was an opiate addict for 20 years with a long history of Klonopin abuse. We once found her with 3 fentanyl patches on! I&#39;ve been told that she&#39;s lucky to have survived that. She concocted a made up story about how someone burglarized my parents home and took all of her pills. She&#39;d beg me to take her to the ER for her &quot;pain&quot; knowing that she&#39;d just get hooked up to Dilaudid. She was in awful shape. I know her pain was real -- I can&#39;t imagine how awful the withdrawal must have been, so I&#39;d often just help her because I didn&#39;t want my own mother to suffer.</p>

<p>She tried rehab, but of course she ends up with cancer not long after completing treatment and finally getting off of benzos. When you&#39;re given a few months to live, how can you say no to her requests for more meds? It was like carte blanche for her.</p>

<p>It was sad though, maybe a bit selfish of me, but she was my mom and I wanted to try to spend some time with her before she passed. You know, get some info, some history, hear more about things from her childhood. I guess all the stuff I think about now, but have no way of knowing or asking. But, she was taking so much towards her last month of life, she couldn&#39;t even communicate or understand anything. </p>

<p>I spent the morning with her the day she passed. Opened the windows and wheeled her over so she could feel the sunshine and breeze. I left around noon and had no clue she&#39;d die that day. I got the call around 8pm and in a neat and humbling coincidence, the late evening sunset filled the sky with a fiery orange. It was truly beautiful as the sky faded to black on the hour drive back to my hometown. I guess it felt kind of right.</p>

<p>Anyway. Keep at it. Stay clean. People love you and you&#39;re needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the interesting bit, when I started seeing all the fentanyl deaths all over Canada and USA. Every local news station carrying some story about the &quot;epidemic&quot;. </p>

<p>Naloxone, is the drug manufactured as an &quot;overdose&quot; kit. If delivered to the victim soon after overdose they have a higher chance of being saved.</p>

<p>Every single emergency responder agency and hospital purchasing these kits due to the fentanyl &quot;epidemic&quot;.</p>

<p>The patent for Naloxone having recently expired, you bet your ass lots of pharmaceutical companies wanted in on being able to produce the overdose kits, and sell them to the government, and to every emergency responder, and hospital.</p>

<p>One of the biggest culprits of Naloxone production I had traced it back to was, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.</p>

<a href="http://www.jefferies.com/CMSFiles/Jefferies.com/files/Amphastar.pdf">http://www.jefferies.com/CMSFiles/Jefferies.com/files/Amphastar.pdf</a></p>

<p>Where is fentanyl coming from? <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-fentanyl-is-getting-through-canadas-border/article29547443/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-fentanyl-is-getting-through-canadas-border/article29547443/</a></p>

<p>China. </p>

<p>Imagine for a moment, fentanyl being produced in China, and being shipped smuggled and distributed in North America. </p>

<p>Imagine again, that a Chinese CEO of a pharmaceutical company, capitalizing on the &quot;problem&quot; by selling Naloxone. </p>

<p>Sounds plausible, doesn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>When there is profit to be made, when you can create the problem, and manufacture the solution, it&#39;s almost a no brainer. </p>

<p>Same could be said about cigarettes really. </p>

<p>Profit on the sales of cigarettes, and when everyone gets sick, profit on the treatment. </p>

<p>Anyways, it requires further research, but believe me when it becomes a crisis such as this magnitude in Canada and the USA... Just follow the money. </p>

<p>I lost a friend to a fentanyl overdose in early 2016, which prompted me to dig a little. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the supply of opium is so high, like marijuana, that they are just making everything stronger?  I mean, these vape pens are huge in the cannabis smoker realm, now its the fentanyl in the heroin realm.  Everybody is trying to make money so they are all growing pot with mixed results.  Gotta be the same for opium poppies.  Not as much money in it as there was so create an epidemic of addicts to bring that price back up.  Flaunt possible war with a major producer who supplies China in N. Korea.  TL;DR too many suppliers, lots of product, making generic fentanyl patches 
stronger to compete.  Something like that.</p>

<p>Fentanyl makes you high with less of it compared to others, so if they cut stuff and add it, it&#39;s cheaper for the dealer, they claim its the real stuff and sell it at real stuff prices. Boom, more profit. </p>

<p>Two generations are being massacred, right now, in real time, while people debate if harm reduction is enabling or not. </p>

<p>2) Big Pharma is making big bucks. Not rehabs, mind you. Not actual housing programs. But the clinics that administer methadone, Suboxone and Vivitrol. Private doctors are reluctant to deal with these meds, for fear of lawsuits.</p>

<p>3) This shit is getting in with cooperation. Why all the emphasis on the Mexican border, if most of the testing is showing the origin of this shit is from China?! </p>

<p>4) I grew up in the 80s and 90s. There was no way we didn&#39;t know that heroin, Oxys, codiene was addictive and deadly as fuck. Something about this Disney generation is fubar&#39;d. They make bad choices, fuck thier (shallow) feelings away and spend a lot of money on dumb shit. Vaping. Explain the popularity of vaping, please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh I understand feeling that way in this particular instance, but overall that&#39;s a pretty limiting blanket statement. Forgiveness is a huge part of recidivism prevention. People shouldn&#39;t necessarily feel trapped  by mistakes, but rather use the inertia of the guilt to hopefully propel them to something better. I make no excuses for his original behavior, but I&#39;ll support just about anyone who genuinely wants to better themselves. </p>

<p>Is that the case here? Not sure to be honest, just wanted to clarify my position because I don&#39;t wish to play the role of the &quot;misguided saint.&quot;</p>

When it&#39;s not your sister, brother, or best friends family. Goto an addicts funeral sometimes, then you will maybe understand we should invest some money to help fix these people.</p>
