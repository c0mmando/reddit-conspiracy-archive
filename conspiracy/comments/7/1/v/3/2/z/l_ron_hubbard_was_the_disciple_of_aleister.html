        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was doing research on this man Aleister Crowley last night until it became all too disturbing and I was afraid of having nightmares. </p>

<p>This man is one of the most overlooked Satanists on this sub. He is a heavyweight scumbag hater of epic proportions. The world is better off without this waste of space. He was known to eat shit and filed his teeth so that he can bite into people. He spent an entire lifetime practicing evil and studying Satanism and the occult. He was a well respected Satanist among the most powerful Satanists on earth mostly due to his legendary wickedness, Occult knowledge, and general scumbaggedry. </p>

<p>Here are some pics of the madman:</p>

<p>He was involved in the occult since in early age:</p>

<p><a href="https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/300x300/0a1009f5d9d34496bd8571933f5644fb.jpg">https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/300x300/0a1009f5d9d34496bd8571933f5644fb.jpg</a></p>

<p>He worked directly with another maniac named John Whiteside Parsons aka &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/images/image1/parsons-the-anti-christ.jpg">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/images/image1/parsons-the-anti-christ.jpg</a></p>

<p>L Ron Hubbard was a staunch disciple of &quot;The Beast&quot; Aleister Crowley and upon Crowleys death, Hubbard decided that the torch was now passed to him and so he would, from that date forward, be the new &quot;Beast 666&quot; and work with Parsons &quot;the Anti-Christ&quot;. </p>

<p>Hubbard decided that Scientology would be officially open for business on December 1st, 1947 since that is the day Aleister Crowley died. </p>

<p>Today, the Scientology church has grown into a massive parasite that has left millions of poor, unsuspecting fools penniless after they lost every dime they had paying for false information (i.e. They teach a spaghetti monster in space is God). The only reason a full blown scam like Scientology became so powerful is because of Hubbards connections to high level Satanists inside our government. </p>

<p>There is much more to this Aleister Crowley and his ghouls. I&#39;m sure all kinds of scandals will pop up as people research this very wicked man. </p>

<p>Edit: Here is L Ron Hubbards grandson saying how Hubbard was a full blown scumbag that was always on the run from somebody.</p>

<p>Then he came back to the US and used what he learned to start Scientology. The whole process opens people up to possession, that&#39;s what the Thetans are. I can&#39;t remember where I got this information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking past the bad, Hubbard was on point about some things. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our enemies are less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up […]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters […]. These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, income tax, government finance — [Harold] Wilson, for instance, the current Premier of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually.[29]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So was he just a nice but misunderstood man or did he not exist at all?</p>

<p>Also, Luciferians believe in absolute freedom and they use the &quot;Do as thou wilt&quot; philosophy. Liberty stops at the point where it genuinely hurts another person. Luciferians believe in absolute liberty meaning they believe in enslavement, pedophelia, theft, murder, and everything on the darker side of life because, to them, that is true freedom. This is, of course, delusional and will eventually implode on them once people find out what they have done. The only real liberty and freedom is one established by the masses to provide as much freedom as possible with as little harm to others possible. It takes a happy balance to be free and avoid conflict. This is what Satanists cannot seem to grasp. In their mind, they want to do everything without any blow back and yet there is always blowback for evil actions. </p>

<p>there really isn&#39;t anything, unless its all in code or the true tradition is handed down orally. It was just crazy talk about doing things society considers obscene, something I based my entire lifestyle around my entire life.</p>

<p>the one thing Crowley might have done, was to seriously encourage pedophilia and sex/drug addiction among the upper classes.</p>

<p>really I believe it was just a primer on manipulating people in flowery and crazy language, with the cherry on top being ritual that makes things seem official and real.</p>

<p>ultimately, his methods aren&#39;t far from actual politics, where drugs and money and sex = power. Torture and abuse, while keeping the victims in Stockholm syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that&#39;s not real power. That&#39;s more of a weakness than anything: when you need to control and manipulate others for your own end. I mean, how secure or happy can that type of person be? Look at politicians, do you look at wealthy businessmen and see power, or do you see what I see: frail old men, insecure, desperate to cling to their lives and their bubble created by war, destruction, and suffering for themselves and others. None of that&#39;s power, it&#39;s weakness. Do you consider L Ron Hubbard a powerful man? He did the same. Jesus lived his entire life without fear to the point he chose death to send a message and he chose a connection to the divine. Crowley died a fat old sack of shit in a flat in England, spent his life shitting on rugs and fucking dudes, wrote some terrible fiction, and only sought a connection to rich socialites for attention. Some of his thelema stuff seems more grounded, and perhaps he had wanted to actually create something meaningful out of it. His liber books, and juddaic spiritualism are all interesting, but they are interesting in the same way Game of Thrones is interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done some reading on this. These old religions were entrenched in time consuming superstitions and ceremonies. If you watch the Muslims, they spend so much time bowing up and down on a rug because they think they can manipulate God into certain actions but in reality, it is a huge waste of time and energy. </p>

<p>The old religions were so intense. If you go back far enough, they were sacrificing and cannbalizing humans. They thought God ate the spirit as they ate the flesh. One king sacrificed like 100,000 cows, 20,000 slaves, and all kinds of other stuff like wheat to God because he thought by doing so, God would favor him but nothing happened except that he lost all that wealth. </p>

<p>Satanists are involved in many of the same type of ritualistic heresy. The old religions haven&#39;t fully shaken off yet. The only difference now is that they are centered around Lucifer and the &quot;Do as thou wilt&quot; motto which is the devil&#39;s golden rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Catholics were made during the council of Nicea. The entire hierarchy of Catholics is a full blown sham and the top members are practicing Satanists who care about nothing other than power. The Popes cathedral or whatever that reptilian building is doesn&#39;t even shock me. He is bad news. </p>

<p>Christians are more detached from a central authority figure which is good but those major preachers on TV are bought and sold. There is no need for a church or priests in religion though. It&#39;s not that religion itself is bad but rather they have perverted it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a non-denominational religionist but I do believe in Jesus. I don&#39;t go to church or utilize the services of any priest because I think it&#39;s all a sham. God is everywhere and not only in some church being represented by a priest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowledge itself is not inherently evil, what you decide to do with is. Use it for you own gain at the expense of others (Evil), or use it to help others, and through that also help yourself (God). AKA The &#39;easy way&#39; and the &#39;hard way&#39;.
&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot;
Basically, the #1 supreme law of the land in this neck of the infinite multi-verses is &#39;Free Will&#39;. If you impose your will onto other people, you are a &#39;bad guy&#39;, To be a &#39;good guy&#39; you have to walk the hard path of trying to let others live their own lives the way they want to. The hard part comes in when other people decide to exercise their rule one right to deny other people their ability to exercise rule one. We all reap what we sow, so do we stand back at hope karma does the work for us, or do we make the realization that we are the universe and nothing will happen until we choose to make it. </p>

<p>Crowley is a VERY interesting character. In his time knowledge was not as freely available as it is now, and anything relating to the occult was demonized. He is very much demonized himself, and in many cases rightfully so. He saw it as his path to seek knowledge, at any means, good or evil, to be an example and illuminate the nature of the universe. He wanted to usher in a new golden age, and knew that to do so he would have to make personal very deep sacrifices along the way. He took it upon himself to try the hard way and be a &#39;good-guy&#39; by scientifically examining the nature of the universe by examining the &#39;good path&#39; by be an &#39;anti-christ&#39; to sacrifice himself down the dark path, and document all his knowledge from all his research into the nature of the universe. He summoned both good and bad demons, practiced good and evil religions, he would pick up anything and try it on for a while to see if it was real or not... and he documented everything along the way, and objectively analyzed it scientifically. You don&#39;t even have to rely on hand me down stories, from translated ancient books. He lived recently and wrote his own work. Don&#39;t even support him, pirate his stuff.</p>

<p>Your supposed to look at his life, look at his example, look at his results (Scientology, pedophile rings, and an awoke scientific esoteric white hat community waking up to the true nature of the universe) and then follow the number one law. &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot; make your own choice, good or evil. the easy path or the hard path.</p>

<p>there is a story that at the very bottom of the deepest pit of hell lives the beast. if you can defeat him in a game of chess you win and defeat him. and can escape from hell and have whatever you want as a prize. but every one who has made it say they can&#39;t beat him. cause he is you, and you are him. he&#39;s trying to teach you a lesson. you are god, and you are good, you just forgot.  the only way to repay karma is to be and do good. realize that god and the &#39;light bringer&#39; are both inside all of us, because we are all the same deep damn and inside, despite all our differences in the outside world.</p>

<p>We own reap our own rewards in this life and the next, based on our own free will choices. This is basically the teachings of Crowley. and &#39;The Lightbringer&#39; although like everything it is twisted by all sized, and demonized to prevent people from digging further.</p>
