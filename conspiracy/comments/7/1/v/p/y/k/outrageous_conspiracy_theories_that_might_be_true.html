       I'm recently on this hiv one and am under the assumption the virus is never isolated and why it is said to not exist.  We also know the testing for hiv is sort of a scam bc it only tested antibody so people where told they had it but never did.

       The only alleged adjustment made is of the clocks in the GPS satellites. Very few gatekeeper people have access to those clocks, so it's easy to just claim that the clocks have been adjusted for Einstein's relativity when in fact they haven't. Elon Musk, ok maybe a real person, but AIDS tests they don't actually test directly for HIV.

       The GPS thing is absolutely real, early GPS was pretty useless due to inaccuracy (within something terrible like 10m accuracy) it was fixed entirely when they corrected for the relativistic effect on time.

       Yes, but the claim is that they adjust the clocks in the GPS satellites to compensate for Einstein's relativity. I don't think they adjust the clocks at all! They just say they do to keep the Einstein relativity hoax going.

       The GPS accuracy can be improved, such as (from Wikipedia): "The standard accuracy of about 15 meters (49 feet) can be augmented to 3–5 meters (9.8–16.4 ft) with DGPS, and to about 3 meters (9.8 feet) with WAAS. ... Accuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternate ways."
      </p>
      <p>
       So improvements like that explain how GPS has become more accurate over the years. No Einstein relativity hoax needed.

       Except that all of those systems are implimented with clocks already corrected for the relativistic effects, about 40 ms/day. If uncorrected a 10km/s error would accumulate.

       GPS was developed by DoD. The only group who really claim to have tested it were the Jason Society (which have a murky history and objectives). GPS manufacture is a
       <em>
        trade secret
       </em>
       so no one really knows how they are designed, but even considering that, some manufacturers stated their relativity programming was off by a factor of two, and in fact others admit they simply use Newtonian physics. There was a paper floating around a few months ago that showed relativity corrections actually decreased the accuracy of the system. Though it has been censored or made difficult to find.

       The burden of proof lies with the one making the claim. But I'll bite. I did a quick literature search and found experimental verification of relativistic effects going back to the 1940s. There are many more modern ones, which I can post if you'd like. Let me know if you want to see a full article but do not have access to the journal.

       Which is the claim relativity allows GPS to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       As mentioned, from an marketing article in 'physics today' selling the idea:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Historically, there has been much confusion about prop­ erly accounting for relativistic effects. And it is almost impossible to discover how different manufacturers go about it! In one case, a manufacturer was found to be dou­ble-counting. During 1989-90 I wrote letters to about a dozen receiver manufacturers inquiring about relativistic corrections in their software. Two of them responded with reasonable information, but nothing was heard from the others...
       </p>
       <p>
        I did a quick literature search and found observational verification of relativistic effects going back to the 1940s.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's a brilliant straw man and everything but we are speaking about relativity making GPS satellites more accurate or them not being able to work without them. That's the claim. Firstly, it's an empirically false claim since history shows the majority of invention work without theoretical frameworks. Inventors or engineers simply make adjustments and simplistic models to get the systems to function.
      </p>

       "Time dilation" can be explained with Newtonian physics. In fact, it seems to entertain the relativity explanation it requires deciding
       <em>
        a priori
       </em>
       that light moves at constant speed. But it doesn't. It slows down based on the medium and it's temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constant speed of light is rather arbitrary, since it's measured in the physical world as variable.

       The most telling example of relativity not being proven, as it should be, is the lack of robust electromagnetic signal data from other planetary bodies. In fact there seems to be no standard benchmark (the most heavily cited paper in astrophysics - as it should be) for this predicted phenomena which
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       have endless datasets if the space programs were public [NASA has a military mandate]

        (In a letter to Physics Today (42) Wallace summarizes his findings as follows: The 1961 interplanetary radar contact with Venus presented the first opportunity to overcome technological limitations and perform direct experiments of Einstein's second postulate of a constant light speed of c in space. When the radar calculations were based on the postulate, the observed-computed residuals ranged to over 3 milliseconds of the expected error of 10 microseconds from the best [general relativity] fit the Lincoln Lab could generate, a variation range of over 30,000%. An analysis of the data showed a component that was relativistic in a c+v Galilean sense.

       The only one I believe on your list is that the theory of relativity is total nonsense.   Most of the others are absurd, and sound like deliberate disinformation put out to "muddy the waters" in order to make "conspiracy theorists" look nuts.
