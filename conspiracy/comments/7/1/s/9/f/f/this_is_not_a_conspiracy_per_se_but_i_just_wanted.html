        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently posted in r/worldnews in regards to a post about evil, fascist dictator of Turkey, R. Erdogan.  Another user made a comparison between Erdogan and Trump and I had to point out that just because someone voted for Trump, does not necessarily mean that individual has racist tendencies.  </p>

<p>Here is the link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/71qmff/erdogan_says_young_turks_who_study_in_west_return/dnczokl/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/71qmff/erdogan_says_young_turks_who_study_in_west_return/dnczokl/?context=3</a></p>

<p>Normally, a civil discussion would take place between someone like myself and the person who made the statement I disagree with.  However, when I reloaded the comment page, my comment was nowhere to be seen.  I have been a member for 28 days and thought that maybe I&#39;m too new to comment, however mod u/mike_pants was kind enough to reply to my inquiry about where my missing comment was.  He mentioned that what I said was a bigoted statement and thus, my comment was removed.  Shortly after I replied with a short comment mentioning that if reddit operates this way, there is nothing keeping the mods from acting within their own best interests not as a platform for free speech, rather a platform to only address information THEY seem fit.  The response I got shortly thereafter was to be banned for 72 hours from r/worldnews.  </p>

<p>Reddit, is this common?  How long has this been going on for?   Don&#39;t any users see how this is a conflict of interests in regards to free speech and not know the motives of mods who can censor anything, here?  </p>

<p>Edit: So, I&#39;ve received several messages from other users who disagree with my political leanings.  The most prevalent of the messages being &quot;Go back to r/conspiracy,&quot; and being summarily dismissed.  Wow, reddit really has issues with those who disagree with their opinions it seems.  I posted here once and now I&#39;m forever written off as a lunatic?  Just to think, all the education and life experience I&#39;ve had has completely gone down the drain since I posted here ONE TIME!  GREAT!</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand why we see Reddit as a place for free speech. It&#39;s not. The mods act that way because it <strong>is</strong> their community. Same as any other subreddit. The beauty of Reddit is you can start your own community. And if you find enough like-minded individuals you can even have a great community. But you will never find that in the larger &#39;Stock&#39; subreddits. It does suck that there is no way to counter the narratives of many of the default subreddits. For example there are many &#39;nuetral&#39; politics subreddits but they will never be able to compare to the user base of the default &#39;politics&#39; sub.</p>

<p>And that may be by design, probably is, but I still don&#39;t know what we are supposed to expect from a privately owned website. It is what it is and you have to find the &#39;good&#39; spots where you can speak your mind. And if you can&#39;t find one, start your own. </p>

<p>Good luck OP. </p>

<p>Lol. On reddit? You must be joking.</p>

<p>Reddit is a highly censored cesspool of propaganda controlled by the seventh largest media family in the world the Newhouses who have their own agenda which is why they bought reddit to dismantle it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this isn&#39;t popular here, but many of us (non-Trump supporters) view Trump and a fair amount of his supporters as openly racist. My racist family is thrilled that they can be more open with their racism now.</p>

<p>The supporters that don&#39;t view themselves as racist are implicit in Trump&#39;s racism. Theoretically, you know it exists and voted for him anyway. So you&#39;re fine with a racist leading the country. Even if you&#39;re not out there shouting racist slurs at people, you are enabling Trump. </p>

<p>To me, this is like a good cop watching a bad cop beat someone and plant evidence. The good cop doesn&#39;t do that, so he feels like a good guy. I would say they&#39;re both bad cops. If you&#39;re seeing that kind of abuse of power and you&#39;re not helping to stop it, then you&#39;re enabling it.</p>

<p>We could debate what constitutes racism all day. I&#39;m not here to do that.</p>

<p>Calling me racist for voting for Trump doesn&#39;t make a traitor or racist or a Nazi.  Many countries have borders and immigration policies.  I&#39;m not saying Trump is great.  I think the Constitution supersedes feelings and rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not like Trump is called racist simply because of his immigration policies. That is a vast oversimplification. If you simply believe in strong borders you aren’t racist. If you go out of your way to defend white supremacists, have a history of racially insensitive comments, have been sued by the federal government for not renting to black people, etc. I have a right to question whether that guy is racist or not. And if you continue to support that guy who has, at the least, exhibited some pretty deplorable behavior that does not make you racist, but it does reflect on you in some way. The problem is that is hard to discuss without you feeling like I’m calling you a racist and me feeling like you are intentionally oversimplifying the issue to not have to address anything beyond immigration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a new user, I was banned from so many subs, I was shocked. When you atebanned from one sub, like a pro Trump one, you are also banned  from any others that are close cousins. It was a really scary 1984 kind of revelation. I was accused of being bigoted on r/politics and 2xchromosones would not even give me an explanation. The bans have been permanent. I don&#39;t say anything very controversial on here anymore. If you even disagree with someone, you&#39;ll get down voted until you bleed out. </p>

<p>I better spend more time being oblivious in r/awww and not ruffle too many feathers.  I&#39;m not even a Trump supporter, but people still don&#39;t seem to grasp what is permissible within the Constitution.  When did any politician and citizen who is not a leftist become a Nazi?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not safe there either. When I was new to reddit, I posted a comment in that subreddit mentioning how I had a cat that looked similar to the one in the post and how her name was Isis. I even mentioned how she was named after the Egyptian goddess (and 15 years old now) due to my fascination with ancient Egypt. My comment was deleted without explanation. I can only surmise that my cat&#39;s name was offensive despite pre-dating ISIS and having no known affiliation with a terrorist organization.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even &quot;leftists&quot;, most of the propagandists and astroturfers on this site are working for the Democratic Party, NOT liberalism, progressivism, socialism, or anything that lefties actually like. It&#39;s about pushing Clinton, a center-right Democrat, while trashing Bernie Sanders, a popular socialist hero among lefties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s astroturf, people paid to go on social media and troll you into submission. The mods in many subreddits are similarly compromised and use their power to censor people they&#39;re paid to disagree with. Try not to be too offended, it&#39;s basically systemic across the entire site. This sub is one of the last few large ones that I know of where a person can freely express political ideas without being banned to silence them. You were banned from r/worldnews for a few days? I&#39;ve been permanently banned from over a dozen different subs despite never breaking any rule to deserve it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya this is the way Reddit works now.
r/worldnews and r/conspiracy censors quite a bit and removes anything that doesn&#39;t fit the narrative, or if someone shits on the agendas Reddit makes money off of.</p>

<p>I was banned from r/conspiracy for questioning mods and saying they are dictators.
Probably going to get banned again haha</p>

<p>This site is shitty now anyway. Just good for a laugh that&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the problems with reddit is that it isn&#39;t actually a forum. You see the most upvoted comments. So it already rewards comments that people agree with.</p>

<p>Plus it&#39;s partially for entertainment. Saying anything important that could actually effect things </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the fact that people can create other subreddits. The idea is that if you disagree with someone or don&#39;t like the rules you can and should go somewhere else where you fit in.</p>

<p>Sure there are the more mainstream subs like worldnews that should allow for more debate, but it usually doesn&#39;t happen that way for the reasons I listed.</p>
