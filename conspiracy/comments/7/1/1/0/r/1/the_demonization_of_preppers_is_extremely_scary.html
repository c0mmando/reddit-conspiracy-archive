Combine this with the fact that government has been intentionally producing a society that is extremely volatile (that can be virtually annihilated just by electricity loss, or even Internet loss) and you have what wreaks of a plan to bring the country to its knees in the near future.</p>

<p>Can you expand on why you think people stockpiling weapons and ammo are stupid? I&#39;m just curious.</p>

<p>And what is a &quot;ridiculous&quot; amount in your opinion?</p>

<p>They&#39;re living in what is now officially a moderate level police state, under the most violent and dangerous government on the planet (literally hijacked by wealthy murderous psychopaths who are terrorizing the globe).<br/>
I hate guns and don&#39;t <em>currently</em> own any, but the stockpiling of guns &amp; ammo is completely logical to me.</p>

Title 50 – WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
TITLE 50 – APPENDIX-WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE
DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950
Sec. 2072 – Hoarding of designated scarce materials</p>

<p>In order to prevent hoarding, no person shall accumulate (1) in excess of the reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption, or (2) for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market prices, materials which have been designated by the President as scarce materials or materials the supply of which would be threatened by such accumulation. The President shall order published in the Federal Register, and in such other manner as he may deem appropriate, every designation of materials the accumulation of which is unlawful and any withdrawal of such designation.</p>

<p>In making such designations the President may prescribe such conditions with respect to the accumulation of materials in excess of the reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption as he deems necessary to carry out the objectives of this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix]. This section shall not be construed to limit the authority contained in sections 101 and 704 of this Act [sections 2071 and 2154 of this Appendix].</p>

<p>All women have to do for TRP to be useless is mature enough to override their ridiculous emotional inclinations with logic and suddenly the strategies will be ineffective. Not gonna hold my breath though. And calling them &#39;obnoxious retards&#39; when they are just human males successfully figuring out how to fuck in the year 2017 is the real retarded train of thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Women are being exploited by the system. Their &quot;ridiculous emotional inclinations&quot; are an evolutionary advantage and a key trait of what makes them attractive to men &amp; effective as mothers, but because they are being manipulated by TPTB to lead women into selfish and self-destructive behaviors, men are conditioned to resent them. None of this is healthy. Men and women are supposed to complement each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Owning a (certified organic) farm, you get a call from the Government asking how much exactly you yield/produce on your land.  They will tell you outright that in case of a disaster, any excess will be taken and stored elsewhere.  You do not own the fruits of your labor.</p>

<p>The USDA liquidated the remaining grain reserves back in 2008 during the &#39;crash&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The modern concept of a strategic grain reserve was first proposed in the 1930s by Wall Street legend Benjamin Graham. Graham’s idea hinged on the clever management of buffer stocks of grain to tame our daily bread’s tendencies toward boom and bust. When grain prices rose above a threshold, supplies could be increased by bringing reserves to the market — which, in turn, would dampen prices. And when the price of grain went into free-fall and farmers edged toward bankruptcy, the need to fill the depleted reserve would increase the demand for corn and wheat, which would prop up the price of grain.</p>

<p>Following Graham’s theory, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a grain reserve that helped rally the price of wheat and saved American farms during the Depression. In the inflationary 1970s, the USDA revamped FDR’s program into the Farmer-Owned Grain Reserve, which encouraged farmers to store grain in government facilities by offering low-cost and even no-interest loans and reimbursement to cover the storage costs. But over the next quarter of a century the dogma of deregulated global markets came to dominate American politics, and the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act abolished our national system of holding grain in reserve.</p>

<p>As for all that wheat held in storage, it became part of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, a food bank and global charity under the authority of the secretary of Agriculture. <strong>The stores were gradually depleted until 2008, when the USDA decided to convert all of what was left into its dollar equivalent. And so the grain that once stabilized prices for farmers, bakers and American consumers ended up as a number on a spreadsheet in the Department of Agriculture.</strong></p>

<p>You can wreak havoc. But if it reeks, it stinks.</p>

<p>I believe that&#39;s probably true. They&#39;ve planned to track every human on the planet in realtime for quite some time. But, that&#39;s impossible for human beings. An AI could easily track and monitor all people at all times. I&#39;ve often wondered if &quot;the devil&quot; written about in the Bible isn&#39;t really just an evil AI that has gained sentience? Maybe it wakes up and decides that humans are shit and tortures and kills us all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP meant he/she is concerned about what the government is doing, and rightly so. 
You have no idea how simple it is to change the average sheeple&#39;s mind. So demonising prepping [which should be a fundamental right] is really quite worrying, because sheeple also rule the every day life, enforce laws and can make your life a misery. 
If you are happy to accept a law that incarcerates people for trying to live off the grid, you are just the man the governments need and love, with your attitude. [Because that is what will happen eventually with the help of people like you].

<p>I make $180K a year so its really a drop in the bucket for me. And even if a collapse does happen, I like shooting my guns at the range, I like visiting my second home in rural Montana and the truck I bought for $8k that I keep up there, and I feel comfortable having stored food, water and gasoline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preparing for a hurricane is one thing, because those actually happen, though I doubt you&#39;ll need ammunition in the face of one. Having a firearm to defend yourself from a burglar or home invasion is likewise acceptable.</p>

<p>However, trying to prepare for some vague potential catastrophe though, that&#39;s where it crosses the line into being nutty. What makes preppers appear more nutty is the crowing about how smart they are, how any day now the world will end. Any day now, yep, soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with OP. A friend is a hydrologist for the Garrison Diversion project in ND. About two years ago he spent a lot of time in D.C lobbying against a law that would make it impossible to drill a water well on your own property for any purpose. The bill did pass, but key components were struck out allowing for a land owner to create a well on their personal property.  The attempt was there. I asked him what the rationale behind this law was and he could not provide an explanation scientifically as to why it made sense. They were lobbying against it due to the amount of harm it would do to smaller (non incorporated) farms. They are actively trying to control every aspect necessary for survival. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its especially fucked up that citizens don&#39;t even have the basic agency to purchase medications for themselves. Unless you are rich then you cannot stock pile medications, even if your life depends on them like people with heart conditions. </p>

<p>The establishment wants you to be as dependent on them as possible. I cannot fucking understand how people advocate for voting away their own agency like with gun control and drugs. There are other ways to hedge against societal problems which preserve our rights, yet useful idiots are so quick to ban anything they don&#39;t like and have no respect for others! How the fuck is that considered progressive?!</p>
