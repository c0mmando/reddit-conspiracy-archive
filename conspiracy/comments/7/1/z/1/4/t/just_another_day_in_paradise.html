        I am tired of 're-explaining' myself;. I am also tired of being stalked and called a scammer.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Why 600k seemed like a "risky budget". On a project that could have saved lives and millions in property damages over the past few weeks alone is factually shocking.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        To the users calling me a scammer:
       </strong>
       Stop telling everyone I wanted that money (for me or some selfless angle). That what this forums problem is-
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that money was attributed to the project and my requested cost of living through the time I engaged the project. I merely requested to marry my gf within this active period "with my supporters blessings".
       <em>
        I must be evil for even mentioning such a thing.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive outlined full theories and papers on what I do, and have been doing; Ive addressed who I would want to work with- What companies could play a critical role in discovery-
How much those individuals cost per hour- What data I wanted them to process-... Why I felt it would be benificial- which agencies could use that data- As well as how helpful it could be-
       <strong>
        While also openly admitting
       </strong>
       <em>
        it may be of no help at all...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>

        Thats really all there is to this-

      </p>
      <p>
       Im just a hobbiest that thinks I see a beneficial role which could help mankind in which I could fulfill. Period...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So factually I am not a scam artist and I am sick of people accusing my posts of being probability based only. 
If anything this is **only
       </strong>
       solar based forecasting-**
It always has been and was just that- for hobby.

      <p>
       <strong>
        I don't have credentials
       </strong>
       but
       <em>
        I do know a lot of people with drivers licenses that factually drive poorly
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I am not asking for help to fund and 'fast-track' the project at this time either
       </strong>
       - so get off my case with your failed accusations. 
And useless probability charts-
      </p>
      <p>
       Either prove to the community that the recent x Flares didn't cause these recent earthquakes. Or
       <strong>
        accept that the largest earthquake of the year followed the largest cme's of the year.
       </strong>
       And
       <em>

       Final thoughts...
I mean: (If I were mexico). Id probably pay me, after these last couple weeks alone;

       What if we don't know a lot about you. I mean, it is amazing you have done so much on your research field and even arrived to a state were you are able to predict some of the quakes on Earth with some acurracy. However if it weren't for I am a redditor, I wouldn't know about you at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think you are overestimating your own helpfulness. People right now are in need of that money, whether investing on research is better or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were you, I would delete this. Not because I don't believe you, but because you seem very egocentrical in what you wrote. There are many many people who would rather have that money right now. That's just how it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't give up. You just need to level up your acurracy and people will believe you. And you better explain everything like they are 5 in order to have a better acceptance. That's my opinion

       I get what you are trying to say. If I had the power to help you in your investigation and testing, I would. But many of us are just redditors that try to make sense out of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I do appreciate your predictions a lot. I want to believe you, really. But your attitude of guilt against people is not helpful to your cause. What if instead of crying for help here, you actually convince people that your system is on the right track and could predict a quake with a lot of acurracy in very few time?
      </p>
      <p>
       You should make a valid research on your system and why it works and convince some investors to help you. Because very few take a Reddit post seriously, even less on r/conspiracy. So, keep on with your dream, but here on reddit you are unlikely to make it true

       He made a post literally titled "If I am right about this, then I just changed the field of seismic prediction forever-". The entire post was basically jerking himself off about how he was changing the world with this prediction and it would completely verify his claims to all the doubters. And guess what? It completely fell flat. He's never been humble about his predictions, so this post really isn't much of a surprise.

       (Intensity is based fully on solar). Locations would be subjective to given probability
       <em>
        "within a model"
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       "What I do is attempt to locate a given magnitude and location". So: "This is a solar based forecast, for a given earthquake and location".
      </p>
      <p>
       The ideal way of doing this would be conducted 'post' an imaging session of paired solar and seismic data feeds /
       <em>
        (archives).
       </em>
       To determine the statistical frequency for and where events could likely manifest in the future:
       <em>
        "again based on 'past': solar and seismic data sets".
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Its comparative to a solar influence-
Thus my posts are not based on a true given probability. Its using attempted probability (via a simple high low strategy), as a defacto system to create a demo.
      </p>
      <p>
       My posts are hobby forecasting, via trial and error. 
They show an expected intensity reading in relationship to how many photons offset the earths flux field / creating seismic activity.
       <em>
        (through: what I believe is an earthly magnetic induction process)
       </em>
       ...
       <em>
        (Or absorbtion system).
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I want to measure the two systems to see if we can extract values to prove a relationship between the two. 
Only then using a probability chart for location triangulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I've always said. (I'm not a genius nor a computer)-
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there (to me) is a given 'measurable' seismic intensity from 'within' these solar outbursts. That: (To me) shows it's a cause vs. effect scenario in its fullest consistency-
      </p>
      <p>
       "We just aren't identifying the kinks so the relationship is still curious to us". Yet, "Thats why I just want to build"-
Stop asking questions and get too it!

       <strong>
        So:
       </strong>
       Yes, I propose within a model; choosing a location involves a great deal of probability. (However) that which I forcast is solar data in itself. (So, all intensity's per the incoming solar winds and their suspected oncoming seismic intensitys are not in relationship to probability in the slightest).

       If I was subcontracted by an agency, Id accept it as an operating budget. So long as a fair salary was seeded into the agreement. I'd assume 450k. Is the operating budget. +/- the 600k. Was due to costs associated with a crowd sourcing service as well as taxes.

       You would "accept" 600k from an agency?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have absolutely zero data to prove your ideas right and you've proven, time and time again, that you don't care enough to try to actually create and test this data. So why are you so entitled? Why do you deserve this money? Why do you deserve 6.00 from 100 people, never mind 600k from some agency that could otherwise use it to protect people from disasters?

       He predicted an 8+ earthquake would hit the east coast of japan within a 7 day period, and on day 8 it hit Mexico. So Mexico owes him at least a half million dollars for that.

       Once more: there are, on average, three 6.0M+ plus earthquakes each weeks. Until you provide some data from your model, your predictions are not more accurate than the current statistical model, therefore they do not have a scientific merit. 
So far your flare-to-earthquake correlation is as strong as an imaginary "there is an earthquake every week I eat lentils" argument. Without data, we can only agree that you are onto something is your hit chance is significantly higher than average.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have offered to help you before, and I will do it again: I am a forensic scientist with a M.Phil. I do not know anything at all about solar flares (other than they exist), I know few things about the earth's magnetic filed and I know as much about plate tectonics as a random nerd would read in books when he was younger. All those things do not matter, because I don't care about reviewing the science part of your work. I will help you with the principles of scientific method, like:  causation, correlation, significance, confidence, Boolean algebra and all that. I can help you with that, just in the off chance you are right and you get to help humanity. Are you willing to take the help this time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, its funny to read things like "I am not a scammer" while your final thoughts are "(If I were mexico). Id probably pay me". If you think you have done something, EARN that pay by doing it correctly. If you are correct you will easily become a billionaire. Put some effort into your work. And not, effort isn't trying to decide which lines you should bold on your Reddit post. Aren't you, of all people, curious to see if what you suggest are true?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have people posting that the earth will be destroyed due to how they interpreted a book, and they don't get abused on their posts. Ever wonder why? 
No one cares about your lack of degree, we all care about the lack of scientific method. This is the only reason you get flak.

       Have an upvote. I watched OP's (GlobalHell) posts from the beginning and I am convinced that his theory deserves attention. It's also obvious he needs help for the hypothesis to sound a bit more coherent. Even if his theory is shown to be partially, or fully wrong, it must be reviewed.

       Unfortunately some people like to project their lack of self worth onto those with a particular skill or knack for something interesting. Misery likes company, so they attempt to draw positive or successful people into their pit of despair.

       There are more people amazed by your predictions than those who seek to disparage you. Keep doing what you're doing.
