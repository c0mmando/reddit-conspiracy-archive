        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Did anyone else happen to catch the Orville on Thursday? Episode 3 focused on Bortus, the Orville&#39;s 2nd Officer and his &quot;mate&quot; who want to give their newborn daughter a sex change.</p>

<p>Peter Macon[9] as Lt. Commander Bortus, the second officer aboard the U.S.S. Orville. Bortus is a Moclan, a single-gender species who exhibits a degree of stoic formality. For example, Bortus disapproves of the bridge crew discussing Mercer and Grayson&#39;s breakup after Mercer leaves the bridge in the pilot episode.[8] Among the peculiarities of the Moclans are that they only urinate once a year.[8] Moclans reproduce through the laying of eggs, which are incubated for 21 days. Bortus and his partner, Klyden, become parents in the series&#39; second episode, when Bortus incubates and hatches an egg.[11]</p>

<p><strong>spoiler</strong>
In the end, they decide to give their daughter a sex change because it will fit in better with the rest of Moclan society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just complimenting the show because the godawful Star Trek Discovery preview was on. I thought Orville was a pretty damn good reboot of Star Trek. And then I got about 5 or 10 minutes into that episode and I was like WTF?!?!? I almost turned it off but decided to see where they were going with it. They seemed to be making sense but in the end, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Which was fucked up and the characters were disheartened. Btw, one parent wanted it and the other didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Saying the show was &quot;transgender propaganda&quot; is way misleading about this episode though cuz most characters were pretty against it, and not in the typical overly exaggerated &quot;bigoted&quot; way but in a common sense way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of discussion right now about transgender children transitioning. There is now a law in Canada that says if your child wants a sex change when they are a minor and the parents don&#39;t allow it, the child can be taken from you. Schools are putting transgender books in school classes and parents can not object. There are lots of reasons why the messaging in this episode is bad.</p>

<p>I agree that the other characters presented reasoned arguments but in the end, the State won out. Bortus&#39;s mate said that he was also given the sex change operation when he was a child and he turned out great so what could be wrong about it? The State knows what&#39;s best.</p>
