       I posed this question to
       <a href="/r/parenting">
        /r/parenting
       </a>
       yesterday and was surprised at the negative response I received. I tried to ask a question in an unbiased and constructive way but the responses were anything but, with the exception of a few. So I ask this sub the same thing. Is the threat of vaccination damage from individual vaccines or is it that so many are given at the same time? Are children less likely to be harmed when the vaccines are given over a spread (but within the actual guidelines of when they are due)?
      </p>

       What is the consensus?

       I don't believe there's any consensus even here (watch the shills come out of the woodwork even here)
      </p>
      <p>
       However I have read more than a few stories of parents who noticed significant changes after a single shot. I'm sure the wide variety of vaccines probably make this a mine field, what's good for us what isn't... Overall though I think it's exposure over multiple with the additional risks of a single one that can fuck you up

       I agree. Its weird to me how this has become such an issue over say... the past 10 years. I don't remember anything ever coming up with vaccines in the early 2000s but then again, i didn't care about such things. It also feels like a divide and conquer technique with actual life change repercussions. The argument for and against vaccines is so strong either way and very few consider views on both sides. Its almost like the current state of liberals and republicans! Its crazy to me but more frightening than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be wrong but after discussions and my research it seems that spreading them out but still within the guidelines is probably the safest bet. If the child is supposed to receive 4 vaccines in a visit, do 2 and then 2 more in a month etc etc. What would be the problem with that? Apparently spreading them out but ultimately receiving them all still makes you an anti-vaxxer

       I think what people need to realize is that while the concept of vaccines is great, we want to cure people, this is great. But it would seem some have co-opted that into also doing population engineering. Not everyone is affected, only a percentage but it still steers them in the direction they want, a dumbed down population.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same with big pharma, I don't hate healthcare and companies trying to develop new cures but I do hate the way we are artificially keeping remedies to things we could cure easily because of profit.

       For example, Thimerosal (ethylmercury thiosalicylate) used for preserving vaccines in many countries should be refrained from administering to children, being most vulnerable to Hg.

       From what I have read it appears to be the number and the age at which they are given. Under 3!years of age shows to be bad. Like everything vaccines are nothing more than big business to make profits. If you want the truth here just follow the money, big Pharma and lobbyists is a good start.

       It seems like the worst vaccines for potential danger are the combination vaccines like MMR.  Also many of the doses we're originally set for older children or teenagers and never recalculated for infants.  We have a very delayed schedule for our children so as not to stack up large quantities of formaldehyde and aluminum etc.  Many we refuse altogether.  One day after a particular vaccine my one yr old developed a massive fever that lasted for a couple of days.  He became listless so we took him to a children's hospital in the area.  Because he hadn't had a menningitis vaccine yet they implied we were terrible parents and insisted on performing a spinal tap.  We explained the fever started the night of his vaccine and that he has always displayed strong reactions and fevers to vaccines but they performed the spinal tap anyways.  They found nothing, luckily my little dude is still super smart and super advanced physically, very affectionate and socially engaged.    His pediatrician reviewed the charts from the hospital and confirmed it appeared to be a vaccine reaction. Not surprisingly we have spread the schedule out even more.

       My now 4 year old had some small fevers as well from vaccines. Which I fully anticipate to happen! Those are fine and we handled those well. Honestly I didn't even know about all this crazy vaccine stuff until a few months ago. As much conspiracy stuff I read up on, I never gave the vaccine theory a chance. But now that I'm expecting a second child, my paranoia as me gripped.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I accept fevers and rashes as part of routine vaccines the small chance of permanent damage or death is my concern. Its weird because the chance of that happening are as equal as the child getting one of the diseases they are being vaccinated against.

       Cool, I never tell others how they should raise their kids but hopefully our experiences can be helpful to others.  Also, our first house (which we lived in when both children were born) was on well water and I put a remineralizing reverse osmosis filter in our current house and both children are testing far above their contemporaries.  They have way more energy and better attitudes than most the other children in the neighborhood.  We also cut most refined sugar and juices out of their diet, they only get fruit unless it's a holiday.

       Please vaccinate your child... we are starting to get measles and pertussis outbreaks again. Certain common diseases are now almost unknown to a generation of physicians because of vaccines. Also, vaccines mean that if you child does get sick physicians can throw fewer antibiotics and treatments at your child. There is no evidence of alternative spacing of vaccines or skipping vaccines being beneficial. The antigen dose of a vaccine is tiny compared to real infections.

       There is no evidence that spacing them is beneficial because big pharmacy refuses to conduct a study, or compare unvaccinated to vaccinated children long term.

       The pertussis vaccine is only about 45% effective and can shed, meaning vaccinated children are spreading the pertussis virus. This vaccine wears off in as little as 4 years, and adults should get a booster shot every 10 years. How often do adults get booster shots? I'm guessing most adults are no longer immune, so why the huge focus on childhood immunisations? Shouldn't we see huge pertussis outbreaks among adults without booster shots and almost none among young children?

       The risk of dying from measles is 0.2%, and usually happens if you are malnourished. In developed countries, there is a very small chance of measles complications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC states a side effect of MMR is "Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)". With millions of children vaccinated, that's hundreds of children having seizures who otherwise may not have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Measles, in rare cases, can cause mental retardation because of high fever and brain swelling. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that the measles vaccine can cause the same symptoms (high fever, brain swelling, and seizures), yet "becoming retarded from a vaccine is impossible!"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've had chicken pox, as almost everyone has who was born before 2000, you know it's not a big deal at all. I would much rather have my child sick for two weeks than cause a mental condition or lifelong autoimmune disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is fear on both sides and that's why this is such a touchy argument. Pro-vaxxers are afraid their children will get a deadly disease and die. Anti-vaxxers are afraid they're harming their children and causing lifelong damage and irreversible medical conditions.

       That is not a small number. 31 people died in one outbreak in Romania last year including many children. Immunocompromised children are at risk. The antigen load and physiologic stress of measles is infinitely greater than the vaccine.

       3-5% of children have febrile seziures, these are self limited, and cause no lasting effects. If kids were not vaccinated, then many childhood diseases would return and kids would have more fevers... and hence more seizures.

       Well, there is no evidence of autism or mental retardation from measles vaccine. There is evidence that 1 in 10 children have hearing loss, 1 in 20 pneumonia (most common cause of death), 1 in 1000 get encephalitis  (brain swelling)

       And I don't have time to do a literature search for alternate vaccine schedules, but there is no evidence for those either. Modern vaccines have much lower antigen loads than previous vaccines are well studied. People in America just had it too good for too long and don't remember what it was like when childhood diseases ran rampant.

       Does hepatitis count as a childhood disease? How many vaccines do you think a child should have? 40? 80? 120? Some vaccines may be necessary and helpful, but there are new ones added all the time and we have never studied how this many vaccines interact with each other. Don't you think that's dangerous?

      <p>
       From a neurosurgeon:-
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear Sirs,
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been asked to render my professional opinion on three points of interest in this case: inadvisability of giving multiple vaccinations, the risk of these diseases at this age and should the children be allowed to leave town days after the vaccination. My opinions are based on an extensive review of the medical and scientific literature on the subject. I have just complete three papers, which have been published in peer-reviewed scientific publications addressing the points I address in this letter.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The issue of multiple vaccinations being given at one office visit. It is my understanding that these children received a total of five vaccinations given at one office visit. Three of these vaccinations were totally unnecessary and two were beyond the recommendations of the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommendations. According to the CDC, there is no indication for vaccinating children with Hib and Pneumococcus vaccines who have reached the age of 5 years. Both of these children have reached the age of 5 or beyond.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This has exposed both of these children to a significant risk of vaccine related complications that were totally unnecessary. Both of these vaccines, especially when given in conjunction are associated with considerable risk of neurological injury. The risk is even greater considering another sibling developed a seizure following a second exposure to MMR vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is considerable scientific evidence indicating that giving this many vaccines at one time poses a substantial risk of neurological injury that may impair these children’s intellectual capacity and behavior on a permanent bases. In a paper soon to be released in the Journal of the American Physician and Surgeons, I outline the pathophysiological mechanism explaining the danger produced by such a practice. In another paper published in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in 2003 (Vol 6, 21-35) I go into a lot more scientific detail explaining the immunological and neurological mechanism for this injury. The article contains 167 scientific references that back up this mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, when the body’s immune system (peripheral immunity) is activated it also activates immune cells in the brain called microglia. Normally, they are activated for only short periods to prevent serious injury to the brain’s cells (neurons). When activated for longer periods of time or with great intensity, as seen with vaccination, more injury to the neurons occurs. Now, here in lies the problem with giving multiple vaccinations together. Each of these vaccines consists of the organisms targeted as well as powerful immune adjuvants. These are chemicals, such as aluminum, special oils, lipopolysacchride, etc, used to stimulate a very powerful and prolonged activation of the immune system. Sometimes we see such a powerful immune reaction that the area becomes intensely red and swollen. In some cases, the skin will break down into an ulceration.
      </p>
      <p>
       When vaccines are manufactured care is taken not to add too many of these immune adjuvants to a single vaccine specifically because of the danger of triggering too powerful of an immune reaction. Yet, when a pediatrician gives a child five injections of vaccines, they are giving five doses of powerful immune adjuvants all at once. They would never dream of increasing the immune adjuvant concentration of any one vaccine five-fold, yet that is exactly what was done to these children.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the body’s immune system is activated this intensely, it also intensely activates the brain’s immune system (the microglia). This has been proven in many studies. In addition, these immune adjuvants remain in the site of injection, producing long-term activation of the brain’s immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Careful studies of what happens when the brain’s immune system is over activated, especially for prolonged periods, have been done. They show widespread injury to many parts of the brain, especially those areas responsible for learning, memory and behavioral control. A child’s brain is much more vulnerable because at age five and six much in the way of synaptic growth and pathway development is occurring. These are the very types of neurological injuries we see in cases of vaccine injury. These injuries can appear within hours of the vaccines or may present themselves months or even years later. The severity of the brain damage depends on many factors-age of the child, the types and number of vaccines given the child’s immune status before vaccination and the child’s nutritional status.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further elucidation of the exact mechanism of the damage was further described in my paper on the central role of excitotoxicity in autism spectrum disorders (JANA6: 10-22,2003). In this paper, I show that intense immune activation, as with administering multiple vaccination at one sitting, strongly activates excitotoxic mechanism in the brain. The results from an outpouring of two excitotoxins from the microglial immune cells in the brain, triggered by vaccine immune stimulation. This is why we see a high risk of brain injuries when vaccinating individuals already having antibodies to a particular disease organism. The immune system is already maximally activated and vaccination causes overactivation, triggering brain immune overstimulation and excitotoxicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is never any indication for giving so many vaccinations at one sitting, except for the convenience of the physician or other third parties. Yet, there is solid scientific evidence as to why it should not have been done. This, in my opinion, represents medical malpractice. As to the argument that since the vaccine schedule has been started, the rest of the vaccinations must be given to prevent increasing the risk of infection is shear nonsense. What it will do is greatly increase the risk of these children developing a neurological injury. Numerous instances of neurological, devastating injuries occurring with the second or third injection series have been recorded n the medical literature.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for increased risk is the immune suppressing effects of some of these vaccinations. For example, the Hib vaccine is known to produce a fall in immune markers following vaccination, thereby increasing risk of infection. It is well known that the measles virus vaccine (a live virus vaccine) can cause severe immune dysfunction, greatly increasing autoimmune reactions to the nervous system. To protect the children at this stage requires nutrient supplementation. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin A deficiency greatly increases vaccine failure and complications. Supplementation can prevent this. To continue this schedule on these children would be devastating.
As for the chickenpox vaccine, the CDC gives as the only indication-to prevent lost work time for the mother having to care for the child at home. Complication and death in a healthy child age five and six from chickenpox is essentially nil. This vaccine should never have been given.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I have been told that the father wants to take the children on a cruise days after their next vaccination series. With a mix of some of the most hazardous vaccines in the schedule-DTaP, MMR and Pneumococcal vaccines, this would be extremely hazardous. Severe reactions to these vaccines, especially if they again receive five vaccines at once, runs a very high risk of severe neurological injury, possibly seizures, during the first two weeks after the vaccines. The CDC recommends the child be watched at least for a week afterward.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       With hyperactivity reactions caused by these vaccines, I would not recommend they leave their home for at least a month after vaccination. Especially with a family history of post-vaccine seizure in a sibling.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, these children have passed the age of greatest danger from failure to vaccinate. At least two of the vaccines should not have been given, even according to CDC recommendations. Haemophilus influenza meningitis, the purpose of the Hib vaccine does not occur after age four. The same is true of pneumococcus. The chickenpox vaccine has no medically defensible indications in these children.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other vaccines, the MMR is most associated with autism, which is confirmed in a careful study to be released in the Journal of the American Physicians and Surgeons. This study totally refutes the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report loudly reported by the national media of no connection between vaccination and autism. This study shows the IOM study to be a highly flawed study. Sound arguments can be made that these children not receive any of these vacations, especially as they have been given.
      </p>

       Sincerely Yours,
Russell L Blaylock, M.D.

       Almost 25 years ago my wife was 'very upset' to learn the US way of vaccinating kids.  Japan at the time was more cautious and gave single injections for each vaccine and at staggered and later times than the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't put much thought into the recent hubub about vaccines until I saw a comparison of the old schedule and the current schedule.  It looked like a 4X increase in vaccines and at much earlier ages.  This made me wonder how ineffective are the new vaccines if they have to be given so many times and so early?  Did we get vaccinations so wrong 25 years ago?  WTH is going on?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously hope this isn't just a money-grabbing push by big pharma.

       Yup, told the kids growing up that only unsuccessful companies advertise, especially when they are on the media like GEICO, Progressive, etc.  The ones doing well don't have to advertise.

      <p>
       From over 15 years of research, here are my findings:-
      </p>
      <p>
       For every extra vaccine given on the same sitting, the risk of vaccine damage increases by 50%, so for anyone who still believes in vaccination but wants to decrease the risk, only get one vaccine at most per month.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still some vaccines which must be avoided at all cost as they have far too much risk involved, such as MMR, DPT, Hep B and HPV.
      </p>
      <p>
       One has to avoid Tylenol/Paracetamol around the time of vaccination, as those who go autistic after their vaccines tend to be the ones who were using Tylenol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not vaccinate a child who has had antibiotics within the last two months, when you read stories from parents of vaccine damaged children, frequently you will hear that their child had recently received a course of antibiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never vaccinate a sick child, they are far more vulnerable to harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not vaccinate if you have anyone with autoimmune diseases in the family, autoimmune diseases mostly come from vaccines, certain families are more at risk from vaccines, the former head of the NIH has called for screening to find people who are vulnerable to vaccines, so as they can sit out, but so far her calls her fallen on deaf ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, never vaccinate before the age of 2, this removes the risk of Crib Death, it also reduces the risk of Asthma, Autism, Epilepsy etc, the longer you hold off the vaccines the lower the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you find, is that the more you research vaccines, the more vaccines you cross off the list, until eventually there are none left, as not one has been through the necessary research, they have all been allowed to bypass real testing.

       In my opinion, the biggest problem is that every drug company that produces them have, in the past knowingly hurt people for profit.  They either produced drugs that were harmful and sold them anyway or sold them, found out later they were hurting people and continued to sell them.  The fines that they paid were insignificant compared to the profits generated and therefore did nothing to discourage them from doing it again.  Corporations that do this should be eliminated, not punished.  How can you ever trust them not to hurt you again?

       I have no qualifications to say yes or no. I believe vaccines are inherently good. I think some are unneeded or need to be given at a older age. But I also think you shouldn't give a child more than one at a time. Ok yes vaccines have a lot of bad crap in them. But hats how they work to help you build a impunity to the bad crap. However if you pump a 20 pound child with 4-5 doses of crap at once, you can't be surprised when they get sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines aren't bad. You just have to take them slow and give the child recovery time.

       Giving my opinion in case it helps give you some more perspective.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Each vaccine injection is sort of like a "hack" to your immune system. The body is supposed to learn about disease through the experience of the disease. How does the body know that this particular particle is dangerous? Because the body got sick (irritated), and this particle was found floating around in the blood. Thus, in the future, whenever that particle is found, the body knows to clear it ASAP.  This is part of the reason why
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant">
          adjuvants
         </a>
         are added to vaccines. Adjuvants irritate the body to a greater degree than "pure" vaccine alone - so the body "learns" more easily. The problem is that every time you "hack" something (computer or body), you're circumventing the normal system process. Sometimes you can get away with it.  Sometimes you trigger something you didn't intend to. Some people's immune systems can handle the multiple hacks. Some people have problems.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         For a healthy individual in an ideal environment, the majority of vaccines shouldn't be necessary.
         <strong>
          However
         </strong>
         , many people aren't healthy and our modern society is far from ideal. I like to make a parallel with animal shelters. Most animals are actually fine without vaccinations
         <strong>
          if
         </strong>
         they're living in the wild and naturally dispersed (i.e. not overcrowded). However, if you stick and un-vaccinated animal in an animal shelter (or a domestic farm), chances are they're going to catch something from the multitude of animals surrounding them. Thus vaccinations are somewhat necessary if living in an "animal shelter" (school/modern city) environment.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The common vaccine schedules are way overloaded. You'll need to really do some research to figure out for yourself which vaccines are absolutely necessary.
        </p>
       </li>

       It's a crapshoot. Just like chemo. The idea is to slowly poison you so your better prepared for the dangers of the outside world. With chemo, the idea is to slowly kill you with the hope that cancer cells will be killed along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       With vaccines, maybe it works for person A. With person B it destroys their immune system and they suffer greatly for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is of course what we are told. There could be a sinister motive involved in actuality, like eugenics.

       What are your concerns specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are single dose (hep B, hep A, varicella, hib, flu, pneumococcal and HPV (given to teens) to name a few), divalent (Td), trivalent (MMR, dTaP), quadrivalent (MMR-V), and then you have the mega 5 combo Pentacel and Pediarix that include IPV, hep B, and DTaP. I tried to remember all of the shots in the first 15 months but I may have forgotten a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pentacel is the one Vaccine that is know to cause what is called the "DTaP scream". My daughter suffered this after her 4 and 6 month round of vaccines and I was told it was normal that she was going through a textbook sleep regression. At the 2, 4 and 6 month round they typically do Pentacel or Pediarix and promote those two shots as "one less injection for the baby" which is appealing to parents... who wants to add one more self inflicted shot to a baby when you don't have to? They're also given HIB and pneumococcal (PCV13 or brand name Prevnar). It's hard to tell if it's the combo vaccines or too many at once. There is much debate currently in the anti Vaccine world about the amount of aluminum being too little if you opt for a single shot or too much if you get 4 injections in one visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Least reactive vaccines are the IPV and HIB. Prevnar is in the middle and Pentacel and MMR being the most reactive.
