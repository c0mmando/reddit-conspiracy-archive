        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He&#39;s a fucking puppet.</p>

<p>On another note,</p>

<p>Now that the Manafort shit is happening before our eyes, let&#39;s look at what&#39;s going on with the Trump and Russia conspiracy. Pretty juicy stuff if you ask me:</p>

<p>Manafort was wiretapped all along. Lets review why that might be bad for Manafort and most of all, Trump, shall we? </p>

<p>1) <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chicagoinc/ct-firtash-0917-chicago-inc-20170915-story.html">His buddy Firtash was also wiretapped, reportedly <strong>thousands</strong> of intercepts</a></p>

<p>2) <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/paul-manafort-search-fbi-russian-interference/index.html">This is likely why he got FBI raided, they knew he was lying.</a></p>

<p>3) Trump continued to talk to Manafort even into this year. AKA Trump is probably &quot;incidentally collected&quot; on tape. and if Mueller thinks that relevant to the investigation....tick tick tick.</p>

<p>4) <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-president-trumps-unsubstantiated-wiretapping-claims/story?id=46198888">This could help explain Trump&#39;s wiretapping claim, people in Trump Tower were wiretapped, not the location itself. </a></p>

<p>5) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-investigation.html">Mueller&#39;s team told Manafort to expect indictments.</a> (I wonder why?)</p>

<p>6) They managed to renew the FISA. What caused that is likely going to be key. Was it the investigation into the dossier? Was it intercepts of RU or someone else implicating Manafort involvement? Would need to be something solid for it to be renewed specifically for the RU interference in the election. </p>

<p>7) Manafort also regularly talked to Pence. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/paul-manafort-is-back-and-advising-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks">“I think he’s weighing in on everything,” the former official said, “I think he still talks to Trump every day. I mean, Pence? That was all Manafort. Pence is on the phone with Manafort regularly.”&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign</p>

<p>Manafort was ousted from the campaign in August. By then the FBI had noticed what counterintelligence agents thought was a series of odd connections between Trump associates and Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny how that works huh? </p>

<p>Back when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/carter-page-fisa-warrant-russia-trump.html?mcubz=0">Page was found to be wiretapped</a> I thought it was unlikely he was the only one. Now we have Manafort confirmed. Do we really think that is where the tapes end? I certainly don&#39;t. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc">My Wiki on TrumpRussia</a> is a bit behind now (trying my best to get it caught up this week) but there&#39;s one thing that has continued to be true, which is everything tends to look worse for Trump and the rest of team treason as time goes on. Also the key people named in the dossier tend to continue to pop up in the investigation. They managed to renew the FISA&#39;s on Page and Manafort likely off the back of some of the investigation the FBI was doing into the dossier.</p>

<p>Money laundering. Go spend a few hours researching how real estate has been used to launder Russian oligarch money. </p>

<p>The Qatari government was named by The New York Times as &quot;the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings&quot;, having reportedly made a $14.8 million, four-year contribution in 2013. A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said &quot;he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers&quot;.</p>

<p>You have no point regarding Qatar.  You&#39;re trying to create your own fake news.</p>

<p>&quot;Brookings states that its staff &quot;represent diverse points of view&quot; and describes itself as non-partisan,[1][15] and the media sometimes describes Brookings as either &quot;conservative&quot;,[16] &quot;centrist&quot;[17] or &quot;liberal.&quot;</p>

<p>Perfect. So which of the Brookings&#39; major donors is the most right-wing, and which is the most left-wing? Which contributes the majority of funds?</p>
