       Riiight because Obama directed the FBI to investigate Manafort in 2014 because he's a psychic and knew Trump would run two years later and pick Manafort to head his campaign.

       I was doing my investigation in this topic and I couldn't find a end date for the first tap. The first wiretapping FICA warrant was in 2014 and ended somewhere in 2016 and was not renewed due to his campaign involvement. August 2016, after he left the campaign the second FICA was issued. If anyone knows when the first ended it would be appreciated.

       Did you know that the san bernadino shooter was investigated many times and each was dropped? Yet, he still committed a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surveying someone, then stopping, does not mean that the investigation has concluded. it means the surveying has stopped for whatever reason but the investigation could still be on going. Whats more, that person can still commit a crime even while being investigated for said crime, its happened.

       seriously doubt obama knew a damn thing about it until after it broke, it was a small operation inside the ATF, holder should have know but again ATF keeps to themselves and might have purposefully kept it hidden or just didn't bother telling him to make someone look bad, or could have been some shady dealings with ATF and cartels or gun stores themselves to run guns.  it was later found that a handful of gun stores in AZ and NM close to the border were dealing large shipments to straw purchasers running south of the border with zero oversite as to why these people were making multiple large purchases on a regular basis, why wasn't the ATF on these guys at all?. none of this was investigated properly IMO.

       Do you feel that it is normal? Do you believe that a Senator (who's a foreign lobbyist) on a lesser committee in the Senate would hold as much power/sway with the President as his NSA Chief or Campaign Manager? Or, does it not matter and all positions are considered the same in your eyes regardless of their stature within the Government?

       Ask yourself, who's the biggest threat? 
A.) The media that projects downwards hatred to the masses?
B.) The Corrupt alphabet agencies who operate outside the constitution with no regard?
C.) The "representatives" who we "elect" to sign us up for endless wars and mounds of debt all while attempting to strip away our rights?
D.) The dumbfucK shills who attempt to control what you think? Who impede on your freedom of thought?
E.) All of the suck dick but you MUST chose one

       Why can't we choose all of them? I think most of the people in the media are really just brainwashed/so deep in an echo bubble they genuinely believe most of the stuff they're saying, they just don't think to question the people who give them informationa and 'official' statements, because they think they're their peers. So while the media being so appalling is a big threat, I do think there's hope that if enough journalists get burst out of that bubble and realise what's really going on, then they could help change things.

       Since when is the CIA known for leaking? Your claim has no basis. Perhaps you could back up what you're claiming, by explaining why you think the CIA would leak that. It's an assumption no one else is making but you.

       The HRC email investigation has taken longer and has less moving parts than this investigation. FBI investigations take years. HRC email investigation was 3 years + the multiple congressional investigations.

       People claiming that its something so simple that it wouldve been released by now are just naive. If you have the criminal case of the century, why would you rush the result? The case needs to be rock solid with lots of evidence. Evidence takes time to gather.

       This spin is hilarious. They tapped Manafort who happened to live in trump tower. The tap started in 2014, before anybody knew Trump would run and pick a possible criminal to head his campaign. This had nothing to do with Trump. I hear an indictment is coming soon for Manafort so I understand why you guys are all freaking the fuck out and trying to spin this.

       William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.”

        A former Soviet counter-intelligence officer accompanied the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton during the presidential race, according to a report.

        Thanks to the Panama Papers, we know that the Podesta Group (founded by John Podesta’s brother, Tony) lobbied for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank. “Sberbank is the Kremlin, they don’t do anything major without Putin’s go-ahead, and they don’t tell him ‘no’ either,” explained a retired senior U.S. intelligence official.

       This is like saying Obama and Trump worked together because they both worked for the same institution at different times - Podesta worked for the biggest lobbying firm in the US, so did Manafort - that doesn't make them partners or even close to it.

       Yes, TONY Podesta's firm, John Podesta worked for the firm in the 80's and 90's - connecting him to Manafort is nonsense. And Tony Podesta working with Manafort is relevant how?

       What association did John Podesta have other than being part of the firm in the 90s? And it wasn't just Manafort - Flynn, Page, Trump Jr, Trump hiding his tax returns and his business ties to Russia are all red flags.

        As Russian interests gradually took control of Uranium One millions of dollars were donated to the Clinton Foundation between 2009 and 2013 from individuals directly connected to the deal including the Chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer. Although Mrs Clinton had an agreement with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors to the Clinton Foundation, the contributions from the Chairman of Uranium One were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons.

       Where is the lie? They didn't disclose the source - just like Trump doesn't disclose his taxes to hide the Russian money. Both are corrupt and hiding something, what's worse in Trump's case is that he is selling off the country to Russians to get his 'loans' taken care of.

       If you honestly think that Russia is the same as the Soviet Union then I wouldn't want to waste my time (which I am charged in).
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has a market economy, their citizens have free speech and no travel restrictions, the geographical differences are staggering, they have elections (even though those are definitely rigged).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Slovakia and the Czech Republic are also the Soviet Union? What about Ukraine and Moldova? Is the fact that the they all split up and have different governments and territories just a "distinction without a difference"?

       Yo're totally spinning it, changing the facts of both Trump's accusation and Manafort's FBI tap.

       Manafort is a crooked man. That's why he was tapped. Even his daughters were recorded saying that they knew their father was getting blood money.

       Russian spies did not cause Trump to win the election. If you believe that the. You're living in an alternate reality. The Democrats disastrous campaign, which elevated the worst candidate to ever run for president, is what lost them the campaign. It's amazing how people are so bent out of shape that Trump is president that they will believe ANYTHING to get him out of office. Even if it means a complete denial of logic.

       You do live in an alternate universe. Comey did not lose her the election. Her own careless actions and TERRIBLE track record as a politician lost her the election. And stealing the Democratic nomination from the rightful winner didn't help her cause.

       Because you're literally just spouting the exact narrative that has been fed to us by every major news network since way back when Wikileaks released the DNC emails revealing what corrupt pieces of shit the Democratic Party leadership are. The Russian narrative was made up as nothing more than damage control for their sorry asses, and amazingly, a bunch of naive people who still believe the Democrats give a shit about them, have fallen for it.

       expecting people to be agreeing with the establishment and the mainstream media, and when called out for this, you turn to pointing at the fact we discuss an actual anti-establishment topic as proof that the real users are the shills.

       Well in all fairness manafort and his buddys Yanukovych and Putin are corrupt and stole millions from the Ukrainian people. Definitely a guy who should probably be monitored, and extradited to Ukraine to face trial. He is likely a corrupt thief, the type of people we should be against, and hoping for justice to be served if he is guilty of his crimes in Ukraine.

       I'm certainly not a fan of foreign countries owning large portions of any of our industries, but it's crazy how this story has been twisted and manipulated for political ends. If the story is bad enough to stand on its own, it shouldn't need to be exaggerated every time it is told.

       It's funny you are getting tangled up in the words legally/illegally.  It was a f'n FISA warrant which was basically setup to bypass regular legal court proceedings.  If the constitution still matters, warrants issued by FISA aren't even legal in the first place.

       No, that article doesn't say that at all, it says Podesta worked for a lobbyist firm (the biggest) which worked for an Ukrainian group and Manafort also worked for that group, that's not same as working together or even knowing each other.

       There is enough partisan bullshittery in here all the time, I know you've probably got a kick out of it but you're like a drop in the bucket of that exact same comment  but replace the punchline with: The_Donald, Politics, EnoughTrumpSpam, Conservative, Far Right, TopMindsofReddit. You're just bogging the sub down with this banal repeat. I do hope you came across it organically, because it'd be fairly lame and low effort to just copy it again.

       Because the words that he used don't have an ambiguous meaning. So either he meant what he said or he doesn't understand how the English language works. Or it is possible that he just doesn't care if he is right and is only trying to rile up his base.

       No none of it is lining up. You can theorize all you want but Trumps tweet was wrong. Trump wasn't wiretapped, manafort was. If Trump is upset about conversations he had with Manafort being picked up maybe he shouldn't have picked a guy as objectively corrupt as Manafort to work on his campaign

       This is true, but Manafort was hardly the only person wiretapped last fall. Rand Paul said he also had information that he was tapped as well.

       No I'm not. If I'm wrong don't you think the actual president of the United States would be actually putting in time and effort to bring the people to justice for authorizing illegal wiretaps? Also manafort was being tapped before he was on the campaign so unless the feds can see the future they weren't going after Trump. Trump hired a prety nefarious dude and then is surprised Manafort was being investigated by the fbi for doing nefarious shut

       I agree with that, but that doesn't mean he didn't overstep the bounds of the wiretap on purpose and use it to unmask people on the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't say it was illegal in the original tweet. He asked if it was legal.

       Unmask people on the campaign? How are they supposed to know who Manafort is if they don't unmask them. The simple fact that they had ro unmask anybody shows they weren't plotting against Trump. If they don't know who they people are how do you plot against them? Even Republicans have come out and said nothing Susan Rice did was illegal. She literally was just doing her job on dealing with the wiretap placed on Manafort

Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!

       Gotta love this sub - some guy come in here and makes all sorts of claims about Trump's lying. Except that guy himself is lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       No DOJ ever came out and said "Trump was not wiretapped": the notion is absurd that the DoJ (Department of Justice) would ever make a comment about such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, Trump doesn't "have" a DOJ, the DoJ (Department of Justice) is a wholly separate department, independent of the Office of the President of the United State of America.

       Just like Obama didn't "have" an FBI, so he can't just whimsically order a tap on Trump, which is why the current president was talking out of his arse.

       Trump does have a DOJ,  Jeff Sessions is the head of it, he was appointed by Donald Trump.

       Placing you on ignore. No such thing as DOJ, and the DoJ (Department of Justice) is an an independent department that doesn't consult, ever, with anyone not in that dep't.

       Here is a tweet that came after the original "wires tapped" claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess you could do some mental gymnastics and say "my wires" involves the literal wires going to every private citizen in his building. However, he then said "my phones". He
       <em>
        certainly
       </em>
       doesn't own all the phones of his renters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and I both know he meant Obama was spying on
       <em>
        him personally
       </em>
       . Not someone who happened to live at Trump Tower. Regardless, this is all moot since Trump already blew his load by claiming he was referring to the unmasking; not a literal wiretap.

       Better yet, his own department of justice eventually released an official statement that said there was no evidence to support Trumps claim. His own DoJ said that, but people still think he's been vindicated. The only amazing part of this story to me is how Trump supporters took a decidedly negative story about their candidate and so amazingly fast turned it around into proof that he was right.

       Not that they didn't find anything, but that they didn't find anything that resulted in charges. That doesn't mean he didn't do anything suspicious. He then started communicating with a known Russian spy in 2016. Given his previous record, that was why they reopened the investigation.
       <br/>
       And just because I know what is coming, closing a previous investigation doesn't mean that someone isn't a criminal or won't be. The Pulse Nightclub shooter was investigated by the FBI on suspicions of being radicalized. They found nothing at the time and closed the investigation.

       The Pulse nightclub shooter was an example to show how charges don't always come up after an investigation, but shit can go down regardless.
       <br/>
       The difference is that they might find suspicious communications and suspicious activity that raises red flags, but important information is missing and they can't prove a link, if that information was relayed in person, for instance. The red flags didn't prove anything illegal and so they would have to close the investigation without charges being filed, while suspecting there is more.

       Per my understanding, Rinat Akhmetshin is well-established to have been a member of Soviet intelligence and is believed to have worked for Russian intelligence after the fall. US intelligence is pretty adamant that he is involved with Russian intelligence. As for Fusion GPS, everything I've read is that the dossier was the result of Republican opposition work during the primaries. Nor is it unusual for someone to work in different industries. Nor was he paid to associate with Trump. Nothing I've seen indicates that he worked on the dossier and the dossier didn't involve associating with Trump at all, but collecting information from disparate parties.

        Fusion GPS, headed by a former Wall Street Journal journalist known for his dogged reporting, Glenn Simpson, most often works for business clients. But in presidential elections, the firm is sometimes hired by candidates, party organizations or donors to do political “oppo” work — shorthand for opposition research — on the side.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It is routine work and ordinarily involves creating a big, searchable database of public information: past news reports, documents from lawsuits and other relevant data. For months, Fusion GPS gathered the documents and put together the files from Mr. Trump’s past in business and entertainment, a rich target.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring, the Republican interest in financing the effort ended. But Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton were very interested, and Fusion GPS kept doing the same deep dives, but on behalf of new clients.

       I have no idea who knew him, but I'd imagine their communications with him were also recorded. My guess is those communications weren't suspicious enough to warrant a wiretap. I'd say it is safe to assume that Comey would have avoided communications/meeting with him as much as possible.

       If you want to take everything I say as exact, then yes, I contradicted myself. The world of politics is small and everyone knows who everyone else is. Do they all know each other intimately and engage on a regular basis? Unlikely.
       <br/>
       And that's fine. That's normal political work. The fact is that he is a former spy, who is believed to still be a spy, who met with and communicated with Manafort after Manafort was already known to have Russian contacts that raised red flags.

       They were also spying on him
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       he was campaign manager though too. The wiretaps go all the back to 2014, and in Trump's own words "He was with the campaign, as you know, for a very short period of time, relatively short period of time." So they've been wiretapping Manafort for much longer than he has been with the campaign. And they were doing so legally, even if you think the FISA warrants were garbage. So instead of using any biases to spin this in any direction, why not just stick to the facts?

       Because I agree with what you've said, I just also think that it is important that they WERE wiretapping the man who WAS Trump's campaign manager, before AND during the campaign, and flat out denied there was ANY wiretapping going on. Not to mention Manafort was never charged with anything which without more information (which I'm sure will come just slowly), lends a LOT of credence to Trump's accusation of political abuse of power.

       I'm trying to keep an open mind with this because it is possible these wiretaps were used beyond the extent they were intended for. But we can pretty safely assume they weren't originally requested and approved for political reasons because the timeline shows they were in place well before Manafort had any connection with a presidential campaign.

       They didnt deny it. FISA warrants arent something we regularly tell the public about. Should we give out secrets and classified intel instantly or do an investigation and report on it so we can disclose the right information tot he public? Thats whats going on now. Susan Rice told congress about the FISA warrants with flynn. These are just now coming out about manafort. Idiots think that because there is not instant disclosure of every fact the second they want it, there is some cover up. Chill out homes. Republican congress will cause a stink about any perceive impropriety, so you get you visiblity.

       So what you are saying is that I am right? Clapper and Rice did explain the Fisa warrants in public and in congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats your beef then? They legally complied with the FISA warrants and that is corroborated with congress. If they legally complied with the warrants , a judge signed off, and congress investigated them, there is no misdeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting that they re-opened the FISA warrant for manafort only for purely political purposes on DJT? And is that your feeling or a fact?

       I'm saying the exact opposite. My beef is that they said the opposite until they got found out. I'm not accusing Obama of grand le Watergate 2.0 I'm just not rationalizing the deceit regarding the wiretapping.

       So should they disclose all secret surveillance whenever asked by random citizens? So you are upset with the way FISA works or what? Should we revise FISA so its a completely public transparent process?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know they dont make it a habit of telling everyone at the drop of a hat what secret surveillance they are doing? It defeats the purpose of secret surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point did they deny it? Trump claims he was wiretapped, he was not and thus the denial. There was no denial about manafort or flynn, unless you have proof?

      <p>
       Incidental collection is not wiretapping and any parsed words around the FISA warrant is strictly because of the sensitive nature of the program.

       lol funny you mention word play, because thats very important for legal matters. a words meaning has alot of significance. There is major difference between incidential collection and someone illegally wiretapping them. This is why people parse words on this subject that lead to your perceived deceit.

       So in the interview you can hear clapper say to his knowledge and that he has no idea of the other agencies. Its not a denial. Its anecdotal evidence by clapper that he has not done any or seen any. Thats not the Obama administration, thats a single guy reporting from his post who didnt even oversee the matters pertaining to the counter intelligence investigation. You can misconstrue that as OBAMA himself claiming there was no illegal wiretapping all you want but that is just your feels.

       Yes, in 2014 a warrant was obtained for Manafort well before the candidacy of Trump. Yes, Trump may have gotten some of his phone calls swept up into that surveillance. Don't hire someone under investigation and then act like you were being investigated because you hired poorly.

       Obama isn't the FBI, and Manafort was involved in crooked activity, so, no, Trump's accusation is still "unproven."

       He has done more than exaggerated. Instead, when it comes to the whole Russia story, Trump has lied about a number of things, from his campaign meeting with the Russians, which he called "fake news" when it turned out to be true, and his business investments in Russia, claiming that he didn't have any at all when his lawyers said he has at least $100 million worth.

      <p>
       The recent story is about Paul Manafort getting wiretapped by the FBI for his activity in the Ukraine. Now, while this may tie into the Trump scandal. it's different than Trump's broad claim that Obama was wiretapping Trump, which would be a totally different situation, especially if Obama had personally ordered the FBI to target Trump for political reasons (which doesn't seem to be the case at all).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, nothing is being clarified here, except that Manafort is part of an ongoing federal investigation dating back to 2014.

       That only shows issues with one particular statement from Obama. It doesn't how where he said "you can keep your doctor" or how ObamaCare is forcing people to change doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the original statement that people has disputed is, "If you like your health care, you can keep it."

       Not really. While no presidency has been 100% honest, most of them don't lie just to lie. Instead, they usually lie when it matters the most or when it's strategic to lie or when they can afford the political capital to lie.

       Nothing about that was a lie. ObamaCare doesn't have requirements that force people to leave their doctors as the bill's opponents claimed. That being said, ObamaCare also can't control if someone's private insurance plan forces them to change doctors or to drop coverage altogether, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you're bringing up Mitt Romney now and I don't where you're getting your quotes since you've provided no sources and no contexts. For example, are you trying to claim that seven million Americans haven't been enrolled in Medicaid, or are you trying to say that the quoted figure is too low? And who claimed the seven million Medicaid figure in the first place?

       IF anyone "lost" their doctor due to ObamaCare, and you haven't provided anything to back up your argument here, it wasn't due to ObamaCare itself forcing them to change doctors.

       Totally different situation. TrumpCare is reducing spending to programs that will directly lead to states (pertaining to Medicaid) kicking millions of people off the rolls,
       <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-24/cbo-score-23-million-lose-coverage-under-american-health-care-act-deficit-trimmed-119-billion">
        according to the CBO and one of the TrumpCare versions

       . There is a direct correlation here.

       Let's get this straight: Trump said that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mcN0zweQE">
        he was "going to take care of everybody"
       </a>
       when it came to health care, and now he has totally flip-flopped on this campaign promise -- and you're defending him for it while trying to attack Obama for a "lie" when you didn't even get Obama's quite right in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're still making a poor equivocation because it's about coverage, not, doctors. That's what you don't get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any cut in Medicaid, or SCHIP, or Medicare funding has direct effects. That's one of the principle issues with TrumpCare.

       Thanks for responding. I disagree with you on a bunch of stuff but I always appreciate a fleshed out conversation.
      </p>

       Obama administration: over the past year or so I have experienced quite the opposite. I do not trust a word from them. For me, that started back with Edward Snowden and the NSA lies but over time there have been an ASTOUNDING number of discrepancies between what they've said and what has actually happened. Eric Holder, Benghazi, now Loretta Lynch, tons of lying going in IMO.
      </p>

       I think the "more every week" speaks to both of our media's biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the Russia meetings and investments, I have yet to see ANY proof that ANY of that was actually relevant past the witch hunt. To me it has seemed since the election that the CNNs and the DNC have been conflating Trump's business career with his political  career and making a fuss out of (gigantic international) business as usual. Looking for crossed i's and dotted t's.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You don't lie that much unless you have something to hide" that right there is confirmation bias. Where there's smoke, there may be fire, but when all the smoke is coming from the opposition party and media, I'd definitely wait to see a flame before I panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort: it's amazing to me how differently both sides see this. We have the exact same facts but draw nearly opposite reactions based on the part we see as most important. You see it as more evidence of criminality in the Trump campaign and I see it as more evidence of govt abuse of power. Scott Adams writes about this, the "two movies on one screen" phenomenon.

       Trump had a series of tweet about Obama illegally wiretapping him because he was running for president. That is still untrue. And the "this is like Watergate" approach Trump took is why he was mocked for it. That and the fact that he brought it up via a series of early morning tweets, like an angsty teenager.

      </p>
      <p>
       Donald whines on Twitter, exaggerates (WATERGATE 2.0!)
      </p>
      <p>
       The media and Democrats completely and totally dismiss him, point and laugh at "crazy" Donald
      </p>
      <p>
       Months later, the courts finally spit out information, in this case, most certainly NOT confirming Watergate 2.0, but DEFINITELY confirming the flat out denial of wiretapping to be misleading or a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media has to explain more details and or backtrack, Donald can claim an (exaggerated again) vindication to his camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Donald tweets Sunday morning memes while the whole world clutches their tendies.

       Sure. But it doesn't really matter if they buy the no or not. The FBI or whoever probably don't give a shit if the general public knows exactly who is being investigated. It's certainly in their best interest for the individuals being investigated to not think they are.

       Many people seem to think that if they ask the FBI if they've been wiretapped, the FBI is going to answer honestly. They have no incentive to do that and people certainly shouldn't be surprised when they're lied to about it.

       Why not? Is it not surprising that Trump was correct in his assessment? Is it not surprising that the head of Trump's campaign would be wiretapped?

       Seems strange that you're trying to dictate what our expectations of government should be. Of course I don't think the FBI should come out and tell people they're being investigated, but I also think that when that shit gets found out... people are gonna be surprised.

       With knowledge about Manafort now, no, it's not surprising to hear that he was being investigated.

       It's Trump that has to keep going back and revising history. First it was "wires tapped". Then he tried to claim that unmasking and incidental collection is what he meant by "wires tapped". Now he's back to claiming actual wiretapping and trying to use Manafort as a proxy. No, it's still not true.

       The government was wiretapping a person who wasn't Trump. If that person calls Trump, they are still only wiretapping that person. If Trump calls someone who is wiretapped, that does not make Trump wiretapped.

       This is such a stupid conspiracy theory. If Obama was doing unethical things to spy on Trump, why wouldn't he just spy on Trump? An unethical president doesn't even need a warrant. He just needs to instruct someone to do it off the books. The reason it came from the FISA court and has a record is because it's not what you are making it into.

       The conspiracy theory is that Obama targeted Trump during the campaign. The fact is that Manafort was a target, and he was a target even before Trump announced his campaign. I explained how this doesn't constitute Trump being wiretapped. You can't seem to dispute that. It's amazing how people are ignoring the
       <em>
        actual

       conspiracy here.

      <p>
       That's as accurate as the truck of lies he and his whole administration have told about Russia connections. Over and over and over and over again. And not just lies to the media, but lies on forms to get security clearance, lies on the forms to correct the lies on the forms you originally submitted. Lies, lies, lies. Its all we get out of these clowns.

       How do people fall for blatant, repeated,

       lies. They are admitting them. Wtf does it take to call a lie a lie?

       Fair enough. Who would you say is regarded cleaner, Trump or Obama? And who would you say is

       cleaner? (Illuminati aspects aside)

         I can't possibly have an opinion on who is technically cleaner as I don't, and never will know everything about them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That's far too subjective, for example Obama might do something I regard as clean that someone else might see as scummy.

       </li>
       <li>

         My gut feeling is that the vast majority of politicians
         <em>
          aren't
         </em>
         clean (who is), and that if there is any dirt on someone, there is likely a lot more additional dirt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The way people see things comes into this, as Trump/Obama being unpopular/popular doesn't necessarily mean he is dirty/clean. Yet of course mr. unpopular will be seen as more dirty by virtue of people strongly disagreeing with his opinions (regardless of whether there is real dirt).

       Oh I see you're neutral. I'm not trying to bait you. I just find threads like these amazing, because people have the same logic and the same reasoning but it's a 50/50 split on who they're referring to.this Manafort stuff, while I lean Trump, it looks like somehow both sides see the same facts as a win for themselves.

       I wouldn't say fishing but definitely cutting to the chase, know what I mean. It's hard to tell why people have the views they have when you can agree logically but find out later you're staunchly opposed on the facts. Plus the shill level in this thread is crazy

       So at the risk of getting downvoted hard, I'll lend some potential insight as to why that happens here, at least for me. On Reddit there are strong political opinions, and I have one. There's r/politics, that is decidedly liberal and while Trump supporters can participate, they are often downvoted heavily though so their points aren't seen by the masses. Then there's the_donald, where ONLY pro Trump comments are allowed. The very first comment I made there got me perma banned many months ago. I still read it daily and get frustrated at what I see as decidedly incorrect information. The latest example is that the CNN story vindicated Trumps claim that he himself was wiretapped illegally. To me, the story does not at all vindicate Trump, and if in fact does the exact opposite. It says that Manafort, not Trump, was tapped and it says that the tapping came over a year before Manafort came on as campaign manager, removing the implication that it was politically motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       That brings us to r/conspiracy, which has a healthy mix of both left and right politics, and both sides are free to argue their points. I think a lot of people on the left see this subreddit as the only way to productively engage with supporters on the other side, and so you see what you see here. It's not shilling, it's just that by deduction this is where people go. To me, people complaining about shilling are just upset that their echo chambers aren't being applied to all of Reddit. I'd say that if the community doesn't like the back and forth politics discussion then moderators would have to make policy changes to not allow it. Unfortunately for r/conspiracy, there just isn't another good place to actually engage with each other.

       You misinterpreted my comment. I don't care that the_donald is a self proclaimed echo and propaganda center. That's their prerogative. I'm just saying that r/conspiracy is the best place on Reddit to engage with Trump supporters without getting banned.

       You seem to misunderstand. The sub isn't organically "not neutral", it is enforced and anything positive about Trump and negative about the opposition is removed instantly. There used to be a website late last year about the most removed and downvoted stuff on reddit, and it was clearly organized and botted to remove any negative articles about H.Clinton. Then reddit made it not work anymore, like it does to all sites showing this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like going to a club where all the people are robots wearing human skinsuits. That's what politics has been like since late 2016.

       stupid lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fisa reinstated because they met with a russian spy working to undo the magnitsky act. This would be the case if anyone met with someone who was marked as a russian spy, since they always record russian spies. Without looking at the FISA, there could be a good reason to re-open the warrant. Remember that the san bernadino shooter was wire tapped and investigated many times, each time dropped. Does not mean a crime wasnt committed or that they should never re-open investigation should the offended behavior come up again.
      </p>
      <p>
       said spy(veselnitskaya) was allowed into the country without a visa by the DOJ, not obama. Its important because she was to be there as a lawyer representing a case.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Veselnitskaya's application for a visa to travel to the U.S. to work on the case was denied, she said in a later court filing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, the Department of Justice granted Katsyv and Veselnitskaya immigration parole. In later arguments before a federal judge, a government attorney described immigration parole as "a discretionary act that the statute allows the attorney general to do in extraordinary circumstances."

       Everyone is "wire tapped."

       William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.”

       In all honesty this propaganda campaign should be treated as act of treason. allll the shills, alllll the media, all the corrupt politicians, all the fucked "Intelligence" agencies.... All these fucktards deserve to be executed for treason.

       Ask yourself, who's the biggest threat? 
A.) The media that projects downwards hatred to the masses?
B.) The Corrupt alphabet agencies who operate outside the constitution with no regard?
C.) The "representatives" who we "elect" to sign us up for endless wars and mounds of debt all while attempting to strip away our rights?
D.) The dumbfucK shills who attempt to control what you think? Who impede on your freedom of thought?
E.) All of the suck dick but you MUST chose one

       This has just began, and it wouldn't even exist if Trump hadn't fired Comey. Steve Bannon even admitted that firing Comey was the biggest political mistake in modern history.

       It's funny you are getting tangled up in the words legally/illegally.  It was a f'n FISA warrant which was basically setup to bypass regular legal court proceedings.  If the constitution still matters, warrants issued by FISA aren't even legal in the first place.

       Russian spies did not cause Trump to win the election. If you believe that the. You're living in an alternate reality. The Democrats disastrous campaign, which elevated the worst candidate to ever run for president, is what lost them the campaign. It's amazing how people are so bent out of shape that Trump is president that they will believe ANYTHING to get him out of office. Even if it means a complete denial of logic.

       People claiming that its something so simple that it wouldve been released by now are just naive. If you have the criminal case of the century, why would you rush the result? The case needs to be rock solid with lots of evidence. Evidence takes time to gather.

       It isn't a conspiracy theory, it's a fact that you have even stated. You're adding a bunch of strawman stuff and calling it a stupid conspiracy theory, on r/conspiracy.

       lol funny you mention word play, because thats very important for legal matters. a words meaning has alot of significance. There is major difference between incidential collection and someone illegally wiretapping them. This is why people parse words on this subject that lead to your perceived deceit.

       So in the interview you can hear clapper say to his knowledge and that he has no idea of the other agencies. Its not a denial. Its anecdotal evidence by clapper that he has not done any or seen any. Thats not the Obama administration, thats a single guy reporting from his post who didnt even oversee the matters pertaining to the counter intelligence investigation. You can misconstrue that as OBAMA himself claiming there was no illegal wiretapping all you want but that is just your feels.

       thanks for that. I was wondering how the spin of "he wasn't actually wiretapped" was gonna be explained now. I look forward to CNN pushing this technicality point now.

       No he didn't. He just claimed that those warrants are illegal but didn't explain why they are.

       How do you know it was a loan that was paid back? Trump only said they got the funding, it never said on what terms.

       Where is the lie? They didn't disclose the source - just like Trump doesn't disclose his taxes to hide the Russian money. Both are corrupt and hiding something, what's worse in Trump's case is that he is selling off the country to Russians to get his 'loans' taken care of.
