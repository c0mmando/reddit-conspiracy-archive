       I mean, they spent 20+ years serving in the military to earn $250k per year. To do so, many of them had to be away from home and make sacrifices of of us don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as they are doing nothing illegal, i don't see why they need to be punished because some of them are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're outraged over someone serving their country for 20+ years to earn $250k, yet it's okay for celebrities and entrepreneurs to earn way more than this for way less. Okay.

       Tge military causes incredible harm in the wirld and is systemically corrupt.  250K per year without working is incredibly lucrative.  Its not bad actors, its an entire system of generals lobbying and making the system worse.  Dont like it dont join

       Dude what part of public service dont you get?  No one has a right to be a general.  There arr a million other jobs out there.  The harm a bad general can cause far outweighs the role of a good general.  Our public institutions have to be protected against specifically the worst case.  Thats the price of having them.  There's a whole private sector for people who aren't willing to pay yhe price to ensure the public good

       You keep talking about the right to be a general. Nobody has the right to be a general.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this isn't about the good of one general outweighing the bad of another. To me, it's about the good of all good generals outweighing the bad of the bad generals, and not penalizing good people because of the bad. It's really that simple.

       It's not a penalty.  Rules prevent Congresspeople from receiving gifts isn't a penalty on the good because of the bad.  It's a position of public trust and demands sacrifices so the system can prosper and work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hardly a punishment to set up people who willing chose to become a prestigious military leader with a lucrative lifetime pension above and beyond the average salary (like top 10% level).
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the corruption, giving wall street jobs to generals after their careers as rewards for being corrupt, it's killing America and the world.

       I don't disagree about those that know of corruption not doing anything about it being bad. I'm saying it's supremely unfair to claim that 100% of officers are corrupt or bad. That's a genuinely ridiculous statement that you absolutely can't back up.

       Are there corrupt officers in the military?  Yes.  Every single officer who hasn't publicly spoken out about them is therefore also corrupt, and I'm pretty sure that's almost 100% of them.

       You realize the sheer number of officers in the military? Amongst every branch? 100% of them? You really think entry level officers straight out of school or ROTC are fucking corrupt? You really think the majority of low ranking officers have enough authority or power to be corrupt? If the answers to either of these questions are yes, then I'm sorry, you're either trolling, retarded, or fucking delusional.

       Did I hit a little close to home?

       The first time an officer sees another officer doing anything corrupt and fails to take action they're corrupt too.  Considering the rampant systematic corruption that exists in the armed forces I'm comfortable in saying that's close enough to 100% of officers as to make no difference.

       Claiming that 100% of officers in the military are corrupt is statistically unlikely and the fact you can't see that anyone with a basic understanding of statistics (or common sense) will think you're a lunatic for trying to claim this, does nothing but diminish your argument and destroy any credibility you have on the subject.

       The difference is our definition of corruption.

       In any case, fuck the military.  Nobody joins the military unless they're psychopaths or terminally stupid.

       Oh okay, you're making up your own definition of corruption and using to argue a point with someone using the ACTUAL definition of corruption and acting like I'm in the wrong. Okay, got it. Delusional.
