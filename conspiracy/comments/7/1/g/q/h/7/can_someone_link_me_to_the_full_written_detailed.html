    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have it timestamped, but Andrew Basiago has talked about it quite a bit in various lectures he&#39;s done.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlUNImaBIxs">Here&#39;s one of the most comprehensive lectures he&#39;s given.</a>  It&#39;s seven and a half hours long, so I&#39;d say watch it in parts.  He&#39;s mentioned that he, Barak Obama (who he says was named Barry Soetoro at the time and is how he knows him), Regina E. Dugan, Brett Stillings, and Bernard Mendez were all in a project together where they were involved in various jumps they did to the planet Mars.</p>

<p>The main jump room where Basiago says they teleported from is at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@33.930937,-118.3962719,3a,75y,217.72h,104.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOXfBNOye17rxLAIdpESpmw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">999 North Sepulveda in El Segundo, California</a>...on the 9th floor, I believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been there.</p>

<p>The first time I heard Basiago talk about the location, I said...wait a minute...that&#39;s driving distance from me.  I can go check it out and investigate myself.</p>

<p>So I did just that.  I took down the information he gave in the lecture I was listening to, and went there myself to investigate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a nice building.  I think it&#39;s some corporate video game making building now or something.  Anyway, I went inside the building, got in the elevator, and went to the specific floor he said he jumped from.  I think it was the 9th or something (don&#39;t specifically remember right this moment).  The elevator door opened, and what I believe I remember seeing was just a corporate office hallway at that point.  Nothing really fancy.</p>

<p>It was interesting to just be there, however, as Basiago said that this was one of the main places that a jump room to Mars and to different time periods on Earth was located.</p>

<p>Very fascinating stuff to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>was there ever a mention of extra-terrestrial military personnel on Mars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basiago mentioned the very thing - yes - but two figures that <em>really</em> get into this particular subject in an even more in depth manner are Marine Captain Randy Cramer, and Tony Rodriguez.  Alana Kapulnik and Kevan Trimmell talk about their experiences here pretty deeply as well.  And, of course, Corey Goode discusses ET and human personnel on Mars.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say you confused different stories because there are various figures that are saying similar things.  It&#39;s easy to get a little lost in who&#39;s saying what because multiple people have been in similar programs and have gone through similar things as a result, so various people have experiences that are not wholly dissimilar to one another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what has regina dugan said about all this, if anything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zero.  Goose egg.  Nothing, nada, zip.</p>

<p>She&#39;s straight plugged in directly to the corporate system and is making a <em>lot</em> of money doing so, and she doesn&#39;t want to I imagine risk her public standing and her bank account, so she&#39;s kept her mouth shut, hasn&#39;t even addressed anything in this area, and has continued along her corporate timeline as if nothing happened.</p>

<p>This is quite similar to what Barry Soetoro/Barak Obama has done, if what Basiago is saying is true - and given how many long years and how many dozens of interviews and lectures Basiago has done saying <em>the exact same thing</em> in super great detail (without, I should add, detrimentally effecting his current practice as a licensed Washington attorney, mind you), I don&#39;t actually doubt that there&#39;s quite a lot of validity in what he&#39;s saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty easy actually.  Just walked in.  It&#39;s not like the place is a lock down Fort Knox type facility.  It&#39;s just a regular (though very nice) corporate office building.  I don&#39;t recall there being a front desk guard or anything like that.  It was actually kind of sparse and empty.  Don&#39;t remember too many if any people around - and those that were/might have been walking were just...going wherever they were going.  It wasn&#39;t like anybody was looking at me weird or strange or anything.</p>

<p>If I am to understand some of the things he’s said correctly, he and his father were deeply steeped in the goings on of a couple of different corporate entities - a very significant one of which was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_Corporation">The Ralph M. Parsons corporation</a>.  This is an engineering and development center that is particularly massive, connected, and overreaching enough to have “hidden in plain sight” locations that can be used for a variety of things.  Apparently one of the elevators at the Sepulveda building was used as a jump room.  Basiago mentions that there are various locations that have been used as such, but for whatever reason, this locale was I guess another spot for it as well.</p>

<p>The building would never be known by anyone as any sort of “jump room” location if one didn’t go in there knowing what to look for in the first place.  Heck, I went in there knowing what to look for and even to me it didn’t look like anything other than an average elevator in an average corporate building.</p>

<p>Basiago mentioned that some sort of technology was used whereby the elevator itself would…start spinning or something, and some sort of vortex or something would open up and they would be somewhere else.  I’m not doing it justice at all in this explanation, but the point I’m making is that it seems that what happened was dependent more upon the use of some technology that perhaps could have been (and likely was/is) used almost anywhere/wherever they wanted more than it was dependent upon any type of special place specifically designed for the activity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is quite possible as well.  yes.</p>

<p>Honestly, I actually doubt anyone will come in here with the specific place where Basiago mentions the Mars jump room activities and Obama, etc.  They are specific places in his lectures where he mentions them, and they are LOOONG lectures and interviews he generally has, so finding the specific moments where he mentions them is kind of needle in a haystack work that I doubt anyone will be willing to go through just to find those statements.</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s possible that someone in the next few days or so who reads this OP might possibly be listening to a Basiago lecture and come across him mentioning Obama and then decide to be decent enough to timestamp and link that moment on here...but honestly, I&#39;d personally say that&#39;s a pretty big long shot.</p>

<p>I know Basiago&#39;s mentioned Obama and his personal dealings with him only because I&#39;ve listened to <em>so</em> many of his lectures - so I know they&#39;re in there because, again, I heard him talking about it on various occasions.  However, even I&#39;m not willing to go back and scour through which area specifically Basiago said that in.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to just listen to almost any Basiago lecture (like, for example, the one I have in the comment I linked you), and you&#39;ll likely come across some mention of it.</p>
