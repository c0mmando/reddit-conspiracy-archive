       If someone only watched the news and never went outside, they would think everyone was murdering each other, kidnapping, raping, being racist, sexist, etc. Why is the world always on fire in the media?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why do they never talk about the biggest issue of all which is wealth inequality? This masses are getting poorer, fatter, dumber and dying earlier and all the media does it make it seem like we're all out to get each other.

       The short answer is that the media is all owned by about 6 huge corporations, all owned by billionaires.  Even twenty years ago, it wasn't as consolidated as it is now.  These billionaires do not care about the rest of humanity.  The view is much different from the top of the food chain.

       I was going to make this point, but from a little bit if a different angle.  If the media loves to fear monger, it's the stories that aren't heavily reported that always interests me.  For instance, the Awan story seems like it's straight out of a movie, but when MSM reports it, they leave out important aspects of the story and marginalize it.  Another examplr would be the US Diplomats that were attacked with a sound weapon in Haiti.  Although there were several event before that made me question these type event, the one that really got me thinking about it was the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack">
        San Jose Terrorist attack on the power grid
       </a>
       .  If you check sources on that wikipedia page, there is only one source from around the time of the attack, everything else is from 9 month and beyond.  No one was interested in that attack and it was ripe for the MSM.  Anyways, knowing the MSM loves sensational headlines, it's the stories they don't report that really interest me.

       Those sources.  Cutting social programs goes against everything the establishment stands for.  Obama spent 8 years defunding and fucking over our military.  Obama is establishment to the bone.  So again this would be going against the TPTB that were trying to make our military weak.  He's slashing taxes for everyone, once again something the establishment does not want.

       If the establishment loves Trump they are the best fucking actors in the world and are pure geniuses.  I've never seen a president attacked so viciously by the media, the entertainment industry, and shills.

       You wouldnt watch the news if it was all normal stuff like a nice person helping granny. 
You want to watch abnormal stuff, the same as I.  Youll follow a story twice as long if 100 people died vs 6 injured.

       I do not watch the news.  They have been caught faking and manipulating stories so many times.  Nobody I knows watches the news.  My parents, who watched the news for 50 years, stopped watching the news.  Reruns of Gilligan's island gets more viewers than CNN's top rated show.  Nobody watches the news.

       That's only half the story. Media companies need to appease both viewers and sponsors, and sponsors' interests trump viewers'. This means that thoughtful programs on the evils of corporations are dead in the water right off the bat.

       I say this all the time. They want to talk about wars, and sending aid to other countries. We need/should be using that money to help ourselves. There's a homeless epidemic and even people with full time jobs are going hungry. Why are we feeding other countries when people in ours can't even eat.

       They do, you just don't watch every news channel or read every information source. MSNBC talks about income inequality like everyday. Caring about income equality is a liberal concern in America, so it would make sense that sources of information that are considered "liberal" would discuss it, and they do. MSNBC and VICE regularly discuss these issues. Don't assume grand conspiracy theories and act like you have watched every news channel at every minute, that is a certain way to acquire an incorrect understanding of the "media". I can already tell you that you are asking this question in the wrong sub, you should ask it in a general sub where people actually consume information and news from the media. You asking this here, you are just going to get some circlejerk about the msm that is typical here. You are confirmation biasing your understanding by asking people who don't watch the media yet somehow magically know what every channel is discussing at all times.
