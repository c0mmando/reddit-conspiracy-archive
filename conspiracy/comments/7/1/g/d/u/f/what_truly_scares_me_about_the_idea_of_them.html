<blockquote>
<p>We live in a simulation in a sense that almost everything in our realities is manufactured. The news, most science, pretty much any type of information out there aimed at mass consumption is deliberate and meant to program you down specific paths.</p>

<p>Everybody has an opinion. But opinions are formed from someone&#39;s breadth of knowledge on any given subject. What happens when those breadths of knowledge are all bs and specifically set out for public consumption on TV, internet etc. We get programmed robots basically.</p>

<p>Everybody is living in a manufactured reality or simulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Basically, our entire reality and the way we view the world is already so damn shaped by the the elite who own and control pretty much all of the media we consume. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">This is a fact -- 90% of the media we consume is controlled by six corporations.</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s clear they don&#39;t want us thinking for ourselves. If enough people were awake to what is truly going on, they wouldn&#39;t be able to maintain their foothold on humanity.</p>

<p>This is why I believe the end goal of globalization and a one world government is to put chips in us and be able to literally fully control how we view the world and our realities. We will never be able to get in touch with our inner selves. I hope this never happens because if it does, 0.1% of the population will have basically enslaved humanity.</p>

It will be a tough choice since you won&#39;t be able to participate in the economy once this becomes the standard practice, when your belly is hungry people will line up to take a chip or accept their terms just to eat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be completely guessing, but I honestly believe America is the last stand against the NWO due to simply how many citizens we have who are armed to the teeth. This is why they want the guns so bad. &quot;Public safety&quot; is just the pretty excuse they give the public.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say they will wait for for the last generation of people who believe in the constitution to die off or get old and weak, and then they will take the guns, and then we will truly see the NWO take place. Do I sound insane lol?</p>

<p>I really believe that&#39;s the plan. Ask some of the youth today, most don&#39;t care much for rights like privacy and freedom, because their teaching in school now that these things are bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re already trying this with targeted individuals, I&#39;m in Iran and they&#39;ve already tried lot of things with me: sent suicidal, anger, anxious feelings, different voices to me or people around me, control of heart rate, speech, fake alien experiences, traumatic 3D dream, memory manipulation, faint images and/or sounds that seem like your own thoughts, different painful feelings that&#39;s heightened whenever I meditate or post online. </p>

<p>I found a group of TIs here that got invited by a member of Iranian parliament to speak with Iranian intelligence, when the group arrived to the address they found out they been given the address of a psychological assessment center and an intelligence member arrived with 2 of their doctors to refute anything we had to say and despite numerous times we&#39;ve reached out to government officials they all said they haven&#39;t heard anything about the subject we were there to talk about which is extremely fishy to me considering they knew in advance that they have to make us look crazy. </p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;m scared shitless about our future, no government is on our side and all of them work to further suppress us. Only thing that&#39;ll help us will be a collective effort and with this new global targeted individual program, don&#39;t even need to get into the really techy stuff, everyone&#39;s life is being conditioned with their cellphones, news, work and almost everything around them to not give a fuck about the bigger picture. </p>
