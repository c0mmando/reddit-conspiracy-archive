<p><strong>Venezuela begins pricing their Oil in Yuan instead of the Petrodollar. Watch carefully, this is major World event news!!!</strong></p>

<p>And now in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTf9RVUJzB8">his speech today to the U.N.</a> he is beating the war drums and trying to rally support from other countries.  They even applauded his speech about Venezuela.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I don&#39;t think you understand how bad it is over there. I don&#39;t think it can get worse than masses of people literally starving in the streets. Whatever the reason, over throwing this dictator will probably be a really good thing. They have a much better political culture and infrastructure than any of the Middle East countries, especially since they aren&#39;t a theocracy. Whatever the reason is for their gov getting overthrown will be an end justify the means situation for people who actually have to live there.</p>

<p>I think if you or your family was actually suffering you&#39;d be a lot less concerned about conspiracy and be just super happy that something might actually change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only that what the media tells doesn&#39;t capture the entire story. It doesn&#39;t capture the way socialism has blatantly deteriorated their country over the years. It wasn&#39;t an all of a sudden everything sucks, it&#39;s been slowly developing and the people of Venezuela have been angry about it for like 10 years when most liberal politicians were still praising the country. The horrific state they have been saying the country is in is pretty much accurate but the governments oppression has been kind of glossed over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see some sense around here, socialism is not some great secret we are missing out on, it has been proven inadequate time and time again for large countries (smaller countries is up for debate).  Look, just because our interests are also fueled by arterial motives doesn&#39;t mean that what they are doing is right.  It is a system that by its very nature represses free thought and growth of a society.  Socialism could be a great idea adopted by specific states but on a larger scale when you are talking about a country there is too much room for corruption and lack of growth long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trouble here is that socialism can mean a whole lot of different things.

Or, as in the case of Venezuela, socialism can mean the government steals everything.  </p>

<p>The government steals everything most definitely has been proven time and time again to lead only to ruin.  </p>

<p>Not a lot of people know this, or maybe you guys do, but America&#39;s world dominance is based on currency (and military). When people start using other currencies as a means of exchange, then America can&#39;t manipulate value. A lot of countries have gone to hell because they refused American money as payment. America is presently holding the world hostage, and what the hell can anyone do?</p>

<p>It is falling apart fast, no food, riots day and night. Yuan is nothing, Venezuela isn&#39;t that high on oil exports and thier oil is shitty anyway.</p>

<p>The move to yuan is more likely how to do with the USD exchange rate situation over there and thier manipulation of it to line thier pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you root through my post history to where I&#39;m calling a flat earther a fool and reference that as if my reminder that <strong>15 years ago</strong> a republican (not that I buy into the 2 party fallacy) president claimed we were doing a single war, on multiple fronts is akin to claiming GPS fails to work in rural areas because it&#39;s not a signal from space. One is a documented quote, the other is a moronic rambling of someone who doesn&#39;t understand doppler shift and time delay calculations. </p>

<p>He claimed it&#39;s a single war on several fronts. George Bush told us <strong>in 2002</strong> that it would be a single, long war, on several fronts. How many fronts have we seen on this never ending terror war? </p>

<p>Lets count!</p>

<p>1) Iraq
2) Afghanistan
3) Pakistan
4) Somalia
5) Yemen
6) Syria
7) Philippines
8) Lybia</p>

<p>How many more do you want? How many of those countries are news to you that the US was involved in anti-terrorism operations under this ever waging war? All you need to do is look at 15 years of history and the war on terror, specifically the various campaigns of Operation Enduring Freedom that still carry on today. </p>

<p>Stop wasting time rooting through post history and start rooting through history. Thanks for failing, maybe you&#39;ll get some education and try a little harder. </p>

WE are being lead to believe that our mission with Venezuela is &quot;democracy&quot; just like our ultimate vision with Iraq was presented as &quot;democracy.&quot; Stop being stupid, no one is revising history, I was alive during the beginning of the Iraq campaign and I remember the Bush speech I quoted very, very clearly. I watched it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears. We were told <em>&quot;democracy&quot;</em> and &quot;with US, or with the terrorists&quot; by Bush. We are again being told <em>&quot;democracy&quot;</em> by Trump and all we&#39;ll see is the war machine continue to gobble up lives and resources in yet another battle in this endless war. The ONLY difference here is there was an act of terror so profound on US soil as to stir up public support for the initial campaign. It only took one day to unleash 15 years of hell on the planet and you seem to think it&#39;s somehow different because another talking head is voted in? </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re a sincerely uneducated individual who would do better to spend their time looking at actual history instead of assuming it&#39;s all been altered because you get your facts from reddit and other half assed social media. I&#39;d go so far as to wager you weren&#39;t even born as of 2002 to hear Bush&#39;s speech and are an ignorant child who&#39;s teen angst is leading them to think they&#39;ve got it all figured out because you heard the term &quot;internet revisionist&quot; once. </p>

<p>Grow up man, start cracking books and reading archives, watching old newscasts and you too can see all the same things I saw with my own eyes, the very same things I&#39;m attempting to present to you today. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t how logical exchange happens. You&#39;re resorting to emotional attacks and have ignored presented proofs; these are tactics of disinformation agents. Honest assessment doesn&#39;t require talent, and discussing the interpretations of the many can make it easier to come to a greater understanding of a topic as a whole, in its reality. You do not imbue these ideals; you seek only to distract and misinform. </p>

<p>Please, discontinue your harassment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, do you mind not bothering me and taking my words out of context. I&#39;ve never participated in cheer leading for anyone, but I did, as I&#39;ve mentioned six or seven times, reiterate points made by Trump in his speech to the UN yesterday, 9/19/2017.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve explained more than once that the &quot;war on several fronts&quot; line was my own line, and a way of explaining Trump&#39;s <em>stated</em> stance on US involvement abroad. You&#39;re muddling the point and accusing me of cheer leading, while accepting no words to the contrary. </p>

<p>I, at no point, was cheerleading. Explaining what someone else said does not constitute cheerleading. By your definition of cheerleading, if you suspected me of cheerleading, and continued to quote me, as you&#39;re doing, you would be cheerleading for me.</p>

<p>By that logic, thank you for your continued support! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh good grief, every time this is mentioned. </p>

<p>Cannabis is a great thing and should absolutely be legal for medical and recreational use and has many uses, <strong>but</strong> it has not been shown to be effective against chronic pain with the exception of neuropathies, it is not a silver bullet/miracle opiate replacement, it does not work to sufficiently kill acute pain like opiates do either. In many people it can exacerbate pain. </p>

<p>And I can tell you from experience it does very little to help with opiate withdrawal besides ease some of the nausea and help you sleep for a few hours. Both great things, but not enough that people are going to say &quot;Oh hey, I don&#39;t want heroin anymore!&quot;. </p>

<p>People who use opiates are often using marijuana as is. Why aren&#39;t they walking away from dope if it works so well?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we have doctors who are bribed, just like politicians of course, to prescribe drugs no matter what, if we had more regulation on this, and also introduce cannabis mainstream where its not illegal AT ALL, people would probably start PREFERRING to take cannabis over the pills due to the other sideaffects they can have, even if it doesnt help AS MUCH with pain, like sideaffects of not operating machinery because you took painpills, well you can get the medical properties from cannabis without getting high...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. That&#39;s a great point about the benefits of cannabis versus prescription drugs like opiates. I also like how you admit cannabis isn&#39;t a panacea and may not work as well as opiates in some cases, but is still preferable because the lack of side effects and no potential for addiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intervention doesn&#39;t have to mean a military action but it might be.</p>

<p>This may actually start with getting support to enforce trade restrictions or similar diplomatic action to put pressure on the administration.</p>

<p>If we start to use military force, the regime will have what they need to say, the US is trying to bring down Venezuela as they have been for years.  This is bad for us, good for the Venezuela administration.</p>

<p>What I expect to happen is after this intervention takes place if at all, will Venezuela change their oil exports back to the dollar?  If that happens, I would 100% believe this intervention is mainly about the petro dollar.  But by that time its to late to be upset about but anything before that time its hard to say what the real motive is IMO.</p>

<p>I want to say the US doesn&#39;t really care about authoritarian administrations unless it directly impacts the US, in this case it has oil that we probably need and they used our dollar for pricing.  This also sends a message to everyone else &quot;You should probably stock up on nukes before leaving the petro dollar&quot;.</p>

<p>Proof that you don&#39;t know anything about socialism. You&#39;re referring to Marxist-Leninist state collectivization and the resultant party controlled bureaucracy. That is not socialism, that is one specific <em>application</em> of socialism. Google &quot;libertarian socialism&quot; or just read the fucking wiki on socialism itself. It goes through all this. Socialism is a wide range of economic and political ideologies, and simply saying &quot;socialism is evil and inherently flawed&quot; just indicates that you know very little, if anything at all, about socialism. </p>

<p>Maybe if you&#39;re a moron</p>

<p>In b4 you dredge up some atrocity that you&#39;ll blame squarely on socialism while ignoring comparable occurrences in capitalist societies</p>

<p>In b4 you equate communism with socialism and those with authoritarianism/tyranny, oblivious to the fact that socialism describes a wide range of ideologies and you&#39;re identifying it with Marxism-Leninism/Stalinism, which is but one subset</p>

<p>WTF is this logic?</p>

<p>It should be the opposite: A poor country but with full freedom is Indefinitely better than a puppet state. Because with full freedom, you can decide you and your country&#39;s own worth, doesnt get stripped down both your rights and your economy control, doesn&#39;t having unwanted asshole building shits without your consent, and doesn&#39;t gonna get thrown under the bus if your country stop being useful.</p>

<p>Like I said, cherry picking arguement</p>

<p>East Asia getting rich from the VIETNAM WAR. They just sell stuff to the US troop and getting rich there. And even then, you could easily argue that Japan doesnt need US intervention puppet state to actually be great. They could easily rebuilt and be an empire themselves. The US puppet state is there to HALT their power, NOT empowering it.</p>

<p>Western Europe is the same. They could just as easily built back themselves. The US puppet state is there to HALT their power, NOT to empowering it. If you really want to see a superpower that could rebuild themselves from dust, look no further than Russia. While most could argue that Putin is a dictator, there&#39;s no doubt that he&#39;s making Russia a super power again after the fall of the Soviets. And this is what the Interventor afraid of these nation. THEY HAVE MORE MANPOWER THAN THE INTERVENTOR. So they have to establish their puppet state and spy network early before these nation can fully rebuilt and contest them. After that they can fully control these nation and not let them surpass the interventors.</p>

<p>Now I understand why you think intervention and puppet state are good. The truth is, nothing is there for free. Politician dont do charity when it comes to state matter. And a free nation, where your opinion actually somewhat mattered is far better than a nation that just gonna roll over to somebody else. People are resilience enough to survive and fight back if need to. But you just want to op out for an easy way out so......</p>

<p>The people of Venezuela are not even free to voice their opinions or else they&#39;d no longer be starving in the streets.

<p>Strawman at it&#39;s finest.</p>

<p>Like I said, IF they decide to overthrow the gov, help them by sending food and provisionals, NOT WEAPONS, NOT SOLDIERS, AND NOT THE CIA. If they don&#39;t, then just sending aid to them so that they don&#39;t starving on the street anymore directly. You just want to justify intervention and war for the oil at this point.</p>

<p>And FYI, if the US wasn&#39;t so bloodthirsty with their &quot;Stop the red&quot; campaigns, then other socialist nations wouldn&#39;t be so on lock down and paranoid, resulting in dictatorship. And if the CIA didn&#39;t going full bullshit mode with their governmental take down so much, maybe Americans will actually have a decent government for once. But I suppose you never think about it and just try to be a smartass. So I&#39;m sorry for having this conversation with sbd who tries to decide for the other guy.</p>

<p>&quot;We became a dictatorship because you tried to over throw us, that&#39;ll show them how free we are, its not like socialism advocates for dictatorship, or that socialism and communism have killed tens of millions before the cold war even began!&quot;</p>

<p>Trump didn&#39;t declare war in his speech, and there&#39;s nothing new about US concern regarding Venezuela:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/09/obama-venezuela-security-threat-sanctions">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/09/obama-venezuela-security-threat-sanctions</a></p>

<p>Venezuela&#39;s situation has been disastrous for years, the US has been talking about it for years, there&#39;s nothing new going on - yet. Trump may still do harm. But when he does it won&#39;t be because of dollar pricing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media including reddit played you like a fiddle. The media presented the protests in Venezuela in a positive light, reddit acted like the situation in Venezuela is a socialist nightmare and it&#39;s being covered up. This gained the support of people who were unaware of the issue and people who don&#39;t like socialism. Redditors have a bias towards receiving news from reddit in the sense that they believe it&#39;s separate from the media and it&#39;s more reliable when it&#39;s definitely not. Now, people won&#39;t care that Venezuela will receive US involvement. You guys were being played and you didn&#39;t even know it. </p>
