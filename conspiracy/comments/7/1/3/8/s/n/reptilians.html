       If you're willing to entertain the idea that there are reptilians, hopefully you can entertain the idea that these so called "reptilians" are spiritual entities known as "Fallen Angels" Angels of Satan

       Who ever said fallen angels are just human clones have severely deceived you guys, because people will rather have their ears tickled with fantastic lies, rather than embracing the truth, which is that these fallen angels &amp; aliens are evil spirits and these same evil spirits are the ones  who were kicked out of heaven for rebelling against God and the evil spirits are the ones promoting the deception that they're human clones, so people won't know of their true intentions.

       The people who upvoted your comments may not have known you were joking, which shows me that people can easily be deceived.  Since you said these things just for the sake of it, then you've knowingly sent disinformation to people just for the sake of it.

       The spirit realm, that is real, that I can say for sure. What I cant wrap my head around is that its Gods doing. Have you seen the inside of the Popes private chapel? I dont think that guy worships the same guy AS you do man.

       Fallen angels are the original human beings I think, giants that lived many years ago. And still do on Atlantis according to some. The reptilians, at least some had to make sure we never figure out how powerful we actually are, so they made us into slaves. Im not that read up on the subject tho, so please, anything you have is much appriciated!

       Quite a few actually. Spirit realm Ia discussed on all levels, not just in the fringe parts. Do you want some articles relating to it? If you have dabbled with phsycadelics before, I suggest you try LSD and DMT.

       Fallen angels are real so is the spirit realm, just as the bible says, so don't be so quick to think you haven't been deceived by demons who told you that reptilians are some type of alien race, it's nothing more than Satan and his angels whispering lies in your ears so you would believe in anything except the Salvation that comes through Jesus Christ our God.  The Good News is that Jesus Christ died for you, so that you can be saved.

       That's why it's important to know how to spiritually discern.  The bible accurately predicted Jesus over 500 years before His birth.  The Bible was written by men inspired by God over a period of over 1000 years and the message remain consistent.  The bible have prophecies that have been fulfilled.   The Bible promotes wisdom and righteousness and the condemnation of evil.  Jesus taught us to love God first and foremost, and that we should love one another, that we should do good unto friends, strangers, and our enemies.  There's plenty of things in the bible that proves it's from God.

       ...you are aware the first half of the Bible that would contain this prediction is also a Jewish document? And that they don't believe the Messiah has returned?
      </p>
      <p>
       That sounds like a really solid way to pick and choose what you want to believe. And also a better way to score converts by making Jesus' teachings a lot less stringent.

       I'm but you don't have the spiritual discernment to recognize truth.  It doesn't matter if the old testament was written by Jews, God choose the Jews due to Abraham's obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just because there were some Jews that don't believe that Jesus is the messiah, doesn't make them right and there were plenty of Jews who did believe Jesus was the messiah, as well as some Gentiles.  According to scripture Jesus did fulfill prophecy, if you read the entire chapter of Isaiah 53 "The Suffering Servant".
      </p>
      <p>
       The circumcision of the old testament was an outwardly obedience to God and a foreshadowing of how Jesus was going to circumcise our hearts to remove the foreskin of bitterness that we have within us.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the old testament the eating of only clean meats was symbolic of God wanting us to be pure and the animals that they were allowed to eat were the animals that God allowed for a pure sacrifice, in which animal sacrifice foreshadowed the purest sacrifice of all which came from Jesus Christ The Son of God.  The Blood of God is greater than the blood of animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the new testament Jesus taught us that the it's not what we eat that defiles us, but what we say out of our mouths that does defile us.

       Then why didn't god just let us know he was wrong after the coming of Jesus? Oh. Because God is infallible and does no wrong. Gotcha. Makes me believe that this was written by a fallible human instead.

       God created every creature, no? Why would he make ones we can't eat? He gave Adam Dominion over all the creatures of the earth, right? Sooo why would God do that? And we're God's "chosen people" wrong for the whole old testament? Or is it far more believable that Christianity just decided to change it because pork is fucking delicious?

       That entire book creates more questions than it definitively answers. And you are more than willing to interpret it as you see fit.

       They did and the few times they didn't they got involved real hard in the business of editing and interpreting the texts, but christians don't like to hear that because they think their god magically protected their holy books from corruption and veiled agendas. The council of nicea was just one of countless examples of how spiritually compromised individuals set the agenda for what would and would not be shared with people.
