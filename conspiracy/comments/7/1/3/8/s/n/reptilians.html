    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to know how to spiritually discern.  The bible accurately predicted Jesus over 500 years before His birth.  The Bible was written by men inspired by God over a period of over 1000 years and the message remain consistent.  The bible have prophecies that have been fulfilled.   The Bible promotes wisdom and righteousness and the condemnation of evil.  Jesus taught us to love God first and foremost, and that we should love one another, that we should do good unto friends, strangers, and our enemies.  There&#39;s plenty of things in the bible that proves it&#39;s from God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...you are aware the first half of the Bible that would contain this prediction is also a Jewish document? And that they don&#39;t believe the Messiah has returned? </p>

<p>That sounds like a really solid way to pick and choose what you want to believe. And also a better way to score converts by making Jesus&#39; teachings a lot less stringent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m but you don&#39;t have the spiritual discernment to recognize truth.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the old testament was written by Jews, God choose the Jews due to Abraham&#39;s obedience.</p>

<p>Also, just because there were some Jews that don&#39;t believe that Jesus is the messiah, doesn&#39;t make them right and there were plenty of Jews who did believe Jesus was the messiah, as well as some Gentiles.  According to scripture Jesus did fulfill prophecy, if you read the entire chapter of Isaiah 53 &quot;The Suffering Servant&quot;.</p>

<p>The circumcision of the old testament was an outwardly obedience to God and a foreshadowing of how Jesus was going to circumcise our hearts to remove the foreskin of bitterness that we have within us. </p>

<p>In the old testament the eating of only clean meats was symbolic of God wanting us to be pure and the animals that they were allowed to eat were the animals that God allowed for a pure sacrifice, in which animal sacrifice foreshadowed the purest sacrifice of all which came from Jesus Christ The Son of God.  The Blood of God is greater than the blood of animals.</p>

<p>In the new testament Jesus taught us that the it&#39;s not what we eat that defiles us, but what we say out of our mouths that does defile us.</p>

<p>Thanks for your concern and I&#39;ll be glad to answer any questions you may have.  Cheers!</p>

<p>Then why didn&#39;t god just let us know he was wrong after the coming of Jesus? Oh. Because God is infallible and does no wrong. Gotcha. Makes me believe that this was written by a fallible human instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The circumcision of the old testament was an outwardly obedience to God and a foreshadowing of how Jesus was going to circumcise our hearts to remove the foreskin of bitterness that we have within us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...that is the single most hamfisted analogy I have ever seen used as justification. Grasping to the Nth degree. You are <em>legitimately</em> arguing &quot;that&#39;s an analogy for the removal of the foreskin of our hearts...&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the old testament the eating of only clean meats was symbolic of God wanting us to be pure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God created every creature, no? Why would he make ones we can&#39;t eat? He gave Adam Dominion over all the creatures of the earth, right? Sooo why would God do that? And we&#39;re God&#39;s &quot;chosen people&quot; wrong for the whole old testament? Or is it far more believable that Christianity just decided to change it because pork is fucking delicious?</p>

<p>That entire book creates more questions than it definitively answers. And you are more than willing to interpret it as you see fit.</p>
