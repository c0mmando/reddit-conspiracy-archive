       Even a simple google search of the videos shows they are clearly not the same person. It is laughable that upon seeing this thread the mods haven't even made any attempt to watch the video, realize it's completely false, and take it down for the same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that people should be allowed to discuss whatever if it is conspiracy related, no matter how retarded most of it is. But if it is empirically wrong it is not a conspiracy theory it is just fucking fiction. It's also allowing people to believe false information which helps no one. If you want people to know the truth stop letting them believe bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is at least the fourth time I have seen something proven to be wrong upvoted highly on the front page. And I frequent here, maybe ever 5 days. It should be in violation of the rules to post something that is not true. It would be in most normal subs, except for some reason a sub obsessed with getting to the core of truth just lets it slide on some of the biggest and stupidest things.

       I am not so sure of them being the same person...but the possibility of the whole Foley thing being propaganda to get into Syria is definitely possible. After all it is now legal for the state dept to create &amp; distribute "material" targeted for American consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the interview with Katie Couric where the image falls of the wall, specifically Foley's siblings reaction to it(or lack thereof) interesting. Have you ever noticed how well random callers to say NPR speak so eloquently or share opinions that line up so well with the TPTB's agenda?

       It's obvious when people are trying to disrupt and discredit when they think that one minor mistake or oversight in one meme on the front page is cause for them to concern troll about how it's bad for the sub. Even if one of those pictures is incorrect, it doesn't change the fact that Sandy Hook and all the other events were hoaxes and that crisis actors and actresses were and are being used to manipulate the narrative for contrived events.

       This is not concern trolling. This is me telling you false things are the antithesis to the truth. Like it or loathe it, it's the truth. It may not hinder the image of your sub, but if you are content with provably false things being treated as true then that's on you. But things that are
       <strong>
        provably false, as this is
       </strong>
       should not be allowed anywhere on this subreddit.

       Anyone who's been to this sub long enough realizes the front page is almost always some laughably fake conspiracy coupled with top comments "debunking" the article. Sometimes the front page will have an article that is a legit issue and the top comments will be some sort of damage control like that one with Nestle stealing Canada's water yesterday. The shill tactic is to upvote the obvious BS articles to discredit the sub for any casual user coming to check it out. It appears to be working quite well.

      <p>
       This sub is largely filled with shills and bots, if you want to see the legit users sort by new and browse through self posts.

       There are groups actively trying to discredit this sub an its core user base on a daily basis an the mods do not care. So shitposts happen an then they get bottted or brigaded with upvotes so they can say to people we are crazy and moronic. Before sb an records needed corrected is was minimal an this was not a political dumping ground. It was actually a great place to learn.

       I think this sub is more for speculation than codifying a narrative about what's true and false.  Those ideas are better discussed on a philosophical basis, because there's a millennia old debate about the nature of reality itself.  Alot of people in this sub are familiar with those ideas, so it seems like a waste of time to bring that debate here.  Reddit is a silly place full of robots, and no one should take it very seriously.  Finally, without exploring all the possibilities, how can anyone be sure of the truth?  The post you mentioned is very useful for that purpose.

       I think you're stuck inside your mind a bit. Its OK, I did it a lot when I was a teen/early 20s. What is real? How do we know this that or the other. The reality is, once you get out of your head, you know a lot of things are true just by experiencing it. It's the beauty of the faculties and senses we are given by a certain being--I'll let you speculate as to who. But simply by being out in the world we know things are true by experiencing it. In this instance--and I'll save the long argument--its quite clear what is true IN THIS INSTANCE. It isn't always this easy to ascertain the truth, but in this instance it is. Also, we can know that this is true because we can prove it's false: hence me saying that over and over again. If we can prove it's false we can know it's not true. Something can't be true and false at the same time.

       Essentially you are saying "I know it's fake so you must censor, doesn't matter about the rest and rights and free speech".

       I am not disagreeing. I am saying that we shouldn't censor ANYONE, it is the beginning of the end. If people put up blatant lies it is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY more effective to leave it there and have them see everyone call them out. It's not even close.

       Negative advertisement is better than no advertisement. And even if things are easily disproven, it's still fun every once in a while to think with different perspectives, and they usually bring up great conversation opportunities anyway.

       I don't think you actually know what provably false means. We can't actually prove whether or not anyone was in weeks, days, years before the event planting explosives. We can prove two planes went into the building, and we can prove the people in the videos are not the same.

       As I said. I don't think you understand the extent of the claims made by the official narrative of 911. That you can prove two planes flew into the towers means you can prove 0.0001% of all the anomalies in the official 911 narrative. Congratulations.
