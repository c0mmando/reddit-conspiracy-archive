    <div class="md"><p>u/ParsingSol uses data about the sun and its spots to predict earthquakes. His theory is that CME&#39;s (the sun spitting up powerful waves of energy) hit the earth and cause seismic activity. He&#39;s posted a lot of predictions over the years, under some other usernames. He&#39;s been wrong sometimes, but he&#39;s been eerily correct at others.  </p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50211/abstract">Studies</a> have been done to correlate the waves hitting earth and earthquakes, and generally, the consensus it that there&#39;s no correlation. This is due to the fact that we have earthquakes when there is no solar activity.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that there is a correlation, just not with every quake. It seems to me to be one of many factors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, 8.0 magnitude earthquakes happen on average once per year. Even if he did spent 3 weeks suggesting it will happen, he only had a 1:17 chance of being right. You cannot have a high degree of confidence, as the data sample is 1, and it could simply be a lucky guess and not at all influenced by what ParsingSol suggests generates earthquakes. That said, he still had made a prediction that had a higher chance of being true than random chance. </p>

<p>You know, as opposed to him predicting that something that happens with an average of 3:1 chance, will happen, like this and all of his other threads. </p>

<p>Regarding people saying that he has provided his formula, data and methodology in the past, no he hasn&#39;t. Alot of people, me included, have volunteered to help him, but I am not aware of anyone receiving a reply. </p>

<p>Well, 8.0 magnitude earthquakes happen on average once per year. Even if he did spent 3 weeks suggesting it will happen, he only had a 1:17 chance of being right. You cannot have a high degree of confidence, as the data sample is 1, and it could simply be a lucky guess and not at all influenced by what ParsingSol suggests generates earthquakes. That said, he still had made a prediction that had a higher chance of being true than random chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He made predictions just like that before and nothing happened. The earthquake also happened outside of his timeframe and in the completely wrong location. His “best guess” (those were his words in that thread) was that it would happen in Japan.</p>

<p>I’m not going to be impressed by someone finally hitting a predictions when they were wrong before and when they didn’t even hit on it in the first place. </p>

<p>That’s what’s annoying me the most, and I’m being called a troll and a shill for asking for more info. I want to see his methods and data and also want to see a chart/database/whatever that shows all of his predictions and how many times he hit and miss. Anyone doing research like that should keep a record if they’re serious about it. The complete lack of information is what bothers me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except he says in the comments that the earthquake happened “several hours” after his timeframe (which, knowing him, could mean a full day) and the magnitude was 0.1 off of his predictions, which means it was a 7.4 when he predicted a 7.5-9.0(which is a laughably huge scale).

<p>How is that a contradiction? Do me a favor. Go look up the definition of credentials and tell me if it specifies a degree. I’m asking what his background in science is, what is expertise are, how much experience he has with earthquakes. Those kinds of things that an amateur could, in fact, gain through years of work. You don’t need a degree, but you damn roll better have some kind of background in order to be taken seriously. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have had not the slightest clue that such an earthquake would have been likely, who tipped you off? and how?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, why am I not surprised at all that you wouldn’t have the slightest clue?</p>

<p>You do realize there are well over 100 6.0-6.9 earthquakes around the world every year, right? That comes straight from the USGS.</p>

<p><a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/stats.php">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/stats.php</a></p>

<p>That means that last year, there were an average of 2.5 earthquakes that were in the 6.0-6.9 range every week. If someone were to make a prediction over even a three day span, the odds of them being right are fairly high since the odds of being right in any given seven day span is very high.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he is full of shit - prove it? - we won&#39;t refute genuine proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the fact that he’s been wrong countless times before isn’t proof enough? What about the times where he literally ignores that his location was way off and just says “well, we need to work on that, but the magnitude was right!”? Or the fact that he ignores the timeframe completely and counts earthquakes outside of that timeframe as correct like he did last time? </p>

<p>I want to see the data he’s collected and if he’s for real, that shouldn’t be a hard task for him to do. He needs to show how accurate he’s been. He should have that all recorded if he’s serious about this, right? So where’s all the data in an easy to read table? Anyone could put together an excel document to show it.</p>

<p>He makes vague predictions on location, date and magnitude. He allows for wiggle room when defining a &quot;hit&quot;, that is, if he predicts a 7.0+ quake and a 5.0 quake happens but the location and date match up, that&#39;s a hit. He discards the the complete misses and only keeps the &quot;hits&quot;.</p>

<p>Using the same technique, I predict that in the first 6 months of 2018, an underdog sports team will defy the odds and beat an elite team. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re missing the main point of what he&#39;s doing.  He&#39;s saying solar activity INCREASES the likelihood of an EQ, it doesn&#39;t cause them.  He also doesn&#39;t predict locations unless pressed and obviously he&#39;s going to name the main BIG earthquake locations where those normally occur.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but if I lived in an area prone to big quakes and someone had a theory about predicting them...even a 1% chance...i&#39;d want to know about it.  I&#39;m not sure why people have to be so overly critical of new ideas, makes no sense to me, especially if it can eventually save lives</p>
