    <div class="md"><p>I think the recourse should not be to &quot;get back at them&quot; or anything, which is what it feels like the op is implying, but rather to educate the userbase here on techniques used by shills/trolls/brigaders so people can recognise any of that and be able to simply mentally bypass it. If need be, also reply to any comment distracting from the point with an example of whatever technique they&#39;re using - not engaging in their tactics, but making it obvious what they&#39;re doing so any further readers who don&#39;t know of their techniques can recognise right there and then. I believe someone posted some &quot;list of shill techniques&quot; a while back, or something to that effect. I&#39;ll have a little dig and stick it in an edit. Unless someone else can beat me to it. </p>

<p>I watched it happen on the mod-log.  So to those who say the mods are shills that won&#39;t ban the trolls - whoever they are: here is evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>One begins to question themselves, and their report of the other - possibly even feel sorry for a multi-year account becoming banned.  Then I saw they posted that - and it was sweet confirmation: justice served accurately.  </p>
