       I think the recourse should not be to "get back at them" or anything, which is what it feels like the op is implying, but rather to educate the userbase here on techniques used by shills/trolls/brigaders so people can recognise any of that and be able to simply mentally bypass it. If need be, also reply to any comment distracting from the point with an example of whatever technique they're using - not engaging in their tactics, but making it obvious what they're doing so any further readers who don't know of their techniques can recognise right there and then. I believe someone posted some "list of shill techniques" a while back, or something to that effect. I'll have a little dig and stick it in an edit. Unless someone else can beat me to it.

       I was the user who reported Gentleman_Retard ( who made the post you are referencing ).  The mods then banned him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched it happen on the mod-log.  So to those who say the mods are shills that won't ban the trolls - whoever they are: here is evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       One begins to question themselves, and their report of the other - possibly even feel sorry for a multi-year account becoming banned.  Then I saw they posted that - and it was sweet confirmation: justice served accurately.

       I find tagging more productive, better to be aware of some of the derailment and tactics that are taking place and possibly point some particular brigading or voting manipulation. Though I understand simply not wanting to see all that crap may just ultimately be for having a better Reddit experience.

       We need to have fun with it. Just call them out as you see them. Their job is to appear to be an ordinary user but unmasking them makes it a lot harder for them to work and they end up getting unmotivated after many unmaskings. This also helps unsuspecting members spot them. As long as we try, we will win. If we don't try, we lose.

       Pizzagate got false flagged. Users who posted anything that broke site rules were promptly banned+muted, but admins were unbanning+unmuting them before they should have been. Without telling anyone. Here's one of the screenshots I saved from it

       Well I think we've been down this childish route in the past. Don't you remember? I won that game by the Davey vs Timmy precedent of 1993, wherein it was found that if one party is rubber and the other is glue, what bounces off of the defendant stick, in turn, to the plaintiff. Also, times infinity.

       Hey OP, how much has the sub changed in just nine days? Seeing as that is how old you account is. Probably an alt account.

       Always funny the loudest cries for the old days are always the brand new accounts.

       I notice a little of this _____ a little of that ____ worse some days better others, but overall I can post what I want and defend my position when I want on this sub. I’ve never been censored for speaking from the heart on here. That might change someday but in 3 years I haven’t noticed any major shenanigans affect me personally.

       Yeah? You joined three months ago. How much has this sub changed in just three months? Are you using an alt account? I'm using my alt account yet I've been here going on a decade now but it doesn't really matter because this isn't a tenure contest, dickhole. Keep embarrassing yourself with stupid comments like this.

       Man, you guys sound like a bunch of bullied nerds. Just ignore them. It's not some vast plot to take you down; it's literally just some people fucking around because it's so easy to get a rise out of someone when you call their thought process into question and what better place to do it than a sub filled with delusional users who don't trust other users, Russian propagandists (i.e. recent "Fuck Morgan Freeman" post title), religious fanatics, Jew haters, and schizophrenics. Very few level-headed people comment here anymore and it's obvious why. Stop taking yourselves so goddamn seriously. No one here is changing the world yet everyone thinks they are.

       I find tagging more productive, better to be aware of some of the derailment and tactics that are taking place and possibly point some particular brigading or voting manipulation. Though I understand simply not wanting to see all that crap may just ultimately be for having a better Reddit experience.
