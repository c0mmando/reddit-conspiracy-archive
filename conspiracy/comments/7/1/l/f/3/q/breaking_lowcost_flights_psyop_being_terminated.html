       Last Prophet's words from Sep 16, 2017 ...
      </p>
      <h1>
       BREAKING: Low-cost flights: PSY-OP being terminated: Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights
      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Last Prophet's words days before the illuminati dropped the Ryanair bomb:
       <br/>
       Branson is a fake name - meant to suggest (Charles) Bronson - for a fake billionaire, same as Last Trumpe(nce)ts alias Tramp, fake owner of the St. Marten estate where Irma made its 2nd landfall (1st was in Barbuda's Princess Diana beach).
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Actor playing "billionaire Branson" was cast in "low-cost flights"
       </strong>
       , one of the main "end of the show" psy-ops, to catch the human cattle by surprise with the imminent BIG BANG, the end of the world as the beasts know it.
       <br/>
       Reminder of the main psy-op of this type: to have the "market prices" for oil dive under its US production costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       From illuminati media "news" headlines, one day after Irma's third landfall, on Neckar Island, supposedly owned by Branson, an article has no word about "Trump's estate in Saint Marten":
       <br/>
       <em>
        "Richard Branson's Son Is 'Glad to Say All Humans' Survived Hurricane Irma but Buildings on Private Island Are 'Destroyed'
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminder of Last Prophet's words hours before...
       <br/>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6yj26h/irmageddon_first_landfalls_barbudas_princess/">
         Irmageddon: first landfalls: Barbuda's Princess Diana beach's ghost resort; Trump’s St. Martin estate
        </a>

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BREAKING: Low-cost flights: PSY-OP being terminated:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       So it starts: Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights over the next weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sep 15, 2017 -

       <br/>
       Timing for these FAKE (read: scripted) "news": hours before "
       <em>
        Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights over the next six weeks
       </em>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How do human cattle react to this "news":
       </strong>
       <br/>
       So reacts the human cattle, unable to get what the start (or in this case the end) of an illuminati psy-op is, when confronted with the truth:
       <br/>
       <em>
        "... and actually, Ryanair is
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         only
        </em>
       </strong>
       <em>
        canceling some flights for six weeks ..."
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>

       </strong>
       <br/>
       What's behind this FAKE leak is the same as behind these cancellations (after reading it will also be clear because these kind of excuses to cancel flights starts at isolated New Zealand, several thousands miles flights).

       <strong>
        BASICS
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Human cattle scared to fly (fear of crashes caused by the fake crashes series is not the main reason):
       <br/>
       that's why illuminati don't lose as much money with the low-cost airlines psy-op as you may think at first sight.
       <br/>
       Google in quotes:
       <br/>
       "Oil price below production costs"
       <br/>
       <a href="http://illuminati-overtime.blogspot.com/2015/01/oil-price-below-production-costs-for.html">
        http://illuminati-overtime.blogspot.com/2015/01/oil-price-below-production-costs-for.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake airliner crashes: 9/11 to "end of show" series
       <br/>
       General Agendas - valid for all episodes:
       <br/>
       1. Human cattle terrorized, stage set to be stripped from air travel.
       <br/>
       Note that it's not the fake crashes and incidents that will terminate air travel for the human cattle.
       <br/>
       This will happen immediately after the launch of the BIG BANG now, with the brutal termination of another psy-op, ongoing for more than a year now, "oil price below production costs".
       <br/>
       But thanks to the previously served fake crashes and incidents human cattle will be more willing to accept it.
       <br/>
       Note: the series "fake terrorist attacks" shares the general agenda "set the stage for human cattle stripped from air travel" as well as some episodes with the series "fake as airliner crashes".

       Read the article, notes and links carefully - EACH word counts.

       If you are still unclear after reading, formulate a question about a statement in article or a previously mentioned concept.

       That's not unexpected behavior from human cattle, but drugs consumption will NOT help you to understand the simple Truth.
       <br/>
       Drugs will only contribute to reducing whatever capacity for logical reasoning that may still exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:
       <br/>
       Drugs were used as a tactical weapon to control human cattle on their decades long path to the slaughterhouse.
       <br/>
       But the BIG BANG also means the official proclamation of Global Slavery,
       <strong>
        a world where there's no place for human cattle on drugs.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The same illuminati who just started legalizing marijuana in the US will be coming shortly for the execution of drug addicts (preview ongoing in Philippines).

       So, you are unable to comprehend nothing about what is written and have demonstrated the lack of capacity to build any logical reasoning whatsoever.

       The article is only 15 lines long, excluding notes and links.

      <p>
       Read again. That's NOT the reason human cattle are scared to fly.
       <br/>
       The explicit explanation is given in the BASICS section in OP by following the links.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, why is the human cattle scared to fly?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The answer starts with a general agenda: the ongoing transition to global slavery.
       <br/>
       It already drastically reduced jobs, social security payments and savings of a human cattle afraid to lose in the near future what's still left.
       <br/>
       The answer continues with collateral benefits of a specific agenda: set the stage to terminate air travel for the human cattle.
       <br/>
       This agenda is advanced by two "end of show" series:
       <br/>
       1. All episodes of the fake "airliner crashes".
       <br/>
       2. Countless episodes of the fake "terrorist attacks".

       Reminder of what was explained in advance worldwide only by Last Prophet and is now already unfolding, from the Ukraine to the Philippines ...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BIG BANG: the most extreme inversion of illuminati scripts ever.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The ultimate reverse script starts with a sudden inversion just before the BIG BANG, launched with Obama's staged arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the scripts that will be suddenly inverted:
       <br/>
       1. Multiracial society and open borders becomes manhunt for aliens and non-whites
       <br/>
       2. Legalize drugs becomes execution of drug addicts
       <br/>
       3. "Gay marriage legalized" becomes manhunt for homosexuals
       <br/>
       4. "Ultra-nationalists" become "our national heroes"
       <br/>
       5. Staged democracy becomes "Hitler was right"
      </p>
      <p>

       Sep 22, 2017 - One week later Last Prophet is still the only one exposing the start of the termination of the "low-cost flights" psy-op.

       Anyone can verify Last Prophet's original forum thread posted

The UNDENIABLE timestamped proof of Last Prophet's words about the imminent termination of the low-cost flights psy-op was hours before the illuminati media would start to read from the script.
       <br/>
       All part of setting the stage to strip human cattle from air travel to be replaced with the reality of empty highways, but this time, unlike 1973, for good.

       Note from 2014 about the "low-cost flights" agenda as it was launched:
       <br/>
       the illuminati launched the low cost psy-op with fake airline companies, meant to make a loss not a profit, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, while they drill fake oil prices into new depths.

25 Sep 2017 - Air Berlin sell-off: what passengers need to know
The 40-year history of Germany's Air Berlin (LSE: 0GPE.L - news) will end in the coming weeks, as its planes and other assets are sold off in bankruptcy proceedings. Here's what passengers need to know:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Is Air Berlin still flying? -
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Flights are still taking off thanks to an emergency loan from the German government.
The financial stopgap is supposed to last until November, giving bosses time to wind up the company by selling off its planes and takeoff and landing slots to other airlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the plan fails, the company will be liquidated and all flights will be cancelled.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Which flights are affected? -
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Long-haul flights to Boston, Havana, Varadero in Cuba, Punta Cana and Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, Cancun, Curacao, Abu Dhabi, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco have been cancelled.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Air Berlin is keeping its popular route to New York aloft for the time being.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        What if my flight is cancelled? -
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Only tickets bought from Air Berlin after August 15 -- the date the airline declared bankruptcy -- are eligible for a full refund under insolvency rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you bought tickets before then, there's no chance of a refund unless the flight is cancelled or if the sale of Air Berlin falls through.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you bought tickets through a tour operator, they generally have insurance to cover cancellations.
- What if my flight is cancelled last-minute? -
      </p>
      <p>
       The European Consumer Centre advises passengers to insist on a replacement flight and refuse to pay for any hotel stays that might be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travellers should also avoid checking too many bags to avoid complicated damages claims against the insolvent company.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Can I cancel my ticket pre-emptively? -
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       No. Passengers can't break their contract for fear of a possible cancellation of their flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normal cancellation rules apply to customers despite the unusual situation.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Should I still buy flights from Air Berlin? -
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Airlines in financial trouble often try to sell off tickets at rock-bottom prices online.

       The 1979 reverse of illuminati script in Iran pales in comparison to what will now happen in the USA, EU, Australia, Canada:
       <br/>
       The ultimate reverse script starts with a sudden inversion just before the BIG BANG, launched with Obama's staged arrest.
       <br/>
       Some of the scripts that will be suddenly inverted:
