    <div class="md"><p>Rev 12 states that the 12 stars will crown Virgo, with the moon at her feet and sun clothing (Don&#39;t know the exact word) her, and she will give &quot;birth&quot; to (insert your own interpretation of the context), which in the theories case is Jupiter. </p>

<p>For the 5th time (1st in these theorists eyes) in the last 1000 years alone, the alignment fits the &#39;prophecy&#39; and the dude who came up with it decided to add his own twist that since Jesus lived what he says was 33 years, and the eclipse (which was said to be a sign by him), is 33 days from September 23rd. Also, Jupiter will be in Virgo for what he says is as long as human gestation, which he claims is 42 weeks (when it&#39;s on average actually 40 weeks). </p>

<p>Therefore, all these neat little numerology twists and bends add up to somehow mean Nibiru is close and either the rapture/signalling of the end should begin. </p>

<p>There&#39;s massive issues with this theory on an astronomical AND religious level, but nobody wants to actually take the time to understand that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m not disagreeing with you on the conclusion part of it but when else has this ever happened? I&#39;ve never seen Virgo crowned with 12 stars, moon at her feet, clothed with the sun, <em>while</em> Jupiter goes in retrograde motion inside of the &quot;womb&quot;/box of Virgo for 9 months as foretold. And I&#39;ve looked at all of the dates that people have said it happened, but they didn&#39;t match. Please enlighten me because I&#39;d actually like to know if it&#39;s ever happened before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jupiter part fascinates me back That part has never occurred where it&#39;s in Virgo for that long, with the other &#39;signs&#39; if you will. </p>

<p>That being said, there have been 4 times over the past 1000 years where the alignment has occurred, and in my personal honest opinion, 2 of those 4 involve the 3 planets actually &quot;crowning&quot; Virgo. The other 2 are iffy, depends how literally you take the passage. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the exact dates because I&#39;m on mobile at work, but earthsky.org has a good article on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally understand that, but theories are generally well thought out, and to believe something that is blatantly wrong in many ways is just dumb. </p>

<p>I apologize if anyone was offended, it&#39;s not what I meant, but there also needs to be a balance here. A lot of people stumble on these kinds of posts and can get severe anxiety and worry a lot about them, especially younger people, so it&#39;s just good to balance out all of the craziness with some sanity. There are certainly believable conspiracies, but I can&#39;t see this being one of them, not even their own religion endorses it, and I just don&#39;t want anyone getting worked up over something that has an astronomically low chance of happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa whoa whoa, what about people and anxiety have to do with these conspiracy topics? I mean, the same can be said for a ton of people who feel the same. What makes this different from, say, 9/11?  That would and should give the masses anxiety and make them think different.  But that isn&#39;t the case. All of us here choose what to follow, not the other way around. That&#39;s what makes us different from the rest. We can use our minds and expand further than most</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what this subreddit was made to be.  It isnt right to exclude people because YOU think that&#39;s how it should be. I understand there is a lot of science to disprove things. I get it. but does that mean evolution is right? We dont hear it&#39;s the THEORY of evolution. It&#39;s just evolution. So where is the line on things that can be dismissed? I see a lot of shit on here that can be dismissed, but nothing as heavily of flat earth or planet x.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People think Revelation 12 is a sign that is supposed to occur in the sky on sept 23 when the sun, moon, and certain constellations are lined up just right. Different theories have been proposed: rapture, beginning of the great tribulation,etc</p>

<p>Although that is not the true meaning of Revelation 12, the date 9/23 has been a recurring subliminal message. If something happens on saturday, no matter how massive or important, its a false flag not a sign of God. The sign for the beginning of the great tribulation is detailed in Matthew 24:15 and is nothing like the Sept 23 baloney.
“When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)”
“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” Matthew24:15,21

The Great sign of Revelation 12 occurring just 33 days after the eclipse may represent the pre-tribulation rapture. It also happens to line up with the Feast of Trumpets which is heavily alluded to being the time of rapture and just happens to be the next Feast day in line to be fulfilled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christianity originates from the ancient sumerian culture, which was the first civilization of earth, whose records say that they lived with the gods. They describe advanced technologies and even missiles used in war.</p>

<p>Their model of the solar system and advanced mathematics tells us they were far more advanced than we would expect the first civilization of man. This model had all of our planets, but an additional solar system which they said would only visit every 20,000 years.</p>

<p>NASA revealed that they had evidence of a large body in the outer solar system in the 90&#39;s, but never confirmed it. Search of press release &quot;unexplained deviations In Uranus and Neptune point to a large outer solar system body...&quot; NASA then sent out infrared probes and found pictures of a large dark ball of gas with discs, but never said another word about it.</p>

<p>In 1991 Dr robert harrington, chief astronomer of us naval observatory found this object in New Zealand, and calculated that this object was approaching earth.</p>

<p>NASA WAS ready to release info about the object, but Dr Harrington suddenly died of throat cancer before publishing his findings, and NASA never said another word about it, other than to discredit anyone that claimed to have been tracking it.</p>

<p>There have been sightings of a second  sun in the sky for the last few years.</p>

<p>The other issue with you assumption is that if &#39;Nibiru&#39; were as close as you and others claim, it would be absolutely massive, and easily visible with the naked eye multiple times a day. It&#39;s not like it just rotates absolutely perfectly with the sun to ensure we never see it. By now, especially if it were 2 days away, it would be much bigger than the sun itself in the sky. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, we can argue about that all day, but the basic matter of fact is that if it were in the sky and close enough to do absolutley anything to us, it would be physically impossible not to see it, either with a telescope or just the naked eye. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t visible to just a few. It has been spotted for a few years now, but most people don&#39;t pay attention. And recently it has been so close to the sun, you need an ultra zoom lens or some sort of occlusion to remove the glare of Sol just to see it, since it&#39;s so close it&#39;s in the glare.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to see it for two weeks now. That would make sense if it&#39;s swinging between earth and the sun, as the bright side would be away from us right now.</p>

<p>I suppose we&#39;ll see what happens by the end of the year. I don&#39;t know about an eclipse happening on the 23rd, but I suspect it will happen before this year is out.</p>

<p>Since we can&#39;t see infrared, we would only be able to see it if it&#39;s positioned behind the sun, like any other planet in our system. If Mercury or Venus were on the same side of the sun as us, we would not be able to see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to offend people with this and I&#39;m truly sorry if I do, but it&#39;s just my opinion from the research I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>I think Revelation and The New Testament altogether are setting up humanity for the False 2nd Coming of Christ. TPTB hijacked the Gnostic concept of a &quot;savior&quot; spirit and substituted their false Messiah (who may have actually been Lucifer or the anti-Christ). I&#39;ve noticed that the Gnostic sayings of Jesus don&#39;t line up with what&#39;s found in the Christian New Testament. These are different entities/people and one may be entirely fake. One says the Kingdom is within you, the other says he&#39;s coming to rule over his Kingdom which is amongst us (IMO the false reality matrix all around us).</p>

<p>The Da Vinci Code set the stage for us to believe that a lineage may have been created from Jesus of Nazareth that still survives to this day. I think they might try to tell us that the surviving lineage is with the Royal Family, and Prince William specifically has the blood of Jesus. </p>

<p>On September 23 a ritual will take place to allow the anti-Christ spirit to inhabit (voluntary possession) the body of Prince William. I&#39;m certain that the Great Tribulation is meant to bring a lot of fear into the minds of the masses and won&#39;t actually be the end of the world or anything so extreme. The False Flag of all False Flags?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how the truth is often times the opposite of what is presented. You think i&#39;m closed minded, but that is not the case at all. I am extremely open minded and have spent a stupid amount of time researching all sorts of things. I believe in the reality of many many things that even most Christians would call me &#39;crazy&#39; for, despite it being contained in the Bible that they claim to be truth as well (things such as the Nephilim (giants), demonic bloodlines, dragons, etc). I am probably one of the most open-minded Christians you have ever met.</p>

<p>Once you know the Truth, it becomes very east to spot the lies. One of those is demonically inspired gnosticism. So yes, I will always stand up and shit all over someone&#39;s false theory that promotes the Bible as false and a collection of stolen texts, while promoting gnosticism as truth. The sad thing is that in today&#39;s horribly fallen secular society (speaking from the Western world) the luke-warm Church and Christians that exist today have, for the most part, become complete pansies and cowards and are afraid to stand up for the truth anymore. In my opinion it&#39;s pathetic and disgusting (albeit was prophesied perfectly and not surprising). This world hates the Truth, always has.</p>

<p>Truth is a category unto itself. It is not &quot;fluid&quot; or &quot;relative&quot;. Personally I will always stand and call-out blasphemers and heretics that profane the Word of God and promote false demonic doctrines instead. This world is so far gone, we are in the last hour before the tribulation period starts, and i&#39;m so sick of hearing people call what is good, evil and what is evil, good and others defending it.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t come here to argue. Read the title of the post. I was just giving my opinion, my explanation of the significance of 9/23.

<p>If there were any credibility to this theory, I wouldn&#39;t have made my original comment calling anyone insane, but again, this whole thing is pretty simply debunked, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying what I&#39;m saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a cohesive theory or event so now I know you&#39;re just rambling. Why do you think so many people are posting here and asking for an explanation? If we could link them to a single book or document that would be great. We&#39;re just looking for clues and putting the puzzle pieces together though. We&#39;re also allowed to do this without having a formalized scientific theory to note, thanks.</p>

<p>Most people also don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the end of the world, at least not nearly as much as the 2012 Mayan Calendar fiasco or even 1999.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t believe I&#39;m a genius. I feel pretty stupid and inferior to everyone else most of the time, and that&#39;s why I read more every day. So I can stop being ignorant.</p>

I&#39;m open to anything that can&#39;t be explained, hence why a lot of my comments include that  I don&#39;t know what to say about the whole Jupiter inside Virgo for 42 weeks thing. I won&#39;t lie and say i have an explanation, I have a theory, but I&#39;m not asserting it. </p>

<p>I just also want to ensure the people reading these theories still have a grasp on reality, because 99% of the time they&#39;re untrue, and from personal experience, they can cause massive anxiety. </p>

<p>Your version of Judeo-Christianity, and most importantly whom Yeshua Ha&#39;Mashiach is hopelessly twisted. </p>

<p>I am a gentile that has been adopted into YHVH&#39;s family. Grafted in through the True Vine, Jesus Christ. I am not a goy, and have no interest in demonic texts such as the babylonian talmud. There&#39;s a reason Jesus called the Jews of that day the &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; and that &quot;their father is the devil&quot;.</p>

<p>That false sect of Judaism still masquerades today for there is nothing new under the sun.</p>

<p>The real Jews haven&#39;t been called home to Jerusalem yet, that is still future during the coming 7 yr Tribulation that begins soon (according to the DOZENS of signs that have all converged this very year). In fact one of them, of which this very thread is about, is only 2 days away. But, like most things in this world, it will go by completely un-noticed by the majority of people on this earth b/c they have their heads buried so far up their own ass, which is in turn buried in the sand all while they stick their fingers in their ears and go &quot;LALALALA, the Bible isn&#39;t true... Jesus isn&#39;t coming... There is no such thing as an apocalypse.. There is no devil... blah blah blah&quot;. There&#39;s some extremely hard Truth&#39;s coming down the pipeline that everyone is going to have to face very soon whether you want to or not.</p>
