        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There will be a TLDR at the bottom for the lazy people. </p>

<p>I certainly don’t like the idea and practice of subs that autoban people for participating in other subreddits. In fact that is technically against the reddit site rules, but of course admins look away on their “blessed” subreddits who do just this. I’m <strong>not</strong> advocating for an autoban just because you’ve posted or participated in <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> or other subs. I’d still want the bans to be human interactive to look at and weigh evidence, and not by bots. </p>

<p>There is a sub called <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> which loves to harass members of this community by also commenting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts. I want the free exchange of ideas and don’t want to necessarily shut them out. I am concerned over their ability to “troll” though without punishment. There is a user I see comment here frequently, that also participates frequently in TMR making fun of the same people they are supposedly “engaging with” in the comments. </p>

<p>Generally I just see this person here to stir up shit. They usually just have lots of downvotes, but they will continue to comment not dissuaded by the community’s reaction. In fact I’ve seen them flip flop on issues in comments just so they could rile up the other person. </p>

<p>To me this person is obviously here just to troll others participating in this sub, <em>looking for a genuine discussion</em>, so they feel bad and have emotion start to take over rather than thoughtful debates. </p>

<p>Can we make it a rule that if you spend a significant amount of time making fun of conspiracy theorists in other subreddits, that maybe they shouldn’t be allowed to come comment here? I’m open to other ideas too, I just think it’s crazy to have people who hate and make fun of conspiracy theories be on here making arguments and stirring shit up. There needs to be a clear line on if that is trolling behavior or not. </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> There are people in subreddits that are to specifically mock conspiracy theorists. Some of them also come to this subreddit and engage in comments but make the comments more about arguing and rage and less about debating and discussions. I think that is trolling and needs a clear way in which it would be addressed by mods. </p>

<p>Open to other thoughts and ideas too, even if you disagree with me!</p>

<p>EDIT: also sorry if the formatting and grammar sucks. I’m on mobile and will hopefully remember to fix it up later haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest Feedback, not meant to be insulting, just honest from my point of view:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some threads here are so mindboggingly stupid to more scientific/analytic/skeptic people. You have references to ghosts, the flat earth and other weird stuff here that overshadows some conspiracies that could actually be real.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very hard to have a pragmatic, skeptic and most importantly scientific discussion here without people calling you shill or sheep or whatever. That&#39;s why some people go to r/actualconspiracy, they actually have some rules in place that facilitate a healthy discussion and actually leads to somewhere</p></li>
<li><p>Some People here always praise themselves as having on open mind. However, to them, this mostly means believing in the opposite of Occams Razor. The possibility that sometimes the simple, not that exciting explanation for something is true is often dismissed, for example. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, this subreddit can be very frustrating. Everybody loves a good conspiracy theory, but the minimum requirements to believe something could be true varies a lot between people. And I think that is why TopMinds exists, people need to vent.</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t think they should harass you in any way. </p>

<p>I wished this sub would allow more &quot;checks and balances&quot; to keep people from wasting time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get some conspiracies are dumb. Like I really have a hard time believing flat earther’s aren’t some satirical joke gone wrong or something. I don’t think it should be <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>’s mod team who decides what’s allowed to be a conspiracy though. That should be up to the people upvoting and downvoting, but I get for heated discussions that doesn’t always allow for the best discussions as the hive mind tends to take over. </p>

<p>I’m also get why TopMinds exists because they don’t just point at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but other subreddits as well. Not saying ban all of the people there or whatever. That’s why my comment says I want a human mod to be the one who would be banning, so they can look at the substance of the persons posts and determine if they are just sick of flat earthers here and there, or if their agenda is just to fuck with all conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>I appreciate your feedback and thoughts. Though, to be honest, I’m not sure if anything you’re saying has to do with what I’m saying. I just want people who are only here to start arguments and get people angry (while actively making fun of conspiracy theorists in other subreddits) to be banned as trolls.</p>

<p>The humility each individual possesses varies greatly based on their maturity and self esteem. Many seem to feel they cannot entertain ideas without being totally devoted to them.</p>

Whatever the reason you&#39;re not going to be able to convert their thinking because they are not open to it. They come here to make fun of us. Pure and simple.</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t agree with it but at the end of the day it&#39;s their decision to use their energy and attention mocking others to make themselves feel better. I think that spending your energy in such a way is far more harmful then they think but good luck trying to tell them that. Let them have their fun because they, for the most part, seem like people who are at their core, uncertain and afraid of the world around them. A few who I&#39;ve gone through their post histories have posts about depression, porn addiction, and other such aliments that antagonising people over the internet only makes worse. But you can only offer to help people, not force it upon them.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be frustrating to those of us who have spent long enough doing our own research that have an idea of just how large and serious the problem with our whole society is. This is compounded by their attitudes. It&#39;s like trying to warn someone they&#39;re about to run off a cliff while they flip you off and call you stupid. But don&#39;t contribute to the problem by engaging them. I know it&#39;s easier said than done and I&#39;ve been guilty if it in the past as well.</p>

<p>Light and love, brothers and sisters. That&#39;s how we are going to help this. More hate and conflict is never the answer. </p>

<p>This is already the status quo with the rules as is. Report something and a human mod will review and adjudicate appropriately (hopefully). </p>
