       I got interested in all the conspiracy stuff about a month back after watching a video called "JFK to 9/11 Everything is a Rick Mans Lie" It was really well put together, but although it had good evidence to support that it was plausible, why would anyone do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the JFK assassination. Whats the point of assassinating that man and risking having it all fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about 9/11. You expect the US government to bomb the twin towers and pentagon by having americans involved in a terrorist act. We would have heard more stories coming out about it then just a few people saying outrageous claims that it really did happen. Maybe I'm just dumb, but on that scale with such risks, why? To start a war? And then whats the point of starting a war? Getting money? Unless I'm just stupid, putting that much risk into getting money or face getting killed, thats not worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the CIA being a cocaine business. Why haven't we heard of this? Wouldn't some article or someone come out about this by now?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess I'm asking is it all just for money? Are humans really that fucking stupid to start wars and kill civilians to get more money on top of there huge fucking wallets?
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading back over what I typed, I sound pretty dumb. Sorry I was just dumping words out. But I'm still curious.

       In a very brief nutshell, you have
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       wicked elites ruling the world.  They are Satanists, pushing a globalist "New World Order" agenda that essentially wants to enslave and mass murder the masses (achieving the aims of Satan and the fallen angels).  Yes, they are taking a risk by perpetrating all of their many crimes.  So do common criminals.  That doesn't mean common criminals don't exist.  We just have criminals running things.

       But the elites are risking like 1,000,000 times more than a common thug. They are risking billions or even trillions of dollars and world power. Criminals are only risking like 100 dollars and a few dozen years in prison.

       I get what you're saying but the CIA guys must have some morals. They aren't controlling the world like those who order them around. They are common people. I would hope that people can speak out about shit that's brainwashing most of western society then worry about themselves. Or maybe that's just too optimistic.

       There are whistleblowers from many different walks of life.  They're silenced pretty quickly by character assassination, trumped up charges, ignoring them, or outright murder.  People pretend that there aren't whistleblowers, but there are.  They're just labeled quacks, liars, criminals, etc.  And I hats not including the

       I know but this whole thing is fucking with me. Litterally everything I was taught when I was younger is being said wrong by these conspiracies. It's hard for me to just admit that the world is fucked up because everyday you have the media bitching about some stupid identity politics while calling people like you crazy lunatics. It's hard to know what is right.

       It's a lot to process.  It can take years, to sort it out, and maintain some amount of sanity (or not...).  One step at a time.  Building 7 opened my eyes to the depravity of our government, then the rest of 9/11.  Once you start to realize all the different players involved (media, politicians, agencies, governments), it gets pretty damn overwhelming.  Sometimes you just have to step outside and breath a little.

       I would rather have my old life back before when I couldn't care less about what the government was doing. It all made sense on a basic level. Now I just find myself questioning EVERYTHING that governments have done and are doing now. I can't even believe the media or anything. It's fucking awful doubting everything. And for what? If you start an uprising you will be killed. There is no way to stop the US or any other western government because they will use every asset to silence you and convince the populace that they are right via the msm.

       It's a tough spot to be in.  I hope you hang in there.  Don't get lost in the rabbit hole :)  It can be a never-ending source of stress and confusion.  I'd still rather know, than not, and if enough people figure out what's going on, maybe we'll be in a better spot to do something about it.

       it gets really stressful I feel till you get into even bigger conspiracies. if we are all just one person playing different parts of the same play if we are all just energy vibrating at different frequencies if we know what we all really are then none of the politics really matter. its weird but I think ancient civilizations or cosmic conspiracies are soothing.

       A person can get there, but it tends to be a long process, and can have all sorts of ups and downs, over the years.  It was tough for me.  I was 100% blue pilled.  Even joined the army after, and because of 9/11.  It wasn't until shortly after, that I realized how utterly used and deceived I was.  It wasn't an easy thing to deal with.

       Weather or not we are aware of it while we are on it, it is a spiritual journey. Eventually you see the bigger picture or at least become aware of its existence. I know that there is constant distractions with other puzzles we are tasked with but it always boils back down to that bigger picture. Is it god or the spirit of the universe or gia or whatever it is who knows exactly but I know whatever it is, it is. I have some pretty good ideas and I have learned a lot and I hope to share what I've been through to help guide others to find the path I found that lead me to where I am. Take the red pill. Don't get discouraged. You are not alone.

       Do you really believe that? Simply raise your awareness. Stop caring. Keep questioning. Care about the truth. But recognize the fundamental truth that
       <em>
        none of it even matters.
       </em>
       Look up Steven Greer and the disclosure project. It goes further than simple consolidation of wealth and power in rich mans trick. It goes deep into the human psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been suppressed. We have been conditioned. Understand your mind. Understand the minds around you. Have you seen the movie Cloud Atlas? If not, watch it and study it. Ideas are timeless. The truth is timeless. Consciousness is timeless. Synchronicity is real, it is God. Use your time here on this planet to tap into the flow of synchronicity, learn the truth about the universe and about consciousness and the forces that drive them, from fear to love.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're legit, feel free to pm me. But why should you care about believing the media? Does that change the facts? The fact is that 9/11 happened, it was planned and coordinated by the same group of people who killed JFK, and for similar reasons. It's the truth. It's powerful. Take responsibility for it, and you will be happy.

       Omg the advice on here is criminal and absurd.
You want confidence in the accuracy of your worldview?
You test it, you measure it, you falsify it.
You test its Predictive Power.
Hint: Physical Material Mechanical Reality is the only reality that can predict the future..Repeatedly again and again. Its also the only reality that doesnt measure Zero.  Place your certainty In that, a  material reality that can accualy be measured and validated and predicted. and then recognizing bullshit is magnitudes easier.

       "Waking up" is a process, it is painful, it will make you angry, sad, depressed, but eventually this goes away, and you're left with the basics, the things that are important to you, like your family, your health and theirs etc. You will quit the rat race, you will stop spending money you don't have on things you don't need to impress people you don't like. Keep asking questions, remember those at the top think they are smarter and better than you, and they have for many generations been planning your slow imprisonment of your mind and body.

      <p>
       It’s said JFK was prepared to release a lot of secret information relating to ETs and free energy devices.  The secretive elite were willing to kill him for that because releasing that information would have entirely done away with their ability to continue parasitizing off the masses.  It would have taken away their power to an absolutely massive extent.

        What about 9/11. You expect the US government to bomb the twin towers and pentagon by having americans involved in a terrorist act.

To start a war?
       </p>

      <p>
       It’s not just to start any war.  It’s a constant, perpetual war that’s been going on for over 15 years now.  That constant, perpetual war has made quite a few manufacturers absolute billionaires.  There’s a lot of money in selling war.  Additionally, it’s also a lot easier to control and continue manipulating the masses if they’re agitated and at war with and constantly at odds with one another…and this is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what a perpetual state of war does to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fearful, angry, violent, and afraid people don’t generally look up from their fighting to realize that we are all one.  The masses won’t all come together and fight the real perpetrator -
       <em>

       We have.  Some of us absolutely have.  It just doesn’t get any real air or MSM time because the MSM isn’t about reporting reality and truth.  It’s generally about reporting sensationalism and fake news, and keeping the population agitated, scared, and on edge.
       <em>

      <p>
       No.  It’s about power and control over the masses by the elite - who are the managers of this civilization (not the rulers, mind you…just the managers of it).  Money is just the means they use to manipulate things toward that end.

       The reason is money and power. There are resources to be taken and foreign governments to destabilize in order to protect the petro-dollar and existing positions of power as well as further increase wealth. And let us not forget that we are easily controlled through fear. All of this was achieved through the incidents you have mentioned.
As I am to understand, JFK was working on eliminating the FED to keep the big banks from taking over the world economy. Also.... as one very delightfully slimy GOT character said, "Chaos is a ladder." I'm guessing that if the conspiracies you've mentioned do turn out to be true it was not because of a sense of patriotism, concern for the worlds people, or to do "the right thing."  It was because of greed of power and wealth.
