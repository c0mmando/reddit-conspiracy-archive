        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I got interested in all the conspiracy stuff about a month back after watching a video called &quot;JFK to 9/11 Everything is a Rick Mans Lie&quot; It was really well put together, but although it had good evidence to support that it was plausible, why would anyone do it? </p>

<p>Take the JFK assassination. Whats the point of assassinating that man and risking having it all fall apart. </p>

<p>What about 9/11. You expect the US government to bomb the twin towers and pentagon by having americans involved in a terrorist act. We would have heard more stories coming out about it then just a few people saying outrageous claims that it really did happen. Maybe I&#39;m just dumb, but on that scale with such risks, why? To start a war? And then whats the point of starting a war? Getting money? Unless I&#39;m just stupid, putting that much risk into getting money or face getting killed, thats not worth it.</p>

<p>And then the CIA being a cocaine business. Why haven&#39;t we heard of this? Wouldn&#39;t some article or someone come out about this by now?</p>

<p>So I guess I&#39;m asking is it all just for money? Are humans really that fucking stupid to start wars and kill civilians to get more money on top of there huge fucking wallets?</p>

<p>After reading back over what I typed, I sound pretty dumb. Sorry I was just dumping words out. But I&#39;m still curious.</p>

They are Satanists, pushing a globalist &quot;New World Order&quot; agenda that essentially wants to enslave and mass murder the masses (achieving the aims of Satan and the fallen angels).  Yes, they are taking a risk by perpetrating all of their many crimes.  So do common criminals.  That doesn&#39;t mean common criminals don&#39;t exist.  We just have criminals running things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot to process.  It can take years, to sort it out, and maintain some amount of sanity (or not...).  One step at a time.  Building 7 opened my eyes to the depravity of our government, then the rest of 9/11.  Once you start to realize all the different players involved (media, politicians, agencies, governments), it gets pretty damn overwhelming.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really believe that? Simply raise your awareness. Stop caring. Keep questioning. Care about the truth. But recognize the fundamental truth that <em>none of it even matters.</em> Look up Steven Greer and the disclosure project. It goes further than simple consolidation of wealth and power in rich mans trick. It goes deep into the human psyche. </p>

<p>We have been suppressed. We have been conditioned. Understand your mind. Understand the minds around you. Have you seen the movie Cloud Atlas? If not, watch it and study it. Ideas are timeless. The truth is timeless. Consciousness is timeless. Synchronicity is real, it is God. Use your time here on this planet to tap into the flow of synchronicity, learn the truth about the universe and about consciousness and the forces that drive them, from fear to love. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re legit, feel free to pm me. But why should you care about believing the media? Does that change the facts? The fact is that 9/11 happened, it was planned and coordinated by the same group of people who killed JFK, and for similar reasons. It&#39;s the truth. It&#39;s powerful. Take responsibility for it, and you will be happy. </p>

You want confidence in the accuracy of your worldview?
You test it, you measure it, you falsify it.
You test its Predictive Power.
Hint: Physical Material Mechanical Reality is the only reality that can predict the future..Repeatedly again and again. Its also the only reality that doesnt measure Zero.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the why, power and maintaining control over a rapidly changing world. Money is nothing to them but a symbol, and it allows them to buy people off.   </p>

<p>As far as risk goes, they&#39;re really not risking anything. They are the law, and the common people can&#39;t do a fuckin&#39; thing about it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why would anyone do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Power and control by a secretive elite over the throng of the masses they manipulate and parasite off of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take the JFK assassination. Whats the point of assassinating that man and risking having it all fall apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s said JFK was prepared to release a lot of secret information relating to ETs and free energy devices.  The secretive elite were willing to kill him for that because releasing that information would have entirely done away with their ability to continue parasitizing off the masses.  It would have taken away their power to an absolutely massive extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about 9/11. You expect the US government to bomb the twin towers and pentagon by having americans involved in a terrorist act. We would have heard more stories coming out about it then just a few people saying outrageous claims that it really did happen. Maybe I&#39;m just dumb, but on that scale with such risks, why? To start a war?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not just to start any war.  It’s a constant, perpetual war that’s been going on for over 15 years now.  That constant, perpetual war has made quite a few manufacturers absolute billionaires.  There’s a lot of money in selling war.  Additionally, it’s also a lot easier to control and continue manipulating the masses if they’re agitated and at war with and constantly at odds with one another…and this is <em>exactly</em> what a perpetual state of war does to the masses.</p>

<p>Fearful, angry, violent, and afraid people don’t generally look up from their fighting to realize that we are all one.  The masses won’t all come together and fight the real perpetrator - <em>together</em> - who’s being responsible for our hating one another over false, indoctrinated ideas in the first place.</p>

<p>It’s easy to control dogs who too busy fighting one another to realize who’s manipulating them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then whats the point of starting a war? Getting money? Unless I&#39;m just stupid, putting that much risk into getting money or face getting killed, thats not worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re not stupid, but it’s a lot more complicated than just “war and money”…although it is on a certain superficial level <em>about</em> war and money.  It goes much deeper than that though.</p>

<p>It’s about control and power over the population as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then the CIA being a cocaine business. Why haven&#39;t we heard of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have.  Some of us absolutely have.  It just doesn’t get any real air or MSM time because the MSM isn’t about reporting reality and truth.  It’s generally about reporting sensationalism and fake news, and keeping the population agitated, scared, and on edge.  <em>That’s</em> their job - not reporting truth, but keeping the population consistently agitated, controlled, and at odds with themselves and each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t some article or someone come out about this by now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  They’re owned by the CIA, the military industrial complex, the deep state, and the shadow government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I guess I&#39;m asking is it all just for money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It’s about power and control over the masses by the elite - who are the managers of this civilization (not the rulers, mind you…just the managers of it).  Money is just the means they use to manipulate things toward that end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are humans really that fucking stupid to start wars and kill civilians to get more money on top of there huge fucking wallets?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, humans are malleable.  They can be manipulated to do great good or great harm (to themselves and others)…and humanity is getting/has been <em>greatly</em> manipulated for quite a long, long time now.</p>

<p>By whom?</p>

<p>Well…shit gets deep, very deep, so get ready, but <a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">this pdf book right here</a> gives a <em>lot</em> of information as to what’s really going on at a much deeper level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading back over what I typed, I sound pretty dumb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you don’t, man.  Not at all.</p>

<p>And trust me, ask anybody who’s been in this sub for a spell.  I’m <em>real</em> fast to call someone a stupid ass motherfucker if they are in fact being that.</p>

<p>You’re not being that at all.  There are just a lot of things you don’t know.  Big deal.  Nothing wrong with that.  There’s tons of stuff I don’t know and that <em>all</em> of us don’t know.  The important thing is to A) <em>know</em> that there’s a lot you still don’t know (i.e. don’t be hubristic), and B) be very willing to learn as much as possible about what’s actually going on around you.</p>

<p>The fact that you came on here and <em>aren’t</em> sounding like some know it all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcja4WFFzDw">faggot</a> is a good indication that you are open to learning new information - and this is good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry I was just dumping words out. But I&#39;m still curious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need to apologize.  All good.</p>

<p>Upvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason is money and power. There are resources to be taken and foreign governments to destabilize in order to protect the petro-dollar and existing positions of power as well as further increase wealth. And let us not forget that we are easily controlled through fear. All of this was achieved through the incidents you have mentioned.
As I am to understand, JFK was working on eliminating the FED to keep the big banks from taking over the world economy. Also.... as one very delightfully slimy GOT character said, &quot;Chaos is a ladder.&quot; I&#39;m guessing that if the conspiracies you&#39;ve mentioned do turn out to be true it was not because of a sense of patriotism, concern for the worlds people, or to do &quot;the right thing.&quot;  It was because of greed of power and wealth.</p>
