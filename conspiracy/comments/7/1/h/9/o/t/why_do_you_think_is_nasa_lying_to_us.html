       Perhaps an old subject, but i still find it exciting to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What could be the purpose behind all the NASA lies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking particularly about the moon landings, or the round vs flat earth theories, but about almost everything they show us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was exploring through NASA website planet directory, and after years i finally made up my mind and realized that something very fishy is happening with this agency. 
I mean, most of the pictures took by various suppossed missions like challenger, curiosity or voyager made me feel like they're hiding something, and sometimes like they've been almost hand-crafted perfectly to fit a determinated standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, just to clarify, im not a flat earther and i do not support any of those theories, i actually believe the earth is round and probably 40-50% of the historical astronomical data we have learned throughout the ages is accurate, but the question is... what's up with that 50% missing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they have the need to feed us with lies about our universe? 
Why can't they disclose everything and be open about it?
Why after 60 years of research and countless missions including supposed moon landings it feels like we have very little knowledge about our solar system? 
Why everything we see in NASA pictures of mars is rocks and sand? do you think that's all there is? is our universe really that fucking uninteresting or is just the way they want us to see it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think?

       Well, there's plenty of reasons, too much to say them all in one comment to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the ones that shocked me the most are the photoshopped pictures of earth and various planets, the reason why they never went back to the moon after Apollo 17, which is (and this is a quote from Don Pettit himself) "Well, we used to have the technology, but we destroyed it and now its a painful process to rebuild it again, so thats why" (?!).
      </p>
      <p>
       They also "lost" the original footage from the first Apollo mission, i mean, they literally destroyed the evidence from the supposded one -if not the most- important achievement in human history, and the reason for that is? they never said it, i guess they were just a bunch of old videotapes huh? who cares?.
      </p>
      <p>
       You got the Voyager thing too, they sent a probe 40 years ago which is still sending data to this day, or at least, thats the official statement, but they cant take a clean picture of the Earth (one thats not photoshopped) or explain some basic stuff.

       Photoshopped pictures of earth means composite images, a satellite moves around, takes pictures, they stitch them together to make one big image - the same goes for pictures of other planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pettit's comment is accurate and simple. When you go to the moon, you don't take that entire rocket they launch. Stages separate, falling away into orbit/burning up in the atmosphere. The only bit that comes back to earth is the very tip of the rocket. It is a huge technological/engineering project to make a rocket that can go to the moon. It's not like satellites, those go in low earth orbit. The moon is 240,000 miles away, low earth orbit is 1,200 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voyager was designed to leave the solar system while transmitting data as long as could - whats the problem, it's a successful mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       What footage are you talking about? You can watch videos on youtube of the first apollo mission...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what basic stuff you think they can't explain, can you give me examples?

       Well, i want to see a full picture of the Earth without composition, photoshop or anything like that, just a clean shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still cant believe that's the reason considering the enormous budget they had since 1973 until this day to made it happen, we're talking about trillions of dollars, the Apollo program "successfully" (or should i say, suppossedly) landed 4 different missions on the moon in a period of 5 years, i think the reason behind it has nothing to do with money or time, and needless to say technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding the Apollo footage, im talking about the real film, the one they watched on ground control, not the one that was streamed to the TV (which is the one you find nowadays on youtube, the one disney remastered and enhanced).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do i really need to give examples of things NASA cant explain?

       Before you call it a photoshop, they take pictures in specific wavelengths of light. This is the red,blue,green wavelength pictures on top of one another. Full earth, one frame, no stitching anything together. They do specific bands of light because the camera takes a number of pictures of different light frequencies (infared, ultraviolet, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what video that is, I wouldn't have even assumed they were watching a video in ground control outside of ground mounted cameras and stuff sent back once the ship was stationary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you'd expect NASA to have all the answers about space to begin with. Most universities have astrophysics departments doing research on space. Like, if something isn't know that doesn't mean it's being suppressed. Someone has to figuring it out. I figured you had some anomaly or something specific, not that NASA isn't an all knowing research facility. You don't think that's a bit much to ask? All the answers in the universe?

       They actually plan to, as they keep saying that moon is a priority before Mars, yet they never returned.

       Haha, no they said it's a pain to make a rocket that can go to the moon. They absolutely can replicate it, there just isn't really a pressing reason to go there when low/zero grav experiments can be done on the ISS.

       Here's their mission statement:

       That quote is out of context, it has nothing to do with what we are discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You dont need to hear it from me, they always stated that going back to the moon it's a priority and should serve as a preparation for future planet colonizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it actually makes sense because if you think about an expansion of the human race through space and colonization of other planets, and more specifically mars, which is they're primordial objective, there's no better place than our moon to start with it.

       You know how /they/ do not want us to know the truth about 9/11, how they don't want us to know the truth about the birth of Human existence? Well they don't want us to know the truth about the universe and our reality. No, I don't mean some hippy new-age shit. NASA is another gatekeeper. We have to think rationally yet questioningly which is very hard to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they are hiding can be small, or it can be huge. Perhaps they are hiding the fact that Greys, or some form of aliens exist. Maybe they are hiding the fact that there is no 'space' and our entire reality and concept of floating planets orbiting stars within arms of galaxies floating in clusters in a massive vacuum is not true. Maybe they're hiding the fact that we cannot truly escape Earth's atmosphere (ISS is still within it, so past that).

       If you think the stuff discovered by NASA is uninteresting I can't really help that, because a huge number of people find it really really interesting. NASA isn't a monolith, it's made up of...normal humans. People like exploration and discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they discovered alien life we would absolutely be told - but it'd probably be a little disappointing for people because the best we could hope for is detecting radio/EM waves from somewhere else. Distances between stuff are too great.

       It's more like a philosophical thing than actually an argument but the way i feel it is something like:
      </p>
      <p>
       We're living in a tiny world compared in scale with what space seems to be, and yet there's so many things to discover, so many exciting things to see.
You can go from America to Europe, from there to Africa, and nature is constantly showing you how powerful and amazing it can be, we live in a wonderful world full of mysteries and beauties, and we still have things to discover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now , if we can even begin to grasp the idea of what space REALLY is or how it looks like, how many planets or civilizations are out there, is something that when you think about it, when you imagine it, feels exciting, if its just a piece of what Earth is, then it should be awesome, thats for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet when i see pictures or read data collected from NASA in this 60 years of continous research of our solar system, that excitement falls apart quickly, because all i see is a cold, dark place full of empty lifeless planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i think there's something missing, i can feel it, thats not all there is, it cant be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe i just feel dissapointed because reality is not what i expected, but there's something telling me thats not all, there something else out there. 
Either they know and dont want to show us for whatever reason, or they dont have a clue because they never went past low earth's orbit and the moon landings, the mars rover, and all that crap is just FUD, which if you start to think about it, there's plenty of political reasons for them to lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i dont know, maybe im delusional, and our universe is just that, some cold and dangerous place where we dont belong, and we are bound to this earth forever, who knows.

       I guess you could say that, but no, thats not exactly why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I clearly stated the reasons why i think they are lying, i did on the first post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been proved they photoshopped/faked a lot of the material they released to the public as real, and never expalined why.
It's undeniable the amount of proof sorrounding the moon landings being a hoax, hence why they never returned, and when you throw politics into that mix, it starts to make sence on why they would lie on such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, im not saying they lying about everything, but you can be damn sure they're not telling the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tell me, do you believe in everything they say? you think every thing NASA stated in the past 60 years is the undeniable truth about our universe? You think they dont have any political agenda, any reason, to lie to us?

       It's just the way they want us to see it imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had disclosed what they knew and eventually found in the solar system back in the Twentieth century the fear and reverberations of the impact of that (something along the lines of "Aliens Scully!", with artifacts and other entities, bases, craft etc. That is, if those stories are true. From my point of view they are feasible, and likely true), would have probably disabled society, the force and flow of whole economies, the control of knowledges pertaining to certain kinds of technological development and exploitation made possible through certain discoveries, and beyond that, various institutions of control. This control has been on a massive scale, of knowledge, of wealth, of resources, of means, of a certain lifestyle and systems, of accessibility and comfort, of power and influence. All of that would have become scrutinized and likely stripped from private or small group access and turned over to the public domain to varying degrees, meanwhile other systems and insitutions such as Wall Street, NASA itself,various centers of religious power, etc would have also become destablised. The truth pulls apart and dissolves what is false and organised oppositionally towards it, eventually if not immediately (as after a sword slicing through an object unable to resist the force of the swords action).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that deception or non-exposure of truth has compounded and now even less can be said for it implicates numerous individuals and agencies complicitly in other kinds of crimes, such as removal of said artefacts, and employment of NASA tech for research that is criminally against humanity., ie., bioweapons development in weightless conditions, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its complex. And the insitutions involved appear to be factionalised themselves, the elite and the bodies that they work through are not monolithically aligned. That would go for NASA also. Information on a need-to-know and security clearance basis and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       They lose much if there is full disclosure. And the world becomes both very weird for the hard materialists and rationalists (who run and control all sorts of structures and processes in society, across military and monetary interests), and even now, perhaps more unstable.

       Yeah looked at that website, that dudes wrong. Light acts like a wave in some situations and a particle others. Double slit it acts like a wave. Stuff like Röntgen it acts like a particle. Also don't know how that proves Einstein wrong, photoelectric effect only works if you assume photons are particles.

       We live in a dome on a flat earth, created by the Almighty to imprison Lucifer. Our souls are continuously reincarnated into this dimension to either: surrender your soul to the devil and become part of his army for armageddon or become enlightened and never return to earth(hell)...we've never left earth, we cant get to the moon 50yrs after we supposedly went there! its all excuses and bad photography. Nasa gives us clues to its origin and purpose. Earths tilt is

       Honestly I think the only shit they faked was early in the space program.

       They definitely played around with how to fake space photos but I think thats a product of them attempting to fuck with the Russians.

       Let's say the video we have of the moon landing is fake, but we actually did go to the moon. Now that's something I think about from time to time.

       There has always been a lot of NASA shill activity in this sub, expect to be down voted for questioning its legitimacy. That being said, they are hiding that earth is a closed system, and NASA has only been to outer-earth orbit, what we know as "space" is pure science-fiction, all Hubble telescope imagines are CGI, how anyone can believe we landed on the moon in 1969 using what looks to be a tinfoil outhouse, is really funny, and sad at the same time. Why would they go through the trouble to construct such elaborate hoaxes? The simple answer is control of perception, the complex answer, you need to figure out for yourself.

       I guess you could say that, but no, thats not exactly why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I clearly stated the reasons why i think they are lying, i did on the first post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been proved they photoshopped/faked a lot of the material they released to the public as real, and never expalined why.
It's undeniable the amount of proof sorrounding the moon landings being a hoax, hence why they never returned, and when you throw politics into that mix, it starts to make sence on why they would lie on such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, im not saying they lying about everything, but you can be damn sure they're not telling the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tell me, do you believe in everything they say? you think every thing NASA stated in the past 60 years is the undeniable truth about our universe? You think they dont have any political agenda, any reason, to lie to us?

       Don't give the NASA fanboys ideas, they'll be lobbying to raise taxes. How about let's start with the Moon? All that money we should be able to send something up there, if not people.
