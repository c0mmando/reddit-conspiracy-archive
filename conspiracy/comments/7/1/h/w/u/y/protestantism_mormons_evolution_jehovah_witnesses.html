       <strong>
        Sects and Ordo Illuminatus
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The original and real meaning of sect is the commandment to unconditionally OBEY the elders, who in fact, in the case of the Ordo Illuminatus, are as many as ONE, the Illuminati Grand Master.
       <br/>
       In other words: the Ordo Illuminatus is not only a sect but also a perfect pyramid.
       <br/>
       A sectarian religion is not necessarily a sect.
       <br/>
       But ANY sect is more sectarian than ANY religion that is not a sect.

       <strong>
        Protestantism, Mormon Church, Evolution "science" alias church, Jehovah witnesses, Scientology: Religions created by the illuminati: basic principle and organization
       </strong>
       <br/>
       All religions created by the illuminati were strongly sectarian, starting with the first major religion they created, Protestantism.
       <br/>
       All religions created later by the illuminati, with the exception of evolution theory for obvious reasons (not created as an official religion), were additionally organized as a sect (recently: Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses, Scientology).
       <br/>
       The first reason for creating sects: ensure robotical control of believers.
       <br/>
       As for evolution, this control is completed by other means, starting by preventing the members of the church (everybody) to be confronted with the truth by simply never ever allowing evolution to be questioned in schools and media.

        That does not sound very logical. If robotic control is the objective, why start so many directly opposed religions, having only one would be more manageable.

       I would have thought that Catholicism was the Illuminati "Christian" religion, when it was combined with paganism by Emperor Constantine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Protestantism was formed against Catholicism.

       My understanding is that Constantine passed an edict (law?) establishing tolerance for Christianity in the Roman Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theodosius than made it the state religion.

      <p>
       Council of Nicaea decided what literature would be included in the official Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inclusion of pagan practices took place over a long period of time as Catholic Church sought to gain converts and keep the religion growing.

       There are no pagan practices in the Catholic Church.  There are some who are not orthodox in their beliefs or praxis, but all the teachings of the Catholic Church are biblical and follow sacred tradition.

       Praying to Mary, the mother, queen of heaven, etc, to intercede, is a pagan practice.  Confessing to a fellow man, is not a biblical practice.  Those are two of the main issues as I know of, but I'm not Catholic so I can't say definitively on all of the teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that that teachings are rooted in, and are the majority of, the biblical teachings.

      <p>
       That's my understanding too.  Though I believe that's only half of the story, as the pagan beliefs weren't tossed out, so that when Theodosius made it the state religion, "it" was a conjunction between the two practices - half Christian, half pagan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Council of Nicaea confirmed that religion/denomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is, is that the half-pagan practices/beliefs of Catholicism denomination of Christianity came from Rome, which my understanding is that the Illuminati are part of Mystery Babylon that the book of Revelation speaks of, which includes the Roman Empire beliefs.

       <strong>
        Discarding alternatives
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Protestantism was created by the illuminati so in reality protestant churches can't be considered Christian denominations and can be discarded from the start.
       <br/>
       Stripping the table from these "denominations" (Anglican, Reformed, Lutheran) doesn't eliminate any of its columns.
       <br/>
       The question is not posed in the plural, what implies that only ONE of the remaining alternatives is correct and this doesn't exclude any of the four possible answers left:
       <br/>
       - Jewish (Talmudic);
       <br/>
       - Orthodox Christian;
       <br/>
       - Catholic as well as using the same generalization as the table;
       <br/>
       Then what's left in the second column:
       <br/>
       - other Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, which one is it?
       <br/>
       The answer is as simple as this: what you would expect from the Laws of End Times Reductionism.
      </p>

       <br/>
       Commandments: illuminati v Bible: the one and only literal parallelism:
       <br/>
       The first commandment of the illuminati religion implies for believers a parallelism to what one of the Bible's ten commandments implies for Jews and Christians.
       <br/>
       "Coincidence": in both cases the source for this implication is their first commandment.
       <br/>
       The parallelism, obviously only apparent, appears if the implied commandment is stated using the CREATOR word.
       <br/>
       In reality and as in other any other comparison of the same type, it's the opposite. All it takes is to precise the CREATOR with either satan (by illuminati religion's believers) or by God (by Bible believers).

       Huh.  So what is Eastern Orthodoxy, then?  Chopped liver?
      </p>
      <p>
       See, they have the same Bible and the same Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  They also a chain of Bishops that goes back to the Apostles.  They just decided that the Pope wasn't the only Bishop that rules over all Christendom.  So why should I believe you instead of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       See, that whole schism in 1054 makes this claim as pointless grandstanding.  If the Orthodox aren't "original" then you aren't.  If they are, that doesn't mean that Protestants aren't either because we all teach Christ crucified.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you did here is a petty "I'm better than you" tactic.  It's something you Catholics have been using to attack the the legitimacy of Protestants as Christians since 1521.  You seem to think that by doing this, we Protestants will lose our courage to resist your manufactured title claim and we will just crawl back to the Papacy.  But I'm calling this out for what it is.  Propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Lutheran, I'm already livid at the blatant lie that OP made here about us.  But here you come to pat him on the back and give him a helping hand.  This is predatory.  And it seems to confirm my
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71hwuy/protestantism_mormons_evolution_jehovah_witnesses/dnb7xiw/">
        conspiracy theory

       that I stated below.  Catholics use exactly this method to sow dissent against Protestant soteriology for their own gain.

       If you had any honor, you'd recognize that the poison you're crafting here is being used against you also.  By cheapening the concept of "faith" you've fostered the growth of anti-religious beliefs of every kind.  All to punish Martin Luther and those who agreed with his view of Christianity because you cannot fleece them into joining your sect.

       Well, I don't see you correcting any misconceptions with your claim that "Catholicism is the original Christianity" and you're certainly feeding the anti-Protestant atmosphere that OP has created.  What do you think I should have seen your post as?

       1) You should know that 'catholic' simply means 'universal'.  It comes from the Greek word 'καθολικός (katholikos).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) As early as the 1st C., Christians were referring to themselves as 'universal' or 'catholics'.   It was just a designation meaning 'for the universal body of Christians'. Here is
       <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm">
        Ignatius of Antioch
       </a>
       writing from 107 A.D. using the term 'catholic', as well as presenting a thoroughly catholic understanding of the eucharist.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The 'Roman' part of the name got tacked on because of course the birth of Christianity occurred within what was then the Roman Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The Great Schism shifted the use of the word 'Roman Catholic' to the Western part of the Empire and 'Byzantine' to the Eastern part.  Of course the Byzantine is today better known as 'Orthodox'.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) While some of what caused the Great Schism involved the filioque clause, the better part (and we see this affecting the Orthodox Churches even today) of the controversy was over submission to a bishop with primacy, that is, the bishop of Rome.  Yet we see that the bishop of Rome has had primacy however since the book of Acts, chapter 15, where St. Peter is called upon at the First Council, the Council of Jerusalem.  So the see of Peter traces its roots back to the earliest days of the Church and to Peter.  We also have, of course, Our Lord, making Peter essentially 'prime minister' of His Kingdom in Mt. 16:18.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Orthodox (or Protestants) rejected the primacy of the bishop of Rome, they therefore rejected the Biblical precedent set up by Jesus Himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is saying that Orthodox or protestants might not also be Christians.  Only that they are Christians in imperfect communion with the Church that Christ founded.

      <p>
       I agree wholeheartedly with these statements that I've cited.  I can't really vouch for the discussion of the evolution of the terms Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox as you discuss, but they seem reasonable enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let me clarify.  I've got no objection to the
       <em>
        word
       </em>
       catholic.  We ourselves use it in our doctrinal corpus because they contain the Ecumenical
       <a href="http://www.bookofconcord.org/creeds.php">
        Creeds
       </a>
       .  The term is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a connotative implication which Roman Catholicism does not distance itself from that subtly suggests that the "universal Christian faith" consists ultimately of the churches that submit to the Roman Pontiff
       <em>
        exclusively
       </em>
       and that those that aren't are somehow in an inferior communion.  This connotation is one of the elements of the objection that you've rightly identified.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the sense we would use the term
       <em>
        catholic
       </em>
       , it refers to the invisible communion that all Christians have regardless of their denomination or sect.  We may believe ours is the most accurate interpretation, but we don't reject that other Christians are just as worthy to be called that.   You've mollified this part of my objection when you say "No one is saying that Orthodox or protestants might not also be Christians."  We reject your Pontiff's claims about his authority, but we vigorously maintain our membership in the Body of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is what leads to the real focus of my concern and what led me to make the post initially.  You said "The OP is correct about the other 'denominations'."  When it is coupled with the above connotation, it appears like you're giving ammunition to OP making these spurious claims which claim that Protestantism is an invention of devil worshipers.  Absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       That you chose to back his statement in this way is what led to my response.  All the rest of my objections rest upon the Treatise on the Power and Primacy which rejects the Papal claim and sees it acting in a manner hostile to Christianity.  A fact I hold no Catholic, even the Pope, directly guilty of.  That point is merely a matter of doctrine.

       They are.  There is no salvation outside the catholic Church.  To the extent that protestant and orthodox believers have salvation and communion with Christ, it is because elements of the Catholic faith have seeped out of the 'four walls' so to speak of the Church proper. Our Lord, who is rich in mercy, has brought people to Himself even though they are in imperfect communion with His Church.
      </p>
      <p>
       This 'seepage' is due to the heretical and nefarious influence of conversos, marranos, and illuminati who bolstered up half-truths and false claims and made them appealing to certain Catholic dissidents (ie - from what I understand,  moreso the case of Calvin than of Luther).

       Anything good in protestantism is there because of what it retained from Catholicism.   Anything bad in protestantism is there because of what it picked up from these nefarious elements.

       Salvation only comes from Jesus/Yeshua Christ, no matter the body of believers ("church", aka denomination).  The people do not save the people, God-the-Son/Messiah Jesus/Yeshua is the salvation, and by grace alone, not works.

       Jesus is the founder of the Catholic Church, so yes, that means salvation through Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are saved by grace alone, but not by a grace that stays alone.  Our Lord says to "produce fruit in keeping with repentance."   Plenty of Bible passages state that we are to use that grace to good effect.

       I am paying attention to scriptures.  I quoted scripture in another reply to you:
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 24:5 "5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
Acts 9:2 "2 and [Saul who became Paul] asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem,"
Acts 11:26 "26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch,"
Colossians 3:12-13 "12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; 13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."
      </p>
      <p>
       Please pay attention to scriptures also.  Where in scripture does it state the word "catholic"?

       No thanks, I'm firm in my non-denominational beliefs.

      <p>
       I don't pray to Mary to intercede, as that is Jesus' job to intercede to God-the-Father, nor do I confess to a man who I've done no wrong to (ask forgiveness from Jesus directly and the person I wronged).

       You are misunderstanding that.

       I said that the Catholic Church has 'seeped out' of her four walls, so to speak.  There is no salvation outside the Catholic Church.

       However, the Church has been fragmented or has seeped out into the factions you describe.

       Not from what I've heard.  They pray to Mary, to ask Jesus to intercede, in the name of Jesus.

      <p>
       And they ask forgiveness from a priest, you're misunderstanding to not do that.

       It is not arrogance to explain that Jesus is sad over disunity as Jesus Himself prayed for this in John 17.  Jesus' main prayer is for UNITY!!: "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— 23 I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity."
      </p>
      <p>
       You LITERALLY just said that 'Jesus founded my faction/denomination!'   when He clearly did not FOUND it.  He may be a part of individual believers' lives, but He did not FOUND your church.   So you are celebrating a falsehood and promoting an untruth and factiousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your understanding of asking for 'intecessory prayer' is woefully misguided, perhaps because your Bible took out the verses and books of the Old Testament which described saints doing this very thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you ask your grandma to pray to Jesus for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about your mother?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, Catholics rightly understand that people who are in heaven are more fully alive in the presence of Jesus than people on earth who still wrestle with sin and the devil.
       <a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-intercession-of-the-saints">
        https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-intercession-of-the-saints
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is outlined also in II Maccabees: "For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead, And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...But your Bible has been tampered with by individual men and has had original books removed from it, so you twist and distort the Scriptures.

       I'm not interested in playing the game 'show me the word in the Bible, or I won't believe it' because it is a false and dangerous game to play.
      </p>

       However, I will send this: Acts 9:31 (Greek Bible), "ai men oun ekklēsiai kath olēs tēs ioudaias kai galilaias kai samareias eichon eirēnēn oikodomoumenai kai poreuomenai tō phobō tou kuriou kai tē paraklēsei tou agiou pneumatos eplēthunonto" EKKLESIA KATH'OLES.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "Catholic", derived from the Greek word καθολικός (katholikos), which means "universal" or "general", was also used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century. The term katholikos is equivalent to καθόλου (katholou), a contraction of the phrase καθ' ὅλου (kath' holou) meaning "according to the whole". Thus the full name Catholic Church roughly means "universal" or "whole" church. END QUOTE

       The "whole" church there, is specific to three locations, as stated in Acts 9:31 "31 Then had
       <strong>
        the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria
       </strong>
       , and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied."
      </p>
      <p>
       Those three locations were the boundaries of the "church"/followers-of-Jesus, at that time, then multiplied outward.  As you stated, the term for "whole", also was "universal", but then "catholic" came about in the second century, meaning later.

       I don't agree that only "Catholics", as commonly used today, are the only believers in Jesus Christ.  If you want to assume that no other faction/denomination are followers/believers of Jesus Christ, that's up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe all factions/denomination of Jesus Christ, are followers/believers of Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       What started this argument was regarding the later combination of the pagan beliefs of Emporer Constantine into the "Catholic" church, resulting in the beliefs of Catholicism today, which is rooted in beliefs in Jesus Christ (and acknowledging beliefs of pagans as well in that faction).
      </p>

       They are not, your exclusionary beliefs are not correct: Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans, Non-denominational are all true churches; they are not false churches.  Your opinion does not make it so.  As long as they follow/believe in Jesus Christ, they are a part of the "true church".

       Accurate enough, but for different reasons.  There is no salvation outside Christ.  The Body of Christ is the Church containing all believers.  Thus, there's no salvation outside of the universal Church.  We just don't share that idea of "walls" you have.

       Crowley was the illuminati high priest assigned the role of creating MAGICK.
MAGICK is one of the religions and sects created by the illuminati to brainwash and thus control the human cattle, from Protestantism and Heliocentrism to Evolution, Mormons, Jeovah Witnesses, Scientology and New Age.
       <br/>
       As far as free will, Crowley's Magick repeats the satanic doctrine of illuminati High Priest Calvin, dressed as Christian four centuries earlier: make believe that there's no free will, thus denying one of the 10 basic facts about God.

       That's a summary of the information.  Let's go with the Holy Bible, scripture itself:

       Acts 24:5 "5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the

       Acts 11:26 "26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and
       <strong>

      </p>
      <p>
       Colossians 3:12-13 "12 Put on therefore,
       <strong>
        as the elect of God
       </strong>
       , holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Again, the early church member themselves called themselves 'catholic' from the earliest days of the church, meaning 'universal'. Ignatius of Antioch wrote about this in 107 A.D. in his letter to the Symrneans

        In section 8 he says, "Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church." That is him writing not even 50 years after the death of St. Paul!

      <p>
       Please point to the book, chapter, and verse(s) of scripture that utilize the word "Catholic".  There is not one usage of that word in any scripture in any English version of the Holy Bible.

      <p>
       You referenced "section 8" of Ignatius of Antioch from 107 AD, however, that is not a scriptural reference, just an interpretation of scripture; an update, if you will.  A man who wasn't even a disciple of Jesus, yet Paul was, as quoted above.

       This is not a game that we can play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of words are not 'in the Bible' -- that does not make them untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word 'Trinity' is not in the Bible. ...does that mean there is no Trinity?
      </p>
      <p>
       The word 'Bible' is not in the Bible....does that mean the Bible is untrue?
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact word 'preacher' is not in the original Bible...does that mean that the office of preaching does not exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       You also make a strange request: that these words show up in an English (?) Bible.  English was not the original language of the Bible.  As we all know, Hebrew was for the OT and Greek was for the New.  So it is entirely acceptable to discuss a Greek word that was in wide usage already by 107 A.D.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a false argument to say 'show me this exact English word in the Bible, or I won't believe the concept exists'.  If we used that logic, there would be no Trinity or other truths of the faith that have been
       <em>
        derived from
       </em>
       sacred scripture and sacred tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, on a slightly different note, have you ever thought of the fact that the New Testament did not exist as a book until about 390 A.D.?   For almost three-hundred years, what did Christians go off of?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sacred tradition and oral tradition was largely keeping the Church going until the Bible was fully canonized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when the NT finally did become canonized, it contained verses like this: "1 Timothy 3:15: “but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is
       <em>
        the church of the living God the pillar and ground of the truth.
       </em>
       ”
      </p>
      <p>
       Timothy...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...is stating that the CHURCH is the pillar of truth.

       The words "Trinity" (a Latin word, after Greek writings) and "Bible" (referring to the "inner bark of the papyrus plant", meaning what the text was written on) did not exist when the text of the papyrus were written, therefore is not a valid comparison.  Same with the word "catholic", it did not exist yet, yet there are scriptural references to the "early church", and none include nor mean "universal" or "catholic".

       And I also provided this Bible verse in the original Greek with derivative form of 'catholic': QUOTE:
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 9:31 (Greek Bible), "ai men oun ekklēsiai kath olēs tēs ioudaias kai galilaias kai samareias eichon eirēnēn oikodomoumenai kai poreuomenai tō phobō tou kuriou kai tē paraklēsei tou agiou pneumatos eplēthunonto" EKKLESIA KATH'OLES.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "Catholic", derived from the Greek word καθολικός (katholikos), which means "universal" or "general", was also used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century. The term katholikos is equivalent to καθόλου (katholou), a contraction of the phrase καθ' ὅλου (kath' holou) meaning "according to the whole". Thus the full name Catholic Church roughly means "universal" or "whole" church. END QUOTE

       No.  You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.  It's utterly inconceivable to make that claim with a straight face unless you're a Papist that thinks the Catholic Church did nothing wrong, ever...
      </p>
      <p>
       The Protestant Reformation was about returning to the Biblical teachings of salvation.  Martin Luther was a Catholic monk who had become fed up with the Church teaching things that contradicted the Bible in order to fleece the people through selling indulgences.  He wrote an academic thesis criticizing the abuses.  However, the money was being used by the Pope to fund wars and build expensive cathedrals.  His proposed reforms, which he had continued to improve and develop through various debates, upset the Pope's money makers which is why the Pope eventually had him excommunicated.  Subsequently, Martin Luther had to flee from the Pope and the Emperor and go into hiding for a few years where he translated the Bible so people could read it in their own language.  Then, after the Pope and Emperor got distracted by their own petty Medieval politicking over who got to rule Italy and the fight with the Turks, Luther developed his doctrines and taught people about Christ.  The Lutheran princes developed a defensive alliance against the eventual war that the Pope and the Emperor were preparing.  And boy did that war come.  In the city of Magdeburg, the Lutherans were slaughtered by a deceitful general who came under a flag of peace and murdered them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, but that ain't no Illuminati.  The real conspiracy in the Middle Ages was the fact that the Pope was able to shut down entire kingdoms (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdict">
        Interdict
       </a>
       ) for being "heretics" and had a puppet Empire burning people that criticized it under its corrupted form of Excommuncation process like happened to John Wyclif (posthumously defiled) and Jan Hus. (burned at the stake despite a vow of protection)  The Hapsburgs were the conspiracy, not the Reformation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You mean, like the Pope who banned dissent?  Protestantism was about reclaiming what the Bible taught and letting the believers really have a crack at understanding it for themselves rather than bowing to what some elitist Bishop tells them to do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The theory of evolution didn't exist until the 1700s.  Martin Luther can be excused for resorting to a preference to literalism when his opponents were abusing allegory to prop up its money making lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Protestants might sometimes have a lot of antipathy towards evolutionary theory, but that's not a necessary requirement and many Protestants are able to think otherwise because they're not an ignorant monolith.

       Utter horse manure.  The Catholics excommunicated the Protestants.  They made a church Council to condemn our teachings.  They violently attacked Protestants.  There is no "infiltration" there even if we had wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking as a Lutheran, all we've ever been concerned is defending our interpretation of the Christian faith from people who slander it and try and undermine our freedom to worship Christ.  Our historical documents that we sent to the Emperor are recorded in the Augsburg Confession and its defense against the Roman confutation.  For goodness's sake, these texts have literally been incorporated as part of our
       <a href="http://bookofconcord.org/">

       Yeah, you

       use that claim.  It's necessary to avoid the fact that the Pope supported evolutionary theory since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a key piece of your narrative because you've somehow subscribed to the false idea that evolution is somehow anti-Creator.  Evolution, if it is correct, has no bearing on the existence of a Creator because the fact that a Creator instituted a natural process that can have a degree of variance is already implicit in the tenet that humans have free will which you evidently embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meh, the LCMS is

For me, evolutionary theory is a huge nothing burger anyway.  God created everything; evolution would simply be one means.

      <p>
       By the way, have you even read Martin Luther's

       :

      <p>
       <strong>
        A Brief History of the ORDER - from Foundations to Terminations
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The illuminati or Ordo Illuminatus first stepped on stage as an identifiable organization in 1190: Ordo Teutonicus, admission requirements included proof of German nobility for at least four generations.
       <br/>
       Prussia was the first state that they took control of, using their #1 tactic: infiltration.
       <br/>
       It didn't take long until it was the turn of England, even before it also became the first EMPIRE under their control: since 1534, except for five years (1553-58) at the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ORDER also stands for the first illuminati attempt to militarily occupy Russia, almost six centuries before the second attempt, using illuminati agent Napoleon Bonaparte.

       As implied before: both the first and the last (Adolf Hitler) military attempts were officially led by a German.
       <br/>
       In fact there's only one exception, 1812: french or corsican agent Bonaparte was used to cover-up the german illuminati behind the plan, the same who years earlier ran the French Revolution by the guillotine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ORDER was created disguised as christian fundamentalists, BEFORE the illuminati took control of the Templars.
       <br/>
       survived more than two centuries after the destruction of the infiltrators at the Templars, 1307, ending with the execution of illuminati agent Jacques de Molay.
       <br/>
       In fact it was never clearly recognized by the leaders of Christianity as a nest of infiltrators, although the ORDER's plots at the Vatican failed several times.
       <br/>
       "Coincidentally" one of these failures, in the early XV century, was nearly identical to the theater staged to start World War II with the aggression to Poland.
       <br/>
       That's why, unlike the Jesuits or the Templars, the ORDER was not terminated by the pope but by the illuminati themselves.
       <br/>
       The termination was staged as joining another illuminati creation, Martin Luther.
       <br/>
       As correctly stated in the Wikipedia page about the last Grand Master of the ORDER: [in 1525 he] "
       <strong>
        <em>
         converted to Lutheranism
        </em>
       </strong>
       ".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's necessary to avoid the fact that the Pope supported evolutionary theory since then.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing to avoid since everything was said long ago.
       <br/>
       The main role of ALL (fake) popes since 1958 is act as suicide bombers: figuratively destroying the Catholic Church from within.
       <br/>
       Any treasonous pope "supporting" the evolution theory hoax is nothing but illuminati theater,  preparing the way to let the ultimate bomb explode:
       <br/>
       acceptance of evolution theory hoax, i.e. the "factual" destruction of the Catholic Church.
       <br/>
       Reminder:
       <br/>
       The lie "the Catholic Church teaches that evolution theory is not incompatible with faith in God" was created by "pope" John Paul II to additionally "discredit" the Bible.
       <br/>
       Since now the Vatican is under total illuminati control ever since 1959, it openly defends evolution theory and threatens defenders of intelligent design. 
All popes before 1960 categorically dismissed the evolution theory hoax, a religion created for human cattle and used by the illuminati as the most important mind control weapon in the process to destroy logical reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reduction of the capacity logical reasoning prevents human cattle from understanding anything about  the lengths it's been fooled.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Evolution Theory hoax alone reveals illuminati TOTAL control of media and politics
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Evolution of species: Questions that illuminati media and school books will never pose, not to mention will never discuss:
       <br/>
       - Who appeared first: chicken or egg, man or woman?
       <br/>
       - How was it possible for each and every species that female and male appeared at the same time?
       <br/>
       - How was it possible that each of the astronomically high number of times that supposedly the female (or male) evolved, the male (or female) simultaneously evolved the one and only way to become the PERFECT match to ensure both reproduction and "survival of the fittest"?
       <br/>
       Why don't they ask it? Answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        MAN comes from APE hoax: 10 lines to NEVER EVER read again 1 line by evolution "scientists"
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Evolution Theory hoax is based on the instantaneous magic of BANGS to explain the origins of the universe or of life:
       <br/>
       - the first BIG BANG created the universe;
       <br/>
       - another BANG created the first living species on Earth, from where ALL species come from, in a morphism requiring an astronomically high number X of stages to reach all present and extinct species.
       <br/>
       So apparently no more magic BANGS required.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the reproduction of almost all species requires two genders, male and female, that MUST 100% match each other.
       <br/>
       So actually evolution also requires the astronomically high number of BANGS that supposedly kept the 100% match between male and female as EACH and EVERY species "evolved".
       <br/>
       The bigger the lie the more people will believe it.
       <br/>
       This is why evolution theory diverts from this astronomically high number of required BANGS with "evolution of species required billions of years".

       Since you're alleging that the foundation of my religious tradition was a crime, you are bound by God's Law to establish the testimony.  "One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. (Deuteronomy 19:15)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything may, then, as a matter of course be discounted if you do not back it up.  Every single one of my posts has citations.  Yours are rather lacking.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As correctly stated in the Wikipedia page about the last Grand Master of the ORDER: [in 1525 he] "converted to Lutheranism".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Finally, a citation that can be sourced as a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_Duke_of_Prussia">
        reference
       </a>
       .  But a member of the Teutonic Knights converting to Lutheranism is irrelevant since your claim depends on two points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The assertion that the Teutonic Knights were devil worshipers.
       </li>
       <li>
        The assertion that Martin Luther was a member of them.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Neither one of these claims has been substantiated.  So, I'll propose a counter-hypothesis.  The Duke converted to Lutheranism because he saw the opportunity to be free of the oppressive yoke of the Papacy and maybe even agreed with what Luther was teaching about salvation being founded on faith in Christ rather than faith in the Papal institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, let me provide you these citations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.  (1 Corinthians 12:3)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Self evidently, Martin Luther confesses this in spades.  Directly quoting his
       <a href="http://bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php">
        Small Catechism
       </a>
       , "I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord"
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter. 29But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.” 30Jesus made this statement because they were claiming, “He has an unclean spirit.”  (Mark 3:28-30)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're risking your own salvation if you're bearing false witness against us.  At the very least with
       <a href="/u/StGabriel5">
        /u/StGabriel5
       </a>
       , he acknowledges we might be Christian.  You, on the other hand, are claiming that I, a worshiper of Christ since He has saved me from the clutches of Satan, am not what I know I am by undermining the very theology by which I found such salvation.  Which leads me to my final citation...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.  (Isaiah 5:20)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can substantiate my hypothesis is that the Pope is the true malevolent agent.  The Pope wielded all the political power in Europe.  You're claiming that somehow there was an organization more powerful than the Pope that just wanted to destroy Christianity by defending its tenets vigorously against a perceived corruption.  That's a logical contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       My model has no such contraction.  What is Luther?  A simple monk.  His "crime" was speaking his mind in order to confess Christ's teachings faithfully.  The Pope generated Exsurge Domine and Decet Romanum Pontificem to coerce Luther to stop speaking his mind because it caused people to question his money racket built upon the blood and tears of the saints.  We know the Archbishop of Mainz backed Johann Tetzel in his indulgence hawking.  We know the Pope turned a blind eye to the doctrinal errors.  Yet, you accuse
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       of the devilry.  Just remember what I said.  Christ will judge you as He will judge me.  And I'm confident in my salvation.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The illuminati started using agents disguised as religious fundamentalists as early as the XII century, more precisely 1190, as revealed worldwide first long ago by the Last Prophet.
       <br/>
       At that time these agents were not playing Muslims but Christians.
       <br/>
       The totally controlled Wikipedia page for "illuminati" serves not only endless deception but also some fulfillment of the fourth commandment - openly tell the truth to the human cattle and still make sure that the cattle doesn't get it. Ideal is to have it perceived as "black is white".
       <br/>
       Examples:
       <br/>
       - The illuminati were supposedly created in Bavaria, Germany. Indeed the illuminati were created in what is now Germany and been ever since controlled by Germans.
       <br/>
       - "Founder" Adam Weishaupt was supposedly Jesuit-taught.
       <br/>
       The Jesuits were originally NOT created by the illuminati, but the illuminati DID manage to later take control of the Jesuits, using infiltrators.
       <br/>
       That's why Pope Clement XIV in 1773 suppressed the Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       500 years after the illuminati created the "Protestant church":
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Illuminati have destroyed not only the Orthodox and Catholic Churches ...
       </strong>
       <br/>
       but ALL SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS, the Churches that stood for the seven Christian rites practiced at the start of End Times.
       <br/>
       So why hasn't the Day of the Lord come yet?
       <br/>
       Because God’s True Church still exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        WHAT ARE THE SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS IN REVELATION
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The book of Revelation refers to lampstands seven times in six verses:
       <br/>
       - 1:12, 13, 20; 2:1, 5;
       <br/>
       - 11:4: referring to the Two Witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SEVEN lampstands refer to the lights of churches shining in
       <strong>
        Ages of Darkness
       </strong>
       : the Age of the first Christians and End Times.
       <br/>
       Two ages separated by an Age of Light that the illuminati obviously call the Dark Ages.
       <br/>
       An Age where the lights started to fade, in a preview of the Darkness at the End of the Age, as the illuminati managed to establish fake Christian churches, starting with agent Luther.
In other words, even before what illuminati call the Age of Enlightenment.
