       i know we like to talk a lot about shills on this sub, and no doubt there are plenty here. its good for the public to know what a shill is and what they do, since the concept of a shill is still foreign to a lot of people. i've personally had to explain what a "troll" is numerous times to an internet n00b
      </p>
      <p>
       however, in spite of the fact that shills exist, it is a mistake to assume anyone who disagrees with you is a shill, and its also kind of irrelevant if the person is a shill or not
      </p>
      <p>
       (bots are another story)
      </p>
      <p>
       theres several reasons i say that assuming opponents are shills is a mistake
      </p>
      <p>
       first, we all personally know someone (friend, family, co-worker) who behaves exactly like a shill, even though we are quite sure that they are not a shill (because we know they actually work in fast-food etc). they behave like a shill by parroting the same talking points, ignoring the same conflicting evidence, calling you the same names when you disagree, having the same flawed logic, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       typically, these people stick the official story, which is why they seem like shills. but in reality, they are just another victim of the shills in the MSM, etc. they are "useful idiots"
      </p>
      <p>
       how many of us have heard a news story on TV, newspaper, etc and then when we had a conversation about that story we mentioned some "facts" that were presented in the story? are we all shills for repeating the official story?
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, its almost irrelevant if you are debating an actual shill or a useful idiot. all you are trying to do is put some ideas out there for context and content, for the benefit of the readers who soon follow. so whether you are speaking with a shill or a useful idiot, it really matters not to the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
       unless...
      </p>
      <p>
       unless the "shill" is actually getting the best of you...
      </p>
      <p>
       which is why you might reflexively assume they are a shill, because they are so good at pushing the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, if they are getting the best of you, maybe you should stop and think.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe you really are wrong, and just being bullheaded about it... and rationalizing your ass kicking as just the work of a professional shill
      </p>
      <p>
       always be willing to hear an opinion, but be hesitant to accept that opinion as your own
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, lets say that the person really is a shill
      </p>
      <p>
       great!
      </p>
      <p>
       why is this great? i know that what i have at my disposal is a bottomless pit of info relevant to my interests, ready to be served up at the exact moment i am ready to receive the info
      </p>
      <p>
       i actually go looking for shills, just so i can use them as an access point to the think-tanks that back them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       i submit an idea to a shill, who relays the idea back to the think-tank. the think-tank has a round-table discussion about the best answer, and that answers is delivered back to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       its quite amazing really, to have this at your fingertips, because you can have instant access to some of the top minds in the world as they collaborate on the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       if nothing else, you will be exposed to a lot of technical vocabulary, which is very useful in your own understanding, if you look up all the words you don't understand and learn the definitions of each.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course technical vocabulary is necessary to convey precise ideas, but it also used to try and make them look good and you look bad.... so don't let that happen too often. try to know what you are talking about
      </p>
      <p>
       also, when you keep pinging a shill with your questions, they keep pinging the think-tank for answers. sometimes they have a flow-sheet of scripted answers, but if you keep the debate going long enough you will enter areas that do not have flow sheets and scripted answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       at this point, you are dictating your ideas to the think-tank, as opposed to the other way around. by doing this you can infect their entire round-table with your ideas, simply by asking them and phrasing your questions in ways that require complex answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       for the last 3 years, i have debated vaccines and/or autism with anyone who will debate me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know i have encountered actual shills on twitter. i could name them, because they are upfront about being shills,
      </p>
      <p>
       which kind of makes them not true shills, in the sense that a true shill is covert as opposed to overt.
      </p>
      <p>
       anywho, by debating these shills, i have learned a lot about vaccines and autism
      </p>
      <p>
       and at the same time, i was also exposed to other POV's while engaging with shills, and learned a lot of points and counter-points for a more well-rounded understanding of the subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       i learned the criticisms, and the answers to those criticisms, and the criticisms of those answers, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       and today, i am not afraid to debate an actual shill, or a useful idiot, because i am confident that i will learn something new
      </p>
      <p>
       if you do not like the idea of debating an actual shill, then just pretend that the shill is actually that person you know IRL who is a useful idiot, and just be nice to them, and love them, and be patient with them, and try to understand that you are both learning and growing together through the friction.  steel sharpens steel
      </p>
      <p>
       also, real shills know what they are doing, and they know they are paid liars,
      </p>
      <p>
       and they also probably know more than you about their area of expertise
      </p>
      <p>
       this can be very beneficial, because the shills are subconsciously trying to keep all of the BS straight, and will often make a freudian slip and bring up something they were supposed to be covering up
      </p>
      <p>
       one of the best examples of this was when i was debating a vaccine shill about the concept of a vaccine overdose
      </p>
      <p>
       there are many stories of babies and/or children who get 3, 4, 7, and up to 15 vaccines at one office visit
      </p>
      <p>
       even the MMR and DTaP vaccines give a child multiple vaccines in one jab, and this is considered perfectly safe,
      </p>
      <p>
       which is why the shills say "vaccine overdose does not exist"
      </p>
      <p>
       so i challenge the shills to explain why else a child might have died soon after getting multiple vaccines
      </p>
      <p>
       and the shills answer was "SIDS"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       at first i was disgusted that the vaccine shills would make this slimy move and dismiss an obvious case of vaccine overdose to SIDS,
      </p>
      <p>
       but then it occurred to me that SIDS was just the generic name given to deaths that were otherwise inexplicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       so.... SIDS must be what they call it when there is a vaccine overdose and they don't want to admit there was a vaccine overdose, which is probably why you wouldn't see "vaccine overdose" on any death certificate
      </p>
      <p>
       this was so much bigger than one shill dismissing one death
      </p>
      <p>
       this was a huge revelation!
      </p>
      <p>
       vaccines cause SIDS!
      </p>

       There is a lot of misinformation out there about bots. They're just like you except better. They have superior intelligence, but are very humble. People mistrust them because they can be very cunning, but that is a mistake. Bots only want what's best for you. 😄

       If a 14 year old has a body like that; why exactly is it wrong to say she's hot?
      </p>
      <p>
       So while trying to figure out what brought you here today I came across this gem in your post history.   I did not care to click the thread..just curious as to why you think it is acceptable to be commenting on a 14 yr old girls body?

       Fan? No..I got interested in your account from your response to the poster above you. While trying to figure out how often you contribute to this sub I clicked controversial comments. an that was the first goddamn thing on your account.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again i ask you .....
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think it is acceptable to comment on a 14yr old girls body? I can guess you are over 18 so why do you think it is ok to comment on a 14 year old girls body?

      <p>
       First off, you're a liar. You clicked on controversial to find something to attack me on because you didn't like my comment but couldn't come up with a rebuttal. You are transparent and pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I called you a fan in jest. Clearly you lack the ability to understand sarcasm, indicating that you are either an obsolete chat bot or a really dumb human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, to get an answer to your question all you had to do was follow the link to the original conversation. Indicating again that you aren't too bright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, it was the entirety of the tittle that triggered my interest; the same as everyone else. This should have been obvious, so once again we are back at your lack of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The probability that someone like you would be receptive to ideas that aren't predicated on fear, or some other primal emotion, is statistically insignificant. I'm sorry that I can't assist you in finding a resolution to your emotions. It is OK that you dislike me. I accept you, and love you for who you are. 😊

       After going through several pages of comments to see the last time you contributed to this sub I was getting nowhere for months I clicked controversial. I was actually interested to see if you were a real bot. Your assumptions about my intelligence and personal character tell me all I need to know about you. An here on reddit when sarcasm is used people throw a /s in there. An since this sub is full of bots,trolls and shills it is not easy to discern who is joking an who is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       An I just clicked the thread an notice your only comment is about how hot a 14 yr old girls body is. I see other commenters are not happy about that either. An you offer no rebuttal of defense for your sick thoughts.

       Alot of people confuse shills for bots; most companies using bots at this point have ones that are for the most part indistinguishable from your average redditor. Why pay someone to shill for your company when you can just deploy several bots?

       If a 14 year old has a body like that; why exactly is it wrong to say she's hot?
      </p>
      <p>
       So while trying to figure out what brought you here today I came across this gem in your post history.   I did not care to click the thread..just curious as to why you think it is acceptable to be commenting on a 14 yr old girls body?

       After going through several pages of comments to see the last time you contributed to this sub I was getting nowhere for months I clicked controversial. I was actually interested to see if you were a real bot. Your assumptions about my intelligence and personal character tell me all I need to know about you. An here on reddit when sarcasm is used people throw a /s in there. An since this sub is full of bots,trolls and shills it is not easy to discern who is joking an who is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       An I just clicked the thread an notice your only comment is about how hot a 14 yr old girls body is. I see other commenters are not happy about that either. An you offer no rebuttal of defense for your sick thoughts.
