       Are you serious? Have you EVER heard him talk? You've definitely never heard him talk about the investigation.  Keep putting your head in the sand.  It's called Information Aversion.  Don't be blind dude.  Nothing has been proven but, don't just blindly make shit up.

       I don't know. The timeline says it could be all true.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one even expected Trump to win the repub primaries. Then Trump's first move is to know and employ the guy who had to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of other countries and hire him as a campaign manager for president.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have him on video saying he knows Putin then denies knowing Putin. So if it's untrue then this guy is a compulsive liar. Which in and of itself is quite common in people, imo. I'd find more comfort in that than he knows Russian mafia through New York real estate and the casino business.

       LOL yep, all the cities that are the economic and cultural powerhouses in this country (who literally subsidize all the red on that oft-touted election map) are just full of losers and failures, to the brim! Just millions and millions of people who literally keep our country running that are a bunch of losers and failures, you nailed it.

       True but that's what keeps your food cheap in the cities that can't produce it. By the way I'm not a republican and I live in a large city. And what the fuck is a cultural powerhouse being that you fucks are all about multiculturalism which kind of lends itself to the idea that no culture should dominate?

       I don't dislike all dems, some are at times better than R's. However many current dems cater to modern liberalism, which I do find repulsive. I just looked up cultural powerhouse in hope of finding a definition. There wasn't one. So no, not confused just unsure of the new Orwellian term you introduced to me

       I can easily name many dominant cultures throughout history. On a long enough time line there's been plenty. Just because white western culture is dominant at this moment doesn't really mean much.

       It's obvious you're ignorant of history though, and I'm only here to mock you - not change your ignorant mind. And really, for a guy that started this whole thing calling ALL liberals losers and failures, you're bummed about name calling? Hahaha

       I said very specifically they have an inferiority complex. You're right they're not necessarily losers and failures but in a general sense they end up being that because they have resigned themselves to it. Not a historian, but not ignorant of it. But name one that has done more and didn't lose the advantage?

       I mean, Arabs were inventing math and astrology and the Chinese were inventing paper and printing and sailing the world while white Europeans were mucking around in the mud and fighting over who's version of the same God was shittier. It's mainly happenstance that Europeans got out and outpaced them, but like I said, on a long enough timeline... China appears to be making a solid comeback, for example.

       Everyone makes generalizations, you just did (euros mucking). Arabs were also fucking kids and took  zero advantage of these discoveries. China is making a comeback with our help. If that dries up, we'll we see. You do know their cheap labor costs us intellectual property (and we are dumb for giving it to them) and all the college students they send here is a money grab by our unis. I imagine if I would have spent a year studying for the gre I would have a record score and not just enough to get in. Who took paper and made it mass media by the way? Oh yeah one of those euros mucking around. Who took math and made calculus? A mucking euro.

       Yes, in general, the Dark Ages were a super shitty time. That's not remotely the same as your idiotic broad brush. Are you offended that I characterized the Dark Ages as "mucking around in the mud"? Lol I'm of European descent, don't get your panties in a bunch.

       You still haven't answered my core question. What exactly am I ignorant of (and we can go ahead and suppose I'm not an expert in many areas, so enlighten me). You also have failed to adequately address "cultural powerhouse" unless you were in fact serious about art and fashion. I have admitted that I am biased and make generalizations; I own up to and I will gladly give you the reasons behind my biases and generalizations. Will you? Or when we finally start getting to the core you... Oh wait I remember, I'm racist, hate women and science (which if you actually read into, nvm you won't). Care to call me another name/generalization (and yes I did generalize you and frankly not so well, but I am narrowing it down).

       She admitted to unmasking US citizens that were caught on FISA warrant taps of suspected Russian spies.  Those people happened to be members of Trump's campaign and family.  It could have been anyone but, it was them caught on a wire with Russian spies.  However, didn't your lord and savior Jesus Trump say his campaign had NOTHING to do with Russia or Russians?

       A fucking fisa warrant is laughably easy to obtain (check out how many are granted vs how many aren't). Furthermore Obama by EO made unmasking and sharing that info much easier as one of his last acts as prez. Coincidence?
