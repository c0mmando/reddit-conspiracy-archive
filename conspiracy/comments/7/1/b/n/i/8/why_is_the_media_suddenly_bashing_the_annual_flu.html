<p>Back in 2013 an FDA expert announced a universal flu vaccine was on the way. What we are seeing is them laying the AstroTurf &quot;seeds&quot;. Don&#39;t believe for a minute the media is finally waking up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year, I had influenza B, and the flu vaccine was 76% effective against influenza B. I have an autoimmune disease and often have a somewhat compromised immune system as a result. I was wary of the vaccine, but the flu almost took me out. I have no idea what I&#39;m doing this year. I&#39;ve been fucked by more medicines than I can remember, but I&#39;m seriously considering a vaccine this year. It freaks me out that Walgreens offers it for free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried a (temporary) raw vegan diet, or fasting yet?</p>

<p>As a long term diet, I hear it gets pretty dicey, but I&#39;ve also heard great things from people who switch over, for a month&#39;ish.  It&#39;s given dramatic improvements to people with a wide variety of neurological and immune disorders.</p>

<p>Or, if I&#39;m overstepping my boundaries, you could say so, too :)</p>

<p>Houmous is your friend there, load it with ground-up mixed nuts and use peanut butter in place of tahini for maximum effect. Or just don&#39;t be vegan obviously, it&#39;s your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m in a pickle. I definitely don&#39;t want the flu again because it sent my disease into attack mode, but I also don&#39;t want to introduce anything that could potentially do more damage. It&#39;s an awkward position, and I absolutely recognize the risks of both choices</p>

But keep in mind that studies have pointed to the rather bizarre phenomenon that consecutive annual flu shots (in addition to raising miscarriage rates, as noted in the news these past few weeks), actually figure into LOWERING your immunity against the flu - making this year&#39;s vaccine less effective.  </p>
