       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Apr 2013 - Mass detentions became routine, from New York to Madrid.
      </p>
      <p>
       A psy-op propagating this video posts:
       <br/>
       "
       <em>
        MAKE THIS VIRAL LEAKED DOCUMENT PROVING The Government Is Building Military INTERNMENT CAMPS in U.S to be USED FOR POLITICAL DISSIDENTS [VIDEO]
       </em>
       ":
      </p>
      <p>
       Last Prophet replies:
       <br/>
       <strong>
        They were ALL already built.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Video is served by the illuminati web of disinfo to divert from the THREE basic facts:
       <br/>
       <strong>
        1.
       </strong>
       The INTERNMENT camps are in fact EXTERMINATION camps.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        2.
       </strong>
       Although they are also for POLITICAL DISSIDENTS they are meant primarily for TENS of MILLIONS (in the USA alone) of human cattle.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        3.
       </strong>
       They are not only NOT hidden but also visited by human cattle on a daily or weekly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Executions by the illuminati: public vs behind closed doors - sports champions vs HUMAN CATTLE
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Falsely accused athletics and cycling champions were publicly executed, forced to "confess" doping, coming now to Lance Armstrong [update: fulfilled as predicted].
       <br/>
       But human cattle is executed no differently from normal cattle at the slaughterhouse: behind closed doors.
       <br/>
       Millions were already executed in hospitals and homes for elderly.
       <br/>
       The next stage, after the BIG BANG and martial law: malls, stadiums and large schools morph on demand to extermination camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Human cattle unable to see the Truth in plain sight
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Human beasts fattened by the illuminati to be slaughtered, are like the rest of the cattle: not able to identify the slaughterhouse even when they are inside it.
       <br/>
       But it's even more sickening as far as the human cattle: they got the chance to visit several times the slaughterhouse and leave each time before the last visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Virtually EVERY mall, stadium and large school built since 2000 designed as FEMA concentration camp in the reduced version, the extermination camp
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In nazi concentration camps people were supposed to work until they were gassed.
       <br/>
       As expected from the famous final Laws, in most neo-nazi concentration camps human cattle is NOT supposed to work until they are slaughtered.
       <br/>
       Virtually EVERY mall, stadium and large school built since 2000 was designed to be used as concentration camp, or better, the reductionist version, as extermination camp.
       <br/>
       That was already the case for MOST of those built after 1990.
       <br/>
       That is all it takes to understand reductionism in that kind of Architecture of the last leg of illuminati overtime in Illuminatziland.

       No need to waste your time with the CIA links in this section.

       Good reply.

       Check that this was also explained here:
       <br/>
       It's part of the "evacuations" psy-op, setting the stage for the BIG BANG (when the "relocations" under martial law will start).
       <br/>
       For the time being the hurricane evacuations are "just" used for this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sep 19, 2017 - French police evacuate 557 migrants from makeshift camp - for dummies:
       <br/>
       The "migrants" (in fact most are refugees) are being "evacuated" to the same type of facilities as the homeless during Harvey and Irma: the gas chambers.

       Correct, not a concentration camp but rather an EXTERMINATION camp that scripted to be fully activated in sync with the coming BIG BANG.

       Reminder of what was explained in advance worldwide only by Last Prophet and is now already unfolding, from the Ukraine to the Philippines:

       BIG BANG: the most extreme inversion of illuminati scripts ever. The ultimate reverse script starts with a sudden inversion just before the BIG BANG, launched with Obama's staged arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the scripts that will be suddenly inverted:
       <br/>
       1. Multiracial society and open borders becomes manhunt for aliens and non-whites
       <br/>
       2. Legalize drugs becomes execution of drug addicts
       <br/>
       3. "Gay marriage legalized" becomes manhunt for homosexuals
       <br/>
       4. "Ultra-nationalists" become "our national heroes"
       <br/>
       5. Staged democracy becomes "Hitler was right"

       I think it's a goal post that the cabal wanted but I truly believe it's something they will never be able to implement/carry out due to the universal laws of free will and the ideas of power over others and service to self and service to others.

       They want to carry out such plans and wipe us out but they are bound by the same universal laws we are all bound to.

       But have we seen any minorities vanish? I know FEMA is in Texas and has been providing shelter, are people missing or something? It's something to have the infrastructure in place, it's entirely whole new level when they actually act on it and start wiping people out. Has this happened yet? I'm genuinely curious because I've heard nothing about homeless or elderly being killed off.

       Not a peep in the illuminati media until it will be formally proclaimed.

        An example for non-whites starts with the Syrian refugees.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Millions of refugees were sent to (unknowingly and risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean) march into death camps.
       <br/>
       Reminder of the other main tactic to drastically increase the flow of refugees to Europe in summer 2015: termination of food stamps in camps for 5 million refugees in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.

        Genocide of Homeless: contrast IV and III Reich

        The homeless are easy pickings.
       </em>
       "
       <br/>
       Nobody will miss them or know who there were. They're just gone and some people will think "Oh, good. Those homeless people must have moved on. I was so tired of looking at them".
       <br/>
       That's why he homeless were part of the first "undesirable" to be executed in the III Reich.
       <br/>
       IV Reich: the roundup started again with the homeless but at a moment when millions of other "undesirables" had already been executed.
       <br/>
       There was no need for a previous roundup because this time the illuminati came first for a type: of "undesirables" that didn't yet exist in 1933: part of those being paid a pension or expecting to soon get one.
       <br/>
       The genocide of the homeless would start only more than a decade later.

        Since 2009 mass murder in hospitals, from USA to EU, from Canada to Australia, has DECREASED - WHY
       </strong>
       <br/>
       From about 5 million a year in this millennium until 2009 to 4 million yearly since 2009.
       <br/>
       First reason: Because nothing changed as far as how people are murdered in hospitals: death squads kill patients laying in hospital beds, 90% pensioners.
       <br/>
       This type of mass murder only recently started in some EU states (Greece, Portugal, Bulgaria, Poland).
       <br/>
       So why did it decrease?
       <br/>
       Elsewhere, from USA to Canada, from Sweden to the UK, the number of elderly had already been dramatically reduced BEFORE 2009.

       Yes, at this point the ongoing genocide of several groups remains behind closed doors.

       <strong>
        Ongoing Genocide of Homeless
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Apr 8, 2015 - Christian Science Monitor:
       <br/>
       "It is a very encouraging thing that the homeless population in the United States is getting smaller, and especially that there is a new resolve to find homes for the veterans who have served in the armed forces."
      </p>
      <p>
       FOR DUMMIES:
       <br/>
       For one time illuminati media presents data not as "black is white".
       <br/>
       Reason: to mock the HORRIBLE TRUTH behind that real data.
       <br/>
       Now for the real reason why the homeless population in the United States is getting smaller:
       <br/>
       State organized mass murder is not restricted to hospitals and care homes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I've heard nothing about homeless or elderly
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What else would you expect from the totally controlled illuminati media?
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution to cover-up this type of final solution: this time not gas ovens to reduce bodies to smoke and ashes but rather to simply declare murders as deaths by natural causes.
       <br/>
       It started decades after abortion but still before this millennium.
       <br/>
       For simplicity it will be referred to as "euthanasia", the word used for the mentioned less than 0,00001% of declared cases.

       In relation to what? I think what that study proved was that when you remove the common link between us all, it causes a feeling of separation and power over others. With the use of sunglasses, batons, and police outfits, they managed to remove the connection that we all have to each other thus making it easier for the "police" in this experiment to have no problem perceiving the prisoners as "below them"
      </p>
      <p>
       How this ties into OP's post is with the idea of an "us and them" that the "elite" view us as, through their distorted ego lens colored glasses they perceive us as less when this is not so.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, each action has an opposite reaction. By the cabal wanting to imprison us and "keep us as cattle" there will be those who oppose such "evil" ideas and "fight" against it.

       Ultimately darkness can never win because the light illuminates and shines through it.

       Correct.
       <br/>
       Because
       <strong>
        YOU
       </strong>
       live in a simulated reality, staged by the secret society Ordo Illuminatus (illuminati).
       <br/>
       In politics and media the simulation reaches 100%:
       <br/>
       - all members of all EU "parliaments" or from the US Congress and Senate fulfill orders dictated by Grand Master Alexander Adolf Hitler, grandnephew of the "Fuehrer";
       <br/>
       - media stories are the result of a script, except for local news and (almost all) natural catastrophes.
