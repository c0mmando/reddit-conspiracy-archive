        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Had Donald Trump bothered to read his history he would know that the first &quot;rocket man&quot; was in fact US President Harry Truman, who deployed nuclear missiles in South Korea in the late 1950s in a unilateral violation of the US ceasefire agreement with North Korea. That mistake took 34 years to correct, and the US weapons were finally withdrawn under President Bush in the early 1990s. Not surprisingly, North Korea has been pursuing a nuclear weapons program ever since. Now Trump wants to tear up the nuclear treaty with Iran, which only gives North Korea even more of an incentive to build as many nuclear weapons as possible. People used to tell President Truman to &quot;Give &#39;em hell, Harry,&quot; but Trump seems determined to actually take us there. God help us all.</p>

<p>No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing, and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That&#39;s what the United Nations is all about. That&#39;s what the United Nations is for. Let&#39;s see how they do.</p>

<p>It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved. But we must do much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this whole time I thought you were serious.  That you seriously were taking Donald Trump on his literal meaning, despite it being completely obvious what he meant.  Because he didn&#39;t say we&#39;d partially destroy North Korea, he must want genocide. I don&#39;t think there is a human on this planet who honestly believes Donald Trump means to eradicate North Koreans.        </p>

<p>I actually think this post is a pretty smart pro-Trump post.  Are people smart enough to know that when they purposely pretend not to understand basic things and over exaggerate because they can&#39;t get past their dislike of someone, it only hurts their own cause--losing their side supporters?  Probably not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I constantly see the Donald saying,&quot;it&#39;s obvious what he meant&quot;, so the question is why do we have to constantly interpret what he says, rather than him say exactly what he means, verbatim. It&#39;s like he purposely chooses to be vague or unclear so he can backpedal later.</p>

<p>But the important part, is that what he said wasn&#39;t just said to the leaders of the world, but to the population of the world. Maybe it&#39;s clear to you (it shouldn&#39;t be), most of the planet probably just focused on him threatening to destroy a country.</p>

<p>You might see the word regime and think that&#39;s supposed to modify what he meant by &quot;totally destroy North Korea&quot;, or perhaps you can assume he meant the government.. but that&#39;s not a default way of reading those sentences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rest of the world, not just the leaders, can see what was said. I think he&#39;s totally unhinged, and would not make avoiding civilian causalities the priority.</p>

<p>But countries outside our own, where he is frequently shown as unhinged, you can be sure that they didn&#39;t hear a whole lot after he threatened to destroy a country!</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gotta get out of your echo chamber and realize that when you get on the world stage, you don&#39;t pander to your base. Billions are watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the big difference is that the NK has already acted aggressive towards multiple countries.  I&#39;m sure countries are going to say things about Trump, but they are not going to do anything.  Would you?  Japan and South Korea aren&#39;t showing him as unhinged, and they are the ones that matter.  I don&#39;t think the UN would reign in Trump in much of any way if NK started killing people.  </p>

<p>Tell me, can you tell me a country that was &quot;destroyed&quot;?  I don&#39;t like rhetoric either, but he doesn&#39;t mean kill all the citizens and raze the ground.  He means completely remove the regime, set up &quot;democracy&quot;, and take resources.  That&#39;s what the U.S. does.  Whether that is good or bad is up to you to decide, but NK isn&#39;t the first instance. </p>

<p>Also, he may just be ramping up rhetoric to get NK scared.  World leaders have tried pretty much else...would you disagree?  If Trump &quot;completely&quot; destroys NK I&#39;ll eat my words, but I&#39;m perfectly fine with doing that.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing some bits of information in your comment.</p>

<p>First of all the no fly zone would have been for Syria, not North Korea, and would could have potentially escalated into WW3, that&#39;s correct but these are completely different war scenarios. North Korea is essentially on their own unless we were to strike first (very unlikely). North Korea treats it&#39;s own people not too different from Jews during the Holocaust. There are literally concentration/reeducation camps there and the government is known for starving it&#39;s people while Kim and his friends eat like kings. With North Korea on it&#39;s way to becoming a nuclear power, maybe the only thing Kim will understand is tough words, because that&#39;s all that seems to spew out of his mouth.</p>

<p>After nuclear bombs were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima we of course don&#39;t want to ever drop nuclear bombs again, but North Korea is a problem that we might need to get a handle on, before they have the technology to strike anyone they please, so the world leaders really need to figure this out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea isn&#39;t firing missiles over Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, Venezuela (coming soon to a theatre near you!)or building defenses in Poland either.
Nor are they occupying Japan, Guam, South Korea, Philippines as well as many, many other countries that have lost their sovereignty by force/coercion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I&#39;m torn, on one hand I don&#39;t trust anything the media says, but on the other hand I think its pretty apparent what north Korea is: a tiny strong hold soviet era country.  Are they a threat? Probably not, but they are sitting on a huge stock pile of rare earth metals and minerals. </p>

<p>Do I trust the us govt? Hell no, but do I want China to have access to all of these resources? Hell no. </p>

<p>If we wanted to we could probably fire one none nuclear war head right on kim jung il or whoever runs the countries head and hand it over to south Korea. </p>

<p>And honestly I think those people are probably miserable so it would be cool if they could adopt s. Korea&#39;s govt. </p>

<p>Ps. I don&#39;t even know what trump said, so I&#39;m not haraying war, just giving my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A military strike on North Korea would not be a nuclear holocaust. They would likely be surgical strikes to cripple their nuclear and ballistic missile facilities as well as neutralize artillery aimed at Seoul. I live in Korea, and no one here is worried.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rest of the world, not just the leaders, can see what was said. I think he&#39;s totally unhinged, and would not make avoiding civilian causalities the priority.</p>

<p>But countries outside our own, where he is frequently shown as unhinged, you can be sure that they didn&#39;t hear a whole lot after he threatened to destroy a country!</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gotta get out of your echo chamber and realize that when you get on the world stage, you don&#39;t pander to your base. Billions are watching.</p>
