    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one claiming to be able to predict earthquakes. The issue isn&#39;t whether or not I can predict them, it&#39;s whether or not <a href="/u/parsingsol">/u/parsingsol</a> can. </p>

<p>In 2016 there were 16 earthquakes with a magnitude between 7.0-7.9. That&#39;s an average of one 7.0-7.9 earthquake every 22 days. That means there&#39;s a 40% chance of having a quake within any 9 day window. He also completely missed the area.</p>

<p>If he had been a week late I&#39;d be willing to bet that a ton of people would say &quot;wow he was only off by a week!&quot; ignoring the fact that there&#39;s a nearly 2 in 3 chance of a 7.0-7.9 quake in any given 2 week period.</p>

<p>when you think of what earth really is its a big water balloon floating in space (the crust being the balloon, the mantles being thicker water) so the idea that the solar wind slamming CMEs in to it making it shudder seems pretty obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His work is interesting. What&#39;s his track record, though? He seems to edit his prediction posts retroactively, which is a <em>very</em> bad habit as other people have pointed out. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see a clean record of his hits and misses. Leaving locations aside (which benefits his predictions, I think) there are usually more than 15 quakes per year of mag 7 or above. With 52 quakes per year, that means any given week has nearly 30% odds of seeing a 7+ quake somewhere in the world. </p>

<p>Are his 7-day picks hitting with greater than 30% accuracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Oh my god I wish I could ban YouTube links. Especially ones with flashy graphics in lieu of clean, clear content. (I do like his graphics, though.)</p>

<p>Parsinsol and this guy won&#39;t ever be taken seriously unless they can show that they have hit rates that are significantly better than random. To do that, they need to collect their predictions in a way that allows other people to see how accurate they are.</p>

<p>All it would take is a single table: Date prediction was made, length of prediction window, predicted magnitude range, predicted location if any. And then a note of what quakes occurred in or around that window.</p>

<p>When their predictions are in video form, that kind of analysis becomes such a pain in the ass that people won&#39;t do it. That puts a hard cap on how many people will take these predictions seriously.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s <em>never</em> relevant that someone predicted <em>an</em> earthquake. There are so many earthquakes every year that totally random predictions can be right by random chance--especially if they&#39;re nonspecific. </p>

<p>What matters is whether the overall track record for a particular methodology is more accurate than random guessing. I don&#39;t know if these guys don&#39;t know how to make that analysis public or just don&#39;t want to subject themselves to that kind of scrutiny, but it&#39;s hard to take them seriously when they won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because I&#39;m not asking for his methodology. I don&#39;t care <em>how</em> he claims to predict quakes. I want to know whether his predictions are accurate. </p>

<p>Anyone who claims to care about their theory should be interested in whether their predictions are accurate. He doesn&#39;t even seem to care--he&#39;s talking elsewhere about how he &quot;feels&quot; he&#39;s got an amazing track record, but he doesn&#39;t seem to actually be keeping track at all!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I tell you I can predict the weather. I say it&#39;s going to rain this week, and it does! And a month later, I say again that it&#39;s going to rain this week, and it does! I&#39;ve had two hits in a row. But can I actually predict the weather? It rains lots of times, so the predictions might have just been a little lucky.</p>

<p>You&#39;d need to see my hits and misses together to see whether I can predict the weather. How many predictions have I made, how many have been right, and is my success rate better than random guessing would be. It&#39;s the simplest possible analysis of accuracy.</p>

<p>The fact that Parsingsol isn&#39;t interested in tracking his own performance does not give me any confidence in his overall hit rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he could demonstrate that his predictions were better than random, his warnings would get more attention and could reach many more people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no good reason to not track his predictions systematically. There are lots of bad reasons, primarily not wanting to be shown to be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a good reason might be that its a bunch of works just so shit posting anons on reddit can continually site it to call bullshit on him and discredit his work.</p>

<p>if your that dead set why not put in some work yourself to track it? the reality is the only reason you would is to try and call bullshit on him. frankly why would you do extra work just for some one to use it against you if your model hasnt been perfected.</p>

<p>its not like he is submitting the theory to full peer review when its the first draft of the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So after watching that, I watched his prediction from a couple of days ago (17/09) for global activity and just now in the past few minutes we had an earthquake (MM5.1), right where he said (I&#39;m in Wellington, New Zealand)</p>

<p>his video here (starts at relevant time): <a href="https://youtu.be/zMG4r0F5Pak?t=1802">https://youtu.be/zMG4r0F5Pak?t=1802</a>

<p>That&#39;s pretty frikken cool to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah got it totally wrong to be fair.  Just shotgun approach nonsense.</p>

<p>On that note, I predict m there will be a 4.9 quake in Mauritius on Thursday </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because I&#39;m not asking for his methodology. I don&#39;t care <em>how</em> he claims to predict quakes. I want to know whether his predictions are accurate. </p>

<p>Anyone who claims to care about their theory should be interested in whether their predictions are accurate. He doesn&#39;t even seem to care--he&#39;s talking elsewhere about how he &quot;feels&quot; he&#39;s got an amazing track record, but he doesn&#39;t seem to actually be keeping track at all!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I tell you I can predict the weather. I say it&#39;s going to rain this week, and it does! And a month later, I say again that it&#39;s going to rain this week, and it does! I&#39;ve had two hits in a row. But can I actually predict the weather? It rains lots of times, so the predictions might have just been a little lucky.</p>

<p>You&#39;d need to see my hits and misses together to see whether I can predict the weather. How many predictions have I made, how many have been right, and is my success rate better than random guessing would be. It&#39;s the simplest possible analysis of accuracy.</p>

<p>The fact that Parsingsol isn&#39;t interested in tracking his own performance does not give me any confidence in his overall hit rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one claiming to be able to predict earthquakes. The issue isn&#39;t whether or not I can predict them, it&#39;s whether or not <a href="/u/parsingsol">/u/parsingsol</a> can. </p>

<p>In 2016 there were 16 earthquakes with a magnitude between 7.0-7.9. That&#39;s an average of one 7.0-7.9 earthquake every 22 days. That means there&#39;s a 40% chance of having a quake within any 9 day window. He also completely missed the area.</p>

<p>If he had been a week late I&#39;d be willing to bet that a ton of people would say &quot;wow he was only off by a week!&quot; ignoring the fact that there&#39;s a nearly 2 in 3 chance of a 7.0-7.9 quake in any given 2 week period.</p>
