       They weren't wrong. It was the end of an age. The interpretations that the world would end was wrong. Bad shit is coming, but the world will not end.

       Even if the bible prophecies are fulfilled, that still didn't mean the end of the world.

       The Mayans 2012 and the Christians 9/23/2017 are the same general things.  Both signify the end of the Age of Pisces and the beginning of the Age of Aquarius.

       I'm not good enough is astrology to track the positions of various planets in various houses, but I think the gist is when the Sun rises in the East, which ever constillation is behind it is the Age we are in.  Imprecise measurements (I see it like football, do we count the nose of the ball over the line as IN or the whole ball must cross the line for IN, bible astrologers and Mayan astrologers may have had different "rules").

       Well, the Draco who were in charge for the last tens of thousands of years left Earth, and the Illuminati they setup and control are now fighting each other in the vacuum while the world wakes up to their shenanigans.

       There's like trillions of alien species out there, there's no way they're all demons. But that's just my opinion :)

       That's a difficult question to answer. From what I've gathered, it was a combination of factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The control they had over us was actually given to them by us about 16 and a half thousand years ago. Humanity was in a really bad spot and our world was messed us when the Draco offered to take charge and fix things. We took the easy way out, but of course they then went on and enslaved our planet and harvested us and our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they were doing was mostly legal, and the stuff they were doing that wasn't was well hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess word of what was happening eventually reached a certain authority and they got smacked down.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this, they are busy in many parts of the galaxy and situations elsewhere needed more of their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing is some cosmic event created by the universe to help balance out this part of space where darkness had really grown. Universe is always working to balance light and dark. Duality is the catalyst for change and growth, so we need both, but too much of either always causes a push to return to balance. The pendulum swinging. So a wave of energy is sweeping through to help with that, and it makes the Draco uncomfortable since they are on the negative side.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing that might have also pushed them away is they might have literally had a change of heart.  They have been "feeding" off our energies for thousands of years. Its like a really potent drug and also like a life extension tool. Well, it might be that doing this for so long started to change them, they started to get slight feelings of human empathy and I heard it was almost like a warrior's respect for his enemy. We humans really are good at adapting, caring, and also our creativity and imagination is something they lack. So they might see us a bit different now then they use to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that's about it. I know its weird, but I hope it helps.
