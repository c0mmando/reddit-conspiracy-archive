       Relevance, most likely. I grew up with kids who had relatives who survived the holocaust, so it was natural that the schools would teach that. Also, at least in the US, we learned about the Native American genocide, again because of its local relevance. I wonder if anyone from outside the US can weigh in?

       Well, it feels odd that everyone is overlooking the fact that The Holocaust is fairly relevant in explaining WW2, an event that set the stage for the dynamic we see throughout basically the entire world.

       UK here. We only ever learnt about the holocaust. The term was coined in 1944 to describe what was happening to the Jewish people occupied in Nazi territory.

        It's well known that the word holocaust is far older than ww2 and has been used by Jews themselves well before ww2, which is not surprising since it is derived from the Hebrew shoah.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The word "holocaust" originally derived from the Greek word holokauston, meaning "a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering," or "a burnt sacrifice offered to a god." In Greek and Roman pagan rites, gods of the earth and underworld received dark animals, which were offered by night and burnt in full. The word "holocaust" was later adopted in Greek translations of the Torah to refer to the olah,[3] standard communal and individual sacrificial burnt offerings that Jews were required[4] to make in the times of the Beit HaMikdash (Temple in Jerusalem). In its Latin form, holocaustum, the term was first used with specific reference to a massacre of Jewish people by the chroniclers Roger of Howden[5] and Richard of Devizes in England in the 1190s.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
       The earliest use of the word holocaust to denote a massacre recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1833 when the journalist Leitch Ritchie, describing the wars of the medieval French monarch Louis VII, wrote that he "once made a holocaust of thirteen hundred persons in a church", a massacre by fire of the inhabitants of Vitry-le-François in 1142. As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering. The English poet John Milton had used the word to denote a conflagration in his 1671 poem Samson Agonistes, in which the massacre was clearly divinely dedicated.[7] The word gradually developed to mean a massacre thereon, taking on a secular connotation.[8][9]"

       Then along comes you, too much of a dipshit to read and understand spouting off about something unrelated and so intent on winning an argument that you don't seem to notice you invented it yourself.

       Full of shit. "Genocide" was coined to describe Armenian mass murder by the Young Turks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Raphael Lemkin was explicitly moved by the annihilation of Armenians to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word genocide in 1943."

       Because apparently the Jews sacrificed the jews so people would feel bad for Israel and allow them to establish the new world order and also the holocaust never happened.

       Not true, the word is WAY older than this and has been used in Europe since the 12th Century to mean burning or sacrificing of people. Outside Europe, it goes back even further.

       Yea but they dress it up with cute words like "Westward expansion" and then showed us all the reserves they set aside for them in basically worthless land. It's funny Hitler talked about "living space" for Germans in their Third Reich. It's like there was a great example for him to follow that had been done 100 years before in the USz

       I was eluding to how the Jews have their "Holocaust" Museum...there is a whole Holocaust industry and it makes them a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Native Americans have received no benefits from their suffering as did the jews. No so called reparations at all...
      </p>

       I have respect for the National Park service and I'm sure the Cherokee Museum is very educational, but it's not nearly enough.

       Did you learn about the founding of the eugenics movement in America? The Tuskegee experiment? Forced sterilisation in jails and mental hospitals? Hysterectomies and sterilization procedures given to African America and Native American women post csection? Whoops, it's all ok, we beat the Nazis!  Nevermind that we're earth's prison slave labor mecca and tossed away the bill of rights after we set our own Reichstag Fire.

       A lot of the history is dramatised around colonisation. It wasn't an invasion like with America. It was a bunch of upper classaristorcrats who dumped their lower class criminal slaves here, and worked them like dogs.

       You know my people were sad when they realized they couldn't enslave your people because of the lack of immunity to European pestilence. They were fucking sad about having to import their slaves. White people problems.

       Any white person who isn't a multi millionaire needs to realize the rich see us all as on the same level, no matter our rece. We're all expendable SERFs. They'll do anything to us to preserve the order of things.

       No. You clearly have never read about the holocaust and reasons for it. Hitler gave the idea then people below him started innovating and murdering to please him and improve their position in the nazi hierarchy.

       Maybe that's because they had a strong sense of religious and national community that brought them into conflict with people who wanted them to convert, religiously or nationally. You can see the same thing with Roma today, but there is no grand conspiracy of the roma controlling everything?

       They we're also generally more educated as a population as to be a good Jew you need to be able to read the torah where on the priest needs to be able to read in Christianity. And for most of the history of the world when something bad happens the wealthy and educated are blamed.

       If Hasbara means Israeli propaganda then you are wrong about Arendt, she was openly critical of Israel and her book
       <em>
        Eichmann in Jerusalem

       got her heavily criticized in the country.

       Yeah I remember having a full class debate over whether the trail of tears could be considered a genocide. And we talked about the rowandan one and  a couple more that I forget. I think OP was either homeschooled or is full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also im not sure is the great leap forward counts as a genocide, or any of the things Stalin did. Because isn't genocide have to be specific ethnic cleansing?

       There have been other wars than the World Wars and the American civil war, other revolutions than the American and the French, etc. Things that directly involve the US or Europe are deemed more relevant to Western students. Genocides in Africa aren't taught in school for the same reason nothing else about Africa is taught in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the world should absolutely do what it can to stop the genocides in the Sudan, Myanmar, and anywhere else. It'd also be great if the media cared about more than what concerns the West directly.

       Because if people knew that the real holocaust was on Germans, Russians,and Armanians ectthey would riot. If they look closer and notice it's the Jews (not all obvs) behind the murder of over a billion people ( including Russians, Arabs, Chinese (Mao), and Germans). There would be blood on the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The German Holocaust is particularly disgusting once you realise they are paying millions in reperations to the Zionist Jews who tortued and bruttaly killed so many of their people "Gas Chambers" and "Ovens" arenothing compared to the brutality of the Zionist Jews.

       A better question to ask is: why are there LAWS for questioning the Jewish Holocaust. Why aren't we sent to jail for denying the Armenian genocide? Does truth need laws to protect it? I believe not.

       Right. Well, there ARE laws. That's the point. No other genocide has laws protecting it. Can you find one?

       Also, America is owned by the very same group who helped create these laws.

       What school did you go to?  We were taught about the Armenian genocide, the French conquest of Algeria, Great Irish Famine, North Korean Famine, Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam Famine for starters...of course the genocide of Native Americans.  That was a huge topic in High School

       I agree. I remember hearing about the Armenian genocide and knowing nothing at all about it, certainly not from school
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a way to downplay the fact that genocide is rampant and a natural part of human evolution.

       I regularly see people refer to it as "the worst atrocity ever committed." Shit, it wasn't even the worst atrocity committed in
       <em>
        the same decade.
       </em>
       But the only thing anyone in the West knows about is the holocaust because it's depicted so much in Hollywood and the media and public schools (all mostly operated by Jews, not a coincidence.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that outside the West, the majority of people don't believe in the holocaust? Because they haven't been indoctrinated and emotionally manipulated since childhood to believe it. It's easier for them to look at it objectively and see that it stinks to high heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't even get into the details of how the official narrative is bullshit, because the people here who know already know and the ones who don't are too thoroughly brainwashed to ever accept it.

       Because it's a guilt thing. Israel feeds off it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has spent its ENTIRE life, even back into the Bible, being entitled little shits. Just going wherever they want, killing and raping under the command of their god. With no feelings of guilt because 'we are the chosen ones!' 
'Poor pitiful' Israel has its fingers in so many religions. While some factions of Christians hate them for the death of Jesus, many consider Israelites holy and chosen. My own parents send money to charity's who's purpose is to fly Jewish people back to Israel and help reclaim Palestine. They couldn't afford Christmas for their children but they could send hundreds of dollars to fund the genocide of Palestinian children. These same Scotch-Irish parents insist on wearing stars of David and have Hebrew religious items all over the house even though they are Christian. 
These are the people who are pushing for MORE aid to be sent to Israel. Who want a war. 
And the whole world just bends over backwards for them because 'oh well remember the Holocaust?' Guess what?! They weren't the only ones dying in the chambers. In fact, WE LEFT GAY MEN IN THE CAMPS TO DIE WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER. But do we act like we owe them crap? No in fact they just got rights a couple years ago. 
There is also evidence to suggest that the death toll may have been greatly exaggerated. For there to have been that many deaths, EVERY Jewish woman in Germany alone would have had to have at LEAST 6 children each. 
Then we have the Rothchilds. A Jewish 'family' that controls the worlds money, the same world that is constantly giving Israel a pass. 
If you really step back you begin to see Israel as the manipulative liar. They want to cry and guilt trip everyone. But the moment we aren't looking they are killing small children and trying to start a Holy War.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a point here. My point is shit happens ok. Bad shit happens to country's and people are assholes. So what gives Israel this pass they seem to have? 
They didn't invent genocide. They just gave it a new name. 
I'm not anti Semitic, I just feel that they shouldn't be able to walk all over everyone and then play the victim any time someone tells them to stop.

       I learned about the Holocaust, Holodomor, Rwandan Genocide, Khmer Rouge, and genocide of Native Americans in school. Maybe your school has a shitty curriculum, or maybe you simply didn't pay enough attention, but the idea that there is a global movement to only teach about the Holocaust doesn't fit with my reality.

        For more than 20 years, Robert Faurisson has been Europe's foremost Holocaust revisionist scholar.
       </p>
       <p>
        For his views Faurisson has repeatedly been a victim of physical assault.
Between November 1978 and May 1993 he was a victim of ten attacks, 
at least nine of them carried out by Jewish thugs. 
None of the criminal assailants in any of these assaults has ever 
been brought to justice. 
The most savage was a nearly fatal attack on September 16, 1989, 
for which a group calling itself "The Sons of the Memory of the Jews"
claimed responsibility.

       This is from an American perspective; In my opinion I think that history taught to students in the US tends to be very US-centric, specifically focusing on how certain events changed or benefited the US, rather than how they changed or benefited the world. I think that because the US had a part in the liberation of concentration camps, it's considered something to be proud of. Because we never "saved" anyone from the Khmer Rouge or directly aided any Tutsi during the Rwandan Genocide, people don't view it as essential to high school US history.

       That's just my opinion though.

       Only in public school. Private schools teach more history, but it may have to do with recency coupled with timeframe of number killed.

       Not to worry, soon the Holocaust will be expunged from history books. The only way they can repeat history is when we forget it ever happened.

       In Romania they barely even teach the kids holocaust, but yeah It's mostly the other one that's highlighted in a way. Until I was around 15 I thought it was the ONLY genocide that has ever happened, then I researched and found out much more. I have no idea why is this to be honest...

       I am not sure if it's an official part of the curriculum but a teacher I know told me about her talking about the Armenian genocide and getting heavy push back from the Turkish parents of two of her pupils. Sad times.

       Several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was considered part of the driving motivation to fight the Nazis in World War II, and school history curriculums (at least American ones) love covering wars, especially WWII, because of how widespread it was and less morally grey than WWI.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The motivation behind it was ultimately to eliminate a race of people (as well as other "undesirables") from a continent, if not the world. Other genocides in the same era were usually of political opposition, such as Stalin's Forced Famine in the Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, as well as the Cambodian genocide.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The organization behind it has gained notoriety for rounding up people to send them to death camps rather than just killing them wherever they were found.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's the most recent attempt at eliminating a group of people for their race/ethnicity, rather than political opposition, with such a high estimated death count. The earliest year it's estimated to have started isn't even 100 years ago, so it still has a historical significance reaching to the present.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was part of the Nazis' invasion of multiple countries, and invading countries and killing their people gains more historical notoriety than killing people within the country they already rule.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's not the only genocide to get taught in schools. Things like Stalin's killing of his own people, the Cambodian Genocide, Apartheid, and the slaughter of Native Americans are usually taught as well.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I know what this post is implying, that the only reason the Holocaust gets covered so much is because they want us to believe it's real when it really isn't. Or that the Jews want to play the victim card to excuse their attempted takeover of the world (which is incredibly ironic). But there are actually several reasons why it has enough historical significance to be covered in nearly every history class.

       Whenever I point out the fact that zionist jews may be scheming to manipulate, deceive and brainwash the people, in order to eventually control or take over several governments (usually of developed nations), I almost always get a "So.. to what purpose?, what to they expect to accomplish with that?, enslave us? .. cmon" type reply.

       West Coast public school kid:  Nothing about the Native genocides.  Trail of Tears, yes, but mostly as an event, lacking the "holocaust" energy that WWII has.
      </p>

       Certainly nothing like the great leap forward or the rwandan genocide.  Not the Armenian genocide, nothing.

       I learned about Rwanda in high school, I think that was some form of genocide. Also the khmer rouge were taught in my school. Both not as big as the holocaust but we were taught about them. Nothing about how the native Americans were slaughtered though, just how they were akin to an insurgent force.

       I was taught about a lot of them in school, namely the hutus and the tootsis in the 90s, but also we glazed over other genocides like the Armenian genocide. granted the holocaust did take center stage.

       Canadian here.  Only taught about the Holocaust.  Officially.  I mean the teacher talked that it was a genocide, that it wasn't the first, wont be the last.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why, as a North American, it's the big one.  Because it happened when the whole world was fighting Nazis.  And I imagine a liberal american educator would love to extole the virtues of fighting evil and doing good.  Stopping industrialized killing of people has to be a good thing.  And, as I remember it in my Canadian education, the Holocaust was't just Jews.  Gypsy's, homesexuals, lefties.  If we didn't stop it, it wouldn't have stopped with them.  Slavs would have come next.  Then who?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect we don't teach about the atrocities our ancestors committed because saying we don't want to admit we can place such low value on life.  I know we european settlers obliterated whole peoples and cultures.  Hard to think of yourself as a good Canadian, and Canada as a good place if you really have to face what evil it took to create it.  To create you.

       "The word "holocaust" originally derived from the Greek word holokauston, meaning "a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering," or "a burnt sacrifice offered to a god." In Greek and Roman pagan rites, gods of the earth and underworld received dark animals, which were offered by night and burnt in full. The word "holocaust" was later adopted in Greek translations of the Torah to refer to the olah,[3] standard communal and individual sacrificial burnt offerings that Jews were required[4] to make in the times of the Beit HaMikdash (Temple in Jerusalem). In its Latin form, holocaustum, the term was first used with specific reference to a massacre of Jewish people by the chroniclers Roger of Howden[5] and Richard of Devizes in England in the 1190s.[6]
      </p>
      <p>
       The earliest use of the word holocaust to denote a massacre recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1833 when the journalist Leitch Ritchie, describing the wars of the medieval French monarch Louis VII, wrote that he "once made a holocaust of thirteen hundred persons in a church", a massacre by fire of the inhabitants of Vitry-le-François in 1142. As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering. The English poet John Milton had used the word to denote a conflagration in his 1671 poem Samson Agonistes, in which the massacre was clearly divinely dedicated.[7] The word gradually developed to mean a massacre thereon, taking on a secular connotation.[8][9]"
