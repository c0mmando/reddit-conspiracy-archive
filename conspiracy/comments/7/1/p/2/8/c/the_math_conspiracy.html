        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are fewer people in the deep state than in the public community, including in science. So how can the deep state remain having an upper hand?</p>

<p>True knowledge is power. False knowledge is detrimental. By tricking the public scientific community into adopting false theories, the deep state clandestine scientific community can retain their control and power.</p>

<p>This includes knowledge in mathematics. As an example of how the public scientific community has been tricked, let&#39;s examine the set of real numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 and call this set S. The claim is that the set S is uncountable.</p>

<p>We can construct a bijection from N to S with binary representation like this: n(x) = sum(2<sup>xsi),</sup> where xsi is the i:th binary digit of the real number x in S. The set S is therefore countable. Cantor&#39;s theorem is false and a conspiracy to mislead the public scientific community.</p>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, the value n(x) represents the natural number for x in S. And only bits that are 1 should be included, so n(x) = sum(xi2<sup>i</sup> ), [xi is x subscript i] and for example with x = 0.1001101...</p>

<p>Then n(x) = 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>6</sup> + ...</p>

<p>A cop out claim is that real numbers can have an infinite number of decimals and that Cantor&#39;s theorem therefore is true, but at the same time a common definition of the set of real numbers uses Dedekind cuts, which only are gaps between subsets of the set of rational numbers R which doesn&#39;t prove uncountability. The number 1/3 for example has an infinite number of decimals, yet R has the same cardinality as N.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. And when I looked up the definition of e and found sum(1/n!), that&#39;s a rational number! Because infinity is not a number that can be reached.

<p>Anyway, as a side note I found on Wikipedia: &quot;Moreover, R  has the same number of elements as the power set of N.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting. 2<sup>N</sup> can be mapped to N like this (me shooting from the hip here :D):</p>

<p>P = 2<sup>N</sup></p>

<p>p = a unique natural number for the subsets in P</p>

<p>n(p) = 2<sup>p</sup></p>

<p>Bijection! And therefore the set of real numbers R and the set of natural numbers N have the same cardinality.</p>

<p>I was thinking of the same principle as when the set of even numbers get the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers. That can be done with the mapping n(e) = 2e. In this way the set of natural numbers is &quot;stretched&quot; to fit the set of even numbers.</p>

<p>Similarly, the idea is that n(p) = 2<sup>p</sup> is a mapping that stretches the set of natural numbers enough to always allow the natural numbers to be mapped one-to-one with the natural numbers of p.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your function has to map from natural numbers to sets of natural numbers or the other way around. How else can it be a bijection?</p>

<p>If p is a set then 2<sup>p</sup> maps to a set of sets if p is a natural number 2<sup>p</sup> is a natural number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So first, this isn&#39;t a bijection because it isn&#39;t surjective, you are missing every natural number that isn&#39;t a power of 2.</p>

<p>And more importantly</p>

<p>That is only possible if there is a bijection to the natural numbers or a subset of them. You are assuming your conclusion.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a crazy idea. If you can turn the subsets into numbers, just map every subset to the number. That&#39;s exactly what the point of the bijection is.</p>

<p>That&#39;s easy. The number 1/3 in binary form is: 0.0101010101...</p>

<p>Here is a proof that |R| = |N|:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can not define a function into a set that doesn&#39;t exist yet.<br/>
You can&#39;t define R by having a function that maps to R, because that doesn&#39;t exist before being defined.<br/>
That&#39;s why the construction of the reals usually uses Dedekind cuts or equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in Q, neither of which you seem to have even the tiniest amount of grasp on.</p>

<p>How about you spend some time reading up on this stuff before claiming to have overthrown well established knowledge?</p>

<p>How arrogant do you have to be, to think that for hundreds of years everyone that was presented this and concluded it made sense is wrong and that you, without even understanding basic concepts involved like what a set or a function is, have found the flaw in it that will overthrow mathematics as we know it?</p>

<p>There is no subjectivity in math, things are proven logically.
If something is proven to be true, it will never stop being true with new knowledge being discovered or us achieving deeper insights into the universe or a regime change or whatever.</p>

<p>x = sum(9*10<sup>-n)</sup></p>

<p>y = sum(8*10<sup>-n</sup> + 10<sup>-(n-1))</sup> - 19</p>

<p>Yet the decimal expansions differ:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+n%3D1,5+(9*10%5E-n">x = 0.99999...</a>)</p>

There are only ever two infinite binary sequences that identify the same number.</p>

Those are the only two sequences that will map to the same value.</p>

<p>Since that&#39;s a link to Wikipedia, no conspiracy theories there. However, the key problem with Cantor&#39;s theorem is that it compares numbers with equal number of digits, such as: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument</a></p>

<p>In truth there are an infinite number of possible extensions of number of digits, so Cantor makes a mistake by comparing numbers of increasing yet equal number of digits. Because compare with the set of even numbers E which has the same (infinite) cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers N. This can be shown by the mapping e(n) = 2n. In this case N is &quot;stretched&quot; to fit E, yet in Cantor&#39;s diagonal argument that kind of stretching has been limited.</p>

One idea I came to think of is to look at all the Dedekind cuts, and at most there can be only one cut between each rational number pair with minimal difference between the numbers. And then the rational numbers can be mapped to the set of even numbers and the cuts (which include the irrational numbers) can be mapped to the set of odd numbers, i.e. the set of real numbers R then is shown to have the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers, which means R is countable.</p>

<p>One idea I came to think of is to look at all the Dedekind cuts, and at most there can be only one cut between each rational number pair with minimal difference between the numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;a rational number pair with minimal difference between the numbers&quot;. If you give me a pair of distinct rational numbers a and b, then I can find a rational number c between them, so that the difference between a and c and the difference between c and b is smaller than the difference between a and b (For example c=(a+b)/2 has this property). So what do you mean when you talk about a &quot;rational number pair with minimal distance between the numbers&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have two distinct rational numbers, then there are infinitely many real numbers between them. And similarly if you have two distinct real numbers then there are infinitely many rational numbers between them. So I don´t see how &quot;mapping the rationals to the even numbers and mapping the irrationals to the odd numbers&quot; is supposed to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way of describing it is to map the rational numbers to the natural numbers. And then it&#39;s easy to see that the minimum difference between a pair of natural numbers is 1 (the pair here is not allowed to contain the same number).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t work. There are bijection between the rational numbers and the natural numbers, but they are not monotonous.</p>

<p>As an example let´s just take a list of all rational numbers from a random website.</p>

<p><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Rational_Numbers_are_Countably_Infinite#Proof_1">https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Rational_Numbers_are_Countably_Infinite#Proof_1</a></p>

<p>In this list the first entry is 0/1. The second entry is 1/1. As far as I understand you, you suggest that in this situation 0/1 and 1/1 have minimum distance. But 1/2 is inbetween them, and has smaller distance to both of them, so the distance between is not minimal. If you want your suggestion to work, then you need to find a list of all rational numbers where the entries are always getting bigger and never smaller, and that doesn´t exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, any irrational number will have infinitely many non-zero digits in any base, since irrationals have terminating expansions by definition. But as your example shows, we don&#39;t even need to consider the irrationals to show that n(x) is not a bijection between N and R. Any rational with a denominator that is not a power of 2 will have infinitely many 1 bits in its expansion, and thus map to infinity, which again shows that n(x) is many to one. e.g. n(1/3) and n(1/5) both map to infinity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My idea is that there can at most be only one cut between each rational number. And the set of rational numbers Q has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers N. And since the set of even numbers E also has the same cardinality as N, all the rational numbers can be mapped to E and all the cuts can be mapped to the set of odd numbers O.

    <div class="md"><p>The set of rational numbers is dense in R, but does not have the same cardinality.</p>

<p>I get that that is counter intuitive. Nevertheless it is true.</p>

<p>If they had the same cardinality you&#39;d be able to list the real numbers in a specific order, thus creating a bijection N &lt;=&gt; R, which Cantor has proved impossible quite conclusively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be great if you did, alas you didn&#39;t.<br/>
The reason your function isn&#39;t a bijection has been pointed out to you repeatedly I think.</p>

<p>And Cantors theorem is something else than the Cantor diagonalization argument. It works just as well though.</p>

<p>We can pretty easily show that the powerset of the natural numbers is bijective to the real numbers in the interval [0,1].<br/>
The powerset is the set of all subsets of N.<br/>
Now every subset S of N corresponds to the number that has a 1 in it&#39;s n-th binary place exactly if S contains the n-th number in N.<br/>
So N maps to 1, the empty set maps to 0 and {1,2,3} maps to 0.111.<br/>
This is pretty clearly a bijection, so we know that P(n) has the same cardinality as [0,1].  </p>

<p>Now Cantors theorem states that the cardinality of any set is <strong>strictly</strong> smaller than that of its powerset.<br/>
So since R and P(n) have the same cardinality N has to have smaller cardinality than R.</p>

<p>The proof for that is one I actually prefer to the diagonalization argument:<br/>
Assume a bijection f:N-&gt;P(N) exists, then it is also surjective.<br/>
Consider the set B that contains all numbers n that are mapped to a set that doesn&#39;t contain them. So B = {n in N | n not in f(n)}.<br/>
Since f is surjective it has to map to every subset of N, which contains B, so there is some x with f(x) = B. Now if f(x)=B, then B can not contain x, but if B doesn&#39;t contain x, then it should contain x.</p>

<p>This is clearly a contradiction, so such a bijection can not exist.</p>

<p>Therefore the cardinality of N is strictly smaller than that of P(n) and also R.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mapping is not a bijection and people have pointed out the reason for that repeatedly, so I&#39;m not even going to engage that.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take a look at 2<sup>N</sup> .
It&#39;s the set of all subsets of N.
Any subset of N either contains or doesn&#39;t contain the n-th natural number. So for example the set that contains all of them is N and the set that contains none of them is the empty set.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s easy to see that this is bijective to [0,1].<br/>
Let&#39;s say that for a set A, A_n is 0 if A doesn&#39;t contain n and is 1 if it does.<br/>
Then f(A) = Sum A_n*2<sup>-n</sup>  is obviously a bijection between P(A) and [0,1].</p>

<p>The decimal representation of a number isn&#39;t the number, it&#39;s a representation. 0.25 = 1/4 =2/8. You can have lots of representations of the same number.</p>

<p>And yes, a real number can have infinitely many digits, because it is still bounded. Almost all real numbers between 0 and 1 have an infinite decimal representation. But none of them are bigger than 1.

<p>So I know that for <em>any</em> pair of numbers a and b you give me, there are some numbers c so such that a &lt; c &lt; b.  So you cannot construct such a pair a, b.</p>

<p>QED.  :-D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &quot;each rational number&quot;? You can&#39;t mean &quot;each successive rational number&quot;, because without the concept of minimal distance pairs, there&#39;s no such thing as successive rational numbers. And you can&#39;t mean &quot;at most one cut between any two rational numbers&quot; either, because then for any two cuts, you could find a rational number greater than the upper cut and a rational number less than the lower cut.</p>

<p>If you mean to say &quot;For any two cuts there exists a rational number between them&quot;, that that&#39;s just a restatement of the theorem that there exists at least one rational number between any two irrational numbers, and I don&#39;t see how that helps your proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we start with the Wikipedia definition: &quot;In mathematics, a Dedekind cut is а method of construction of the real numbers. It is a partition of the rational numbers into two non-empty sets A and B, such that all elements of A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element.&quot;</p>

<p>So the partition is always so that A contains the smaller numbers and B contains the larger numbers. How many different such partitions are possible? The answer is at most |Q|, i.e. the cardinality (&quot;size&quot;) of the set of rational numbers. So again, the number of Dedekind cuts is at most one for each rational number. </p>

I can easily define the two sets, but there is no closest rational to the square root of two from either side. So which rational number would identify that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you can dedekind cut the real numbers between A &lt; 1 and B &gt;= 1. And this is valid because A is less than all elements of B, and A doesn&#39;t have a largest element.</p>

<p>Because if I said .99 is the largest element, you could just tack on another .009 and get .999 which is larger.</p>

<p>And then you can do this for all rational numbers, |Q|?</p>

<p>And then you can do this for sqrt(2) so the sqrt(2) is rational.</p>

But A <strong>has</strong> to contain infinitely many elements to do that.</p>

<p>Of course there is only one possible split, because there is only one square root of 2. If there was more than one, Dedekind cuts would do a poor job of defining the reals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ordering of the elements in a set doesn&#39;t matter. The set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} is the same as the set {3,5,2,7,1,6,4}. For a countable infinite set like the set of rational numbers Q all the elements can&#39;t be listed, but nevertheless there is a clearly defined ordering of the elements in Q allowing the construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut">Dedekind cuts</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;It is a partition of the rational numbers into two non-empty sets A and B, such that all elements of A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element.&quot;</p>

<p>Take for example A containing all rational numbers less than 1 and B containing all rational numbers greater than or equal to 1. Then there is no limit to how many rational numbers there are 0.999... yet those numbers are still all elements of Q. A Dedekind cut doesn&#39;t add rational numbers to Q.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s clearly defined which rational numbers belong to A and which numbers belong to B. And because the ordering of the elements in A and B doesn&#39;t matter, there is only one possible split of Q into A and B for each cut.</p>

<p>Therefore the cardinality of the set of all cuts cannot be larger than the cardinality of Q.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, yes you could be right. I made an amateurish definition of the set of real numbers earlier that actually has numbers with an infinite number of decimals. The example is for the interval [0, 2) but can easily be scaled to [0, 1):</p>

<p>N = {0, 1, 2, ...} is the set of natural numbers.</p>

<p>T = {1, 1/2, 1/4, ...} which is 2<sup>-n</sup> for all elements n in N.</p>

<p>P = 2<sup>T</sup> = {{}, {1}, {1/2}, {1/4}, {1, 1/2}, {1, 1/4}, {1/2, 1/4}, {1, 1/2, 1/4}, ...}</p>

<p>The power set P of T contains subsets of rational numbers in such way that the combinations represent all real numbers in the interval.</p>

<p>And for example in the video the presenter said iirc that it&#39;s impossible to make a general equality comparison of two real numbers because of the possibility of an infinite number of decimals. Yet with my definition, value x and y are equal iif x and y are the same member in P. That&#39;s just a basic set comparison. (Of course 0.999... is then a different number than 1.0 but I think that&#39;s valid.) Maybe even addition and so on can be defined for P.</p>

<p>Actually it isn&#39;t as that assumes a craptonnes of things, for example it assumes a priori
1: The limit existing, which, if you only have rational numbers, most don&#39;t
2: It assumes you can do a sum of inifnitely many terms, which in rational numbers you cannot so there is an issue there.</p>

<p>To name a few, it is an increadibly ugly definition as it assumes a craptonne of things.</p>

<p>When you start going to the root of things for limits and all, defining what a limit is, you still suffer rom the limit not existing as an element. So to create this we need to use other things. This is where dedekinds cuts come in, we have the ability, by ZFC, to create sets like that and can show it will create the neccisery limits we desire.</p>

<p>We can also use cauchy sequences and do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found: &quot;4. Comparability (trichotomy law): For any a,b in S, either a&lt;=b or b&lt;=a.</p>

<p>The first three are the axioms of a partial order, while addition of the trichotomy law defines a total order.&quot; -- <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotallyOrderedSet.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotallyOrderedSet.html</a></p>

<p>Then for total ordering, the following condition is added:</p>

<p>∀x∀y(x≤y ∨ y≤x)</p>

<p>But yes, it is different than the set of real numbers, because in my definition for example 0.4999... is a different number than 0.5 whereas in the set of real numbers they are the same (due to the use of limits I assume).</p>

<p>Instead of the set of real numbers R it can be called the set of standard numbers D, by forming numbers z.f where z is an integer and f is a member of P (the power set of T I defined earlier):</p>

<p>Trichotomy is a property in an ordered set that says for any 2 elements a, b in S, that a&lt;b, a=b or a&gt;b, and only one at a time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which also kills the supremum property, your system doesn&#39;t have it and CANNOT have it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, why would you do this? This satisfies none of the properties we want and have wonky things such as as not all elements are comparable and even your definition z.f is non-sense. You haven&#39;t said what kind of structure it really is. You can go with ordered pair (z,f) but how do you compare then? (z,f)&gt;(x,g) when what?</p>

<p>z&gt;x and g is subset of f?</p>

<p>You have illdefined things and you cannot throw any number of axioms at something and hope it works, your thing is incoherent selfdefeating.</p>

<p>I ask you, why are you doing this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok that&#39;s a reasonable question. If you suppose a map from the natural numbers to R and follow cantors argument to obtain a new real number which wasn&#39;t mapped to, the new one has only 0s and 1s. The trick is that whenever there was a &#39;9&#39; in the binary expansion of the nth real number mapped to, we have to be sure to make the nth digit of our new number 1 rather than 0. if we do this then there is no way that the new number was already in the sequence. (because we would have to have repeating 9s which is the same as a 0, not a 1).</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good question though, and a subtlety of the argument which is important to notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a mathematician.  Your proof is wrong from the get-go.</p>

<p>You define <code>S</code> to be <code>[0, 1]</code> - the set of all the real numbers from 0 to 1 - and then claim that the function <code>n</code> is a bijection from <code>N</code> onto <code>S</code>.</p>

<p>However, the very first example you give, <code>n(x) = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^6 + ...</code> does <em>not</em> in fact give you a number in <code>S</code>, i.e. a real number between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> - indeed, the sum seems to be unbounded (&quot;goes to infinity&quot;).</p>

<p>So you&#39;re obviously badly confused already.</p>

<p>In order to go further, I&#39;d have to try to guess what &quot;bijection&quot; you really meant to talk about, which I&#39;m not going to do.  My idea is that if you cleaned up what you meant, you would eventually get a function <code>n</code> into <code>[0, 1]</code> but that it would be an <em>injection</em> - a function that&#39;s one-to-one but <em>not</em> onto.  </p>

<p>As you can imagine, I&#39;m very very very very doubtful you have a proof that the real numbers are countable.  Were this true, all of measure theory and so basically all of calculus would be grossly inconsistent.  But calculus does actually work - bridges stay up, airplanes don&#39;t fall out of the sky and so on.</p>

<p>However, if you&#39;re interested in going on, if you clean up your &quot;bijection&quot; I&#39;ll take a look at it for you.</p>

<p>From a philosophical viewpoint, I claim ω-1 does exist. At each moment in time there is a defined natural number ω-1. However, in the next moment ω-1 has increased. So from a mathematical perspective we can take a snapshot in time and deal with ω-1 as a uniquely defined natural number.</p>

<p>There is no definition of the natural numbers that has them depend on the time. None of this makes any sense. I asked you to produce a natural number that is equal to 1+1+1+1+..., and you keep dancing around the issue. The number either exists, in which case it can be written down in decimal notation, or it cannot. The fact that you keep resorting to new symbols or pseudo-philosophy to describe this sum tells me that you are unable to evaluate it as a natural number.</p>

<p>Why not? Math processes don&#39;t take time, they&#39;re just done. Can you give me a good reason why 1+1/2+1/4+1/8+... doesn&#39;t equal 2?</p>

<p>If everything follows sound logic and works out to be consistent, then why shouldn&#39;t we be able to consider things like infinite sums?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a problem at all. You <em>can</em> have infinite numbers, but these are usually ordinal numbers like you mentioned earlier, or cardinal numbers, such as in this case. Real numbers can have up to an Aleph_0 amount of digits, and there&#39;s no reason why they shouldn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we are not required for things in mathematics to conform to reality, let&#39;s consider a real world example of an infinite number of steps that can be completed in finite time.</p>

<p>Imagine you are on one side of a room. Your first task is to make it to the middle of the room. Your second task is to make it half way between that point and the far wall. Your third is to make it half way again, and so on. Clearly you have infinite tasks, but these can be completed in finite time by just crossing the room. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dedekind cuts are not defined in terms of two rational numbers, but two special sets of rationals. However the contradiction is obvious even with your incorrect premise. Suppose an ordering gives a,b adjacency. Then let x be irrational s.t. a &lt; x &lt; b. Now suppose another ordering, since your statement should hold for all orderings since your choice was arbitrary, gives the ordering a,c,b. Then there exists an irrational y so a&lt;y&lt;c&lt;b, i.e., a second irrational between x and y.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have that for any n, 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n! is a rational number. My question is: why does that imply that the result of the infinite sum is a rational number?</p>

<p>For example you also have that for all n, the set {1,2,3,...,n} is finite. But that does not imply that the set {1,2,3,...} is finite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I pointed out to Firzen_, there are no ended infinite processes. And using that kind of false construct in mathematics is a part of the conspiracy to mislead the public scientific community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar problem with the claim that real numbers can have an infinite number of decimals while at the same time claiming that infinity is not a number. Another false conspiracy construct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but here is another problem: &quot;Let D be the set of all non-selfish natural numbers. By definition, the power set 𝒫(ℕ) contains all sets of natural numbers, and so it contains this set D as an element. If the mapping is bijective, D must be paired off with some natural number, say d.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to construct a pairing with no non-selfish numbers: n &lt;-&gt; {n, ...} and then D is the empty set and there is no number d.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if the real numbers R is a set, then the element 0.4999... is the same element as 0.5. So how can Cantor use his diagonal argument when many real numbers become fused like that into the same element in R?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>(trichotomy law): For any a,b in S, either a&lt;=b or b&lt;=a.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trichotomy is a property in an ordered set that says for any 2 elements a, b in S, that a&lt;b, a=b or a&gt;b, and only one at a time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But yes, it is different than the set of real numbers, because in my definition for example 0.4999... is a different number than 0.5 whereas in the set of real numbers they are the same (due to the use of limits I assume).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which also kills the supremum property, your system doesn&#39;t have it and CANNOT have it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the set of real numbers R it can be called the set of standard numbers D, by forming numbers z.f where z is an integer and f is a member of P (the power set of T I defined earlier)
D = {z.f | z∈Z, f∈P}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, why would you do this? This satisfies none of the properties we want and have wonky things such as as not all elements are comparable and even your definition z.f is non-sense. You haven&#39;t said what kind of structure it really is. You can go with ordered pair (z,f) but how do you compare then? (z,f)&gt;(x,g) when what?</p>

<p>z&gt;x and g is subset of f?</p>

<p>You have illdefined things and you cannot throw any number of axioms at something and hope it works, your thing is incoherent selfdefeating.</p>

<p>I ask you, why are you doing this?</p>
