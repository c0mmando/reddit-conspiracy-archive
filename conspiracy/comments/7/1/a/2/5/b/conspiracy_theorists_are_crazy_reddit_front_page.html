        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6kgecp/conspiracy_theorists_are_crazy_reddit_front_page/?st=j7subpsc&amp;amp;sh=4493d14b">this</a> post about two months ago:</p>

<hr/>

<p>This <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/6kbie3/next_time_a_conspiracy_theorist_tries_to_tell_you/?st=J4J7SJGI&amp;amp;sh=6b407428">post</a> was trending late last night in r/showerthoughts. The user has since removed the body content.</p>

<p>Now, also on the front page we have <a href="http://www.news18.com/news/buzz/we-do-not-have-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars-nasa-1447965.html">this</a> (&quot;<em>We Do Not Have a Child Slave Colony on Mars: NASA</em>&quot;) in r/nottheonion.</p>

<p>The veracity of Steele&#39;s claim is not important to me, what is, is that both these posts serve the purpose to ridicule anyone who questions &quot;the official narrative&quot; of anything.</p>

<p>Reddit is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com">4th</a> most popular site in the US making an estimated $ <a href="https://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/04/29/report-reddit-falling-short-on-revenue-may-close-content-aggregation-site-upvoted/">20 million</a> dollars last year in revenue. Facebook is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US">3rd</a> most popular site in the US making about $ 26 <em>billion</em> dollars last year in revenue.</p>

<p>They need to clear the narrative for <a href="https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/behind-reddit-funding-round.html">investors</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit still has its albatrosses--namely that its darker corners attract bad actors--and that still makes it a tough sell to advertisers. The harassment and spam that the site is notorious for have been major targets of management, but they are still a massive problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Expect more targeted attacks of this sub.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Over the past 24 hours <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/714v68/losers_are_more_likely_to_believe_in_conspiracy/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=nottheonion">this</a> post (&quot;<em>Losers are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, study finds</em> &quot;) is at the top of r/nottheonion and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/718lta/there_should_be_a_reality_show_where_flatearthers/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=Showerthoughts">this</a> (&quot;<em>There should be a reality show where flat-earthers have to find the edge of the world.)</em> is at the top of r/showerthoughts (as well as r/all currently) both subs which are part of the reddit default sub list.</p>

<p>As a quick aside, I understand the &quot;losers&quot; article title is misleading and personally don&#39;t believe in the flat earth theory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll posit as last time - the veracity of such claims either way is unimportant - what these posts stand to do is to give basic ammunition to anyone who might face cognitive dissonance against their MSM fed understanding of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s some truth right there. The people who make fun of conspiracy theorists and see them as somehow intellectually inferior often believe the mainstream media conspiracy theories without question (Trump/Russia collusion, gas attacks in Syria and son). They are fooled into thinking that network news and publications like the New York Times, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, etc. are authorities on truth. They don&#39;t think about the fact that the media content they consume is created for the purpose of selling advertising, but more importantly to tell them what is acceptable to think and believe. The mass media serves to manipulate the way we perceive our individual realities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is pretty ridiculous indeed. How can people  be considered less educated for conspiracy concepts. I mean these are the people who go out of the way to do research,find patterns/things that don&#39;t match up with what is believed to be true and don&#39;t just take things at face value.</p>

<p>If it smells like dookie, its probably dookie.. if there is legitimate doubt and reasons to make that doubt just. More often than not there&#39;s aome shady shit going on. </p>

<p>There may never be resolution with particular conspiracies, or facts ever proving a conspiracy true but there is no way in hell that searching for truth in things that don&#39;t add up mean you are less educated.</p>

<p>Of course if you have something to hide you want to paint the picture ofconspiracy theorists being batshit crazy. Who would have thought that huh?</p>

<p>What can they say after that? Call you a dummie for knowing all of these facts? Many of the proven conspiracies suddenly make a lot of current theories a bit more plausible because you are no longer debating if something is taking place. You are debating whether the government continued to do something or has done it again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tried and true method of propaganda;  False flags in the information game. </p>

<p>eg. X group pays Y group to do a thing,  And then X group says Z group did it. </p>

<p>And if X group controls largest outlets for the desemination of information and they all share the same narrative, they can paint everyone else as fake news and paint themselves as legitimate. </p>

<p>And those who attempt to stop them, by blowing the whistle or otherwise, will be dragged through the ditches, defemation of character, threats, etc. And if that doesn&#39;t work, you just get a bullet and a cover story is put out. </p>

<p>Textbook Black Ops.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember who said it, but they said the first thing you do after invading a country is to take over the communication systems and media apparatuses. Control the narrative, and you can control minds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to see what&#39;s going on once you understand the rules of the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk about the understatement of... the entire existence of human life right there. Fuck me. </p>

<p>But thank you for saying that; Helps remind me that I&#39;m not alone, you know?  Sure, functioning <em>in</em> and &quot;contributing&quot; <em>to</em> society becomes rather problematic, and extremely difficult to stomach sometimes, but I still do my best to educate others whenever the opportunity arises. I think that those of us aware of what&#39;s going on basically have <em>duty</em> to ourselves and to others to educate them. Granted, that is a difficult prospect in and of itself, but I think if we ever want to envelop a sense of class consciousness to change things, this is a crucial step. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that people talking is dangerous for the status quo. And in my opinion, the internet is perhaps the biggest threat to the game we&#39;ve seen in a long time;  It makes sense they&#39;d want to take it, and for more reasons than just the money. But then again, how much worry do they really have when the majority of people are already trained to follow the herd and the mainstream narratives; Most people still just use the web for the same consumer culture shit and access corporate media like they were doing before the web became the dominant structure of... everything. </p>

<p>Reading between the lines takes critical thinking skills, skills which are not taught, in fact openly rallied against in our childhood socialization, compulsory schooling, etc. (Ever heard of John Taylor Gatti&#39;s book, Dumbing us Down)?</p>

<p>So, yeah. I dunno. </p>

<p>But hey. At least you know what&#39;s up.  :)  And others that subscribe to this sub know what&#39;s up as well. All hail the outcasts of free thinkers. </p>

<p>Trump stole the election, and Wikileaks is Russia, but how dare you question the valuidity of what happened on 9/11?</p>

<p>It&#39;s always interesting to see where they draw the line: Oh the CIA does overthrow governments in the past and has been proven to do so? That&#39;s believable but when you say that the agency had an incentive to remove JFK from power since he&#39;s at odds with their MO it all of a sudden becomes a wild conspiracy theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is one big David Brock noise machine right now.  Which is ironic, because I read his book &quot;The Republican Noise Mahcine&quot; back in &#39;04 and he&#39;s currently using the entire GOP playbook he delineated back then.  Every word.  The &quot;Republican&quot; Noise Machine he railed against before forming Media Matters is now his own clattering, obnoxious, paid-shill driven abomination.  Basically picture Brock wearing <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/metvnetwork/lcK4v-1472228331-1097-blog-Dick%20Van%20Dyke.jpg">the one-man-band from Mary Poppins(y&#39;all)</a> and you get the idea.  <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/david-brock-fundraising-trump-233974">Soros gave his &quot;group&quot; $40 million in January of this year</a>, after the election, to &quot;fight Trump.&quot;  That&#39;s &quot;fight the sitting President,&quot; yes. </p>

<p>I just want to know what a Brock/Soros paid shill that boosts those /politics posts on the front page every day actually, physically looks like.  I&#39;m guessing the ACKCHYUALLY meme guy. </p>

<p>He can be said that Donald Trump and the right wing created conspiracies to cover their corruption. But I didn&#39;t say that, did I? The focus was only on the account name and not the content. You must Sparta kill the messenger because it&#39;s a mild uncomfortable truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm. That&#39;s odd we view that differently. I see adding more lawyers as a sign they are uncovering more and need more people to investigate his crimes. </p>

<p>If there was nothing, they&#39;d hire nobody and the investigation would have ended by now. The fact it&#39;s ongoing is a bad sign for Trump. </p>

<p>BTW, some of us are waiting on Mueller. They caught Nixon 2 years later with 60&#39;s technology. Trump as an elite has probably never had every rock in his life turned over. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a very selective bit of bias belief. Russia&#39;s fake but Obama wiretapped a guy who had to retroactively register as a foreign agent. Tell me, are you cool enough to ever be a foreign agent? Imagine what that would entail and how drastic your life would have to be to go from pushing a narrative that Trump was wiretapped on reddit to a foreign agent. </p>

<p>All this talk about privacy of information for consumers is a joke,  and a distraction.   First of all,  there is no privacy for the voters,  but the privacy of the criminal elite is protected by attacking anyone who is pointing it out.    If there were no conspiracies then why all the secrecy?    Why the total lack of balance of power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends how he&#39;s spreading it and if he values people&#39;s opinions of him. My older brother is the only person I know in real life who can talk conspiracy, especially NASA conspiracy, and not be looked at crazy. Probably because he&#39;s a former marine, long time police office, and highly respected in his community. Without his reputation as being an all around good, trustworthy person, I don&#39;t think his conspiracy talk would hold weight with anyone. He isn&#39;t eloquent or anything, people just listen when he talks because of who he is.

    <div class="md"><p>for the ones who seek the actual truth, yes.  dont forget there are CT out there that will only follow the evidence that points to whatever outcome they personally believe. if you can live with an idea in your head and look at the world through that lens for a while and stop to examine that lens and compare it to the other paradyms which you may have then that to me is the true mark of intellect.  being able to constantly shift your paradymes and view the world from different perspectives is tough but with practice its the only way to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes this as well! its important also to note the differences between our personalities and our character.  personality is simply the social version of who you are(a mask so to speak) while your character is who you truly are when no one is around and all of your morals and values exist here.  your personality is just a p2p communication device for our brains.  people spend too much time worrying about personality they forget the character that makes them who they are.  at least this has been my observation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I agree! Some people want their personality to reflect in their character, so they do great things for people to see, looking positive in the social light, but then later, there is a loss when they are alone. They try too hard to conform their personality to their character, and there is a clash, because who you truly are cannot be warped by a pseudo version of yourself. Understanding your character will ultimately shape your personality and you will truly be one with yourself. I believe the first step is learning to love and respect others, because in doing so, you learn to love yourself as well. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this sentiment, and it&#39;s by no means exclusive to our community. Continental philosophy is very much so in line with this same proclivity for certain Aristotelian values, and surprise it&#39;s a minority in the academic world of philosophy.</p>

<p>There is definitely a sizeable portion of our community that doesn&#39;t just entertain most every idea, but does accept those ideas without applying a critical lens because it confirms their rebellious, counter-culture bias.</p>

The same people who love to circle jerk to these threads are the same ones that get mad when these theories are discussed in a rational manner. There is so much cognitive dissonance involved because so many people have invested their time and energy into pursuits that are based on a belief in how the world operates. When they are exposed to information that threatens their belief system they will have a strong emotional reaction rejecting it.</p>

According to the main flat earth map, Antarctica isn&#39;t the bottom of a sphere; it&#39;s the outer edge of a flat circle. Regardless of whether you believe this or not, the television show would then involve people traveling to Antarctica and then attempting to cross the landmass to see if they end up at the edge of a circle or the other side of a sphere. The problem is that there is so much secrecy surrounding the continent that I personally don&#39;t think any public television show would be trustworthy enough to explore the truth without responsibility to their financial or political backers.</p>

When football teams go into huddles, they&#39;re conspiring. When the quarterback guesses what a defense is doing and changes the play at the line, they&#39;re acting on a conspiracy theory. Nobody would call Tom Brady a conspiracy theorist, but that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s doing. Instead we have this rigid mentality that if someone subscribes to one conspiracy theory, then they are mentally unstable and must believe in all conspiracy theories like the flat Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The common usage of the term conspiracy theory has a meaning though, and it&#39;s more than the sum of its parts. You can&#39;t necessarily define a phrase by just looking at the individual meaning of each word. It&#39;s like how when talking about a &quot;bank job&quot; people don&#39;t usually mean a teller or mortgage broker, and when you talk about &quot;wet work&quot; you&#39;re not generally referring to scuba divers or lawn sprinkler repairmen. When someone says &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; they usually mean a certain kind of theory about a certain kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Abandon ship guys. Reddit is 99% confirmation bot. Voat is the same. Sites like this that are run by corporate entities are never going to be the same, not after that election. They may have decreased their numbers, but the shillbots are here to stay forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that&#39;s okay, and even healthy, to toss around theories.  But becoming tied to them, utterly convinced of them without real, undeniable proof, is not.  Thus telling people &quot;what really happened&quot; isn&#39;t acceptable.  Instead, it needs to be presented as just a possibility.  Something that should be looked into a bit more.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife heckled and jeered at me all through the last election cycle when I told her that the Clintons were corrupt and responsible for many reprehensible crimes, including rape and murder. She just nodded and shrugged it off and didn&#39;t pay it any mind.</p>

<p>The the other day she comes home from work with this stunned and upset look on her face. She had apparently been listening to some podcast and they were telling the story of Bill when he was Arkansas governmor, and how those kids had stumbled onto the field where they were flying drugs in and out, and the boys ended up being &quot;suicide&quot; ...(the cops said they smoked marijuana and fell asleep on the train tracks) even though they has stab wounds on their backs the medical examiner made it go away.</p>

<p>The 3rd bot told his parents what they had seen and was terrified. Not long after he was killed in a motorcycle accident, where an eye witness stated seeing an unmarked police car run him off the road. It was swept under the rug also.</p>

<p>From this to Vince Foster to the stack of bodies in Hillary&#39;s wake (Seth Rich etc etc) I feel like it isn&#39;t even a conspiracy. The look on the wifes face when she got her first real glimpse down into the rabbit hole was priceless.</p>

<p>Good people, like us, don&#39;t live in denial or ignorance. Denial &amp; ignorance is perpetuated continuously in social media and is a control mechanism meant to control us. </p>

<p>As for your bubble, I think a better analogy is that you live in a greener paddock now, and others will want to join you in your paddock when they realize how delicious that beautiful, rich green truth/lifestyle is.

    <div class="md"><p>Seconded.</p>

<p>This is the first time in a long time I&#39;ve commented in this sub, but this guy knows  what&#39;s up. You used to be able to have discussions here without three accounts chiming in on every comment, rephrasing your comments into questions to make it seem absurd. </p>

<p>Also, the whole flat-earth thing is largely a solipsistic problem. Do just a small amount of physics research into the behavior of VERY large objects and you&#39;ll understand. I normally encourage solipsism but not when it&#39;s active disinformation.</p>

Something fishy has been going on with this sub for the better part of at least 18 months. Accounts that reply instantaneously, accounts that come in like you say and comment about stuff and try to twist your words, strange voting patterns on comments, especially on topics that one would imagine wouldn&#39;t be controversial on a conspiracy sub. Stuf makes the front page of this sub from clickbait sites that I;m sure are to give you viruses... Like I&#39;ve seen people question pretty vanila conspiracies on here and get seriously upvoted. I&#39;ve seen super pro-Hillary comments go straight to the top. </p>

<p>the very nature of the comments and how they type lead me to also believe they are either bots or scripts. Moreover always pay attention to the username: It Usually has 2-3 capital letters and  is made of multiple words. </p>

<p>But I digress. Can you expand on the solipsistic problem? I don&#39;t quite follow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia (basic primer statement):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Solipsism (/ˈsɒlɪpsɪzəm/; from Latin solus, meaning &#39;alone&#39;, and ipse, meaning &#39;self&#39;)[1] is the philosophical idea that only one&#39;s own mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one&#39;s own mind is unsure; the external world and other mindscannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. As a metaphysical position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The extreme philosophical version of solipsism is the truth that a person can only be conscious of one&#39;s own consciousness, therefore their may never be a full truth of ANY other consciousness. Read as: everyone on reddit is a bit except you.</p>

<p>The reasonable version of solipsism can be simplified to: &quot;If I didn&#39;t see it myself, how do I know it&#39;s true?&quot; This is an extension of you only trust your own thinking and senses. </p>

<p>The flat earth disinfo capitalizes on this reasonable form of solipsism by asking: &quot;How do you know if &#39;x&#39; is actually &#39;y&#39;? It&#39;s only ever been told to you.&quot; It&#39;s an abuse of the same term &quot;skeptics&quot; use to shut down arguments - &quot;great claims require great evidence&quot;. Then they flood you with pseudo science and bs.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a life raft in all the muck though, as the universal laws of physics would not allow such a large object to remain flat while rotating and orbiting our Sun.</p>

However, many people don&#39;t so they need more proof which we often can&#39;t get access to. Conspiracy theorists should keep the unproven theories based on circumstantial evidence to this sub and only when something has substantial proof (enough to be very valid not necessarily 100%) then people would take everything we say more serious because our track record would be more proven concepts and less speculation. Also keep in mind that many of us have a lot more understanding of the things we know goes on behind the scenes that others without that knowledge will never see where we are coming from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am frustrated that most people claim they don&#39;t trust the government, yet as soon as you start speculating about what kind of secret shit they might be doing (aka &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;) those same people clam up and act like they think the government never does anything secret and only does exactly what it says it&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>I wish each person would consider that the &quot;government&quot; is an organization that we all collectively pay for and involuntarily entrust with managing and implementing the society-level projects and services that define the circumstances of the lives we are living together with each other each day, yet as citizens we are expected to consent to giving this organization the discretion to choose which of its decisions and actions to make public, and which to keep secret.</p>

<p>I expect that most of the audience here has been considering these ideas for some time. I personally can&#39;t see how any other conclusion could be drawn than this: the only way to have a true democracy would be through profound transparency. No more secrets.</p>

<p>The next logical question, which I&#39;m fascinated to consider: what gives the government the right to keep anything secret in the first place? Does it have a solid, defensible legal standing to do so? Simply put, does the government have the right to privacy, and if so who are the citizens who gave it that right?</p>

<p>I will not say that I agree with them about this, but I assume they think that keeping secrets that are for &quot;the greater good&quot; are ok.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with conspiracy theories will always be that there truly are a lot of mentally ill people who believe in them. Belief in conspiracies is generally a sign of significant mental illness. Look up gang stalking if you want to see the extreme end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t help that so many conspiracies are contradictory, creating a pastiche that screams schizophrenia to the general public. I saw a video the other day which tried to suggest that a part of the 9/11 plot included diverting a hurricane so that pilots who were flying by line of sight would be able to see the towers. Shit like that makes more sane conspiracy theorists look ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a common tactic: find some fringe element of a larger group or idea, focus on that as being representative of the group or idea, and hope the group or idea is discredited by this focus.  A couple examples would be finding the tricorner hat dudes calling Obama a n****r and call that a fair representation of &quot;teapartiers&quot;, or find the obviously stoned youth with a grungy look and interview them as a representative of Occupy Wall Street.  Many real conspiracies are ignored by people who think anything not covered by the MSM is &quot;fake news&quot; and so very real finance, government, military, scientific and other conspiracies will be conflated in peoples&#39; minds with pedophiles on Mars and John Dillingers fighting against the Illuminati.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be a running theme here that if one conspiracy theory is true that all are. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s vast attack on the idea of conspiracy theories because the fact of the matter is a lot of conspiracy theories are in fact true and I think people know that, but also a lot are batshit crazy and people also know that. The beautiful and frustrating thing about free thought is that most people choose what to believe. defending individual conspiracy theories makes sense, but conspiracy theories as a whole shouldn&#39;t always be seen as fact if isn&#39;t actually proven. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theorists have received a poor reputation, some of it deserved, to be honest.  Sometimes we&#39;re unfairly mischaracterized, but there is a way to avoid most of the stereotypes.  Being cognizant of your biases, earnestly strive for critical thought, and, most importantly, stick to the Socratic Method when having... controversial discussions.  This is something that I try hard to stick with, but it&#39;s difficult to always do so.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anecdotal: Earlier today I was commenting to a colleague on how I&#39;ve been on duck duck go for quite some time now that when I do a google search on a more abstract technical question DDG can&#39;t get around I seem to get really crap results lately as if their algo has been changed.  I was complaining that when searching for:</p>

<p>&quot;running reports from slave&quot;</p>

<p>The 3nd search result that I found on that query was to the exact thing you posted about child slave colony on mars...I even told him that line and we commented that it sounded ridiculous it is that I&#39;m getting child slave colonies on mars instead of database or technical results.  </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m just getting home and checking out some links around here and I come across THIS post and see your reference to this nasa nonsense. </p>

<p>I just went back in my FF history and clicked the google link again and now this is the second result:</p>

<p>[NASA Denies That It&#39;s Running a Child Slave Colony on Mars](<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com%2Fnasa-denies-that-its-running-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars">www.thedailybeast.com%2Fnasa-denies-that-its-running-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars</a>)</p>

<p>4th result:</p>
