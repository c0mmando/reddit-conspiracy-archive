       I've just found out a guy I used to go to high school with (and was my bully) is a Freemason.
      </p>
      <p>
       At school, I didn't really have any friends. But this guy was a big charmer and made a big impression on the school and everybody coveted him. He would pander to everybody, was loud and over the top to make sure everybody noticed him. And really a charmer; teacher's pet in all classes even though his grades weren't that high. A sociopath when I look back on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well anyway I became friends with him briefly, and when I felt comfortable enough I came out to him about my sexuality when I was 17. And that was that basically, he turned against me and cyber bullied me for the rest of the year, even getting his friends to get in on it too and torment me in class. They ruined everything for me and I was worse off than what I was before he befriended me. And the few people I told didn't believe me because they thought this guy was infallible and a star pupil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I found out that he joined the Freemasons on his 21st birthday (he's 26 now), and recently his career is starting to go high profile and he's even rubbed shoulders with Hollywood celebrities, including one who has been mentioned on this sub as being implicated (but not proven) in Pizzagate.

       Absolutely, if you're doing benevolent things,
being secretive about knowledge should get alarm bells ringing.
Good things should not be kept from humanity,
but it's likely higher levels of freemasonry are into
evil types of occultic stuff....compartmentalization.
Hence lower levels don't know what goes on at the top.

       I read that some societies are secret because they create chaos and do not want to be held accountable.  Order out of chaos, as Freemasons like to say.

       Why they want to create chaos and tyranny I don't know.
Things like extreme power and slavery seem extremely overrated to me.
Childish even. If it really has something to do with archons influencing them,
I will be surprised.

       That is a good question.  It is related to dialectics.

       The way it works is they want to accomplish a certain goal.  The problem, though, is that people will resist if asked to work towards that goal.  The solution is to create a thesis (unrestrained immigration) to push the people in one direction.  They will then create an anti-thesis (police state), which is the opposite of the thesis.  They will use the conflict between the thesis and anti-thesis to push people towards their goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is like they create a problem to make people fearful, then they offer a solution.  People will gladly accept the solution so the fear goes away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are exposed to the problems of unrestrained immigration (rape, robberies, etc.), then they are more willing to accept living in a police state to make the problems go away.

       Yes! My neighbors ex husband! Long story short he married my neighbor. Had two kids and they would always have birthdays at the free mason place and would invite us. I remember leaving the birthday area and wandered into what looked like a small court room. It's been a few years so i kind of forget what it looks like completely but i did get some pretty creepy vibes.

       It's not as evil as conspiracy folks make it out to be. I look at it like Catholicism... Sure, there's something rotten in the Vatican and it's been well established (child sex abuse) that there are some evil priests. But, individual parishes can be fine, even beneficial to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess the same could be said for masonic lodges. Some say the Scottish Rite is to blame, that it's taken over the lodges, but as an outsider we can't confirm that really. Anyway, it's an interesting organization.

       Freemasonry is controlled by the jewish elites, and is used by them to recruit non-jews into working to implement their globalist-Marxist "New World Order" agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to one of the most important Freemasons of all time, the doctrines and practices of Freemasonry are based in the jewish Kaballah (a system of witchcraft and occultism).  Also according to Pike, the god of Freemasonry is Lucifer.   And this follows, because Judaism is Satanism.

       I thought freemasonry is headed by the scottish rite freemasons? And many of the top controllers of masonry are members of European noble families? That makes more sense to me than it being controlled by the "ruling jewish elites", which sounds like more divide and conquer disinfo.

       Yep, the roots are British. They get pretty deep into the symbolism of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, for example Solomon's Temple and Hiram Abiff. That's probably why people think they are aligned with (((the Jooz!))).

       I'm going on what Albert Pike said, among other evidence.  It is ideologically based in the jewish Kaballah.  And many top jewish rabbis and other prominent jewish sources have
       <em>
        admitted
       </em>
       that Freemasonry is of jewish origin (see examples of this at link I posted).

       Albert Pike is a dude from the 19th century. Freemasonry goes back to medieval times and maybe as far back as the Dark Ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if it is influenced by Kaballah, so what? Kaballah is part of the Western mystical tradition, along with Plato and Aristotle. I'm really into Plato myself, does that mean I am Greek? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       It began as a guild, a union of sorts for, well, masons. You know, people who do masonry. If you read the history it was a Christian organization at the beginning. They were really into St. John the Baptist.

       So you know more about Freemasonry than Albert Pike?
      </p>
      <p>
       They used the stone builder guilds as a
       <em>
        front
       </em>
       in order to conceal the organization.  What we call "Freemasonry" was called many other names going back centuries before the Middle Ages -- including names like "Mystery Schools", etc.

       I don't deny that it's esoteric, but in the ancient world a lot of trade organizations
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       esoteric, or at least that's my understanding. The masons were in that tradition. To my knowledge there is not evidence that the medieval Freemasons were descended from those earlier groups. Were they working in that tradition? Yes, but they are not descended directly. This idea that they are Knights Templar or whatever is just for show. At least that's what I've read. Maybe some of the masons on here can weigh in.

       That's interesting but you don't think any of the Templars, being like how they were, I guess, or at least some of them, started realizing that they had to go underground and then formed a new front group? Amazing how easy that would be for a few freemasons inside of freemasonry to start their 'own' secret groups. Like, Skull and Bones? Just for show? Yeah maybe some of the masons pretending to not being masons on here (if so) can weigh-in because it's pretty easy for any one of them to show up and just bs anyone around and down-play anything.

       No, it was in the U.S. and he says the names of a few people that are basically in the "Illuminati" at least 2 of them, he says. No, he has no idea I have his video and he ended up leaving the lodge and even posting all of his pictures with all the freemasons from when he got a few of his degrees. I'm sorry I won't be sharing it with you especially because he goes on, very very calmly (can tell he is a little nervous though) to basically share how other members of his group, other masons, were trying to threaten him. I don't have a copy of the video he had uploaded where another member of the lodge had snuck a recording device in there and I got to listen to ONE freemason sound quiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiite pissed off at the person and wanting to do pretty much do something about him. He also shows his demit papers and from the persons level of intelligence (the sound of it) he definitely rose through the ranks of freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I can't show it to you because you're just going to share it and possibly due him harm. The video is about 2-3 years old at this point though.

       Calling Pike ‘one of the most important Freemasons of all time’ would be disputed by a whole lot of Freemasons. Particularly outside America where people looked at a lot of what he did and went ‘wut?’
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Manly Hall who wrote his Masonic books before he ever joined Freemasonry, but still gets touted as a ‘leading mason’.
      </p>
      <p>
       His passage on the whole Lucifer bit can be twisted into more ways than the Taxil Hoax and that’s saying something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some masons connect it with the Kabbalah, others say it’s not connected at all. Bear in mind Freemasonry has no ‘central dogma’, but individuals or groups of individuals can interpret things in all sorts of ways.

       Calling Pike... Okay what? Either you're shilling folks here otherwise you're a mason in disguise because Albert Pike is a highly regarded Freemason among masons and yeah, some of us non-masons actually figured out how much you bullshit people with that one. There's a statue of him in Washington D.C.. "Morals and Dogma" is still revered by many freemasons. Enough of you have stated this online. Speaking of "conspiracy theorists"...

       He is highly regarded amongst
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       Freemasons.
Certainly outside the US we’re amazed he gets that much credence lent to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a lot of authority given to him by the Scottish Rite, as he basically founded the modern version. Doesn’t mean lots of other masons don’t disagree a lot of his interpretations - and that’s the key point. They are interpretations, not dogma or some form of ‘Masonic fact’ in any form

       So he's highly regarded by a lot of Freemasons in the U.S but maybe lesser outside of the U.S. because obviously if you're from the U.S. or England, masons there might not look/understand right away when let's say, freemasons in "china" or something have their own hero. That's understandable but he surely seems to be a very highly regarded freemason in the U.S., probably more popular with the white freemasons, would be my guess.

       With a name like Pheonix Rises, I would assume you might be one of them.  No....I will not elaborate.  I don't want to allow anyone to guess which friend of mine it might have been.  I have had a total of three experiences with three different people though, 2 who I believe are Masons, who said things which suggest that they are up to no good, and the other was a Jewish guy who is not involved in Freemasonry but is involved in the NWO.

       Let me make sure I have this straight: you believe to possess evidence of a worldwide depopulation agenda being conducted by shadowy elites, and instead of speaking truth to the world to prevent such an effort from taking place, you choose to protect your friend, one who is part of this nefarious plan; and as for the world,

       I dono! What a service you do for us non-masons though. If you guys could do a better job of making it seem like you DON'T want to toss anyone who's not a freemason into a FEMA camp and murder them, that'd be great! : ) Not sure what Jesus did to some of you guys or if just covering the backs of others but as a non-religious person it's funny/sad/crazy to notice that.

       If this Freemason conspiracy is a thing, I believe it differs from place to place. I have a SO that joined the group (non participating) in our local small town because he was trying to bond with his grandpa (has his old masonry ring as a gift from that day, etc). His grandparents are pretty racist and I assume homophobic. I think that that's just how they are as a group, sounds like that ideology draws people like your bully. He did say that their first ceremony was weird af, blindfolding and making them pretend to beg for money, but he hasn't been since because it's just weird and boring. His grandpa is the highest tier of masonry, here, and I genuinely think that he has no secrets. If there is any conspiracy it will be in bigger cities.

       My dad is, and both of my grandfathers. My dad doesn't really participate anymore, but when I've asked him about "Masonic Secrets" he (I'm pretty sure JOKINGLY) said if he told me, he'd have to kill me--admitting that it's part of their initiation oaths to say that. He doesn't really seem to take it very seriously, and is also a bit of a conspiracy theorist. He certainly hasn't gained any wealth or prestige from his association with the Masons, but he DID work in the US Capitol as an aide for Senator Bob Taft in the early 1970's, then had a career in the Federal Government as a Revenue Officer for the IRS.

       I do... a couple guys I worked with. Pretty beta &amp; Shepard dog complex is their similarity I'd say. Can't be too secret as they often publish pictures of themselves with other members and their kids on fb.

       As they say this would be above my pay grade.
Freemasonry isnt so much a secret society. Its more of a open society with secrets. Some trivial that can be found very easily. Others grand conspiracies.

       First.. looking at your inactivity im not sure if your a brother threatening me or if your serious about your inquire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not gonna Pm you because I dont mind open responses, because in my heart Freemasonry is not a secret society like say the Black Lodge but instead its a social group with secrets (most of which can be found all over the internet but some that cannot) . 
Gangstalking is overblown as a freemason conspiracy BUT  it absolutely occurs but about on the same level as a church community. "Did you see Ms Sady at the market the other day, she had been dipping into the shine and was two shades into the wind"  Its more gossip than anything else.. only in a very few societies does it go further than this.. Usually leadership in the auxiliary is vetted and a lot of times its more click'ish than anything sinister.

       Not a brother "threatening" you, with what? Yes, I'm serious about my inquiry and look, you do nothing but defend otherwise down-play whatever I've stated. "But it absolutely occurs but about on the same level as a church community..." &lt; Do you have any statistical proof of this? I would guess you that you do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Freemasonry is not a secret society like say the Black Lodge" &lt; I don't get it. They seem similar enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Gangstalking is overblown as a freemason conspiracy..."
      </p>
      <p>
       And what if you're down-playing that one too, otherwise very wrong about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       You took an oath to support that group, not give away it's secrets, right? Well it seems like sometimes that oath gets in the way of more important things in this world. I guess looking from a non-masons perspective about anything seems to be quite the challenge for some of you. Also, I'm not into gaslighting people to the point of claiming that they've threatened me when I know they have not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how every sentence in your paragraph pretty much sticks to a position of "I'm not even going to listen to you and I'm going to say anything to down-play any of your bad experiences about my group."
      </p>
      <p>
       "social group with secrets"  - A social group...  Yeah, I think you know very damn well that you're quite a bit more than just a "social group" buddy.

       Well, you need meds bro. Heres reality smacking you in the face.. If you go to a fastfood restraunt how many people spit in your food? It happens.. but how often? Its not every freaking restraunt, every freaking day... its rare. The same goes for grand scheming.. and in that its not the organization making those schemes but often men who use the brotherhood to their will. Fx Foundation of America, Titanic, or William Morgan.. or Nasa. Their are many many examples. Always its men who are Masons but Not Freemasonry as the organization. As for it being a social club.. it is.. very much so... but just like in politics deals are made and like the old saying "good ole boys in cigar smoke filled rooms" the masonic fellowship aspect is strong. Why wouldnt you more likely use a brother as a doctor, lawyer, accountant? His your brother just like College fraternities. Now back to the types of lodges.. in small country towns these lodges are a lot like say an elks club or vfw... with the exception of key lodges. In wealthier communities and larger towns and cities these lodges also have the frat brotherhood feel but are also much more likely to be doing business. 
Is that a conspiracy? And is my description of it being like a church community any different? You always have rogue groups in any group.. that often give the entire group a bad look or conspiracy.
So if you dont like my answer go join a lodge and find out yourself. As for the oath it covers any secrets brothers have shared with me as well as the grips and signs and the things like ritual code.. all (but personal secrets) can be found on the internet for free.. just google it or buy a ritual book off ebay. 
....
lAstly all the "major" secrets I've received from brothers there is absoLutely nothing non of us can do about.. Its just an unfortunatE fact aNd doesnt matter if you believe.

       How about locally in the towns? Are you guys always friendly on a local level? Doesn't seem like it. What's the reaction one is supposed to have when they notice you guys just picking out people from around town and harassing them ever-so subtly? I know not all do this, but it doesn't seem like a very friendly place over there, whatsoever, because you all favor towards freemasonry above shedding the truth on what exactly you do (or... ignore more like) when non-masons get harassed by your members. Any response to the gangstalking accusations? What about the one someone said earlier is... a hoax? "Lucifer, the Lighter-Bearer" ? Grandpa was a freemason, others around him. He was gone when I was very young and so many years later, obviously good job staying out of the public's "eye" - You guys got very noticed by me, and I'm pretty sure when you approach people and ask them to join, you should mind when their trying to focus on their high school sporting events during their senior year. Otherwise, getting bad reactions out of family members for not wanting to be a mason. What makes you think I should feel so comfortable coming around your sub? My respect for Jesus (I did grow up religious but I'm 'heavily' influenced by things) has literally gone up several notches because of your group and because of how several (not just one) of you has acted. I definitely mean peace with any and every group, and I just hope that your group can start to show a lot more consideration to the rest of the societies around the world. Not covering-up for pedophiles per the UK police stories. The greatest of the masons I've seen though, are the ones that do admit there are problems with freemasonry. I've seen that, and I've very much appreciated your more civil members undoubtedly. I've been to your sub, and it's just a "typical "look at my grandpa's watch!" sub where I bet your members know not to act like assclowns. Anyways, never any sore thumb up my ass over any groups, but yours... WOW. Maybe realize that I'm looking forward to meeting with several pastors in the future due to your "effects" on other people: harassment, lies, umm... driving by peoples Mom's houses and harassing them in their cars? Getting angry with nephews about not wanting to be in a "frat" lol. I'm better off not being in any group, guys. So Thank for the two or three probes/invites, I would have before thought it would feel like a high honor, and it sounds "cool" for sure but, c'mon... Making an ass out of people here with "Freemasons for Dummies" ? Of course you're serious. Thanks though I'm sure you're a lot better person than some of what I've met/seen.

       I learnt my great grandad was a Freemason about 10 years after he died. He didn't talk about it much. I'll have to ask my mum tonight if he ever talked about it at all, any memorabilia, photos, etc.

       My grandfather was also a mason. I asked my mom about it, and she said that he would never talk about it whenever he was asked. She told me she remembered when she was a little girl she'd hide in a closet and sneak a peak at him in his "ceremonial clothing" as she called it. It was just a kilt really.

       I have known a few and was even interested in joining myself. As I got close to them, though, I also began to notice a common thread of douchebaggery that manifested itself as selfish pedantry in just about anything I talked to them about. It was like, on any given subject, they had to teach me something. They never bullied me though (directly at least. idk what they said behind my back). So, I decided against joining simply because, in my estimation, they were all assholes.

       A friend who I've known since kindergarten said he was joining the Freemasons. I asked him some questions but he said "All I can do is answer yes or no". So I asked "How do you join?" (not a yes or no but I still asked) He actually answered it too, he said "You generally just need to be around them for a while and put your time and get invited"
      </p>
      <p>
       All the rest of the questions I asked he could not answer (what do you guys do? What are the other members like? who are they?). Which was surprising to me because I've seen cars with Freemason symbols secured to the back like the window stickers so I didn't think membership was all that secret.

       My late grandfather was a 32nd Degree mason but I didn't find out until at least 10 years after he died. I'll try to take a picture of the certificate the next time I'm at my grandmother's house.

       Not in the United States but in my home country, My grandpa and my dad are masons. They've never really said anything directly but they kind of hint that they want me to join, not sure about the high profile stuff though. Maybe it's different in the US.

       Their lodge is literally just a few houses away from me in.

       They've been very helpful, and one of them is my philosopher.
I  can walk in pretty much when ever I want, and it does help me putting things and thoughts into perspective. A very linear logic which I find refreshing and quite logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Told an other member who's a retired police officer. 
We crossed paths one early morning and he asked me how things were going. I told him that I was having some issues. The building which I rented was due for demolition and was having trouble finding something else in time. 2 days later I received mail that I was selected out of 1000 other who showed interest in a apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now I live in the same street as they operate from.
They never said anything about it, but I'm sure that it's no coincidence
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like that, not sure why they are quite fond of me.
But, it does spark my curiosity. Maybe one day.. I know where I can find them so

       I knew a master mason when I worked at an air force base. He tried to get me to join (I would have needed 1 more person to sign me in but he was wanting to show me the Masonic lodges)
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked him if the free masons are a brother hood or an enlightenment society and he said both which intrigued me and made me almost join.
      </p>
      <p>
       He seemed like a good dude but I fully believe there is some fuckery that goes on in the higher degrees. I personally believe secret societies have been infiltrated and taken over by service to self people. They use the tools and power of creation in a negative destructive way that was originally intended for good creation, love, and light.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting rabbit hole but I'd like to learn more. However, I have since held off on the choice to join. I still have his free mason pamphlets he gave me and his master mason business card for if I ever wanna join/try to get in.

       My grandfather was in the freemasons. He's long since passed away now, but I remember when we were clearing out his place I ended up finding a bunch of old freemason stuff. He had this kilt like thing that he wore from time to time with a pouch on it, kind of akin to what scotsmen wear.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really intrigued me was this tiny little black book that was full of word cryptic nonsense. Or at least, it seemed like nonsense to me, I'm sure to a freemason it made complete sense. The first page of the book said something along the lines of "Do not let anyone see this book, if you are asked about this book deny all knowledge about it." Just really eerie. That and he wouldn't talk about it like ever.

       My grandfather was a free mason, I remember playing in this extremely elaborate masonic temple as a kid with my brother at a yearly function where they brought the sons, grandchildren.  I don't remember much else, I don't know what level he was but I know he was in it for a very very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandfather seemed to be a good man, I don't think anything ever happened to my my brother or I.  I've always had a very easy life that has just happened for me, no matter what I did to internally sabotage it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always wondered if it had something to do with his connections.  He is long past gone, before I really started getting into conspiracies.  He was the last line of men to go into this as far as I know.

       My Grandfather was a freemason.  I think most of my paternal family are.  He and family were so secretive about it that I didn't find out about it until after he died only because he was buried in a special freemason plot in the cemetery. I was more or less estranged from them, but saw him occasionally. He was kind, even-tempered, but also very aloof and seemed indifferent to many things.

       I'm a Freemason. I'm sorry to hear that this happened to you. When we hear of men who have tendencies to be harmful or immoral we try to find this out before allowing such men into the fraternity. We do this because these are the men who will represent us in the future and we can't afford a bad reputation due to a bad apple in the tree. We stand for making good men better.

       Absolutely, if you're doing benevolent things,
being secretive about knowledge should get alarm bells ringing.
Good things should not be kept from humanity,
but it's likely higher levels of freemasonry are into
evil types of occultic stuff....compartmentalization.
Hence lower levels don't know what goes on at the top.

       It’ll have been a Ritual book, they tend to be written with only random letters and no full words, but they help you practice learning the words (like learning lines to a play)
