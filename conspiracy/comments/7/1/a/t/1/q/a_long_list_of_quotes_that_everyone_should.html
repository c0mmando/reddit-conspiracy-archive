<p>&quot;When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.&quot; ~ Napoleon Bonaparte</p>

<p>&quot;It is ironic that the U.S. would begin a devastating war, allegedly in search of weapons of mass destruction, when the most worrisome developments in this field are occurring in your own backyard. It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy, when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects about which both the Congress and the Commander in Chief have been kept deliberately in the dark.&quot; ~ Former Canadian Defence Minister Paul Hellyer</p>

<p>&quot;From the days of Sparticus, Wieskhopf, Karl Marx, Trotsky, Rosa Luxemberg, and Emma Goldman, this world conspiracy has been steadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recognizable role in the tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the 19th century. And now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.&quot; ~ Winston Churchill, stated to the London Press, in 1922</p>

<p>&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; ~ Woodrow Wilson</p>

<p>&quot;I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country&#39;s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. During those years I had as the boys in the back room would say &quot;a swell racket&quot;. I was rewarded with honors, medals and promotion. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot; ~ Smedley D. Butler</p>

<p>&quot;The real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city, state and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of a self created screen....At the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers. The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both political parties.&quot; ~ New York City Mayor John F. Hylan, 1922</p>

<p>&quot;Debts must be collected, mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible. When through the process of law the common people lose their homes, they will become more docile and more easily governed through the strong arm of government applied by a central power of wealth under leading financiers. These truths are well known among our principal men who are now engaged in forming an imperialism to govern the world. By dividing the voter through the political party system we can get them to expend their energies in fighting for questions of no importance. It is thus by discreet action we can secure for ourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished.&quot; ~ US Bankers Magazine, Aug. 25, 1924.</p>

<p>&quot;If all the bank loans were paid up, no one would have a bank depo­sit, and there would not be a dol­lar of cur­rency or coin in cir­cu­la­tion. This is a stag­ger­ing thought. We are com­pletely depen­dent on the com­mer­cial banks for our money. Someone has to bor­row every dol­lar we have in cir­cu­la­tion, cash or cre­dit. If the banks create ample syn­the­tic money, we are pro­s­per­ous; if not, we starve. We are abso­lutely with­out a per­manent mone­tary sys­tem. When one gets a com­plete grasp upon the pic­ture, the tra­gic absur­dity of our hope­less posi­tion is almost in­cred­ible – but there it is. It (the bank­ing prob­lem) is the most im­por­tant sub­ject in­tel­li­gent per­sons can in­ves­ti­gate and reflect upon. It is so im­por­tant that our pre­sent civi­li­za­tion may col­lapse un­less it is widely under­stood and the defects reme­died very soon..&quot; ~ Robert H.

<p>&quot;The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world&#39;s central banks, which were themselves private corporations.
Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.&quot; ~ Carroll Quigley, Professor of History at Georgetown University, member of the Council on Foreign Relations, mentor to Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>&quot;The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again... Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit.&quot; ~ Sir Josiah Stamp Director, Bank of England 1928-1941</p>

<p>&quot;For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations -- One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support. The UN is but a long--range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One--World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.&quot; ~ Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing left now for us but to get ever deeper and deeper into debt to the banking system in order to provide the increasing amounts of money the nation requires for its expansion and growth. Our money system is nothing better than a confidence trick... The &quot;money power&quot; which has been able to overshadow ostensibly responsible government is not the power of the merely ultra-rich but is nothing more or less than a new technique to destroy money by adding and withdrawing figures in bank ledgers, without the slightest concern for the interests of the community or the real role money ought to perform therein... to allow it to become a source of revenue to private issuer&#39;s is to create, first, a secret and illicit arm of government and, last, a rival power strong enough to ultimately overthrow all other forms of government. ...An honest money system is the only alternative.&quot; ~ Dr. Frederick Soddy, Nobelist, author of Wealth, Virtual Wealth &amp; Debt</p>

<p>&quot;I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology... Various results will soon be arrived at :that the influence of home is obstructive... although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen... Educational propaganda, with government help, could achieve this result in a generation. There are, however, two powerful forces opposed to such a policy: one is religion; the other is nationalism...

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Debts must be collected, mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible. When through the process of law the common people lose their homes, they will become more docile and more easily governed through the strong arm of government applied by a central power of wealth under leading financiers. These truths are well known among our principal men who are now engaged in forming an imperialism to govern the world. By dividing the voter through the political party system we can get them to expend their energies in fighting for questions of no importance. It is thus by discreet action we can secure for ourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished.&quot; ~ US Bankers Magazine, Aug. 25, 1924.</p>

<p>I wish people would understand this. This is the key to taking down TPTB. Unity. </p>

<p>I whole-heartedly agree with you.  The problem is our media, in my opinion.  I&#39;m not only talking about the &quot;Liberal Media&quot; boogeyman, but any politically biased media.  Breitbart, MSNBC, FOX, HuffPo, etc.  Due to the tribalistic nature of American politics and the social acceptance of confirmation bias fueled media consumption, we end up with a massively divided country.</p>

<p>Conservative media would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with them hate America, small businesses, are all communists (when in the context of the world Democrats are center-right), and want to take all of your freedoms.  Liberal media wants you to believe that those who question Islam are Islamophobes, that conservatives are all racists, that they&#39;re all religious zealots that want to tell you waht to do with your body and tell you what to do in your bedroom.</p>

<p>Hell, I hear massively popular radio talk show types essentially call the &quot;other&quot; an outright enemy of this country.  It&#39;s incredibly absurd!  People don&#39;t like having their world views challenged and instead of educating themselves on topics, they&#39;re content to let talking heads tell them how to think.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m truly at a loss as to how we can even go about correcting this as it seems that our population is more than content to hate the &quot;other&quot; while they get fucked by politicians.  It&#39;s incredibly frustrating, but maybe I&#39;ve not put enough thought into this and I&#39;m wrong.  I truly wish I were.  So sorry for the length of my post!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would be just as absurd. naw, Churchill was talking about the uprising of grassroot movements/populares against the natural hierarchy/aristocracy. </p>

<p>OP was using all quotes he could find about global conspiracies regardless of context. And over the histories you would have even more absurd conspiracy theories than real conspiracies. </p>

<p>E.g.: You wouldn&#39;t see the french revolution as something that TPTB were behind, just because it completly demolished the power structure in France. On the other hand you can trace the <em>jewish world domination</em> conspiracy theory to right about this time - probably started by catholic clerics (irony deluxe). Skip forward 150 years and people seriously think that the bolshevik revolution is only a zionist/jewish movement (regardless of soviet antisemitism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adam Weishaupt was codenamed Spartacus. He founded the order of the Illuminati. The Churchill quote is from a 1920ish newspaper article he wrote about &quot;the Jews&quot; and the struggle for their future. He points out that some of them are up to no good - involved in terrorism and some are involved in international shenanigans. He was arguing for the creation of Israel, more or less... a home for the  Jews - in Palestine in accordance with the Balfour Declaration... this would fulfill their need for autonomy and give them a safe space.

    <div class="md"><p>Was being facetious. Although, I feel I can offer some insight into their position. Nations are but gangs in the global neighborhood. There is a socialist, collectivist conspiracy installing a world dictatorship. This is to ultimately remove the nationalistic conditioning and ultimately to bring humanity together into a brotherhood where our differences are celebrated, rather than being a point of contention. It involves restructuring the way we live, but not necessarily so much that it&#39;s &#39;far from natural&#39;.  They see it as a necessary stage of development on our way to a better way of being... without war or the reasons to go to war. Most of us don&#39;t trust those that are doing this and that use all manner of deception and destruction to bring this about... and most of us would fight against it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s done in secret - through subversion and infiltration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really good post. Thank you for the time it took to compile.</p>

<p>For me the biggest shock is people referring to them as occultists like 100 years ago. A lot else is obviously shocking, but the pizzagate type feeling i get from occultist bankers is just grim. </p>

<p>And people saying &quot;who cares, its 100 years ago&quot;... they&#39;re literally describing what has happened to society over those 100 years and what will continue to happen. How can you not see it and not appreciate the post?</p>

<p>Thanks again. I&#39;ve emailed it to a few people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise consider discussing &#39;conspiracies&#39; with me and they&#39;re all shocked.</p>

<p>The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that “my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.” ☛ Newsweek: “A Cult of Ignorance” by Isaac Asimov</p>
