       Fyi: if a couple of the links,  specifically Metapost about the Tehran incident, and the Rendlesham site dont load right away, strip the s from https:// and it will load immediately.

       I also had to add web.archive.org/web/*/ to the Ghost rockets url to find an archive of the relevant link from the intended link.

       dear conspirators if you know anything you know the fight against ancient good vs ancient evil is a definite article in life. Not only does everyone have to stand against this evil, the real truth should be known not to cause mass panic but to obviously alleviate the shock that is to come. Don't be cowardly in the hour of death because it will reflect dearly on your fate. It is not done out of cruelty or cowardness as there are many lives that cannot be saved. It is done for the good of the future of the concept of humanity with all of its subspecies, and your offspring. Just because you are not saved does not mean you have a chance at redemption, redemption not out of bargaining with God but redemption as there will be a surviving species on the planet and I am assuming they can join the rest of God's blessed advanced civilizations. I can only assume the decision has been made about this place so I personally would like to wish everyone luck. Thank you.

       The cruelty and ignorance of those that protect the law has been admonished. The catholic church is infiltrated and perverse methods are being spread. The selfishness and monetary gain of the human race has reached intense heights, where at this point you guys have the ability to bend other people's death at your will, something that only God can have. Good luck, Bali is my sendoff I guess.

       The 2nd link. I have seen that exact same space ship with my uncle in Alaska 3 years ago. It was right above the Northway Mall which is right next to a football field which is about the size I would call the ship. I've been searching for illustrations or recreations of the ship and as soon as I clicked on that link I knew it was what I had been looking for.

       I'm hesitant enough to even include a youtube link in an "official" post, let alone a netflix link, although I understand where you're coming from.

       I personally can't access netflix, and (unfortunately) youtube is currently the most reliable and accessible source for this doc.

       I feel you on the idea of supporting Netflix though. I mostly use it for the nature docs, and I wouldn't want or expect anyone here to get it just for this, but I feel the option is good for users to have, especially given the 360p quality of the YouTube link.

       You are spreading a lot of shitty comments without any supporting evidence. I think there is certainly a big psyop designed around it, there's a lot of evidence which points to the reality of extraterrestials.

       Kinda like the tons of blurry ufo videos, the lack of aliens being photos, people making speculations about ancient aliens on rocks, crazy people channeling alien spirits, I mean come on, this is a hardcore psyop and you people just gobble it up this non-sense.  As far as I'm concerned, the Bible carries much more weight than aliens.  Nazca mummy is an obvious hoax too and the ufo community are so desperate for aliens that they're willing discard any discerning of evidence and choose to become naive.

       Again, I'm agnostic so pretty open minded compared to you apparently 100% knowing the truth. And not afraid of your God or any other God. See my first point.

      <p>
       For the life of me I have no clue where you're coming up with this. Is this just a way for you to make yourself believe in what you're saying by spreading lies about people who disagree with you?

       What a fucking troll you are.

       The irony here is that if Jesus ever actually existed (which he very well may not have), he probably would have been ashamed to be associated with you.

       "Troll" isn't a term you could define as "name calling"  it's just a term used to describe the kind of activity you partake in.  The people speaking on this have high credibility,  these aren't your average rednecks in the woods drinking moonshine and seeing a helicopters then subsequently reporting as "ohmagerd aliens"  to say that's not supporting evidence is bull shit.  Whining about all the crappy footage?  No shit sometimes you get people who create hoaxes I've never seen anyone record an SR-71 well on a cellphone so I don't expect much from a ufo recording either.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're telling me astronauts just get extra money to lie?  Nah that's nonsense those people put their life on the line to push the boundaries of humanity and you think they'd just lie willy nilly?  How silly can you be?  You blindly believe in a guy who could have easily been a shitty carpenter mistaken for a messiah and dare to blow off people who believe in ufo?  That's complete hypocrisy.

       But it actually
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       name calling.  You
       <em>

       you're being an idiot and you're doing such on purpose - it seems you truly believe what you're saying...

       Seems to me he was "crying" because he felt that information was being withheld from the President and it made him sad that they had to come to him for the answers because "they" want to keep the government in the dark.

       I don't have time to search for the timestamp, it was somewhere around the middle, but I can provide the context. He was explaining that the head of the CIA and the ex(?) president were coming to to him to ask about information regarding aliens and ufos. He said he was upset because instead of him going to them to get information, they were coming to him, which he talked about as something that just proved how little those in the public positions of power really are in the dark on so much and so it would be harder than he thought for the truth to get out.

       Yup. I have my doubts about Greer. His body language is off when he talks about a lot of this stuff in the documentary too. The believe me look is always present with this guy. All in all though the documentary itself is very eye opening.

       I dunno. It seems like the establishment can't stand Greer. They're probably sick of him pestering them all the time with his ridiculous bullshit and they know if they talk to him, he's going to name drop them all the time and they don't want their names in his mouth. Everyone who claims to have met with in the Government dispute it.

       From the evidence I've seen there seem to be two main explanations for the US MIC's behavior regarding UFOs:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        What Stephen Greer et al. have said is
        <em>
         broadly
        </em>
        true, even if specific accounts and people (potentially Greer) are charlatans or disinfo agents. ETs have been here, and either gave technology to leaders or managed to reverse engineer it from crashed vehicles. Many of the more recent sightings may be more likely to be ARVs than true ET vehicles.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There is a massive coverup to prevent this information from reaching the public and even the highest elected and appointed officials of the US government. Some of the information leaks, but psyops have been largely sufficient to discredit it in the eyes of the public.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The original UFOs and many subsequent sightings are either black budget military projects or in more cases, have relatively mundane explanations. The stories of ETs may have been dreamt up by scifi readers, or deliberately planted as misdirection, either to misdirect the American public at large or foreign spies.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In this theory, the original idea developed into Project Bluebeam : a staged "alien takeover," meant to consolidate the world under a one-world government, a pretense for mass depopulation, or both. Support for this theory may come from the fact that many high-ranking officials, including Reagan and Clinton, have hinted at the idea of the world coming together with ETs as a common enemy.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There may be other explanations, but these seem the most likely. What's fascinating is that both would seem to indicate a large-scale conspiracy within the intelligence community of at least the US, and likely at least the UK as well, operating over at least half a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say from the evidence I've seen with my own eyes, I believe option 2 to be more plausible. I don't doubt the existence of ET life elsewhere in the universe, or even that it may have reached earth, but I think the evidence just fits option 2 better. And this is given that I think I would actually
       <em>
        prefer
       </em>
       option 1 to be the case.

       I agree with you for the most part. And I say that as someone who for a long time believed that aliens were piloting UFOs and, in a sense, I wanted to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have now come to the tentative conclusion that UFOs are 'black' projects (controlled by the world's ruling elite to serve their interests). The whole "UFO's are aliens" was cooked up to serve as a screen, or as you say, planted as misdirection. I mean, the disclosure project is funded by the Rockefellers for crying out loud. When did
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       ever care about people knowing the real truth about anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also think project blue beam is misdirection. I could be wrong, but it's just too popular in conspiracy circles to be true. Also the term had its origins elsewhere and was simply adapted to the UFO disinformation project. But I am open the possibility that I'm wrong.

       What basis do you have that Greer is a "charlatan"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Explanation #2 is purely speculation. I've wondered if the "it's not aliens, it's really secret government tech" theory is a kind of disinfo in itself. It doesn't hold up for me because under this theory the United States has had advanced experimental craft whizzing around our atmosphere since the 1950s &amp;
       <em>
        absolutely nothing
       </em>
       has come of it in real world or military application.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just lights in the sky. There's too broad a range of evidence &amp; sightings to say it's just secret US projects. Too much variety.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't suppose other countries outside of the US have files on the matter, do you?

       None, personally, and I wasn't even making that as an assertion, just as a potential qualification. That is, Greer being a charlatan or disinfo agent would not necessarily preclude option 1 from being true.

       I haven't seen it, directly that is. I've seen videos that I can't explain definitively, and I've listen to/watched eye-witness accounts from people who seem credible, but that's not enough for me to

       The misnomer that's widely circulated is that it's only hillbillies on a farm that get abducted or have sightings. That all of the evidence is made up of blurry photos &amp; dumb, unreliable eyewitnesses. It's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other point is that evidence is not confined to a single country or small group of countries. It's global. I don't know how the Chinese government handles a mass sighting or how the Russian government handles a crashed object but I don't think that the United States the source for this kind of activity. If it is then it's not just "top secret testing" anymore. It's now a discussion of the US conducting illegal covert operations outside of the country.

       Disinfo is usually 80% truth, and 20% disinfo. (((They))) like to latch onto truthers and force them to accept a deal, expose whatever they want but stop short of specific subjects.

       When analyzing someone like greer, look at what he denies, shies away from, or how his message deviates from others.

      <p>
       For greer a big red flag for me, is telling anyone who had a negative encounter of any type that they are wrong, that

       I've been keeping up with Greer for about a year now and the man has sacrificed a ton to push disclosure of the military industrial complex. In some recent talks he's claimed that Trump will try to disclose more information and that some really big shit is about to go down during his presidency. Guess time will tell if he's full of it or not!

       I thought so too for a long time, until I realized the cover-up by terrestrial organizations and the non-disclosure by ET parties shares the same reason; we're not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if their technology eventually changes Earth for the better, there will still be major fallout in economic, industrial and religious systems from the news impact alone. That means the ET's would also have to greatly assist us in the transition that follows, if they don't want our civilization to implode.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are too violent and morally infantile for the huge responsibility that comes with being an advanced species. We are responsible for our home planet and all species on it, and once we can travel interstellar space our actions will have significant consequences elsewhere. With that in mind, it sounds way too dangerous to bestow technology onto us that is hundreds of years beyond us. If our path is less than ideal, we could damage our planet faster than ever before, and have lots of negative encounters in outer space.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to bring about disclosure, sharing UFO footage or pressuring secret services is not the way to go. Instead, try to assist in humanity's
       <em>
        moral evolution
       </em>
       in any way you can, so the day when we are deemed 'worthy' may arrive sooner.

       Morals are a subjective thing. In some places sleeping with multiple wives is immoral, in others it’s moral. Who decides morality except from the eye of the beholder. There either is suppression of technology or no aliens. There is no mumbo jumbo hippy bullshit in my opinion

       I classify myself as a nihilist, so in essence I agree with you. But I wasn't referring to mundane morals like how many wives to have. And I do believe that in the context of morality, there exist consensus and progress. The ideal number of wives is too specific and culture-bound. But fundamental moral questions like how to deal with fear-based emotions, or whether you owe other lifeforms any kind of help or sympathy, could benefit from many kinds of research and conversations. There don't have to be
       <em>
        absolute
       </em>
       morals in order to state that happiness is more desirable than pain. This gives morality a base to develop around, no matter which answers people come up with in the process, and it only makes sense that morality then moves towards a consensus that puts peace and positive emotions at the center.

       Do you think that the cover-up was done by ETs? Or do you think it was done by extremely wealthy groups of 'people' here on Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was done by people on this planet then I think they are using it to their advantage and have the ability to enslave the human race and do whatever they'd like and not the people of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if the cover-up is being led by aliens, I think they are trying to mold our civilization into what they'd like it to be. Now that I'm reading this, both options seem very similar. So in either case, should we have more faith in the ETs or the 20 wealthiest people on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we can develop morally with either of these things going on in the background. The influence that is being artificially created in our society is a real test that I don't believe we can get past because naturally humans want to be led.

       As far as I know, the coverup started in several world power governments but was in many cases decentralized into the secret services. For example the US president isn't even briefed on this topic anymore, because it's too sensitive to rely on the discretion of new politicians every 4 years. I think Putin knows though, Russia's leadership is less erratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons to cover it up are to prevent the impact and also allow them to secretly work on technology they trade or salvage from ET's. It's just a convenience that ET's have a non-intervention policy of their own. The world's wealthy would be aware through their control of the US government at least. In the end, no one is leading the cover-up, as either party could go for disclosure on their own. Meanwhile though, the secret services are still prepared to murder and spread false information to keep this secret. ET's appear to be watching this reluctantly, only intervening when nuclear weapons or meltdowns are involved.

       I've also been keeping up with Greer for the past few years, and have concluded that he's completely full of shit. Listen to his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast. Also, one time he told everyone from here to Timbuktu that he found an alien corpse... turns out it was just the underside of a stingray, or an aborted human fetus, but definitely not alien. Why all the hype? To sell DVD's.

       Maybe you shouldn't believe a mainstream article that comes out disproving something like this. Of course it's ignorant to automatically believe that the corpse was is too. I think it's important to try and obtain as much information as possible and be aware of who is finding a study that "disproves" Sirius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the under side of a sting ray and an aborted human child are very different things. I may be misremembering that statistics, but I believe the alien had only 92% of DNA shared with humans. This may sound like a lot, but it is not in comparison to other animals here on earth. Chips are 98%.

       I listened to that podcast... what about it? There was nothing particularly good or bad about it. It was actually quite boring.

      <p>
       The DNA testing of the atacama humanoid is openly discussed in that documentary. And it's still a mystery to this day. But with the way you dumb things down I can't imagine you really even care about the topic &amp; you're just looking to fling shit around.

       He kinda lost credibility in the UFO community when he started charging people to sit in the desert to telepathically communicate with aliens. I applauded his push for disclosure, but he shot himself in the foot with the telepathy thing.

       If you dumb it down like that it sounds ridiculous. Of course it does. There is a rhyme &amp; a reason to this experience. It's not "telepathy". Some people have an understanding of the situation, others don't. But it's easier to ridicule.

       And he's not hitting the streets with a sandwich board trying to sell this. It's not being hawked or marketed. An individual pretty much has to seek it out if interested enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a cheap knockoff of this experience put on by a group called ECETI. They're definitely a more pie in the sky, fantasy-based group. And unfortunately people mistake this for CSETI.

       Also also  many abductees claim to have implants, aka chipped. Maybe this is the standard of communication for them. A form of hard wired blue tooth so to say for them to communicate with each other. I personally feel a scientifically advanced race would rely more on tech similar to

       If an alien ship were ever to approach any country I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be greeted with open arms from any government in general. So using alien logic from observation... Why bother.

       My only criticism of Greer is that he doesn't operate like a WikiLeaks organization. There's no PGP to contact him with, and he should make every document he has available on the topic accessible and searchable. He claims to have a dead man's switch, and that's why he's still alive and whatnot, but if I wanted to get in contact with him, how do I do it? How can anyone anonymously dump information to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       His initial meeting with Lawrence Rockefeller is interesting, but for all we know Lawrence is the black sheep of the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       A false flag is coming and it will be cosmic in nature. Greer is the only one talking about this, and Tom Delonge is actively working towards it. It's probably not a coincidence the disclosure project comes to a peak at the national press club in March (or May?) of 2001, months before 9/11.

       Is this for a popular, uneducated audience or pitched at those who know something of the terrain and the issues concerned? Does it say anything new or revelatory? If you've been researching this stuff for awhile or are familiar with the lore and accept the deliberate oppression and deception, there's not much else that can be revealed or said that isn't already known and taken as part of the landscape of the territory..

       This stuff fascinates me even though I don't believe it. I think he is a charlatan who preys on people who really want to believe it's true. A lot of name-dropping without any real proof.  It's all "just wait for it all to be revealed soon".

       I'd like to put forth a slightly dissenting opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The timing and nature of all of the various elements that needed to come together in the precise order and way that they did to allow "life as we know it" on this planet is beyond what we would call "astronomical" when it comes to odds against what actually happened in very own and most unusual case.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is commonly referred to as the "Anthropic Principle" and in order to find another planet like our very own we would actually need as many Universes as there are stars and planets in this one to find ever find another.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't discount the idea of living entities that are completely other and outside of "life as we know it" but we have no idea what those might be or what conditions could possibly account for or sustain whatever those entities might be.

       We need a tie breaker. Either we went to the moon and aliens visited us in space, or we didn't go to the moon, and "aliens" are fiction. The NASA UFO's being anything kind of depend on the NASA footage being real.

       Just watched it - very informative. I really liked how they focused on the countless incidents of declassified information that describes how the shadow government does not have the best interests of the people. Hopefully this will inspire some to do their own research and realize their govt is not what they think it is.

       Saw this on Netflix last night. Very interesting documentary but sometimes the political bias was a little unsubtle and I'm pretty sure they ripped that 'What a wonderful world' montage from Bowling for Columbine.

      <p>
       I need to look into this in greater detail now. I am listening to Those Conspiracy Guys 5 hour podcast on the Disclosure Project and I am slightly mystified as to how a private citizen is being asked to brief Bill Clinton and getting classified memos from the French government when the overriding tone is that anyone who steps out of line steps into the crosshairs of Murder Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't Greer have been suicided a while ago if this was the case?

       He kinda lost credibility in the UFO community when he started charging people to sit in the desert to telepathically communicate with aliens. I applauded his push for disclosure, but he shot himself in the foot with the telepathy thing.

       How can we work towards moral evolution without having an example of where to go/how to become “worthy”
      </p>
      <p>
       Morals are a subjective thing. In some places sleeping with multiple wives is immoral, in others it’s moral. Who decides morality except from the eye of the beholder. There either is suppression of technology or no aliens. There is no mumbo jumbo hippy bullshit in my opinion

       Do you think that the cover-up was done by ETs? Or do you think it was done by extremely wealthy groups of 'people' here on Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was done by people on this planet then I think they are using it to their advantage and have the ability to enslave the human race and do whatever they'd like and not the people of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if the cover-up is being led by aliens, I think they are trying to mold our civilization into what they'd like it to be. Now that I'm reading this, both options seem very similar. So in either case, should we have more faith in the ETs or the 20 wealthiest people on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we can develop morally with either of these things going on in the background. The influence that is being artificially created in our society is a real test that I don't believe we can get past because naturally humans want to be led.
