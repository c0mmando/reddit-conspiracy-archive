       Look on the bright side guys. As they flood our thoughts with negativity and terror, we're still alive and well (some aren't). Collect yourself. Light always shines in the dark. As they attempt to program us through media, turn away. Find peace in yourself. Never forget the infinite chasm that is your mind. Meditate as a hobby. It's
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       better than those same old dumb tv shows we've seen 100 times. You wanna know what's being hidden? Then sit and close your eyes and you'll see. We aren't hopeless, we are highly evolved human beings, sentient and all. Entertainment is a hollow experience. Peace is freedom. Craving for happiness leads to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Instead, try to attain peace and neutrality. As "good" and "bad" duke it out for eternity, their end result is dissatisfaction with the outcome. The unnecessary deaths caused will be a karmic reaction for those in power. Those deaths will come back to haunt them when they're old and senile.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's safe to say that we (Americans in my case) have been largely misled our whole lives. That's a frightening thing, but as the fright wares off we need to stop misleading ourselves. Most of us want to just enjoy something to get our minds off it, but that very entertainment we enjoy is exactly what is misleading us. So what to do? Create your own enjoyment. Have fun in a way that doesn't involve tv/ internet. Exercise the right side of your brain with some art stuff. Make whatever ya want, it's the ultimate freedom. Whatever you create is a timeless piece of the human consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that (because I am currently experiencing as well) we are becoming tired and bored of the old entertainment we used to love, and I think it's like an evolutionary response. It's like they're trying to douse us with as much entertainment/ divisive news as possible because they know that we're becoming tired of it (also would be why it's all getting more extreme in content). Ditch that shit (yeah I know, I'm here on reddit too) Make something of your own while you've got the chance. Might as well right?

       When I was a kid, adults used to tell me TV would rot my brain. I thought they were being literal; I though they were just old ignorant about new technology.
       <br/>
       Decades later I found out they were referring to its ability to program your views, keep you from learning valuable truths, and keep your mind/consciousness from expanding.
       <br/>
       And because we can't see/experience how others think &amp; view the world, we never know there are people out there who achieved far higher levels of consciousness &amp; understanding than we did.
       <br/>
       They usually just look like a regular person, except for maybe being weirder, unfashionable and quieter.

       Your post is beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend picking up a skateboard and letting those creative energies flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no feeling of freedom that touches the level of self expression and bliss that comes with rolling around on a skateboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems silly but once you learn to balance, roll and turn, you will never look back :).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the nature of skateboarding is to fall down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you will learn time and time again that progress is only achieved if you have the will to pick yourself back up and try again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I view skateboarding and other creative endeavors as the entire point of being.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an exercise in our godliness that helps up achieve the greatest version of ourself's with the support of an almost completely harmonious industry/group of human beings behind us.
