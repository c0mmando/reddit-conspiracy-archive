       I'm getting sick of Christian users spewing bullshit, and making this sub look bad. I've seen so many more posts recently that cite the Bible as a source, when I feel like this sub used to laugh at the mentioning of that ancient fairytale. I'd appreciate any suggestions :)

       Thank you!! actualconspiracies seems to suit my fancy. I don't really use this board to post things I find interesting, I use it to find discussion, and incite about conspiracies, and current world events. I'm more-so an information sponge rather than a benefactor.

       Well I find religion to be a conspiracy... so mentioning religion isn't the issue. Pushing religious beliefs as fact is what I have a problem with.

       First you want it to be secular, then you want to talk about Christianity being a conspiracy, but then again "just the facts, man."...look, don't be a hypocrite.

       Discussion of a topic isn't non-secular. 
There's nothing inherently wrong with discussing the material, I was referring to using beliefs to support theories as though it was evidence. 
Also the facts would point to religion being a construct of man, to control man. 
You can keep trying to spin what I'm saying to mean something else if you'd like, or maybe you just have poor comprehension skills?

       Belief is silly. For once you stop believing in anything, reality is the only thing that persists.

       This ain't nothing but discrimination towards Christians, for whatever reason, you have some deep seated hatred towards God and Christians and you'll do anything to oppose us.  I don't see you going nuts on anybody else, except for people who believe in God, so you've been exposed.

       I've told you plenty of times I'm agnostic. We can't prove God exists and we can't prove God doesn't exist. I do have something against Rome (
       <a href="/r/romerules">
        /r/romerules
       </a>
       ) as they are extremely corrupt and run everything. They are dangerous.

       So no, you aren't "exposing" me, that's a silly notion.
      </p>

       My biggest issue with you is you soapbox a lot of bullshit to an echo chamber here because something happened in your life where you need to be right and need to be special. You are very close-minded as your comment history shows, which is very unfortunate.

       You just hate God, that's why you're so passionate about anything about God.  If I had to guess, you're influenced by Satan unknowingly, that's why you express so much hate towards God.  So stop being closed-minded and hateful.  Your trigger word is "God" and you instantly become angry.  So chill out

       I've never posted anything angry here. And ONCE again, I'm agnostic. Don't hate God, don't love God, because nobody (including you) know if he exists or not.

       Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don't have a "trigger word".

       And it is. But I like the faith based conspiracies too. See, maybe they get certain things wrong from my POV, but they still have a good nose for skullduggery. Treat your lack of faith less like a faith itself, and you will be less offended.

       Also, we have a xtian prophesy thing going on right now, so there is going to be more of that. In a month we will see the reverse of your post. Xtians looking for a sub that is less packed with godless heathens. It ebbs and flows.

       This.

      <p>
       Almost everytime a topic about aliens or false flag comes up, there will be one or two preachers saying it's all fake then proceeds to quote the holy book and tell people to repent before it's too late. Usually there will '
       <em>
        amen
       </em>
       ' and '
       <em>
        preach brother
       </em>
       ' replies to the that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to discuss, to preach is another.

       Don't completely discard the bible or any religious text for that matter.  They're a form of propaganda that has existed for centuries berfore the adaptation of modern technology and are still widely used the world over.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been revised throughout the ages.  This is an interesting research topic to provide insight into times past and how propaganda has changed with time.
      </p>
      <p>
       'The "truth" is often hidden between two lies'.  I can't remember who said that but i think it is a good quote to keep in mind when reading/researching religious text and any official government documents for that matter.

       It's the beliefs and ideology associated with religious texts that I find to be the problem, not the material itself. Very rarely is someone mentioning any of "God's" man made books without having a bias or some sort of personal interpretation they're attempting to push.
