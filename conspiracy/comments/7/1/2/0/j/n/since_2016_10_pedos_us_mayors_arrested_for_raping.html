        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, I am sure there are pedos in the GOP camp too, but what is the probability of all these pedo mayors are DNC first and second all mayors? Coincidence? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Seattle mayor, Ed Murray, democrat, his own cousin came forward and accused him of sex abuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Stillwater NY mayor, Rick Nelson, democrat, raped a 5 year old and many other cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Clayton NY, former mayor, Dale Kenyon, democrat, sex abuse of a 14 year old teen, and others.</p></li>
<li><p>Mayor Randolph, Nebraska, Dwayne Schut, democrat, sex abuse of 13 year old child, and others.</p></li>
<li><p>Former Ohio mayor Richard Keenan, a democrat, rape, 4 year old and other.</p></li>
<li><p>Anthony Silva, democrat, then-mayor of Stockton, California, recorded and plied naked teens with alcohol at a camp for underprivileged youth</p></li>
<li><p>Kenneth Lewis Barrett, then-mayor of Winston, Oregon, meeting a 14-year-old girl for sex.</p></li>
<li><p>Christopher Wright, democrat, then a Georgia mayor, raped a kid.</p></li>
<li><p>Former Rockdale, Texas mayor Darral Gene Walker, democrat, engaged in sexual contact with a child younger than 17 years of age by touching the boyâ€™s genitals.</p></li>
<li><p>Former Millbrook, New York mayor Donald H. Briggs, democrat, inappropriate sexual contact with a person younger than 17.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, if you allow this then I don&#39;t get why being a liberal is that special because it looks like it brings pain and suffering to people and prolonging it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you know the expression &quot;to find out who rules over you look to the group you can&#39;t criticize.&quot;  And that group is the Jews...
However I&#39;ve always wondered if the Vatican controlled the Jews or the other way around. 
But yes, Judaism is a religion that claims it is a race at the same time so... You can talk bad about Christians all day and not be considered racist, but one iota of questioning the Holocaust and you&#39;re an &quot;anti-Semite.&quot; Those commie bastards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s becoming clear what the MO here is.  </p>

<p>Assume there&#39;s a higher level of gov&#39;t...aka deep state that wants to control the country through nefarious means.  How would you most easily obtain that control?  Blackmail makes it easy.</p>

<p>Find pedos or frame someone with a pedoophile crime, put them in power, and then they have NO choice but to follow your orders or they get exposed.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing now is that structure crumbling for some reason.  Someone on the inside is trying to expose it, or it just got to be too big to contain....we&#39;ll probably never know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought long and hard about why Democrats disproportionately are discovered as participating in pedophilia, and do believe I&#39;ve arrived at an answer. It&#39;s not that Democrats are the only pedophiles, it&#39;s just that Republicans prefer to keep this sort of thing in the family, as per tradition.</p>

<p>XD</p>

<p>In all seriousness the partisan pedophilia allegations should scare the living shit out of you. That is a sign that the division, whether manufactured or real, is hitting an all time high. Pedophilia allegations are the most slanderous kind. You can&#39;t just sling them around casually as if that doesn&#39;t mean anything. Pedophilia is universally hated by just about everyone. An accusation alone can ruin your life, even if you&#39;re proven innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m a republican, don&#39;t forget former Speaker of the House(the 3rd highest position in line for presidency) was said by the presiding judge he was a serial child molester.  ONLY did 13 months, not for molesting, but for improperly paying off his victims.</p>

<p>Senator Ben Sasse is also somebody to keep an eye out for.  During campaign he was a big Never Trumper and was tweeting out 10x a day.  Pro-Trumper Mike Cernovich tweeted out, &quot;Hey, didn&#39;t you get $20k from Hastert AND didn&#39;t work for the congressional page program around the time all the abuse scandals hit?&quot;</p>

<p>Sasse went twitter silent for 2 days &amp; when he came back, he just tweeted empty platitudes.  Now his books out and &quot;they&#39;re&quot; trying to paint him as a more moderate, thoughtful conservative.  Yeah right.</p>
