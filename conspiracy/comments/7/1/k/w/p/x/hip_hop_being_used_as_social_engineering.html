<p>It&#39;s exactly what your pointing out from adam22 but used differently.   I would regurgitate all the info here if I had the time. </p>

<p>The anti war movement got muddled in the minds of the people with the hippy movement.   Those who were anti war were suddenly thrown into an environment that was also pro debauchery.   Regardless of the pros and cons of that; the rest of the people started to associate muddy naked hippies with the words anti-war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding ding ding! Ironically enough my brother has just started writing music seriously. I used to write and freestyle a lot, but have gotten away from it in recent years. One of my best friends who I&#39;ve known my whole life is a huge hip hop head. I listen to basically only hip hop, and my friend has been the one who has always turned me on to new artists. He and I actually had the conversation the other day about the pathetically untalented mumble rappers that are so popular now. A good artists IMO is Witt lowery. Relatively new artist who talks about the mumble rappers. I definitely agree there is a correlation between the total fall of hip hop (IMO) and whoever is running the show wanting to grab the minds of listeners. Sorry this is scatterbrained, there&#39;s so much I want to say on the subject. But I think you&#39;re absolutely right.</p>

An edgelord rapper talking about drugs and shit seems pretty standard for today, and pretty much all of music.

<p>He talks about having 6 figures under his mattress from scamming and that was what allowed his come up. I&#39;m not sure I believe him. Question his authenticity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that isn&#39;t true. </p>

<p>Just saying that much like the swastika or a shamrock in prison, this symbol is used by a specific population to represent something other than the symbols original meaning.</p>

<p>That tattoo is definitely an expression of Adam22&#39;s atheist ideology. He doesn&#39;t have a Catholic tattoo.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true,  all it takes is a little encouragement.  In the 60s the cia warped the counterculture to poison the well of the anti war movement.  </p>

<p>I would recommend checking this link out if you&#39;ve got the time.  Lots of son&#39;s and daughters of high ranking militarily members end up being platinum stars boasted by the radio incessantly.</p>
