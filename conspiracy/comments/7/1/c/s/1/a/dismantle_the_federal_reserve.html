       renewable energy is more than suffiecient at this point.  the richies just want to keep making money.  sad really.  we need to abolish our entire system and update it in a way that makes sense for modern times.  we need new checks and balances in place because the old ones  learly are not working

       In which way are you referring to?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Generation? What happens when the wind stops blow or it's night out?
       </li>
       <li>
        Storage? How do you store all of the electricity that is currently on the grid for times when generation goes out?
       </li>
       <li>
        Availability? What about areas that do not have a river to damn for hydro, sustainable winds for solar, or limited sun light (winter) for solar?
       </li>
       <li>
        Capacity? The US currently gets
        <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/solar-wind-renewable-energy-record/">
         10% of it's electricity from renewable
        </a>
        , where would that other 90% come from?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not advocating against renewables at all, but to say it is sufficient is misleading, we need to invest a lot more into its infrastructure before it is adequate

       It's also still vastly more expensive per kwh. So I hope you're ok with tripling your utility bill.

       no it isnt more expensive.  we just suck at putting the money and time and effort into things like this.  solar pays for itself anyway in the long run, when is the last time your electricity paid for itself? your probably thinking of these leasing companies that fuck you over but owning a solar array is a no brainer

       Yes, it is. Much, much more expensive, because it doesn't run all the time, so you have to build a whole natural gas plant to back it up.

       Imo just switch the subsidies give renewable what we give coal and petroleum and that price difference will flip flop really fast. I think this is an overly ignored part of this discussion.

       Internationally so, if I might add. That's outside of the acceptable range of discussion/debate. You either believe global warming is real and going to kill us all, or it's a conspiracy concocted by the Chinese. Pick your side.

       If the government wanted to invest in R&amp;D, patent their inventions, and license the results back out to repay the tax payer, I don't think anyone would have a problem. It's curious how they never choose to do that and instead opt for "stimulus" for companies run by their political allies, isn't it?

       there are countries doing it now my dude.  combos of the different ways to start.  keep in mind there is tech that is kept from us and people whos interests include making it seem impossible or improbable to do this.  hy couldnt we cover the entire desert in solar panel and floating panels for the ocean? and throw in wind energy over the ocean, along highways, etc.  if we can spend 700 million a day to fight wars that shouldnt exist we can do this.

       I'm thinking more like alcohol or electric. The first cars designed back in the late 19th century were running on engines that used alcohol and the fastest car Henry Ford built at that time was electric, but eventually Rockefeller monopolized oil and but restrictions on people using alcohol as fuel and it eventually fizzled out. There are many different things cars could run on

       switch to crypto currency formed by amaerican citizens and refuse to usw thier money.  instead of everyone playing into the brainwash thoughts of "its too hard", "it would be too devastating", how about tou grow some balls and fight for the freedom were supposed to have.  Why is it so out there to think that citizens can take back control in a slick way just as these bankers did to us? maybe it takes a long time or a civil war syarts or whatever.  none of that is worth staying complacent and allowing things to continue.  the biggest problem we have is that everyone think someone else will take care of it but this is something that requires us all.  if your too scared then thats ok but dont tell me I have freedom in this country where the police are militarized and operate above the law, where polititions lie to get into office and then do the opposite of what they promise, where i work my ass off for taxes to take a quarter of my check while proces for everything rise.  they cut social programs and healthcare but up military spending.  DONT TELL ME I LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE FREE AND HOME OF THE BRAVE. This is the land of the sheep and home to the depraived

       First watch this and realise our "american" dollar means nothing, less than nothing in fact its recycled debt that continues to grow.  If we created a system that was backed by something other than debt it instantly becomes more powerful because over time that false american money will fall (again) and again.  it was designed this way

       income tax was created in 1913 right when the irs was put into place along with the federal reserve.  fuck this hocus pocus "were not allowed to" from congress.  We should demand a real world way of dismantling this bank system and replace it with one that is run by the people and controlled by our own govt.

       The simplest way I found to defeat the bankers is to not use money at all. They control the flow of money so they can easily cause a drought leaving us with very little. Printing our own money is no easy task either without the resources that they control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution. Everyone has to work a minimum of 25 hours a week at any job that is registered with a central, transparent database so that all people can see that all people are working. We not only work for free, but we consume for free. Basically, as long as one person works, they are allowed to consume. If they don't work, they don't consume. Work can be extended to raising children or taking care of old, sick folks as well.

       i think this already sounds bad.  pushing a consuming social norm is bad.  instead we should be focusing on making individual communities self sufficient and linking them together.  if each place is set up with as much self reliency as possible and we teach frugality instead, we could transform our entire existance from one of a leech to one of a giving spirit.

       I just read that 45% of all work related activities can be replaced by robots as we speak. All we need to do is use robots to do most of the work. I am also considering all the hidden technology they are holding from us which can replace most all jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think of it like a family. A family doesn't count every penny and every little bit of activity they perform. They perform out of love for the good of the household. We need to do that across America where we work so that others can eat, drink, and be merry. If we all take care of each other, what's the point of money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is too easily manipulated by the elite as they are doing now. Ok, so let's assume we stop all the corruption tomorrow. The elite will just find another way to re-accumilate all of our wealth like they always have throughout history. When Alexander the Great took over the world, he tapped hoarded wealth and gave it to the world. The entire world economy blew up for 50 years but then the elite, after Alexanders death, began hoarding it back in again and the world fell back into a prison planet. Money is the root of all evil. It is causes WAY more problems than it solves.

       Not good enough.  We chouldnt have this structure in place.  we no longer need "representatives" thise were for the days when we couldnt vote due to travel time and lack of communication.  its 2017, obama gave everyone a free phone or go to the library and use thier computers.  point is we need to restructure society to put the people first.  no more false promises or back foor deals.  fuck career polititions and corporations that are so massive they sway society at the snap of a finger.  We need real change and we need to organize and centralize our efforts.  if we just sit around talking nothing will be done.  the govt has power because they have a system in place, i say we build one that takes advantage of the current one and will replace it in time, just like they did to us!

       And we do that by issuing currency from we the people. You can't just strip away the older generations way of life. I mean you can. But it's much more difficult. It's a lot easier for right now for American elites to Dick us rather than the European elites.

       You are kidding right? You think an overthrow of the system is easy or possible?  Getting people to side with you when they might starve, get locked up, or killed?  Getting businesses to side with you when it will destroy their profit margins?

       do you think if the information pertanent to this topic was assembled in a neat easy to watch video that was as entertaoning as it is informative people wouldnt start talking? I never said it would be easy but that doesnt mean im not going to do something.  If everyone in this sub that agreed with me shared what they know with who they know and showed them the truth and asked them to do the same it could be the start of the grass roots movement we would need to make a change we all need and from my stand point deserve.  we are being traded and used like money ourselves.  when you are born your sold right into the slave sytem that exists, unwillingly.  I dont think there is any real reason there cant be a peaceful informative movement.  they gave use the tools, lets use it against them and prove were not fucking sheep.

       It needs to be done, desperately.  But they literally own the politicians who
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       do it.  And if we try to get new politicians, the fed, and the banking mafias who back it, will shoo in their own politicians again.  If you're gonna tear it down, it all has to go, at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if that happened, we'd have to be prepared for widespread famine and war.  If you think that the economic powerhouses would just roll over and die without a fight, you'd be mistaken.  A proper, comprehensive, and fully independent agriculture industry would have to be in place, with reserves to handle the lean year or two.  Utilities, and alternatives for power, need to be locally self sufficient, without imports.  As long as we keep going to walmort and the centralized corporations for our food and utilities, a true revolution will be... self destructive.

       I'm not talking about "legal".  If you go after your "rulers", they will starve us, murder us, try to fence us in, on and on.  Look up the Holodomor, if you think they wouldn't.  Look at the situation in Venezuela.  I'm pointing out the need to be prepared for that.

       Ahh sorry went back and reread that.  Honestly though we could force companies to side with us.  if wal mart wants to stay here they cannot fuck us over otherwise we force them out.  the dumb ass cops and military is where its starts to get real hairy, talk about sheeple

       Local companies, with local products, sure.  But how are you gonna get a walmort to import tons of food and goods against their will, and not for money?  It just won't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's gotta be done locally, starting from a personal level, to neighborhoods, to cities, then counties.  The more dependent we are on imports, federal funding, or the financial system, the more control they have over us.  If a city (or family) can't sustain itself for a year or two, it doesn't stand a chance.

       Civil war at this point is the only way it will happen.  To be clear, this civil war would be nothing like Civil War I. We would essentially be fighting troops from all over the world on our soil as the global elitists are not going to lose their Sparta (natural resource rich military state).  If we were to win this "Civil War II"once our government and money supply was created and managed for the benefit of the people (assuming we are not fooled again by some agent of the oligarch), we would then have to fight World War III.  The global elites are not going to allow a country as wealthy as ours to leave the fold. If you were living in Europe/Asia/etc, prior to the attack on the US 2.0, you would be inundated with propaganda about how we are evil and vile.  The UN needs to control our WMD, the UN needs to liberate the Christians/Muslim/Jews/Native Americans/Blacks/Whites/Hispanics/insert any other potential peoples here. We would be attacked as we have done to countless countries under the guise of liberation, democracy, freedom, or to protect the world from terrorism. Terrorists is what we would have become. Terrorists is what we would be to the oligarch, and therefore the rest of the world. After we are defeated, a new friendly administration would be supplanted to ensure all is right with the world.  So, that's how I see it beginning and ending. Not being defeatist, just realistic.

       If we did this, we would need a system of our own that could transform the current one right under thier noses just like they did to us.  im mot the brightest bulb but i think it can be done.  I also think people are too scared and complacent otherwise this would already be in the works.  that said how can we make this happen?

       Also why the fuck does congress get to just draw up random ass bills and vote them into laws? I think everything should be given to citizens for review before any vote, there is just too much power at the top.  we need real answers here.  who can make websites? lets start a new unified movememt of the american people.  all colors, sexes, religions, etc one mass unifying movememt to restart our country and creat new non political ties between the wolrds nations

       Can't recall at the moment but their was a movement of sorts that was called the Tech Party I believe. Essentially created an app with every bill up for vote that allowed your average joe to get all the details of said bill and weigh in on the pros and cons of each. Then they were able place their vote. Of course they were laughed out of the office of every congressman they spoke with. I completely agree that complacency is the biggest issue that will need to be overcome. The question is how. And what the older generations will need is a why. Why should I exert that much energy and risk all that I've spent my life building. I would love nothing more than to be able to tear it all down and start over. But their needs to be a plan. Passion without plan is a recipe for disaster.

       thas why im jere trying to get a plan going but everyone jere is stuck in a "but how" loop.  Stop wondering if it CAN be fone and just do it.  i came up with an idea to start a siciety within this one that refuses to use american dollars.  what else can we rhinknof? i love the viting app idea.  the reason they were laughed at is because that would make every govt position obsolete

       The federal reserve gets a lot of flack for what is a simpler problem: fractional reserve banking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I say simple? That's probably not even accurate. Fractional reserve banking has at least somewhat noble roots. It allows people to own property and expensive assets who otherwise would have no chance. Do you think anyone would lend you $300,000 with the promise to pay it back in 30 years using your $50,000 wage slave job if they actually had to lend you money that exists?
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have the benefit of cheap credit, and a really really bad design for it. Private banks control over 90% of the money supply and hold the entire economy in the palm of their hand. This is the essence of "too big to fail".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, the solution is probably to keep the federal reserve, but transfer ownership to the public domain. Fed profits should add to the federal treasury. This is what Canada does. But more needs to be done than this. Banks should only be able to lend money they have, or act as a broker for "new money" loans directly from the government, who should have the sole power to approve and issue them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's even more benefit to this system too. It gives the government the long desired fine-tuning control over the economy that they need. There's a housing bubble but small business is suffering? Currently their only tool is to manipulate prime rates, but if they controlled all new money loans they could slow down the housing bubble and stimulate with business loans at the same time.

       either way it shouldnt be a private corp.  If the Federal reserve was actually part of the Federal govt then that is exactly what id want.  I think even this is silly though.  In the long run were headed for futuristic society.  In my mind i envision doing away with all jobs and automate what needs to be done and creating huge housing buildings to offer free housing.  grow food hydroponicly in "clean rooms" using organic techniques.  all of this can be done using robots/3d printing.  due away with money and allow people to flourish in thier talemts.  If people want to work they may but it wouldnt be required.  I think a big problem is that we all think within the confines of the rules of the current system.  I think we should be thinking bigger and long term.  knock down the caste system and level the field.

       Well I would caution against advocating that any intelligence re-design "the system". If what you're talking about is viable and possible, it will happen on it's own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is, it probably isn't, at least not with current technology. Scarcity is still a problem, and even imagining some futuristic society where replicators can produce everything we need, like Star Trek, has it's own unique challenges.

       why would you caution against a redesign? you do realise the world you see around you is an elaborate hoax,  that is not designed for your comfort.  By taking control and restructuring society now, a few generations from now will learn to be less self absorbed and taught to love ine another.  there are many systems in olace to limit the types of people there are in order to limit the types of control needed to keep thise people in line.  school, food, social activities, nothing has been accidental.  I think using robots and 3d printing would simplify what we have now.  sire developement will take time but doesnt that go for wverything now? we can use self healing concrete so even maintenance would be vastly diminished.  I would VOLUNTEER  for this future.

       I like the way you think but I think moderately left libertarian center left democratic socialism
and/or social democracy and centrism would be a faster and easier solution
to the deliberately rigged economic system compared to more left anarchistic type of economics.
If in a few hundred years, elites and sociopaths have left the gene pool (perhaps due to things like improvements in research/medicine/psychology/genetics)
then so be it, we can implement that type of completely different system at that point
when we're all less ignorant and psychotic lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, we just have to get money out of politics,
protect the people from psycho corporations, restrain/regulate the corps and banks, and use social programs to benefit the population and economy (withOUT corporate interference).
      </p>
      <p>
       When there's enough opportunities available,
there will be far more advancements in science, tech, medicine, psychology, etc.
Real progress.
I think forcing it could be a misstep and too premature.
But I prefer your type of thinking
than that of the propaganda some people unknowningly push
like "get a job you loser".
Working HARD is overrated, there needs to be a balance.
You need to enjoy what you're doing OR get compensated enough
for doing a job you'd rather not do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think without a little authoritarianism,
the elites could infiltrate things (maybe why dictator socialist countries are forced
to be this careful against CIA spies and rebels and such which could take over the country and corrupt it).
      </p>
      <p>
       We should start with a balanced approach
and AWAY from NEOliberal far right economics,
towards centrism and see how the economy improves, mental health,
intelligence, physical health, happiness, etc.
Then eventually center left (left of Bernie) would be optimum
for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point we could implement universal basic income
but it would have to be done by benevolant people,
because if the elites do it,
they're going to give it with one hand,
and take away social programs with the other (using UBI as an excuse "you don't need free shit now you peasants"
when it's really the elites who leech from US and the fruits of our labor.)

       i disagree, this is too slow of a plan using systems and rules that were designed against us.  im not saying i have all the answers but i know whats right and we need to move fast and swift and get an organized worldwide effort started to spread the truth and guve people a real organization to stand behind.  similar to what they did for the 9/11 movememt.  we need economists and scientists and every person we can get on our side.  to me the police and military personel should be specifically targeted with our message first to knock down the numbers of thier army or even get guys of our own on the inside so to speak.  we need to beat them at thier own game and we need to do this as american citizens and citizens of the free world!

       I think moving to a more moderate socialism-capitalism ratio
(center left democratic socialism to centrism, instead of far right NEOliberalism)
would actually reduce suffering much more quickly
if we can get money out of politics.
But your idea is interesting.

       Quite right. The problem isn't with the tool but rather who's in charge of it. A method of controlling the money supply is probably necessary, full stop. What isn't necessary is having that tool be appropriated by private interests.

       This is an excellent text book, even college level text book response, and it is completely full of false narratives. I will concede the benefit of fractional reserve banking to the economy at large, and especially those at the helm. However, a federal reserve bank does not need to exist at all. Necessary expansion and contractions of money supply can easily be done by the governments treasury through long forgotten treasury tools, reserve requirements, overnight repo rates, and other short term and long term credit facilities. The initial pitch for the Fed was to help stem the voraciousness of boom and bust periods. Arguably these boom and bust periods, or times of creative destruction are a vital part to any healthy economy. Incidentally the worst economic depression our country has ever seen began just 16 or so odd years after the Fed was created. This resulted in the elimination of many small financial institutions and fewer larger financial institutions...as did the 2008 crisis. Currently these periods of expansion and contraction are manipulated globally by institutions that have no skin in the game and prosper in either scenario. The only thing any g-20 treasury does at this point in time, in relation to money supply, is issue debt. The US government can't even print its own dollar bills for fucks sake. To paraphrase a quote from one of the Rothschilds, 'allow me to control a country's money and I care not who writes the laws'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently our Federal Reserve transfers all gains to the US Treasury, the same as Canada and every other central bank on the planet that I'm aware of, less "administrative expenses". Coincidentally, none of these reserve banks has ever been truly audited.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you desire an education on the federal reserve system free of the official narrative I encourage you to read "The Creature from Jekyll Island"

       I cant link the video right now, but there is an arguement out there that if the US Dept of Treasury started a new currency by which taxes could be paid, new currency implementation could occur over a presidency. Not that whoever would make it terribly long as President... see Abe Lincoln after/ during the Civil War

       I completely agree, the idea that a few uber powerful bankers have almost complete autonomy to print money and hand it straight over to the banks is absolutely ludicrous. I truly believe in cryptocurrency, I think a decentralized currency is the only way forward.  I'm not saying that bitcoin is the answer, I just trust that blockchain technology and the premise of ICO's could help fix the ridiculous economy manufactured by the Fed.

       as long as there was a way to ensure protection of the coding i too think this is the way.  i have read that the source code for bitcoin comes from the cia so my thinking is they know this and will start various small cryptocurrwncy companies disguised as independant companies.  then once the switch is made worldwide they can conglomerate just like they did with the banks now.  i think the only way to prevent this is to have a citizen board that changes time to time that oversees the code and ensures protection

       Despite bitcoin (and most cryptocurrencies being open source) we still don't know the identity of who created btc.  Chances are you're right that it was the CIA, but it could have also been someone who was afraid of facing those who control the central banks.

       It's a good idea by itself. But the elites won't allow it to happen because their entire dark occultist network completely breaks if they lose the central bank control. I think we have to wait for the right moment.

       It should be required reading in high school IMO, but all of you should read "The Creature from Jekyll Island" by G. Edward Griffin. Details the creation of the federal reserve system, fractional banking, eliminating the gold standard, and the why it exists. Excellent book.

       As soon as the American people understand that their Treasury Dept doesn't administer monetsry policy, and that a FOREIGN entity does maybe there will be outcry. Problem is, they indoctrinate this system in high schools as 'normal' and dont teach about the economic prosperity the country had when we weren't on a debt-based/ central banking system. Not that that time was terribly long, but the financiers were on the outside, jelly as fuck, looking in. We need another Andrew Jackson

       I think what we need to do is create an entirely different society withon this current one.  If there were businesses  and enough people willing we could BE the society we want.  Think about it.  Some guy went and created cryptocurrency out of thin air and it worked! so why cant we create one we all agree to use and start only using this new currency.  im not sure exactly how to type this out but i think im onto something.  why couldnt we refuse to use the "american dollar"? What if there were businesses who employed people and paid them with this new currency and they used the currency at other stores and businesses doing the same.  make sure there is a spread of industries from hrocery stores to dry cleaners to clothing stores, etc.  make sure peoples needs are covered and create an employee owned conglomerate of stores that all use this currency exclusively.  could this somehow be spread and catch on? im sure there is lots im missing here and i welcome criticism, that helps progress.  this is just one huys idea, im sure we can do better, we need to believe in ourselves and each other.  Do some soul searching and meditate my brothers, we can do this but it has to be together.

       It is flat out a terrible idea. The federal reserve is one of the best institutions in America: nonpartisan, ran by some of the best economists in US, very successful in keeping prices stable, completely transparent, and saves the government a lot of money. What do you propose what we replace it with?

       It makes you realize how contrived the monetary system is and that in the context of humanity and the globe, having a few central families and central banks issue currency to everyone else is completely insane. If they can do it, so could anyone &amp; everyone.

       If everyone did it, currency would become moot after a while.

       US is at war with russia and china (economic informational war), there is no time to reform US and make itself better, when the very power of US is at stake. US dollar as reserve currency is probably going to fall soon(like within our lifetime for sure). Infrastructure, social problems, etc. political bullshit and propaganda. There is no time to discuss the obvious issues that the biggest theft in american history that took place long ago (the fed reserve), when real issues of very power of US is at stake. (which makes sense).
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the topic at hand: Fed Reserve is established and has deep strong roots in the whole of US, you cant just change that.

       the wars are fake my dude.  its rich people at the top of the hill looking down and making money funding the wars and then making money with rebuildimg.  they make money all around while we lose our lives.  they literally ise US as curremvy now.  that is why the cash is useless, its our lives they trade hour by hour.  i disagree with this not being fixable.

       Honestly I have been thinking about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wars always carry a big bonus to the countries. Population control, a good big war always cuts the numbers by the millions. Economy gets a refresh with fewer competition small businesses can rise up. Redevelopment of europe was a big factor post ww2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you are partly right, maybe you are fully right. But the effect of rich fighting the rich and carving up the earth was a factor in ww2, and it is continuing today.

       yeah, i know.  thays what i just said.  were pawns in a game of chess that the king and queen arent even participating in.  there is no  hess game and there is no end unless the other pieces decide to stop playing thier game.  think about the fact that everyone they control is our brothers and sisters, of course there will be thise too brainwashed to care but that is thier  choice.
