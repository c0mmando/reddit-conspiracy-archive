        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: comments are brigaded (as usual) please read content of post and not just the ignorant comments by people who would be screaming murder if she was white</p>

<p><strong>Sept 8th-Sept 9th</strong></p>

<p>Around 11pm Kenneka drives her mothers car then arrives at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Rosemont (also referred to as Crowne Plaza Chicago O&#39;Hare) with Monifa and two other friends. Irene is already at the hotel in a room on the 9th floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/5ptCGD6v8UM">This</a> video appears to be recorded on their way up to 9th floor.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hnOuqee29vI">This video</a> appears to be recorded in the hotel bathroom. I do not know what time (someone who has fb, help?)</p>

<p>1:36am, Irene (red hair) uses Monifa&#39;s (black jacket/bra) phone to post <a href="https://youtu.be/QdozAJD0rg4">this fb live video.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>speculation</em> - some believe you can hear someone saying <a href="https://twitter.com/treybaile/status/907026596481073158">&quot;help me&quot; </a> in the video.</p>

<p><em>speculation</em> - some believe you can hear a man saying <a href="https://twitter.com/sirmaejor/status/907137781343903745">&quot;we about to murder somebody&quot;</a>.</p>

<p><em>almost certain</em> - you can hear a woman say <a href="https://youtu.be/QdozAJD0rg4#t=01m45s">&quot;motherfuckers be using freezers a lot of the time too, he said you can go in and out of &#39;em&quot;</a></p>

<p><em>speculation</em> - some believe you can hear a person say <a href="https://youtu.be/QlYsDuXgGcU#t=00m38s">&quot;they stupid they in there raping that girl&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other videos of that night have popped up online but none of them were live so everyone&#39;s a little suspicious about them (or they should be).</p>

<p>Around 3am Kenneka goes missing (or at least that&#39;s the official story)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/glanton/ct-kenneka-jenkins-dahleen-glanton-met-20170913-column.html">4am</a>, Kenneka&#39;s friends are in her mothers car and have Kenneka&#39;s phone when they call her mother to tell her Kenneka is missing.</p>

<p>Jenkins’ mother (Ms. Martin) <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/09/kenneka-jenkins-video-full-chicago-facebook-live-stream-elevator-party-hotel-footage-videos-martin-death-suspects/">told the media</a> that Kenneka’s friends told her she “disappeared after they briefly left her alone in the hotel hallway to retrieve her car keys and cellphone from inside the room.”</p>

<p>5am: Ms. Martin arrives at the hotel, asking them to review the security footage and help look for her. They helped look but didn&#39;t find anything and Ms. Martin calls 911. She is upset by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/09/11/a-woman-was-found-dead-in-a-hotel-freezer-her-family-says-the-police-havent-done-enough/?utm_term=.0d35c4a6ec08">lack of effort by Rosemont police and Crowne Plaza hotel staff. </a></p>

<p>EDIT: Ms. Martin returned to the hotel later that day asking to see the surveillance footage again but the hotel employees <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/true-crime/wp/2017/09/11/a-woman-was-found-dead-in-a-hotel-freezer-her-family-says-the-police-havent-done-enough/">called the police on her and would not release tapes without missing-persons report</a></p>

<p><strong>Sept 10</strong></p>

<p>An unnamed hotel employee <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/11/kenneka-jenkins-chicago-found-dead-inside-hotel-freezer/652650001/">discovered Kenneka&#39;s body in the hotel&#39;s industrial freezer</a> and at 12:48am Kenneka is pronounced dead. She is described by police dispatch as <a href="http://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Police-release-911-audio--445310133.html">&quot;frozen solid&quot;.</a></p>

<p><strong>Sept 14</strong></p>

<p>Some random activist, Andrew Holmes, views the surveillance footage BEFORE Kenneka&#39;s mother, Ms. Martin. <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/crowne-plaza-hotel-offers-to-pay-for-kenneka-jenkins-funeral/">He declares she was not forced</a> into the freezer by anyone.</p>

<p>EDIT: Ms. Martin then claims <a href="https://youtu.be/Ca6PinTIlGM">Andrew Holmes told her to ask protesters to stop because the hotel is losing money</a></p>

<p><strong>Sept 15</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-kenneka-jenkins-freezer-death-update-0915-20170914-story.html">Kenneka Jenkins&#39; mother says activist who viewed hotel video misrepresented family</a></p>

<p>Video of Kenneka on surveillance cameras released to public. Three official video sources: <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-kenneka-jenkins-hotel-freezer-video-20170915-story.html">Chicago Tribune</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1537467/Surveillance-video-shows-Kenneka-Jenkins-stumbling-hotel.html">Daily Mail</a> this one has additional angle at the end</p>

<p><a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/video/3731505-rosemont-pd-not-handing-kenneka-jenkins-case-to-fbi/">CBS Chicago</a> this one has new footage of her in a hallway</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>speculation</em> - I cannot find an official source for this alternate angle in the kitchen. Not sure I&#39;m buying this, looks fake- <a href="https://youtu.be/DI4u-7H_gJM">guy in blue jacket watches Kenneka as she walks through kitchen. </a></p>

<p><em>speculation</em> - some say the woman in the surveillance video is a body double because she looks heavier on camera and <a href="https://youtu.be/Y4b9tXg1HFw">her pants look different</a>. I&#39;m not convinced. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/GRPqd">Here is a comparison I made</a>. Camera adds weight and also extra fuzziness especially on white clothing. </p>

<p><em>speculation</em> - <a href="https://youtu.be/1x-caRuoa9g">smile on surveillance footage could indicate she wasn&#39;t alone.</a></p>

<p><em>I need help with this one</em> - This <a href="https://youtu.be/RCXVWyt1udw">zoomed in video</a> (possibly) shows a hand grabbing her and I think I can see it in official <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-kenneka-jenkins-freezer-death-update-0915-20170914-story.html">video posted by Chicago Tribune.</a>
I am only working with an iPhone, can someone help?</p>

<p><em>speculation</em> - <a href="https://youtu.be/Cf9TnVa0q3s">this video</a> is similar to the one just above this: there&#39;s something around her waist area, just not sure it&#39;s an arm</p>

<p><em>speculations</em> - each of these words link to a separate video: <a href="https://youtu.be/3zTI7asDojM">there</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/6jGF2-lO0Vc">are</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/lvItgnTYebU">so</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/01ucKNlFjqY">many</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/CE7DsSy7Ou4">fake</a> videos it really muddies the investigation efforts to the point where I consider it an intentional effort.</p>

<p>Hotel offers to show Ms. Martin and her lawyer full surveillance tape. <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/attorney-for-kenneka-jenkins-family-tours-crowne-plaza-hotel/">No new video shown to Ms. Martin or her lawyer as of 9/19.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/edad_p/status/909826890835333120">A quick reminder on how easy it would be to edit people out of surveillance footage.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/09/19/no-video-hotel-freezer-death/">Hotel Claims No Video Exists Of Kenneka Jenkins Walking Into Freezer</a> EDIT: Activist Andrew Holmes had previously stated that surveillance footage shows Kenneka <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/update-things-know-about-kenneka-jenkins-whose-body-was-found-hotel-freezer/yIH7wXJV0kncg1us9LXnxK/amp.html">walked herself into the freezer.</a></p>

<p><strong>OKAY SO THAT&#39;S A FAIRLY GOOD VIEW ON CHRONOLOGICAL EVENTS. NOW ONTO ADDITIONAL RESEARCH</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/DCqh0">A compilation of some really weird online reviews</a> for the hotel where Kenneka died: blood, smells, people entering guests&#39; rooms at all hours of the night. Pr<em>cel</em>ne has since removed the hotel from its map and <a href="https://www.priceline.com/crowne-plaza-chicago-o-hare-hotel-and-conference-center-des-plaines-illinois-il-166307-hd.hotel-reviews-hotel-guides#/details/today/tomorrow/39914/1/US-USD-0/reviews">reviews are no longer accessible on their site.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=180e7f56-16c4-45d0-ba00-72ede311df78">Bradley Stephens is the Mayor of Rosemont. His nephew, Donald Stephens III is the police chief. His other nephew, Christopher, runs the Rosemont Convention Center (right across the street from Rosemont Crowne Plaza).</a> Mark Stephens, Bradley&#39;s brother has <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20141215/news/141218937/">janitorial and parking contracts with the city of Rosemont.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20110831/news/708319920/">The 10 members of the Stephens family on the village&#39;s payroll received almost $1 million in compensation in 2010, according to village financial records. Additionally, five other elected officials and their 13 combined family members totaled another million dollars in pay in 2010. That means out of 679 village employees, these 28 members of six families were responsible for 10 percent of Rosemont&#39;s $20 million in personnel costs last year.</a></p>

<p>In 2014, a former cop <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-rosemont-coverup-lawsuit-met-20141203-story.html">filed a lawsuit </a> against Rosemont because he was forced out for not participating in illegal cover ups. <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-12/news/0602120302_1_lawsuit-charges-marijuana-arrest-legal-limit">Here&#39;s a similar lawsuit from 2006.</a></p>

<p>David M. Friedman <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=6257170&amp;amp;privcapId=324097">owns the hotel</a> through his F&amp;F Realty Ltd. The website for F&amp;F Realty is now down: <a href="http://www.fandfrealty.com">http://www.fandfrealty.com</a> - can anyone find out when it went down?</p>

<p>F&amp;F also owns the Crowne Plaza West Loop (featured in a few of the online reviews above). The west loop hotel nearly foreclosed in 2013 and <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20130410/CRED03/130409780/rising-market-solves-loan-woes-at-west-loop-hotel?X-IgnoreUserAgent=1&amp;amp;X-IgnoreUserAgent=1">it&#39;s unclear where F&amp;F came up with the cash to cover the roughly $11.7 million difference in the loans.</a></p>

<p>Friedman also owns CPO Hospitality which has been a <a href="http://government-contractors.insidegov.com/l/465580/Cpo-Hospitality-L-L-C">government contractor since 2007.</a> <a href="http://elections.il.gov/Campaigndisclosure/ItemizedContrib.aspx?FiledDocID=jqooUqyW0YaRDVdA3hqOBQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;ContributionType=HjDmIU4y6Ufx0337rcn47uKcQLJnGs0puLEVHsYUXhM44FWN4GMEqNdSD4b4p0%2F2p9Jo%2BPx8ZyQ%3D&amp;amp;Archived=6ep1XWxoZkXgvSPr55yWGQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;OrderBy=CrUlaHcZcmsdc06BR9%2F5%2BlOvJ7ER5wOiyDvFXE3HXewGdUMFGOEOuA%3D%3D&amp;amp;ItemizedContribFrom=h2278ew9EzKg1grXp2p9cpw1M92KRob8DU8%2Bg1MWdpcMxxoLskjlug%3D%3D"> CPO donates to Mayor Stephens&#39; &quot;Bradley A Stephens Committeeman Fund&quot;</a> and <a href="https://openillinois.org/recipient/?id=15990637&amp;amp;query">Brad Stephens for Mayor Fund.</a></p>

<p>Ok, we all know what this looks like. If you don&#39;t care, please don&#39;t comment. I would like this thread to be for people who care to help investigate. I will probably update.</p>

<p>Edit: just a reminder that the autopsy has not yet been completed as of 9/20/17, 17:16</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that the Crowne Plaza brand was owned by IHG (InterContinental Hotel Group PLC)? And if so I do not see anyone by the name of Friedman serving on their board or in any role of leadership; nor as an investor. I am not trying to prove you wrong. I am just really curious how you tied the two together. </p>

<p>I did locate a &quot;Friedman&quot; that is associated with the Crowne Plaza O&#39;Hare via this link <a href="http://www.buzzfile.com/business/Crowne-Plaza-At-O!Hare-847-671-6350">http://www.buzzfile.com/business/Crowne-Plaza-At-O!Hare-847-671-6350</a>. </p>

<p>And then I found this &quot;Friedman&quot; that is associated Univercell Holdings Inc. via this link <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=6257170&amp;amp;privcapId=324097">http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=6257170&amp;amp;privcapId=324097</a></p>

<p>You provided two links that connect David M Friedman to the hotel, im not sure what your question is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, I think I answered my own question. Also I was going through some Wikis on IHG. IHG has over 766,000 rooms and 5,174 hotels across nearly 100 countries. Of the 5174 hotels, 4321 operate under franchise agreements, 845 are managed by the company but separately owned, and 8 are directly owned. Good luck to anyone trying to figure out what is what with that. </p>

<p>I live in a city near Dallas, it is not as big as Dallas. Our population is about 104,659, in 2016 respectively. Anyways, DreamWorks (the animation company) owns an apartment complex here. And they use  a nearby management company to run them. It baffles me as to why? These are one story flats, built in the 60&#39;s; it was said they used to be the only hotel in town. </p>

<p>I have not ever really understood, these large companies with their management groups, investors and all that hoopla. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t seen the hotel security staff have you? They&#39;re not always the sharpest guys and technology isn&#39;t their strength. Most hotels outsource their IT jobs so they don&#39;t have tech people on staff. A week isn&#39;t unreasonable. When something happens on private property it&#39;s up to the police to investigate. They can request the video if they want. Why would there be any expectation that a private company would have to release video footage to the general public just because they&#39;re demanding it? I have home security cameras. If you came and asked me for footage of past events I&#39;d tell you &quot;no&quot;. If there&#39;s a crime, the detectives will get to the bottom of it. </p>

They are working so hard to try to turn this into a huge event. Stupidity, I&#39;d believe. Drugs, I&#39;d believe. But, organ harvesting? On some dumb, random 19 yr. old? Not likely. Why not just kill homeless people? Rape, maybe. But, if they planned to rape her, why put her in the freezer? Maybe the security guards are into necrophilia? This whole thing is fishy.

    <div class="md"><p>This story is a MASSIVE deal. </p>

<p>It makes no sense to me that you are so determined to ensure that the family is not being shady, while giving the hotel a complete pass on all of it&#39;s shadiness throughout this entire case. </p>

<p>Takes them ridiculously long to release the tapes? &quot;That&#39;s cool&quot;</p>

<p>Surveillance tapes are heavily edited with time stamp skipping, snd sloppy attempts to remove people from scene?  &quot;No problem.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see someone grab her in the kitchen? &quot;I&#39;m cool with that. &quot;</p>

<p>After almost a week the hotel claims they have no footage of her walking into the freezer, even after the mother and sister saw that they had a camera by the freezer room and the activist said he viewed the tape when she walked into the freezer? &quot;Pfft. Who cares bout that&quot;. </p>

<p>Kenneka&#39;s family has protested about this and are looking for answers into how she died? &quot;THEY MUST BE STOPPED. THEY JUST WANT THE MONEY, SCREW THEM&quot;. </p>

<p>That train of logic makes no sense to me. What did the hotel do to earn your blind trust?</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary to think that you and people like you are so willing to sweep this under the rug when there is so much evidence of foul play involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to work for a hotel many years ago. In the kitchen. I&#39;ve gone in and out of walk-in coolers and freezers in hotels more times than I can remember.

    <div class="md"><p>That is not the most obvious answer. That is your answer because you do not want to entertain the fact of how shady the hotel is. So it is much simpler to say, they are out for money and should stop their whining. </p>

<p>But when it comes to Occam&#39;s Razor, now apply it to the fact that the surveillance video&#39;s were edited and that the hotel is refusing to show the video of her going in the freezer.   What is the most obvious answer then? </p>

<p>They are hiding the truth. Obviously. </p>

<p>Why would they have to edit and photoshop the video if they just needed to show a drunk girl walking into a freezer? They wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>When it comes to the family, finding the truth is just as valid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on. If you need someone&#39;s organs, you really think you would go with a homeless person as apposed as to a fit young girl? </p>

<p>But the motive doesn&#39;t matter to me. All that matters is the facts. And the fact is those surveillance videos were edited. There is absolutely no need for that if the narrative from the hotel was genuine. But it&#39;s not. So they had to cover their tracks. </p>

<p>The hotel is up to something. </p>

<p>You can stay sleeping if you want to, but you really shouldn&#39;t discourage others from searching for the truth just because you don&#39;t have the ability to fathom why the hotel would want Kenneka dead. </p>

<p>And that is why we have police departments and detectives. They will investigate, and if a crime was committed, they will make arrests. That&#39;s how justice works. The days of getting together an angry mob with torches and pitchforks is done. If you find evidence to support your claim, then call the detectives and report the information. Otherwise, let the police do their job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha. Dude, I&#39;m sorry to break it to you, but we live in a world where corrupt cops exist. Not all cops are corrupt but some are. </p>

<p>With that in mind. When you look at this case you have to ask yourself &quot;are these cops corrupt&quot;?   You realize that the cops got involved  on Saturday at around 1:30pm but couldn&#39;t find the body till after midnight even though they had access to surveillance footage. </p>

<p>Then they took over a week to release the videos. They say they will release all of the tapes. But they only release snippets. Those snippets are sloppily edited, yet still show that people were down there with her. </p>

<p>It is obvious that the answer to the question is yes, we are dealing with corrupt cops. So going to the detective would do more harm than good because they have been trying to shut this investigation down from the beginning. </p>

A drunk girl pin balling down hotel hallways and through restricted areas alone for over an hour ON CAMERA going completely unnoticed is either outrageous negligence, or a lie.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been in the restaurant industry over a decade. The only way I&#39;ve seen someone stuck in a freezer is when the seal is damaged and ice builds up on the seal. </p>

<p>This is quite rare since this usually only happens when the heat element in the door is damaged/malfunctioning or the door isn&#39;t installed properly.  Unless they had to replace the door on that freezer it&#39;s near impossible that we are dealing with a seal issue.</p>

<p>Regardless, walk-in&#39;s are made so you can&#39;t get stuck in them. Millions of people around the world walk in and out of freezers on a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alcohol is pretty nasty when it comes to cold weather.  Normally without the influence of alcohol your body when subjected to cold temps will start closing off blood flow to your extremities.  The effect is you feel colder as your extremities are getting colder, but it protects your core temp where all your organs and vital stuff is.  If you stay in the cold too long you&#39;ll lose extremities like toes, fingers, and ears, but you&#39;ll stay alive.  Assuming you don&#39;t stay out even longer and die.</p>

<p>With alcohol in your system your body doesn&#39;t stop sending blood to your extremities.  So you feel warmer than you normally would since heat is still getting to your extremities, but that also means you are losing heat much faster, and you can go into hypothermia much quicker.  So if you are way drunk you might not notice yourself go from warm to hypothermia, and once there you can actually start feeling warm again.  This is why you hear about people with hypothermia taking their cloths off.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read all the info in this yet as I just saved it for later, but it is entirely plausible that she went in that freezer, passed out drunk, and died from exposure.</p>

<p>To me it looked like she was incredibly intoxicated and walked into a freezer that cannot be opened from the inside (speculation).  Once there, she froze.

<p>Additionally, walk in freezer doors don&#39;t not open. I have <em>never</em>, in my lifetime in the service industry, seen a walk in that didn&#39;t have a handle to open from the inside, and I wouldn&#39;t enter one that didnt. Pretty sure it&#39;s a law, I know that very few, if any producers of those freezers would let one go without a way to escape the cold little box of death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Video is out of the freezers. You can definitely open from the inside. The freezers do not close behind you.

<p>It&#39;s really a nonsense point to debate now when the videos show that people were edited out of the video to make it look like she was alone.

It is not easy finding your way through service elevators, maze like hallways that are not usually marked with signs, and then consider the kitchen of a large restaurant is another obstacle course, all of this is monitored by cameras and hotel security. So how did a very drunk woman make her way past security checkpoints and a downright maze to the hotel freezer? That is no easy feat.

<p>You bring up good points about the layout of the hotel. I also wonder why a freezer that is not being used is running. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I am always up for great conspiracy. I believe they exist and I believe they are highly prevalent in our society. Matter of fact conspiracy is found up and down the United States judicial system when it comes to Criminal laws. But in this case, I find it hard to believe or follow a trail of conspiracy. Let&#39;s start with the video that reportedly has the young girl say help me. Immediately after that the music turns up and then within 5 Seconds the music is turned back down. If someone is being assaulted and they yell out help me and the music is only turned on for a millisecond and then all is quiet again I have trouble buying that someone is being physically assaulted at that time. Next there other videos of the amount of people in the hotel room which obviously comes at a later time then the first video because the party has started to pick up. And those videos the young lady is fine. Now let&#39;s get to the elephant in the room, what purpose would be Hotel have to cover this crime up? Not only that but why would the cops go along with the hotel? What would be the reason to edit people out of the video? What game would that give the hotel to keep a murderer potentially on its staff? What good would it do for the cops to let a murderer off the hook? Like I said starting this out I am all ways up for a great conspiracy theory. But in this case it looks like a young lady just got a little bit too loose off the goose and potentially passed out in a bad spot. Tragic death. But I don&#39;t get the money grab angle in the suing angle that is potentially going to take place. I don&#39;t get how the hotel is responsible for an underaged unregistered guest drunk wandering near Hall. From a privacy standpoint the hotel can I simply pull surveillance tape because of the request from a family. Could you imagine how many wives could go to any hotel and request surveillance video to see if their husband is in a room with his mistress? There are privacy and security concerns with just allowing any request to go through. I think is a good thread that you put together, but I just can&#39;t see the conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will address your points. Yes, new to reddit but far from a novice in critical thinking. I don&#39;t think it is victim blaming to point out truths. All of those videos show underage people drinking illegally. The room was booked illegally using a fraudulent credit card. A crime. The victim died in an unauthorized employee only part of the hotel. Trespassing. These are concrete facts. Not victim blaming. Speaking of the video you mentioned ... For all we know these kids could have been using those freezers to engage in other activities ... Especially if they knew the freezers were not supervised by hotel staff from previous trips. Maybe the victim had been in the freezer before ... On the mother&#39;s 9/11 call she mentions having a hotel parking receipt from the property from a previous week in the car. Of course this is speculation which is easy to do. So I rely on facts and not emotion. Blk women do get a bad rep ... But this isn&#39;t about emotion. The facts right now point toward a tragic accident and the young lady accidentally causing her own demise. Let&#39;s see what autopsy reveals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I&#39;ll give you a motive.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eraio_XTz74">area has been connected to organ harvesting right</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tcAFhAfC2k">Organs are big business on the black market</a>. </p>

<p>If the crooked manager had a client that needed the organs of a teen age girl really bad how much do you think that be worth to some rich parents with a sick teenage daughter?</p>

<p>So the crooked manager tells the crooked security to be on the lookout for a girl that happens to fit Kenneka&#39;s description. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4CxlEEDgpw">They scope her out on cam, and pretend to check on the party while  waiting for there opportunity.</a> They find it, grab her, and drug her. </p>

<p>Remember the family was only allowed to see her face, when it went into the body bag. They could have gotten the organ already and been done with it.</p>

<p>The hotel is connected to the cops already which is why the cops are cool with the cover up. They throw the crooked activist a few coins to help them get those pesky protesters out of their way. And business as usual.</p>

<p>There you have a legit motive for the crooked hotel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve purposely shied away from jumping to any explicit conclusions but here&#39;s a quick summary:</p>

<p>Kenneka parties at hotel with friends, goes missing around 3am (according to them), about 24 hours later she is found dead in a industrial hotel freezer. The hotel then takes a week to release footage (only about 3 minutes in total). For some reason the tapes are shown to a city activist, Andrew Holmes, before they are shown to her mother. Holmes states she was not led into the freezer by anybody based on what he saw on the tapes. Now, all the news outlets are saying there is no footage of her walking into the freezer (what has been release shows her waking through kitchen but not actually entering a freezer). </p>

<p>There are many <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/DCqh0">really weird online reviews</a> for the hotel where she died. The hotel is owned by David M Friedman (not to be confused w/ our ambassador to Israel) who donates to the mayor&#39;s campaigns. The Mayor is the police chief&#39;s uncle. There is lots of other corruption involving the mayor&#39;s family (sources above). </p>

<p>In conclusion: it&#39;s not looking good. </p>

<p>However, since this is r/conspiracy</p>

<p>How about she was wandering around the hotel trying to excape her rapist knowing he and her &quot;friends&quot; want her dead.  She is actually trying to hide in the freezer but drugs and alcohol cause her to pass out and she dies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea. Maybe it&#39;s all orchestrated to look like Kenneka was walking in the freezer alone to keep this a simple &quot;suicide&quot; because they had footage of her being dragged there (hence her disheveled hair) and didn&#39;t want to tarnish the hotel..? This is all so odd. Also weird how her friends are nowhere in the surveillance footage except for the beginning when they&#39;re entering / going to the room. I don&#39;t think this is all a conspiracy for Kenneka&#39;s family to get a pay out, I think something serious happened here. I don&#39;t believe she could&#39;ve walked into that freezer, as drunk as she was (leaving the elevator footage) all by herself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it would seem that only the killer(s)[if she was killed] would want to edit the tape. how do 2bit killers get a hold of the tape from the hotel to edit it? Bottom line is the hotel HAS to be in on it if the tapes are edited, but why? did the hotel really play a part in killing somebody at their own hotel? then stash a dead body at their own hotel? if the hotel wanted organs, wouldn&#39;t be best thing be to make sure the body is NEVER found? why bring so much police attention to your place of business?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably an obvious correlation for this crowd, but does anyone else see a few similarities between this incident &amp; the Elisa Lam case?r/elisalam/  </p>

<p>The aspect of the cases i&#39;m primarily referencing here is the perceivable demeanor of both women in the respective security cam  footage. They both seem to be disoriented, stumbling, wandering around in Hallways, getting on and off elevators, potentially even interacting with unseen figures off-screen.</p>

<p>In both cases there is existing video footage of the deceased prior to the incident but no definitive footage capturing the actions which are reported to have caused their deaths. Also, in each case a large volume of people believe or suspect critical video evidence has been doctored or edited in some way.</p>

<p>Each case involves a hotel which, generally speaking, seems to have some previous reputation for suspicious, paranormal, or criminal activity occurring there.</p>

<p>Now is this a shocking revelation? Not really, each one of these correlations can be easily explained as either coincidence or happenstance. The Elisa Lam rabbit hole never seemed to stop spiraling in on itself &amp; no verifiable deeper conclusions ever emerged from my understanding. How far will this spiral recess into itself--let&#39;s find out!</p>

Do you know how many cameras and 24 hour staff are on premises? even at the shit hole motel 6’s you’d be lucky to get away with anything outside of your room. Locking yourself in walk in freezers? It doesnt seem like anyone on the internet has had the privilege of working in a kitchen. They are made so that you dont accidentally kill your idiot staff in the event that some asshat locks themselves in a 12x12 box</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the biggest issue i have with the organ thing is that viable organs can only be taken from living bodies, not frozen to death. i think the freezer was to cover up the rape/murder (which i think was either i exchange for money or a gang initiation). that tribune article did however demonstrate that there&#39;s a market for dead organs/parts too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to say about the Priceline reviews. The thing about people trying to enter rooms &amp; walk ins, seems like the hotel staff there had an employee that didn&#39;t know how to check people in properly. In some hotels, there&#39;s a system to make room keys and then a system to check people in. Sometimes the systems aren&#39;t connected, so someone can easily make keys for a room and NOT check them into the system. </p>

<p>Later that night, the overnight staff thinks that the guest didn&#39;t check in, so they sell the room to another person. It was a common thing that happened at the last two properties that I worked at (I worked overnights) and it was a pain in the ass. Just my two cents as a hotel employee with incompetent ex staff members. (thankfully in a much better workplace)</p>

<p>((HOPE YOU ALL CAN UNDERSTAND MY RAMBLINGS))</p>

<p>Not sure if this was mentioned here already, but something I noticed regarding the time stamps in 2 videos in the article attached above. Videos titled &quot;RAW 3&quot; and &quot;RAW 5&quot;</p>

<p>VIDEO &quot;RAW 5&quot;
02:24:26- door opens
02:24:34- she exits, keeps walking.
02:24:44- walks out of camera view
Video continues
At 02:24:55- time jumps to 02:26:37
(MISSING TIME FRAME 02:24:56-02:26:36)
02:26:47-Doors open 
02:26:56- doors close
At 2:27:05 there is another time jump to 2:28:06
2:28:13-doors open 
2:28:23- doors close</p>

<p>VIDEO &quot;RAW 3&quot;
02:26:40- video begins and she is already half way down the hall.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the video &quot;RAW 5&quot; She gets out of the elevator and walks out of camera view at 02:24:44. </p>

<p>In video &quot;RAW 3&quot; the time stamp begins at 02:26:40 where she is seen ALREADY half way down the hallway. </p>

<p>So what happened after when she walks out of camera view at 02:24:44 in video &quot;RAW 5&quot; to the time we see her half way down the hallway in video &quot;Raw 3&quot; at 02:26:40??? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what happened in that time frame which just happens to pretty much match the missing footage in video time &quot;RAW 5&quot; (02:24:56 to 02:26:36.)</p>

<p>In video &quot;RAW 5&quot; the elevator doors open again at 02:26:47 and close at 02:26:56. Hallway is empty, time continues normally until 02:27:05 where the time stamp jumps to 02:27:06</p>

<p>Most important key points is that in the elevator footage there are missing frame&#39;s because the times (02:24:56-02:26:36) are not there shown.</p>

<p>And there are a few other time jumps. </p>

<p>Why edit out almost 1 minute of film in the middle of the footage, but keep the portion at the end that shows a woman and her son exiting the elevator? (they dont seem to have anything to do with her dissappearance, yet they didn&#39;t edit them out)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a YouTube channel &quot;Fractal Truth&quot; I found what seems to be the original surveillance videos and they all are time stamped.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KKl0PZOGMq4">https://youtu.be/KKl0PZOGMq4</a></p>

<p>That is the elevator footage. It seems as though someone is reviewing the footage and also being recorded as they review it. </p>

<p>In this video you can see that the missing time frame which I mentioned in my previous post regarding video &quot;RAW 5&quot;, is actually done by whoever is reviewing the tape. They are literally skiping ahead in the video. (So there is definitely missing footage because they skipped ahead ) why skip a head??</p>

<p>Also regarding the red motion sensors:</p>

<p>If you notice the sensors only pop up when a figure appears. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Elevator doors open for Kenneka, while they are opening there are no red sensors. The sensors don&#39;t appear until she steps her body out of the elevator.</p></li>
<li><p>Elevator doors open, no one comes out...but sensors appear.</p></li>
<li><p>Elevator doors open, sensors only appear once the woman and child step out of the elevator. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a video someone posted of themselves going into the Lobby elevator and pushing buttons to go down to LR, LL (which I assume is &quot;lower level&quot;) and LLR.</p>

<p>Once he gets to a floor down there and the doors open, you see that the elevators open on two sides!! One side leads to the hallway Kenneka is seen walking walking into as she exits the elevator and the other side leads to some mysterious area with concrete floor.

<p>I say weirdly because they do not include a map of the basement, or how to access it, so I&#39;m not sure why it would have been removed.  This includes maps of the first two floors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the links! Never worry that you&#39;re sending too much info, it&#39;s all welcome for discussion even if I don&#39;t include it in the OP. </p>

<p>The Fractal Truth video has no proof that it is from an official source. It&#39;s certainly interesting though.</p>

<p>The elevator video is also cool but the LLR button means &quot;lower level rear door&quot; so it didn&#39;t open randomly in this persons video- it opened because he pressed the LLR button. It is useful to know that there is such an option on the elevators at Crowne Plaza Rosemont. Where would this fit best in the OP?</p>

<p>As for the motion sensor thing, it&#39;s entirely possible that the sensor just picked up the motion at a different time on the empty open than on the other opens when people exit. I believe if there was something off with the sensors on the empty open video, they wouldn&#39;t have included it in the release. Or maybe I&#39;m missing your point on this?</p>

<p>Thank you for the walk through video you sent? What makes you say Kenneka was already in the kitchen before walking away from camera to the men&#39;s room then elevator area (then eventually towards kitchen)? Where would this video fit best in OP? Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the person who runs the Fractal Truth YouTube page, but he said those videos he posted were Fioa requested footage and that he is waiting on a second request of the entire 36 hour&#39;s of footage from that night.</p>

<p>So based on the time stamps on the videos he uploaded (because of the way they are all time stamped in th same manner, I believe them to be official...but that&#39;s just me) so the reason why I feel that the Kitchen video we are being shown is of Kenneka entering that kitchen a second time and walking back to the elevator in which she came from to begin with is because of the time stamps. I took a screen shot of the beginning of each video and it&#39;s time stamp, put them in order chronologically.</p>

<p>Toxicology found Alcohol, Caffeine epilepsy/migraine medication topiramate. Her mom claims she was never prescribed the medication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this I will update my post shortly. Really don&#39;t know what to think about all of this 😕</p>

<p>Have you seen the additional surveillance footage that has been going around? The source of it appears to be the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Dtu5_oblSn5EMy4uvS6XA">fractal truth</a> who claims to have filed an FOIA request to obtain the footage. How do you get an FOIA processed in less than 3 weeks for a case that is still under investigation?? HERE&#39;S A SCREENSHOT SHOWING THIS IS AGAINST THE LAW: <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/QfD8F">https://imgur.com/gallery/QfD8F</a></p>

<p>AND HERE&#39;S THE SOURCE OF THAT INFO: <a href="https://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exclusions">https://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exclusions</a></p>

<p>So either the videos are leaked or they are just more disinformation. </p>

Honestly it&#39;s to the point where I feel uncomfortable saying what I think happened because other researchers have dealt with some backlash. But I do feel comfortable saying I don&#39;t believe Kenneka randomly locked herself in a freezer. that <em>may</em> have been how she died but there are other factors at play we don&#39;t know about and may never know about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m pretty late to this but you (OP) just updated this yesterday, so I figure it’s okay to comment. </p>

<p>I absolutely believe that someone killed Kenneka Jenkins. </p>

<p>I’m actually really surprised at all the people saying “She clearly got drunk and locked herself in the freezer! There’s no mystery. Her family is just looking for a payday.” I’m surprised because when you truly look at all the sinister crimes that have happened in the U.S. in the past two centuries, you realize that there’s a LOT of truly dark, horrifying stuff that happens. Stalking, murder, rape...absolutely none of these are unique. They happen every day. So I wonder why people are so hell-bent on denying that something was done to Kenneka, <em>especially</em> when there is a plethora of evidence that points to something shady. </p>

<p>• Topiramate found in her body. Her mother said she was never prescribed this—so how did it get into her system? She could have taken it at the party, sure, but she also could have been given it. </p>

<p>• The area in general having known issues with organ harvestation</p>

<p>• The way she walking. Could it be that she was just drunk? Sure. But when I look at how she was walking, it also reminded me of how someone who’s been hit over the head walks. </p>

<p>• The fact that freezers don’t lock from the inside. If she accidentally wandered in and had the strength to open the door, why couldn’t she open the door from the inside? Did she decide just sit down and have a nap? Possibly. But it seems odd and unlikely, given how insistently she was wandering around before. </p>

<p>• How did she get to the back areas of the hotel? The back and basement of hotels tend to be a labyrinth and usually require passkeys or passcodes. Perhaps one or two areas didn’t have codes—but she got pretty damn deep into the hotel. So none of these areas were alarmed or had codes? Or she somehow managed to get in all by herself, while drunk to boot? </p>

<p>• And she wandered the back areas of the hotel for over an hour, whilst being caught on camera, without being seen by anyone? How? Does this hotel have no employees? </p>

<p>• It seems that there is someone’s arm that appears in one of the videos. I won’t speculate on this—just that it’s something people have noticed. </p>

<p>• The hotel took a week to release the videos. Why? There seems to be no acceptable reason for this. </p>

<p>• The hotel claimed there was no camera near the freezer...but cameras were seen by it. And that Andrew fella said he’d seen footage of people walking into the freezer. The idea that there wouldn’t be cameras near the freezer is absurd anyway because people like to monitor their inventory to prevent theft. </p>

<p>Our gut instincts are more powerful than we’d believe. I’ve seen all manner of tragic deaths which are clear that they were accidents and nothing more—and this does NOT feel like that. My gut feeling is absolutely telling me that someone who worked at the hotel murdered Kenneka. A few things off here and there would be one thing—but there are too many red flags in this story to ignore. And given how many wouldn’t-have-believed-it-till-it-was-proven murders and crimes we’ve seen in the U.S., I’m not about to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and or be naive and assume that terrible crimes don’t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to refrain from making any specific conclusions but I agree with a lot you have said. 1. No one would take topiramate willingly if they weren&#39;t prescribed. 2. Many discrepancies in surveillance footage. 3. Just watched interview (linked above under Oct 20) with her lawyer and he says all the other freezers in the hotel were locked. 4. Reaction from Kenneka&#39;s friends was strange- they called her mom after she was only missing for an hour? No one stayed at the party even though room was rented until 11-12pm (I&#39;m assuming) 5. Agree on how could she not have been seen roaming the halls all plastered/delirious like that? Are there no monitors for security to watch surveillance cameras? </p>

<p>There&#39;s tons more.. </p>

<p>Never too late to comment btw</p>

I don&#39;t know what the pill looks like but someone could&#39;ve told her it was Xanax/Molly/some other party drug and she was already drunk and not thinking straight and just took it. Or she could&#39;ve been roofied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post OP. I read on drugs.com topiramate can cause one to feel hot. I wonder how that got in her system? It could also explain her apparent lack of mobility, plus the alcohol of course. Also, how much topiramate was found in her system? Sad case but intriguing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to be glossed over that she had topiramate in her system but it wasn&#39;t prescribed to her. That medicine can make you drowsy and disoriented if you aren&#39;t used to it. Couple that with alcohol and it is worse. They need to be seeing if any of her friends from that night are prescribed that medication. She may have been drugged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they are not. And no they lock from the outside. However, they can sometimes stick shut from the suction of being closed. I&#39;m not saying this was the case but having been in industrial freezers and working in kitchens this has happened before in my world. Let me ask you this only because I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m at work so I can dig around so much. Was the freezer door locked when they found her?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alcohol is pretty nasty when it comes to cold weather.  Normally without the influence of alcohol your body when subjected to cold temps will start closing off blood flow to your extremities.  The effect is you feel colder as your extremities are getting colder, but it protects your core temp where all your organs and vital stuff is.  If you stay in the cold too long you&#39;ll lose extremities like toes, fingers, and ears, but you&#39;ll stay alive.  Assuming you don&#39;t stay out even longer and die.</p>

<p>With alcohol in your system your body doesn&#39;t stop sending blood to your extremities.  So you feel warmer than you normally would since heat is still getting to your extremities, but that also means you are losing heat much faster, and you can go into hypothermia much quicker.  So if you are way drunk you might not notice yourself go from warm to hypothermia, and once there you can actually start feeling warm again.  This is why you hear about people with hypothermia taking their cloths off.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read all the info in this yet as I just saved it for later, but it is entirely plausible that she went in that freezer, passed out drunk, and died from exposure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea. Maybe it&#39;s all orchestrated to look like Kenneka was walking in the freezer alone to keep this a simple &quot;suicide&quot; because they had footage of her being dragged there (hence her disheveled hair) and didn&#39;t want to tarnish the hotel..? This is all so odd. Also weird how her friends are nowhere in the surveillance footage except for the beginning when they&#39;re entering / going to the room. I don&#39;t think this is all a conspiracy for Kenneka&#39;s family to get a pay out, I think something serious happened here. I don&#39;t believe she could&#39;ve walked into that freezer, as drunk as she was (leaving the elevator footage) all by herself. </p>

<p>There is no way in that state she was in that she locked herself in those freezers. It&#39;s really silly to debate it when you can see that who ever made the videos were editing out the folks that were guiding her through that lower level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. If you believe it was the actor, I assume the whole point was to make people beleive she walked into the freezer and died, so why not make sure that&#39;s the ESSENTIAL part that needs to be included in the video?
