       I think anarchist should just come out and admit that if they ever successfully bring an anarchist state into being they will immediately all come out as communist and start their Bolshevik revolution again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not fooling anyone.  As antifa and blacklivesmatter constantly shit talk he police they turn around and dial 911 when they find themselves out numbered and overwhelmed.

      <p>
       There are bad cops, bad doctors, bad dentists, bad Carpenters, bad teachers, bad landlords, bad politicians and much more.  You're implied solution to bad cops is exactly like getting rid of all the children to cure childhood cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't see that for yourself then good luck to you out there.

       Well instead of attempting to find a solution for the police state, it seems your answer is to basically burn it down. unless you've got an idea that can actually fix the police departments. I'd enjoy hearing it.

       Your solution is to tell them to stop what they are doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a practical approach man, who do I take the fight to? The lower patrolmen, the detectives who won't divulge their first name, the records unit behind bulletproof glass who allows injury law firms to read accident reports and solicit to victims in the station, the Sargeant who is trying to keep his squad from fucking up and ending on the news, the captain and major who have every city official up their ass to lower the crime rate in the city to help their re-election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling them to stop won't solve the problem, it will require  an actual movement and action by us. What can we do to reform the system that has been corrupted?
      </p>
      <p>
       A watchdog group just demands action on one member who fucks up instead of focusing on your issue of protection, we need an actual group to go to police stations, protest, and investigate the higher ups in the department.

       It's possible to be opposed to the police state without being an anarchist. I want police to protect my human rights. I want a government that will do that. I am not an anarchist or communist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that that's not how it works in practice. Police are armed enforcers of the government, and whatever the government says goes. When the government collectively acts against the democratic will of the people, which the government does frequently, we get police brutality,

       This guy used to be a mod here too. It's pretty obvious when you read between the lines. He likes it when police brutalize people he does that like. He thinks he's safe in the face of increasing police militarization and surveillance.

       Exactly though, insurance now leads the field of investigation.

       They hire PI's to check in with police months down to see if anything has happened. Mostly, nothing has been done.

       There is an issue in our police forces where they cannot work and close cases, or they don't know how. I'm not sure.

       Not exactly sure where you're headed with this, but there are good cops out there doing good work, and risking their lives to help people who need it. Are there some bad ones? Sure. And they should be punished accordingly.

       All police officers enforce corrupt and unconstitutional laws. Go ask them, they set aside their own personal values and let lawyers and politicians sort out the morals.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer may be a fine person to bbq with. Once they put on the uniform though they are arrmed enforcers for criminals. Protection rackets usually have their own form of justice, and occasionally do serve justice, but their main purpose is always to take, not serve.

       Alright well you dont get to decide what good and bad are defined as. I dont have hatred for anyone and can you pmease highlight what part of common sense im ignoring?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, police do help people. The Mafia also helped people. I dont think anyone who puts aside their morals to act on behalf of another person (who is also a criminal) is objectively good.

       That is a reasonable position backes by logic, facts, and history. Get off your self-righteous throne and do some critical thinking, or at least dont disparage others for participating.

       Or you mean logic like implying you want police to enforce the law using their own "morals" and do things like choose not to help someone who is gay? Or a woman? Or white? Or black? Or Asian? Or old? Or young?

       Well, there are a few different ways to look at this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        If weed is illegal in your state, and you choose to possess it and get caught with it, is it the police's fault you made the decision? Does it make them a bad person that you chose to carry an illegal substance? Not really, no.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       *If weed being illegal is your complaint here, then I hope to hell you're actively working to change the law in your state and not just another bitter fucking hypocritical muppet sitting behind a keyboard on the conspiracy forums vomiting anti-establishment horseshit that sounds grandiose so you can feel like you're actually doing something about the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I'm all for legalization of marijuana. However, until it is legalized, I choose not to smoke it, carry it, or sell it because I'm a reasonable human being that doesn't want his life ruined by a "bag of weed".

       Serious answer: What's your definition of immoral? Who gets to decide what's moral or immoral? The cop? The criminal? You?
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone signs up to be a cop, they sign up to enforce the law, not interpret it. If someone believes the laws to be immoral, and they wish to not enforce them, then they shouldn't be a cop.

       So a theoretical mandate that demands people be arrested for refusing vaccines, refusing to hand children over for "re-education", refusing to have abortions under some extreme authoritarian population control - all those are fine for a cop to do because they are now "the law"?

       Strictly hypothetically speaking, if those laws were passed and someone does not want to uphold them, then they shouldn't be a police officer. I'm not really sure how that's confusing.

       But they also enforce the good laws, like "don't murder people" and "don't steal shit". If you don't like that they have to enforce unjust laws like "don't smoke weed", that's a bummer, but the whole point of a civilized law-abiding society is that no one person gets to decide what is legal and what is not.

       Honestly, you can blame hardnosed dickheadedness on the new breed of millennial cops, they won't tell you their first name and are perfect representations of the blind support the police force wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good cops are getting pushed out, they only want ladder climbers and yes men in the new police order. They don't want detectives to talk to the community and actually solve the cases, they run some pawn shop checks, call the victim and suspect, and if nothing really comes about they'll drop it. That's the new system, so insure your shit now because if it's taken it ain't going to get found unless you have a camera system and the name of who did it.

       It's not all police, it's the ones in charge at the top of each force that are to blame.

       It's public knowledge that police officers only exist to protect government property and generate money for the state. They are under no obligation to protect citizens and they don't, nor do they help defuse any situation they are called to, they are only trained to escalate.

       You said the entire US police force is corrupt, and that’s statistically impossible. Everything is on a spectrum, and that spectrum ranges from corrupt LEO -&gt; people who join LE because they genuinely want to help people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a problem with the US police force in general? Absolutely. No denying it.

       The problem I have with you, is that you’re unwilling to see that claiming 100% of anything is anything shows a pretty basic lack of common sense, coupled with your quickness to slam people with nazi references and labels in some kind of effort to discredit their argument shows you’re scared shitless to have anyone challenge your assertions because you know you can’t possibly defend them logically.

       No, I agree with the fact that there is a problem with how the law is being enforced in this country and I think there are definitely bad actors, as have been proven time and time again.

       There is a middle ground between “all law enforcement is corrupt” and “blue lives matter”.

       And I'm fine with advocating for it, but no reasonable human being is going to take anyone seriously who says, "All cops are bad!" because it's statistically untrue, unfounded, and defies logic or common sense.

       I agree with that, but who was saying 100% all cops are bad? The post was more about the "Blue Lives Matter" and police apologists. Let's be real. Blue lives matter doesnt mean you support police. It means you are in contradiction to black lives matter, because there never was a blue lives matter until they divided us into these ridiculous sides.

       Blue Lives Matter is a countermovement in response to Black Lives Matter in the United States. It was started after the killings of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York, on December 20, 2014, after they were ambushed in their patrol car. Blue Lives Matter was formed in reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to end police brutality against the African American community.[1]

       Maybe from your perspective. As others have pointed out, you're painting broad strokes here. Yes, a police state requires police to function. My car requires tires to function. But if I put a pile of tires in my garage, that doesn't mean I have a car.

       Like ole flytape down at the bottom of the thread, you can't compare the police to inanimate objects. The police in general in the U.S. have a culture problem the same way Muslim countries have a problem with the growth and proliferation of terrorism. There's a culture of opposition within departments that is fueled by increased militarization and expanded powers. The lack of repercussions for abuse has cemented this culture to the point that departments will cover up evidence and lie in the face of public outcry.

       I'm not an anarchist. The police have a culture of opposition with the communities they patrol. Militarization of police needs to be stopped, surveillance needs to be stopped, and community policing needs to make a resurgence. Take a look at the protectandserve sub - it's somehow always the public's fault when a skiddish cop pulls the trigger.

       Culture of opposition is a nice way of saying that all police are bad and against the population. They aren't, and it isn't their fault that they aren't speaking up, they'll lose their job bringing grief to the department.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ever been in a police academy? Or anything like that?
I'm actually curious how much you know about police over what you seen on the news?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually pretty easy to see what is wrong if you actually communicate and immerse yourself in the system to see the cracks. The ladder climbers who've never been involved in real 
Investigations, who pass murders and rape cases along so they can study their promotional exam. Those are the ones militarizing the police, because they are scared. They are at the top now, we've crafted a system where their behavior is promoted, while the ones who actually work are too busy to even have time to give a shit. Especially if they have an important open case which will need assistance from higher up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you on most your points by the way, but if community policing needs to come back, how can it if they are in a culture of opposition?

       I agree with most of your points. It's greedy and corrupt leadership that both pockets DAs, buys surplus military hardware, and pulls strings. That may or may not be the reason that bad eggs are fired then get employment one district over or why no cop every seems to be charged, no matter how many of their own rules they break.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not nearly well read into the issues as I ought to be, but I feel that community policing is the first step to restore trust between both police and the communities they serve. There's a divide and suspicion on both sides. Short sighted laws that don't take into account the experience learned on the streets like search and frisk serve to alienate good police from good citizens.

       David Simon is one of the best resources for inner city police operations. He was a journalist in Baltimore and created The Wire.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does a really good job cutting the divide on what a good police officer is compared to the ladder climbers and nepotism laden jackwagons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about a good police officer, he won't care for protests over a bad officer. He'll ONLY be concerned with how it will effect his job. Will his CI's close up and quit talking to him? And things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good cops are the ones you don't see at police/community meetings, they are the ones assigned cases while those guys figure out which ad campaign to spend money on for recruitment and to end violence in their areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got a deal in my state with a constable who has done something so henious that he has basically ruined a blind/deaf guy's life. However the whole town has turned against the guy based on the Constable's well crafted story, which has more holes in it than Swiss but somehow a judge and jury just fast tracked it. It's hard to fight perception when the town wants to believe something so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       That guy is a sheriff now.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fix the system, we've got to fight for innocent until proven guilty, we've got to end PR firms doing jury selection for cities, we've got cut off the top brass from local and federal government (not completely, but FBI and CIA are helping shape the force mainly FBI unless you believe Jesse Ventura), not completely but at least make purchases based on the will of the people over sales in military surplus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pulling over vehicles for license plate lights out in junky cars is not probable cause enough to hassle someone in poverty, and on that subject fine loops. Have you ever seen those tax places that have the lady dressed as the statue of liberty around tax season?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those establishments are designed for these fine loops. Once a guy gets run up on his shitty car he'll have to pay the fine and then repair the vehicle. So he goes to this tax place to get sorted, they charge him 200$ and get him a return to pay the fine. Fines paid but he cannot repair the vehicle. Cycle continues.but the fine rate increases, now this guy is incarcerated because he can't afford the 3000 dollar fine now. These local forces are feeding off these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep reading on it though man, I do believe police reform has to happen within the next 10 years or it's going to blow up in all our faces.

       I'll definitely read up on some of Simon's writing. Skimming through his work, it seems interesting and insightful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read about the debt cycle caused by certain policing practices. It basically amounts to debtor's prison all over again, especially to the abject poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking through it, I feel like there are a lot of avenues to affect change, but they sort of have to be pursued concurrently... I feel a lot of change needs to come from within police forces. Good cops ought to speak up about abuses or injustices. More than that, we need a system where those who speak out or whistleblow don't have their careers destroyed by cohesive corrupt departments that force out anyone who speaks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe most important, people who aren't affected by oppressive policing need to speak out and lobby for changes in policing habits like the elimination of fine loops. Civil forfeiture needs to be ended for small amounts of money that amount to theft of citizens. Most of the public doesn't care because they aren't affected by these practices, but that has to change. Especially on reddit, I always see people jumping to assume victims of police violence were to blame. Officers are of course forced to make judgment calls, but too often they shoot simply because they are spooked or because they approach a situation with forgone assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the ball has started rolling with body cams though, and I'm looking forward to seeing the system slowly reformed.

       People's perceptions are the hardest thing to break or deal with whenever police issues arise, because everyone knows someone who ended up in law enforcement but they don't really know the extent of how it actually works up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you there on body cams, it is a step in the right direction. We have get FOIA's in place to get that footage out sooner though, like the nurse in Colorado. That video took over a month to release after the accident.
