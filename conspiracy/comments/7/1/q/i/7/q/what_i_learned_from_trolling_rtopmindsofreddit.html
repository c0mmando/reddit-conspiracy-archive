       This headline (and submission*) is a parody of a current top r/TopMindsOfReddit submission. I would never "troll" a subreddit for 3 years because I am not a complete and utter failure of a human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'd like to discuss what I learned about the TopMindsOfReddit community and it's users. I'll break it down into separate categories for a more entertaining and educational read. Open

       <strong>
        Critical Thinking is for Dummies.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been many, many absurd posts mocking critical thinking over the past years so I'm just going to bullet point some major conspiracies and the reaction of the TopMindsOfReddit:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         9/11 - TopMinds have see no issue with a group of barely trained Middle Eastern men managing to highjack two planes, with box cutters, with such pinpoint precision that three NYC buildings then conveniently collapsed into their own footprints. These terrorist also managed to "fly a plane", inches above the ground, directly into the Pentagon, one of the most secure and monitored area of the entire country, but no footage of that plane even entering DC airspace exists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Elite Pedophile Rings - TopMinds thinks that the idea of royalty and those in power having sex slaves is absurd. Those who have documented the history of civilization know otherwise. But TopMinds knows that it totally doesn't happen anymore because those in power pinky-sweared that they stopped.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Science vs. $cience - TopMinds clearly doesn't understand that one of the main pillars of the scientific method is to undergo criticism and scrutiny. Which is why TopMinds also doesn't understand the difference between real science and $cience.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Information Manipulation - TopMinds don't understand basic concepts like advertising, PR, and propaganda because most of them are very young and have no experience as working adults.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vaccines - TopMinds believes that r/conspiracy believes, and I quote: "diseases aren't really a thing". These are the kinds of hyperbolic conclusions that they must cling to in order to feel superior.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NASA - TopMinds knows that everything NASA says is true because government agencies never lie. Anyone who questions any aspect of anything NASA presents clearly believes "the world in flat" and "Earth is run by lizards".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Flat-earth - TopMinds believes that every single person in r/conspiracy literally thinks the Earth is flat because a handful of people post about it (many are likely trolls from their own sub).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Seth Rich - TopMinds believes that only one of two options is possible: 1) Hillary Clinton literally murdered Seth Rich with her bare hands; or 2) Hillary was at her local shelter washing the feet of the poor
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Donald Trump - Sorting by top "all time" you can easily see that TopMinds are absolutely obsessed with Donald Trump. Like the once fashionable "enoughTrumpspam" subreddit, TopMinds obsess over him so much that they actually become the very thing that they are mocking.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mainstream Media - the gospel of truth for a TopMinds user
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         False Flags - Another things proven many times over by documented history, but TopMinds believe that people in power are totally past that kind of behavior and anyone who questions anything that ever happens deserves to be shamed for it.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The "TopMinds"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The real meat and potatoes of the subreddit. The things that sticks out for me the most is the dangerous level of superiority, and I do not say this in a mocking or insulting way. The sheer volume of users that have clear and obvious signs of a superiority complex is absolutely striking. While the desperate need to feel superior is the classic trademark of the TopMinds community, it goes above and beyond in too many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dunning–Kruger effect. Is r/TopMindsofReddit made up of people suffering from this? The answer is undeniably yes. "The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is."
      </p>
      <p>
       They're just smarter than everyone else, that's why they're so enlightened that they needed to create their own personal safe-space echo-chamber to seek validation from one another. They desperately seek acceptance from one another and it is truly interesting to watch a lone member fall into confusion when he or she accidentally steps out of whatever circlejerk the majority has decided is "true". They truly believe that they are enlightened enough to completely have a grip on everything about every aspect of reality and the idea of deeper meaning scares them, probably because of the difficulty presented by getting their echo-chamber to accept it. They have it all figured it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to keep in mind is that reddit is full of very young and very impressionable minds. A subreddit like TopMinds or Conspiratard is going to seem very attractive to that teenager who "has it all figured out" or that dead-beat adult who peaked in high school and still desperately clings to those power dynamics. When you add the very obvious signs of inflated ego and the Dunning–Kruger effect than the result is a subreddit like TopMindsofReddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is that they are even projecting the term "Top Minds" based on their own inferiority complex. Because by ironically calling the conspiracy community the "Top Minds" the unspoken conclusion would be that the members of TopMindsofReddit are actually "smarter" and "better" than them. Another way to put it is that members of TopMindsofReddit feel threatened or challenged. They mock the term "Top Minds" on their perceived opponent because they feel that they
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       deserve that title. But again, don't expect any of them to understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Community Itself
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wew boi. They are deeply challenged by the motto "question everything and always seek proof", because the only way to keep their manufactured validation-chamber intact is to keep everything as simple and as mainstream as humanly possible . If you question a mainstream narrative, you are ironically called a "Top Mind". To ask for further proof within a mainstream narrative is the ultimate sin in r/TopMindsofReddit, as has been demonstrated by various users. Many young, impressionable members of that sub suddenly find themselves being gang-downvoted for stepping out of line. Sadly, I doubt any of them even understand the psychology behind it. But they learn their lesson and the TopMinds circlejerk presses on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills. TopMinds are so lacking in critical thinking and self-awareness, that they mock r/conspiracy users for being worried about shills while TopMinds have literally created an entire subreddit dedicated to brigading conspiracy threads. They make submissions like "What I learned from trolling r/conspiracy for 3 years" and then turn around in the same breath and call us paranoid for believing that they are trolling and harassing our threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       These mental gymnastics are always a favorite part of that community. Every few hours they make a new thread which is essentially a "call to action" to attack a discussion that they feel threatened by. Then they will all flood over there and spread various types of hyperbole and nonsense, while all secretly having a laugh at how "cool" it is going to be to meet up later back at the base to give each other high-fives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony of course is that many times they are actually seeing their own hyperbole and comments designed to be "something a crazy conspiracy theorist would say" and then they are actually using those comments as examples or proof of how "crazy" conspiracy theorist are. Completely oblivious to the fact that they themselves are the ones going over-the-top pretending to be lunatics. Again, the Dunning–Kruger effect seems to keep them oblivious to these truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, TopMinds see a couple random posts saying "Sept 23rd is Doomsday" and attribute this nonsense to an entire subreddit of a half-million people. They pat each other on the back over how all 490k+ subscribers have clearly "lost it" and have all quit their jobs to work full time on their underground bunkers. These are the kinds of exaggerations needed in order to feel superior and feed those immature monster egos. I used to feel sorry for them until I realized that the kinds of people who would create a subreddit just to mock and brigade a place that encourages thinking outside-of-the-box... well, I guess being that way is really a punishment in and of itself.

       You hit the nail with Dunning-kruger, whewie. Ya, you do a good job of poking fun at the moist embryonic sock monster that is TMOR, but this is actually a pretty good analysis. Although you may be right about some of them being relatively young, leadership has been on reddit the better part of a decade. They have deep roots in internet cancer going all the way back to somethingaweful.

       Thanks for everything you've done and have endured for this sub, Flytape! You are a personal hero of mine.  Several months ago I came across a post in /new which contained conversation between you and other mods and it outlined some very severe problems brewing with the mod team.  That post disappeared in under 2 minutes, never to be seen again. That was my first warning that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       had fallen prey to regulatory capture.

       Thanks for everything you've done and have endured for this sub, Flytape! You are a personal hero of mine.  Several months ago I came across a post in /new which contained conversation between you and other mods and it outlined some very severe problems brewing with the mod team.  That post disappeared in under 2 minutes, never to be seen again. That was my first warning that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       had fallen prey to regulatory capture.

        They are young. No experience in the real world.

       The only problem with your post is your collectivization of the entire sub. I've never visited, so you could very well be correct that every single user in the sub fits your description. I just prefer to judge each individual based on the content of their character instead of the group. But that logic would ruin your thesis, so... BRAVO!

       Indeed, I also tend to stay away from generalizations and gauge a person's individual worth rather than the company they keep, although can be synonymous in many cases, birds of a feather and all that.

       I'm pretty sure that OP overused generalizations to imitate the writing style of the TMOR post he linked to.

       So I just took your advice and checked out the sub... scrolled down a bit, clicked a few links... it looks like nothing more than an artifically created pro-authoritarian ideology sub. As if there aren't enough of those on reddit already.

       yeah well you can spend your time trying to reinforce your worldview or you can try to expand your horizons with people that enjoy talking about crazy ass shit.  the people that tend to be worried about what other people think are the same people who tend to try to control what other people think. one is a monoculture the other a garden.  pick which one you want.  the monoculture, btw, always collapses.

       Aha, so this your new account! I was wondering when you would show up again after your last three (or is it four? ) accounts were all banned.

       For anyone who isn't familiar, this is the guy who was banned for:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Sending phishing links to doxx users he thought were shills
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Repeatedly calling everyone who disagrees with him a shill
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Trying to organize a brigade in
       <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">
        /r/ConspiracyRight
       </a>
       to spam this sub and others with comments pretending to be liberal shills
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Admitting to already doing /#3 at least once or twice before.

       Hey now, this is only my 3rd. But regardless, I love how you guys keep a list of the things I've done to rustle your jimmies and then spin them in typical delusional fashion.

       No way, this has to be at least your fourth. You went through two different accounts during your attempted brigade and you had a third that was banned during the doxxing. If those are what you consider "rustling jimmies" then it's completely understandable why you were banned. What I don't understand is why you are so blatant about it and why you so willingly admit to ban evasion.

       You keep saying "you guys" like I'm part of some massive group working against you. You've broken the rules countless times and been
       <em>
        suspended
       </em>
       for it every time. The problem here isn't other people, it's you. And whether it's a ban or a suspension, you are still evading it by coming back to the same subs with numerous alt accounts.

       Oh, did you miss the explanation for that? It was all debunked. The Amazon IPs were from Reddit's spam filter. Regular, well known users were getting the exact same Amazon IP address when sending the links to themselves and each other. Ferf still denies this and leaves that part out when he reposts the results but it was all explained in depth in the original post. And yes posting people's IP address is still considered doxxing. It's revealing identifying information about a user.

       That's fine, but it's still against the rules. Plus there was the whole brigade thing. This sub spends a lot of time complaining about brigades and has removed numerous posts due to "brigading" in the past. And now we have a user trying to organize a brigade with alts, fake accounts, and vote bots and pose it as a specific political group doing it all. And he admitted to doing "something similar" in the past. So all of these brigades in the past could have been from him for all we know just to get posts removed.

       Are you reading through that thread too? No, I don't ever remember him ranting about Jews or how Germany should have won WWII before now. This sort of fits with a weird theory I have that this guy is actually

       I do. I think it's hysterical. I've never seen them link to something that is decently sourced and possible to believe. It's all insane conjecture and pizza parties. You can't blame other people for the actions of users egged on by lunacy at the top.

       Yes I can. Nobody outsa gun to these users' heads and forces them to link here and berate and ridicule our userbase.  The blame lies solely on them and their shitty attitudes and shitty parents (most likely).

       It is a contradiction of principles, and as such is very ugly, but it's a common occurrence, these days. Intentional ignorance, that is. It used to be the definition of stupidity, but it was too potent a word so it was changed. You might understand it by "selective reasoning" or "bias", but it's weird how I have to explain that, considering, you know, you're still doing it.

       It's about conducting ourselves at a standard. r/conspiracy is about facts and reasoning and certainly not about retarded troll/flame warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their mockery is typical denial, from real people or shills it doesn't matter. We talk here about conspiracies and maintain a high intellectual standard, and that speaks for itself.

       Basically, do not click on any of those links and proceed to post or upvote/downvote in them.  Mods/admins can see that you were directed there from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and they are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       ban-happy against
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users for "vote brigading" (though not so much against TopMinds users whose entire subreddit is dedicated to brigading us).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to go into those threads and upvote/downvote, use the search bar or type in the URL.  I've been banned a whole bunch of times for up/downvoting a few comments and it took me a while to figure out what the hell was going on.

       Just discovered TMOR recently. There's definitely something pathetic about an r/ whose sole purpose is to feel Superior to another r/.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really disgusting about it is that they claim r/conspiracy is filled with the mentally ill, but the make fun of them anyway. So from their perspective, TMOR exists to make fun of the mentally ill.

       ... many people (although fewer than we are lead to believe) would feel immense hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the difference? Cognitive dissonance. One intuitively knows the second self-evident statment to be true; in the case it goes against indoctrinated beliefs, the brain short-circuits and produces hostility. It is a common occurence with people that
       <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/aristotle100584.html">
        disagree with Aristotle.
       </a>
       Their beliefs are tied to their identity, so by challenging them one is attacking who they (think they) are.

       This explains the TMoR phenomenon. Or at least the unpaid people who participate in that sub.

       I gather it's quite common internet parlance to mock, character assassinate and undermine someone's point by saying "hur dur did you forget to take you meds bro" while being the most abusive, trolling and reactionary POS as poss. never addressing the conversation at hand but basically bullying and abusing users you disagree with on the alluded to grounds that they need psychiatric medications...........and it's OK to mock them for it.....cunts either way.

       "For example, TopMinds see a couple random posts saying "Sept 23rd is Doomsday" and attribute this nonsense to an entire subreddit of a half-million people." - this is the worst part about being a truth seeker, your constantly fighting off the theories that go too far.

       There is nothing wrong with theories like that. We are exploring ideas here. The problem is the perception that just because we talk about these things, we 100% believe them. And some people do sure, but I think most of us are extremely skeptical, and have mastered the skill of consideration without belief. Whereas TMOR has mastered belief without consideration.

       I find that in speaking to people in a respectful and deferent way, in a way that doesn't mock or belittle them, there are actually very few people that refuse to believe that there isn't at least some dodgy crap going on behind closed doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your hardcore 'topmind' type is about as rare as the rabid "absolutely everything is the work of satan" (or whatever) "total" conspiracy theorist. Most people just don't like thinking about how fucked everything is. The key is in talking about it in a way that doesn't force them to see themselves as vulnerable in order to accept it. I.e., 911 being an inside job as a conspiracy theory is much easier to convince people of if it's framed in a way that doesn't introduce the idea that the government is an all-powerful evil entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the story of 9/11 – in terms of the best efforts made to work out what really happened – told in the form of a black comedy. It would probably be a lot more convincing, and god wouldn't the pathos be a killer!

       Then why is anyone who brings up ties between the Trump campaign/administration and Russia is banned? And all posts that aren't pro-Trump on the Russia issue are deleted? Why is the mother of all possible conspiracies not allowed to be discussed in a conspiracy sub?

       The worst part about being a truth seeker is having your mods and yourself placed on Top Minds of Reddit's Hall of Fame hit list. Last year, 3 mods of
       <a href="/r/electromagnetics">
        /r/electromagnetics
       </a>
       were placed on Hall of Fame 2.0. Drew infiltrators, vote brigading, report as spam brigading, cyberstalking and bullying in other subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, I reported to the admins FOUR mods of Top Minds of Reddit and one subscriber cyberstalking and bullying me in
       <a href="/r/documentaries">
        /r/documentaries
       </a>
       . For two years, I have reported vote brigading, report as spam brigading and harassment by TMOR. The admins have yet to ban a mod or subscriber of TMOR.

       The whole flat earth thing is so strange to me. I suggested to somebody once on Facebook that the science might be unsettled on anthropogenic climate change, and was immediately branded a flat earther. So strange. Can people question anything anymore without being tacked on to the extremes? It seems like every conspiracy theorist is now a flat earther, and every conservative is a Nazi, etc. Crazy times ahead.

        In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing that Epstein's and comes off badly where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)

       From CIA Document 1035-960 regarding conspiracy theories on the JFK assassination. Was CIA behind Edward Epstein's book
       <em>
        Inquest
       </em>
       ? Maybe, maybe not. But what is clear is that they did prefer his particular book as a target of their efforts to discredit
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       alternative theories around the assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, I think it's reasonable to speculate that they would still be using a similar tactic, or variations on the theme, of either manufacturing or elevating particular theories as a means to taint via guilt by association any theory that strays too far from the current Overton window. If the truth cannot be suppressed, it must at least be obfuscated or ridiculed.

       The sad part is that the Earth actually is flat and conspiracy types are the most likely to scoff at it.  The entire point of the Occult (Copernicus was a sun worshiper, Newton was deep into the Occult etc.) creating the spinning ball illusion over the past 500 years was to hide the existence of God by discrediting the Bible.  The biggest conspiracy of them all is that the King James Bible is 100% literally true and the Satan worshiping world elite doesn't want you to know that.  They want you to know anything but that.

       Okay, I would say my mind is partially open to the flat earth stuff. Could you point me to where in the bible God/Jesus/other alludes to the Earth being flat? Otherwise, how do you figure the spinning ball was created to hide the existence of God?
      </p>

       I wouldn't focus on the whole "flat" thing.  It's more about the lie than the whole flat thing.  I would suggest you start here to get an idea of what this is all about.  This channel like almost every flat earth resource is a gatekeeper of their own but he presents the best information from a Biblical perspective.   You just won't figure out how to get saved from him.  If you ever get to that point PM me:

       People have different levels at which we will believe something, and different interests they want to focus on. You may think it's the biggest conspiracy. Others don't. I went through the satanic fear mongering in the 80's.

       I played D&amp;D and didn't sacrifice my family. They were going after kids with an imagination, or not quite in the main stream social circles. It was a psyop attempting to get people to think they were fucked up or unknowingly worshiping satan. Which at the time had a lot more weight, our parent's went to church, we were brainwashed into thinking that playing D&amp;D would somehow makes us satanic and kill people. The 80's satan craze.

       I think the key to this was when Obama mentioned it. That's what seals the deal for me that it's gov planted disinfo. Remember the 2008 stock market crash? I remember Bush himself saying at a white house press briefing that it was a good time to buy stocks, the Fed and US gov shortly after bailed out the global banking system and introduced never seen before amounts of liquidity creating bubbles in all asset classes.

       I think it's easier to explain than that. Subreddits are communities. Opinions are expressed, and if they are responded to positively, people are going to make an association of that thing with that subReddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last example is easier, but I think it would be more accurate with Trump supporters than conservatives. r/t_d is constantly posting hateful things about Mexicans, Muslims, and every other person of color, under the guise of illegals, immigrants, and terrorists. But the thing is, it's simply people of color under a questionable reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's not only accepted, but actually desired there, people make the association with racism/Nazism. How did Germany become Nazi/white only in their views? They wanted to get rid of any person of color, and probably used similar reasons early on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think less people make assumptions that conspiracy people are flat Earth people, unless they really haven't been exposed to anything but that kind of conspiracy. I also think a lot of things posted here are much more acceptable to the general population and only truly crazy shit like flat Earth strikes people as true conspiracy. I'm talking general population, not the small area that is top minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I'm just giving a different viewpoint to yours.

       Why are we tiptoeing around the truth? Reddit created a series of safe space rules 2 years ago that it uses to target users whom its employees are ideologically against. Just assume that if someone is harassing you and your values aren't aligned with the employees that you won't be protected and that you'll have a  target on your back when you try to have a voice of your own. This is the same site that banned the head mod of the largest alternative bernie sanders subreddit (main one is corrupt) for fucking downvoting a user who was spamming the subreddit. And of course the spammer was from topmindsoffaggotreddit.

       Mark dan is just a user... posting in a sub that is light on censorship. They don’t define the sub nor the other users who post here. Equating his evident racism with blanket coverage across the entire sub, is the kinda bullshit, lazyass strawmen you can expect from a sub designed to mock critical thinking.

       Spot on, couldn't have said it better myself. I also couldn't help but notice their unwarranted sense of superiority and inability to critically think. They take the word of the government, the media, and those in positions of authority as the gospel.

       I dunno mate shits looking fucked up. Lots of testimonies from reputable people. At least the satanic ritual aspect of it seems real. It can easily be said the deep state is running it as a blackmail system but then again we have so much history of UFOs going all the way back to ancient times before we would have had the tech like we do in area 51 now.

       I also read a book about mushrooms and hullicegens once and some missionary was telling a story how he was offered some in South America and he hullucinated lizzard people and parts of the bible that he only read and discovered later. His visions matched what was written before he read it. I'm not sure why I'm even mentioning this but I thought it was kind of fascinating.

       "Every few hours they make a new thread which is essentially a "call to action" to attack a discussion that they feel threatened by. Then they will all flood over there and spread various types of hyperbole and nonsense, while all secretly having a laugh at how "cool" it is going to be to meet up later back at the base to give each other high-fives.
The irony of course is that many times they are actually seeing their own hyperbole and comments designed to be "something a crazy conspiracy theorist would say" and then they are actually using those comments as examples or proof of how "crazy" conspiracy theorist are. Completely oblivious to the fact that they themselves are the ones going over-the-top pretending to be lunatics."

       Their jobs? Explain how that makes sense? I think people here and on 4chan take themselves too seriously, you aren't being watched, most of the internet isn't aware of Reddit, or you, or care what anyone here has to say even if they did know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's people pointing out bullshit. Which is good. I like it when I see it done in comments here, rather than everyone just agree. Conversations evolve thru their differences of opinion more than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people need to develop thicker skin. So what someone thinks something you said is stupid, maybe it is, adapt or move on. Assume they're just some loser living in their moms basement, that's what the OP did.

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue (formerly Correct the Record) and Media Matters. They are all run by David Brock. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       While it's certainly possible it may be jobs for some of them, I know for a fact at least one user (I can only assume many more) is not paid, not an angsty teenager or any of the other things being claimed here, as I personally know them. I really really dislike that sub and others like it, but I personally believe the user base there is genuine in their beliefs.

       Is everything a conspiracy? You don't believe that a group of thousands of people on the internet can gather in a forum and make posts about something they all agree/disagree with without it being some sort of hyper organized group of people paid to belittle you? How is topminds any different than any other subreddit, a collection of like minded people who relate over similar views?

       LSC used to be about something, couple of years back.

       It was filled with people being angry about the excesses of consumer culture and the crimes of globalization, with a healthy dose of workers solidarity.

       Just remember while a lot of conspiracies are certainly real and have truth to them, most everyone is filled with all sorts of distortions and is acting on their own belief systems and knowledge and doing what they think best. Basically, have fun, learn as much as you can about topics that interest you, but try not to get too disturbed by them or caught up in what the mainstream world thinks of any of these ideas. After all, the mainstream world doesn't know shit :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be afraid to talk about conspiracies either or subjects you have questions about. We are all working towards finding whatever truth we are seeking about whatever subjects we feel we have been lied to about, and IMO that is making the world a better place.

       I'm seeing more and more that it is not an intellectual thing, but actually genetics. that those 'sheep' are genetically programmed to fit into a society, and so are predisposed to not question any sort of consensus. this is their wired survival mechanism. whereas we lovely bunch do not give a fuck about the opinion of the hive mind.

        The real meat and potatoes of the subreddit. The things that sticks out for me the most is the dangerous level of superiority, and I do not say this in a mocking or insulting way. The sheer volume of users that have clear and obvious signs of a superiority complex is absolutely striking. While the desperate need to feel superior is the classic trademark of the TopMinds community, it goes above and beyond in too many people.

       This is an ironic sentiment from a sub that feels they are the most enlightened group around and everyone is either a shill, closed minded or complicit.

       So you're just going to ignore the fact that the sole reason TMoR exists is to mock people they view as "lesser"? You'd have a point if conspiracy existed just to mock people we thought we were smarter than.

       I'm not ignoring it. At least they are upfront with their mockery. That whole sub is seemingly mocking dumb things people say/do.

      <p>
       Its hypocritical however to pretend the same thing here does not happen. If anyone pushes against the grain they are labeled a shill, a bot, dumb, closed minded, etc.
Hell depending on which conspiracy you could be labeled a pedophile. All with a smug since of self righteousness.

       You are ignoring it. You're using some things some users say as proof that our sub, as a whole, is hypocritical. That's an entirely different thing than TMoR existing
       <em>
        solely
       </em>
       for the purpose of mocking people they think are dumb.

       Going to a store where someone is robbing it is a lot different than going to a store in order to rob it. Surely you understand that difference?

       Thats a false equivalency and you are making yourself out to be a victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the threads there, they pick and choose posts that they find ludicrous and make fun of it. Whilst people here labels users that disagree with them mocking names. The thread that this particular thread is mocking even states that many do not feel all thoughts here are dumb or all conspiracies are without merit. But some are off the wall. And looking again, not all the ones they make fun of come from this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Topics here, also do the same thing. In the pizzagate thread, those who feel that the pizzagate theory was dumb are labeled pedos by some. Some who talk about trump are called shills and a whole bunch of 'muh russsia' bs. The flat earthers are thoroughly maligned here (though i cant say its unwarranted).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who feels any msm (which encompasses any and everything apparently) has a valid point is an auto shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get attacked in this sub quite a bit without so much of a second thought. But god forbid a select few posts that are off the wall get made fun of?

       C'mon, thats just feelings being hurt. And you can tell its feelings because TMOR is being made to be a giant conspiratorial mega demon that deserves its own sticky, as opposed to just a bunch of douchehats  raggin.

       People get "attacked" when they come to this sub and post. We do not go out fishing for other people to mock. In fact, this may be the only thread of it's kind I've ever seen. Yet this post is all you see on TMoR.
      </p>

       You are trying to say we're the same, we're not. TMoR exists to mock, we exist and sometimes mock. Again, two completely different things which you don't seem to want to acknowledge.

       It is because this sub is full of very diverse folks with all sorts of opinions. From investigative journalists to your quintessential crack-pot flat earther. We all know that folks generally judge the weakest link of the whole chain, so as a result when many come here, all they see is draco aliens on the flat earth floating in the astral plane.

       Well except Trump. He gets the blame for everything. These useless TMOR creeps are enabling criminals to sweep their crimes under the rag. All swept in one shot and all we need is a scape goat and a bunch of idiots to go along with the narrative. I'm not saying Trump is all that innocent but usually the loudest mouths are usually the same ones who can't see how Hillary or Obama could be evil at all. They follow MSM and don't think a deep state exists yet they think themselves so highly opinionated because they simply cannot see past the theatre they are part of. So they feel proud to be that character of the show. It gives them confidence. But that's all they are, a character, and they'll do anything in their power to stay in that comfort and keep people away from truly discovering themselves, because the more people are part of their bubble, the longer they can keep their illusion going. I don't blame everyone who's caught up in the spell but these people really go out of their way to make sure the illusion keeps going. They don't even get paid to troll I'd bet. It's amazing seeing an army of dedicated authoritarian people ready to do follow criminal leaders at will and even go out of their way to defend their narratives. It really is something. Are they cowards if they can't see things for what they are and not what they appear to be? I think they are just scared and are complelty weak minded individuals because of the sheer resistance they show.

       A lot of my friends are too but they are cool for the most part. However TMOR take it to a whole new level of resistance by resorting to harassment, stalking and bullying people because they believe in some conspiracies in a dedicated and collaborated matter.

       Absolutely right. I'd say people educated beyond their intelligence are way more nefarious than ignorant simpletons with no pretension of knowledge. Pseudo-erudites, they're a modern scourge; knowing too many words for one's capacity to handle them leads to fanaticism and bigotry.

       That's what the socialization of higher education will do. Someone who would have been happy and healthy as a janitor now lives a life of misery as an diplomat or a journalist.

       u/polkadotgirl has been stalked across Reddit by r/TopMindsOfReddit contributors.  They also make posts mocking her almost on  a daily basis.  She created r/conspiracyundone so that users will not be attacked like she is attacked.  The first rule of the sub is no topmindsofreddit users.  If this post resonated with you, we would love to see you on r/conspiracyundone.  :)

       Their targeted harassment of her is ignominous. I still don't get why they'd pick her rather than anyone else. Everything I saw her post was always quite reasonable. Do they have an overt reason for their ire agaist her?

       I think they are trying to discourage her from contributing to Reddit because she resonates with a lot of people.  She actually responds to them as well to defend herself and in hopes that she can help them to see her side.

       To add to what you said, I've never seen anyone get stalked like that here before. It's rather harassing and seeing it first hand is really eye opening.

       You are taking things out of context and then over generalizing them.  Pulling the Nazi card has been a consistent pattern with shills, top minds, and/or Antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       You posted what I deemed to be a troll post designed to make others not to take the content in our sub seriously.  There were plenty of people in the community that wanted you to be banned as they too deemed you to be a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think she wanted others to voice their opinion on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, people can try out the sub and see how it goes instead of taking either of our word for it.  What does it matter if you get banned from a sub you don't care about anyways?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think veterans of this sub know that banning someone for being a shill is a gray area.  r/conspiracy doesn't really do it.  We try to do it.  If you don't like that we try to do it, then stay on the main sub.

       You are pulling the Nazi card because that's not why we banned you.  It is clear that there is an agenda to label our sub as a safe haven for Nazis.  Not too surprising when that is the same narrative pushed in the media with Antifa vs. Neon-Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not pulling the Antifa card on you.  I used the word "or".  It seems there are these new Antifa people popping up for us who would be indistinguishable from other shills or top minds if they didn't blurt out they were Antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       I detailed why we banned you.  It wasn't because I suspected you to be Antifa.  I don't have enough evidence to believe a given person is Antifa unless they say that they are at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with someone who says "Hitler did nothing wrong".  Us not banning him shows we permit all views.  What we are trying to create is an environment of productive discussion.  I permitted you for a while until you made that post basically making a mockery of the sub among other things.

       They do not intend to share their views.  They come to push an agenda, belittle, and mock people.  It is one of the things that separates us from r/conspiracy.  It is not perfect but it is the best we can do.

       I think people in the conspiracy community do have critical thinking.  It takes critical thinking to pierce the veil.  If you don't critically think, you will fall prey to mind control through means such as propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only some think they are 100% correct.  The same goes for people outside the conspiracy community.  I think that conspiracy theorists are more likely to not completely accept things as 100% correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it justified to mock someone when they "lack basic critical thinking skills"?  Everyone is born different with different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses.  Peoples' experiences also shape who they are.  We all make our own choices but I think it is extremely difficult for some given the situation they enter into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I have ever seen anyone call someone a normie here.  For me, this isn't about seeking attention from our grade school classmates.  There are always egotistical people but I think they are a lot less common in the conspiracy community.

       Went to conspiracy undone and saw you were tagged with an INTJ label and wanted to relay a story to you, (so I stalked your most recent post.) Went to a shrink years ago, and then took the MMPI. My shrink said she thought she knew what I was and after the results came in she seemed more happy to see me. I am INTP, I think she thought I was INTJ. Haha quit judging people asshole.. just kidding.

       Haha, what else is funny is I am a Christian.  As a Christian, we are supposed to not judge others and leave it up to God to judge them.

       I think it is a personality trait I got from my mom.  My youngest sister also has Down syndrome so I tend to judge people who make fun of other people despite having been born with a handicap like they could have easily been born with hadn't they been so lucky.

       top minds think CIA never lies so we can trust them when they say Russia hacked emails and gave them to wikileaks. they also think showing actual emails showing Hillary is corrupt is the same as "hacking the election"

       top minds also thinks we can see the moon landing area on the moon from earth with telescopes. they then realize this is not true so they say we can see it with pics taken from satellites. they then realize this is not true so they say we can bounce lasers off the moon. they are then asked for proof of this and then resort to insults.

       I have experience with some of the users in that particular thread before they were banned in r/conspiracy and the attributes laid out by OP, are a fairly accurate representation of the kind of mind that is drawn to a sub like that.

       Just scrolling through it I’m stuck by how anyone would actively exert time to mock others. Only (badly reared) children tend to do that- or the adults that they grow into.  Who has the time,
       <em>
        nay

       inclination to engage in such pettiness but a juvenile who lacks the ability to emphasise or exercise independent, non authority-derived, critical thought?

       They also say that the Russia collusion narrative has "mountains" of evidence, can't name anything specific, and then call pizzagate an insane theory with no evidence. Despite the fact that there is a mountain of evidence to support a global pedophile ring existing. I guess we just pick and choose what we want to be true nowadays.

       That's the only piece of evidence I ever hear, if you even want to count that. What was said in those emails that would be useful to Mueller? Oh right, nothing. That's why this "investigation" is taking so long. I don't even support Trump, you just fell for a sad media-created conspiracy theory.

       I don't expect you to see reason. Clearly you've tied your self worth to that of Trump no matter how terrible he fucks up.

       Trump also lied about why Comey was fired and then admitted it was because of the Russian investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort and Flynn have had to resign because of them trying to cover up their shady Russian dealings. Sessions had to recuse himself for lying about meeting Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump Jr lied over and over until the NYT was going to leak his emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans spent years and millions trying to pin Bengazhi on Hillary and at the end admitted that she didn't do anything wrong. Yet you're angry that this investigation has taken months so far. Mmmkay.

       Honestly, I think the ideal mentality would be somewhere between the stereotypical r/conspiracy and r/TMOR user. It does us no good to question literally
       <em>
        everything.
       </em>
       But we should still question anything that truly seems suspicious. Of course, what is "suspicious" will differ from person to person, but if you're going to say "the mainstream explanation for [blank] is false," you should at least try to make a convincing argument for why your explanation is more plausible, and be prepared for others to tear it apart if it's bullshit.

       Can we just completely ignore TMoR here?  Don't mention them, don't link to them, don't acknowledge their posts, etc...?  And if a user over there starts trolling this sub, just treat them like any other troll and either don't engage or kill them with kindness.  And if they're not trolling, treat them like you would anyone else on this sub.

       Well they sound like cult, of which there are many. As bad as these guys are, I feel a sense of pity for them. On the other hand we have several cults running around here: the 'love and light' cult - don't you get it? They're enlighted and the love everyone. Then there's the serious political hack cult - they are going to shut you up because your fringe ideas are 'discrediting' the community. Conspiracy is a criminal issue and nothing more. We understand all.

       I wonder who the people are who are trained to throw a wrench into the good fortune of all. If it weren't for fuckers, many more people would be successful, and our World would be more interesting. In my opinion, it seems to be people educated at certain schools, and belonging to certain clubs. Bullying is a way to suppress and vilify potential competition. In my opinion, this is why creativity has been booted.

       Hi I know this is unrelated but please don't flag me. it is for a prelim examination which i am currently doing right now. would anyone care to share their thoughts regarding fake news. Why they spread it. the conspiracies that it may lead to, and other things. Also the reasons why one posts such news. Could it be for fun, to prove a point, to troll as I sometimes do. I really need this. Help a mensch out.

       I feel bad for those people, because they're going to figure it out eventually, and it's going to be really rough on them. The thing is that they look at us the same way we look at them. They genuinely think that we have some kind of 'nerd in his mom's basement' superiority complex whereby we cling to conspiracy theories because it makes us feel special and reaffirms the idea that we know stuff other people don't know &amp; are thus better than them, which makes up for the fact we're really stuck in our mom's basement playing with our genitals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the main problems preventing people from understanding what's really going on, is getting you head round this idea that 'everyone has to be in on it' - I am someone who worked in mainstream media, I worked at a top university and am an academic and have worked on research projects with various government agencies and corporations like Facebook, Google, D-Wave, IBM, etc etc. And the people you meet seem like the same kind of people that you are, most of these people have no idea, they are all utterly brainwashed too. Most journalists I know fly into a rage if you question anything about the government's motives, because to them, these people are people they work with and talk to on a regular basis. What people don't understand is that those people aren't in on it, they perpetuate it because they are in that same bubble of completely unquestioning acceptance of the idea that all the people that are in the same circles as them and their bosses, and therefore their bosses bosses and etc, are the same as them - i.e. well meaning, striving for a better world, equality, peace etc. Uncomfortable things like war or the banker bailouts or the Panama Papers or NSA spying, they are all categorised as one-off anomalies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, until you see it for yourself, until you are there at an event and then you see it covered on the mainstream news completely erroneously, and you see it is being covered in such a way as to advance a particular agenda, and you know that it's not that a mistake has been made, because you've contacted the media and told them the truth, and until you're trying to relate your actual lived experience about something and your receive the same scoffing and disbelief and mocking that you yourself used to direct at people who claimed things like Sandy Hook was faked or that the government was spraying chemicals from planes or modifying the weather or that there's a secret space program and aliens are being covered up... then it clicks, or at least starts to click. That's what I've learned from my experience and from talking to people who have gone through this same thing - a lot of people 'woke up' with Trump and Brexit, because a lot of people were involved in something that they could see so clearly being utterly misrepresented in the media, and finally it clicked - these people are not telling the truth, they can't be trusted.. and then everything you've ever believed, or been told, is suddenly thrown into question - all of reality is up for grabs, which I guess is why some people go full on into flat earth etc, it's almost like a traumatic reaction to the realisation that you really don't know anything because you've so far trusted your perception of reality to sources that are now proven to be lying and manipulative.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the thing about these people who go all out with the attacking the conspiracy theorists are often the people who deep down feel that there is something wrong, just beyond their consciousness, and their focus on tearing down 'conspiracy theorists' is often because somewhere inside they are terrified, they can't bear for it to be true, they're actively refusing to let it be true by trying to talk or write or circle jerk it out of existence. But they can't ignore it. Kind of like a closet gay person who goes all out with the homophobia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the point of my saying all this is to say - if we want these people to understand and see the truth of things, then the best way to do it is to keep showing the discrepancies between media stories and other evidence/footage etc. Keep small to start with, I see way too many people trying to wake people up and going straight to all the Illuminati, Luciferian elites stuff, or other really way out there things, but I've found a lot of success with just showing people the small things, something that they're not going to instantly dismiss and ridicule, but something that shows without doubt, that the mainstream media is deliberately lying, and just ask them why, keep asking them, why are they lying about this? Just one small thing at a time, one small fact, without going into the details of what you've subsequently found out about the whole agenda behind it, or all the conspiracies, just keep to the facts and ask them the questions, ask them to explain it to you in a way that makes sense within the world view they are espousing. And when they do that intellectual work for themselves, and realise that they cannot make sense of it, that is when the brain washing starts to break down, that's when the crisis begins and they start tentatively looking into these things for themselves, uncovering more and more evidence, more of the bigger picture, and before you know it, they'll be calling you up and yelling 'I can't believe Michelle Obama is a man!!!' (Well that's what happened with my Dad anyway, who is a scientist and used to watch CNN religiously). :-)

       I'm pretty sure Michelle is a man. Questioning her gender is enough to get heavily ridiculed, even in this sub. Conspiracies like that, where people have been fooled right in front of their faces, are the ones that bring out the cognitive dissonance and fury from people. I find it it psychologically interesting.

       There is nothing remotely believable about 9/11. I urge everyone to watch Christopher Bollyn's explanations of the event; extremely detailed, so much in fact that it got tedious plenty of times when he'd start speaking fast enough to sound like he was reciting items off a grocery list. Really well presented though, puts things across in a clear-cut way. Another in a long list of 'anti Semites' I guess!

        intolerance for cognitive dissonance.
       </em>
       So, the primary thought they have about themselves is "they are better than other people, and whatever imperfections they have are minor."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, whenever you present a narc with evidence of an imperfection they can not tolerate it.  It contradicts their primary belief that "they are perfect."  So they then accuse the person that points out their imperfection as being the actual possessor of the imperfection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know.  Still doesn't quite add up, but its as close as I can get to understanding their mental processes.

       I couldn't agree more about the troll behavior. When they descend en masse and carry out 10 minutes of mocking banter to clog your post ... then all leave together .. that's not noticeable to the mod? To all of us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard not to think Reddit approves of their 'message" since they turn the other cheek to the obvious activity and the extremely rude behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard for me not to feel like I was censored for content when I was banned on climate today for no reason (leaving content as the only logical reason).
      </p>
      <p>
       After several personal attacks I simply responded to the only substantive question with data from an MIT publication which strongly supported my position and gutted theirs. They resorted to rude personal attacks and then I  was banned without warning or explanation. No response to my question 'why'  yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very difficult for me to believe anything other than content censorship.  Didn't like what I was posting and I crushed the trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a greater sin than censorship for a media organization? It's akin to actively lying but at least active liars permit the other side to be heard in the marketplace of ideas. Yes ... censorship is worse than actively lying. This will go down on all of their permanent records.

       Well i am new to these subreddits like r/conspiracy and i tried to read throu both sides commentars etc.
(Im from switzerland so.. You know im "neutral" as people like to say lol) btw. My grammar is shit sometimes so im sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the thing, i belive in some theories for sure because they are SO fking obvious. Or there ARE actually things happening which are proven. For example: chemtrails.. The US themself reportet that the army "tested" bacterial weapons in San-Francisco.
I do belive that 9/11 is made by the goverment or something like that. Just because of these TONS of HIGHLY suspecious storys behind it.
And a few other things are out there that are not trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post is pretty good. Especially the part where i comfront people is about.. Beliving everything in the media atc.
Just think back. In history class i ALWAYS had people that ask about WW1/2:"but why did all the people follow this bad guy?"
Well, media etc. Back then people did not have the easy way of communicating all around the world. He made false flag attscks and so on.
Ask the most people today how they feel about russia. Many people think they are super bad. Especially putin. Its just the fking same which happends right here. (I dont want to say he is the best guy in the world.. Some shit happends there too) but if you look at the history etc in the past years, russia has IMPROVED A LOT. And they minded somewhat their own buissness and kept things small for such a big country. Just in the past years things got heated up again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And belive me if i say, the media here in switzerland is fking bad, horrible and hilarious in staging things.
Making up statistics where a 12yo. can see something is smelly about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, about all this drama here there is a backstory which is happening with my friend. He goes full nuts sometimes and discusses things like flat earth and sometimes seems to be convinced about it.
And i dont belive in it.
For example he always laughts about since reports and how they explain why the earth is round.. Gravitation, and that all the space stuff is just lies.
 And the biggest thing that trigfers him is something like that.
"what is it about theories? you cant say, it is shit just because it is a theory. If we WANT to solve something that is a problem, come up with a solution or WHATEVER we HAVE to make a theory first, which is most of the time, based on observation.
Otherwise you can go by yourself.. Unlearn EVERYTHING you have learned throu shool and can make up things by yourself which are proven and not just theorys.. Oh wait. You cant. Because, first of you have to make a theory."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again about gouverment. I fking hate to see ours here debating about anything. They are worse as some kindergarden kids. I could find some 12yo boyos which can have a better conversation as our high people. All they do is.. One dude brings up some facts and the other litelary denies it by blaming him in some way. Which makes no sense at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here it is somewhat the same SOMETIMES.
Conspiracy people bring up stuff.. With some nice facts which makes it better. The other partie just denies it with. "oh jeah.  Hehe flatearth is also something you belive in? Hue hue hue. Scrub."
If it is trolling.. Or he just WONT listen to the fact. Dont fking discuss it with this dude.
Just dont.
And sometimes it is the other way around.. Someone says, the sky is just some sort of hologram that is why the ISIS is fake etc. I cant argue against it.. It is just something you belive in but with no evidence and you just denie my part with your belive. And one thing i dont like, which my friend does. Is "Teaching" someone else about something with full on belive while not being better or having ANY idea about it. He is no astrophysic dude which can solve difficult math problems etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is sometimes the same way around. So fking calm down everyone and also just argue like adults if you want to be something better. Jeez i just wanna read throu some nice leaks or discuss a topic but not have every second post about how shitty mainstream people are.
Its hilarious from both sides sometimes if i go throu these posts. Get a grip.

       I'll break it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       -they control both sides
-they astroturf disinformation like flat earth and reptilians 
-they come and debunk said information that they created in the first place 
-they have different groups that are assigned to cognitively infiltrate different subjects 
-they are engaged in social engineering both sides of the dialectic 
-they will encourage you to not "brigade" topminds because they don't want real discourse, they rather "balkanize" the internet and keep people boxed in to their own echochambers, just like how jewish facebook algorithms only show you likeminded posts. It's better to separate groups into: The antithesis (conspiracy theorists). the Thesis (basic bitch good goyim from topminds) and then the SYNTHESIS, which equals a conflict between the two resulting in conspiracy theorists getting discredited in the eyes of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats a gross oversimplification. The current storm they're cooking up is much more sinister and dangerous. All the squabbling over identity politics is a psyop to pit people against one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this isn't going to fly with some of you, both sides are probably going to cry out in pain and downvote, but thats okay, reddit is for faggots and downvotes ain't even a thang.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it all comes back to the hegelian dialectic. Right now we have a storm brewing between 2 factions: left/right, alt-right/antifa, globalists/nationalists, republicans/democrats, Breitbart/Huffington post etc. Both sides are retarded. Alt-right nazifrogs from 4chan are just as bad as blue haired antifa trannies, both go in the trash along with the intelligence agencies who bankroll them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call them both "countercultures" if you want, but they're both just taking real grassroots dissent and mutating it into useful idiocy. For instance, Andrew Brietbart was the pioneer of both Breitbart AND the Huffington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole right/left paradigm is a game of charades

       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue (formerly Correct the Record) and Media Matters. They are all run by David Brock. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>

      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       Urm, I think subs like this skew WAY more in that direction. Haven't seen numbers, but I am pretty sure young people are being drawn generationally to rebel against their liberal parents.

       I think people in the conspiracy community do have critical thinking.  It takes critical thinking to pierce the veil.  If you don't critically think, you will fall prey to mind control through means such as propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only some think they are 100% correct.  The same goes for people outside the conspiracy community.  I think that conspiracy theorists are more likely to not completely accept things as 100% correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it justified to mock someone when they "lack basic critical thinking skills"?  Everyone is born different with different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses.  Peoples' experiences also shape who they are.  We all make our own choices but I think it is extremely difficult for some given the situation they enter into.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I have ever seen anyone call someone a normie here.  For me, this isn't about seeking attention from our grade school classmates.  There are always egotistical people but I think they are a lot less common in the conspiracy community.
