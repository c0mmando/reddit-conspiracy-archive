        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Spanish government has literally seized several Catalan websites and their domains in an effort to sabotage and fully suppress Catalan grassroots activism and Catalan sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Catalan government is set to hold a referendum on full independence from the Spanish nation on October 1.</p>

<p>In response, the Spanish government has raided Catalan government buildings, seized Catalan assets and arrested Catalan representatives, including the head of the registrar overseeing the .cat TLD.</p>

<p>Part of the raids also included the seizure of Catalan activist and government websites that were/are specifically in support of or created for the October 1 independence referendum, such as referendum.cat and ref1oct.cat. The independence movement in Catalonia is very big and is fully institutionalized, which makes it extremely influential.</p>

<p>This situation involving Catalonia is a window into the anticipated future where (other) governments around the world will engage in similar seizures as a crucial rebellion keeps fighting back against the oppression imposed by dictatorial and corporate regimes and by intergovernmental organizations that seek world governance through a centralized corporative body.</p>

<p>The warning that social platform GAB got from its registrar for allegedly violating policy agreements pales in comparison to what the Spanish government has done with Catalan websites and you can&#39;t get around this measure through proxies because the sites are not there anymore.</p>

<p>Provably, Spain is now once again a dictatorship, 42 years after Franco died. - KJ Intel Sector</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree. True independence, not the role out of a foreign policy from a foreign nation, should be supported. And I do.</p>

<p>Spanish establishment is feeling that the time will eventually come that their one-nation will crumble. That is inevitable anyway. The hard response indicates that they truly fear the referendum or else such measures would not have been taken.</p>

<p>Smaller nations = smaller governments too, which is also a good thing that I&#39;d like to see more often ASAP.</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to go along with your idea of also less warmongering in such case.</p>
