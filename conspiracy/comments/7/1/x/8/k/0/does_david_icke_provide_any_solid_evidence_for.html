       It sounds like something I'm unlikely to believe in, but I still want to know if there is any solid information that backs this up other than speculations from interpretations of ancient imagery or whatever it may be.

       Dude if there was any solid evidence to back up "reptilian hypothesis" it'd be either huge fucking news or suppressed like a bastard. Kinda like everything else... perhaps this is a parable for other less controversial and fantastical issues like central banks and wars, no?

       Yeah that's true. It would probably be suppressed though instead of being 'huge fucking news'. I just wanted to quickly find out whether he provides any solid information for it or not

       What's the problem? If he had solid information that he wrote about in his books, I'm pretty sure it'd be quite widespread, especially among a subreddit like this. So all I wanted to know is whether he does provide good information or not.

       That's his story, but I gotta admit I dislike him immensely because he brought lizards into the conversation.

       David Icke is a CIA propagandist who's whole job is to  mix some true conspiracy theories with many that are obviously crazy and fake to try to get the general public to think of the true ones as also being crazy and fake. The reptilians are an example of one of his fake stories.

       Spend enough time around fringe topics or wars and you'll find that huge amounts of resources are being deployed to make objectivity difficult. Broadly speaking: if you can find facts they don't matter much anymore because we are drowning in opinions that are calculated to branch off in a million directions ad infinitium until we forgot what the fuck we were even talking about

       I don't remember where it was from or exactly what it entailed, but it was basically a bunch of paperwork showing that he was on the CIA payroll and in frequent contact with a bunch of members working on propaganda. Communication transcripts that showed that many of his stories were not written by him, but by a team working purposefully to spread misinformation. I don't know how authentic it all was, but it seemed like a pretty good explanation when I read it. I'm not totally sure either way, but this motive would explain why he seems to have some true information and a lot that just seems obviously crazy at the same time.

       Interesting, I'll see if I can find anything on that. Has he ever actually criticised the CIA or does he just focus on the shape shifting reptilian families lmao?

       I haven't ever heard of him directly mentioning the CIA, just that in general all world powers are lizard people.

       This is called poisoning the well, and I agree that this is likely the case with the stories of reptiles.

       I'll give you this basic point: the reptilian creatures exist on a lower vibrational frequency to us humans. Because of this humans cant see their true nature. when the creatures are under a lot of stress or need this vibration changes and humans get a ..

         Reptilians are no more, or less, 'wacky' than Jesus. Somebody who believes in the latter is in no position to criticise those who believe in the former. That's not directed at the OP, it's a blanket statement that goes both ways.

         Icke's Reptilians are a blatant rip-off of the 1983 mini-series

       I was going to expand on this but I might get back to it tomorrow. Icke is very much a British Alex Jones so your question isn't as straightforward as you might think.

       Not endorsing his views but pretty sure it's based on some ancient Sumerian religious texts/tablets. Google these terms to find short written explanations or videos: sumerian tablet reptilians icke

       The mention of reptilian entities ruling mankind is in multiple belief systems, but if you consider things like The Book of Enoch to be folklore then no, there is no real evidence.
