    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t remember where it was from or exactly what it entailed, but it was basically a bunch of paperwork showing that he was on the CIA payroll and in frequent contact with a bunch of members working on propaganda. Communication transcripts that showed that many of his stories were not written by him, but by a team working purposefully to spread misinformation. I don&#39;t know how authentic it all was, but it seemed like a pretty good explanation when I read it. I&#39;m not totally sure either way, but this motive would explain why he seems to have some true information and a lot that just seems obviously crazy at the same time.</p>

<p>However....</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you this basic point: the reptilian creatures exist on a lower vibrational frequency to us humans. Because of this humans cant see their true nature. when the creatures are under a lot of stress or need this vibration changes and humans get a ..<em>glimpse</em> of their true appearance.</p>
