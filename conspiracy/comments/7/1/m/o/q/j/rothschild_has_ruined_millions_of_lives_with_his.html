<p>It doesn&#39;t, because &quot;chemtrails&quot; are a myth. They literally do not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is one to know whether their many beliefs are facts or simply misunderstandings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In modern life, one is expected (a) to have a basic education about the world, (b) be able to distinguish between things which are known to be true and things which are asserted, and (c) have the basic reading and comprehension skills to seek out and obtain additional information before coming to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use your example. Is there <em>any evidence in the entire world</em> that &quot;chemtrails&quot; are a real thing? We know what contrails are, and how they&#39;re formed, and which conditions permit them and which don&#39;t. Is there a <em>single piece of evidence</em> to support the existence of &quot;chemtrails?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one or the other. Valid or invalid. Chemists that most certainly understand chemistry better than you or I don&#39;t understand it.
You offer the opinion that it isn&#39;t a valid assumption that dispersing different elements at different temperatures and the resulting reaction are chemistry. You offer nothing but your opinion to prove this. Freaking theoretical chemists are uncertain whether there is chemistry occurring, but your opinion that it is a purely physical reaction is sufficient ? That don&#39;t play in Peoria, as the Goldstein Trio were fond of saying.</p>

<p>Additionally, spraying lead oxide, silver iodide, aluminum oxide or barium into the atmosphere in various states at wildly varying temperatures isn&#39;t known to be safe. In fact, those elements and compounds are known to be unsafe for human exposure.</p>

<p>I ain&#39;t buying the Rothschild clap-trap, but it sure as fuck ain&#39;t tiddlywinks </p>

<p>You missed the more important part. What if it is?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not elements. They&#39;re compounds. And actually yes, those are all totally safe <em>in the concentration in which they&#39;ve been used.</em> If they weren&#39;t safe in those concentrations, then people wouldn&#39;t have used them in those concentrations. Duh.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there&#39;s the fact that these salts you named aren&#39;t actually used any more in favor of inert hygroscopics like, as I mentioned, ordinary table salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Barium is an element. 
The other compounds named are not harmless. They are measured for risk in ppm or ppb.</p>

<p>Silver iodide, still the preferred compound for seeding, is not ordinary table salt. Nor is it harmless. </p>
