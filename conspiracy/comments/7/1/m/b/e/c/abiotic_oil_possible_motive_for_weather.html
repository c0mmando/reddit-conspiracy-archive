        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am new to posting on reddit and am hoping this will start a feed that can bring a few different &#39;conspiracies&#39; together to form an actual How - Why conversation. </p>

<p>( I am assuming that most of you reading this are familiar with the geoengineering and weather modification activities currently, If not this is an interactive map showing the different projects currently in the public database along with the locations of Ionospheric heaters etc.-
<a href="http://climateviewer.org/index.html?layersOn=sky-heaters">http://climateviewer.org/index.html?layersOn=sky-heaters</a>   )</p>

<p>I am going to be referencing a few articles discussing the &quot;Abiotic Oil&quot; theory, for those who are not familiar it basically states that all oil is not actually a fossil fuel ( that was a statement put out to increase the demand for oil as an exhaustible resource ) , rather it is produced due to a chemical reaction within the closer levels near the core and makes its way to the surface. This has been a highly debated theory most people called it bunk, until the case of Eugene Island 330 outside of NOLA. </p>

<p>The link to the article is &quot;<a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/on-energy/2011/09/14/abiotic-oil-a-theory-worth-exploring">https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/on-energy/2011/09/14/abiotic-oil-a-theory-worth-exploring</a>&quot;</p>

<p>This is a main exerpt to put the weather targeting theory into perspective , this would be the &quot;Why&quot; so many people have been looking for, why target the Gulf coast and Mexico - to obtain the rights to a nearly self replenishing oil supply. </p>

<p>&quot;Chris Cooper&#39;s story appeared April 16, 1999, in The Wall Street Journal about an oil field called Eugene Island. Here&#39;s an excerpt:</p>

<p>Production at the oil field, deep in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, was supposed to have declined years ago. And for a while, it behaved like any normal field: Following its 1973 discovery, Eugene Island 330&#39;s output peaked at about 15,000 barrels a day. By 1989, production had slowed to about 4,000 barrels a day.
Then suddenly—some say almost inexplicably—Eugene Island&#39;s fortunes reversed. The field, operated by PennzEnergy Co., is now producing 13,000 barrels a day, and probable reserves have rocketed to more than 400 million barrels from 60 million. Stranger still, scientists studying the field say the crude coming out of the pipe is of a geological age quite different from the oil that gushed 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Thomas Gold, a respected astronomer and professor emeritus at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, has held for years that oil is actually a renewable, primordial syrup continually manufactured by the Earth under ultrahot conditions and tremendous pressures. As this substance migrates toward the surface, it is attacked by bacteria, making it appear to have an organic origin dating back to the dinosaurs, he says.
All of which has led some scientists to a radical theory: Eugene Island is rapidly refilling itself, perhaps from some continuous source miles below the Earth&#39;s surface. That, they say, raises the tantalizing possibility that oil may not be the limited resource it is assumed to be.
More recently, Forbes presented a similar discussion. In 2008 it reported a group of Russian and Ukrainian scientists say that oil and gas don&#39;t come from fossils; they&#39;re synthesized deep within the earth&#39;s mantle by heat, pressure, and other purely chemical means, before gradually rising to the surface. Under the so-called abiotic theory of oil, finding all the energy we need is just a matter of looking beyond the traditional basins where fossils might have accumulated.&quot;</p>

<p>Now this isn&#39;t all that alarming - strange not alarming, until you look at the placement of Eugene Island block 330, directly smack between Houston Texas and New Orleans Louisiana. </p>

<p>Harvey- Katrina- Earthquakes-Fema Walmarts- Deep Water Horizon Dispersant - 
I keep hearing &quot;Why&quot; well bear with me-</p>

<p>Here is the second article that points to Mexico City - Same discovery a &#39;new&#39; Oil well that would place Mexico into a new category for energy production.</p>

<p>Link Here &quot;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-find-major-oil-deposit-in-gulf-of-mexico-1499872771">https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-find-major-oil-deposit-in-gulf-of-mexico-1499872771</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Excerpt - &quot;One of Mexico’s earliest private-sector energy investors says that it has struck it big with a significant oil discovery in Mexican waters.Britain’s Premier Oil PLC, along with partners Talos Energy of Houston and Sierra Oil &amp; Gas of Mexico City, said Wednesday that exploratory drilling in the Zama-1 field, located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, had uncovered a “world-class” formation with between 1.4 billion and two billion barrels of light crude oil, or roughly double earlier predictions.&quot;</p>

<p>Now these two excerpts alone do not do very much out of context, but between the proven weather modifications being performed all over the world this is serious motivation to obtain control over a body of water and land. Especially if one of the countries has been a point of confrontation for the US - Mexico. </p>

<p>For perspective I am a born Floridian- shit is always crazy here we get Chemtrailed - tested - nothing has ever really surprised me that the Governments have or have not admitted to. However, this feels like something bigger. </p>

<p>I have seen numerous conspiracy documentaries about a plan to essentially turn TX + LA into a oil refinery megacenter back when Blackwater still wore the shirts and 9/11 was fresh in minds. Thought it was absolute nonsense at the time, that was roughly 15 years ago. Now everything keeps adding up.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Debunking? Science I should be aware of? Alternative theories?</p>

<p>Any input would be awesome! And I apologize if that was a lot to read or if I need different etiquette - complete Noob just a reader before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post...and I believe that abiotic oil theories need to be investigated further.  I also wonder if (and how) it factors into the &#39;expando planet&#39; theory, which posits that the earth is gaining girth as it ages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is good information out there that talk about abiotic oil. Some countries do not except the fossil fuel narrative. I&#39;m linking an article from 2007 that not only gives a little background on it but also exposes some of the corruption involved.</p>
