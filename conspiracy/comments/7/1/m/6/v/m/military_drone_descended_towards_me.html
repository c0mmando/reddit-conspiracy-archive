        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>i was driving home from school at night. when i turned into my neighborhood, i saw a strange light moving through the sky. it was moving by some trees. i turn into my neighborhood and park in my driveway. i get out of my car and i see the light about half a mile, maybe a mile away, pretty far up. i noticed it was triangular, and had three lights, one of which was blinking. it had a few white lights and a blinking red light. so i turn on my flashlight because it&#39;s dark and i can&#39;t see. i walk to my backyard which is about an acre and has a lake. visibility is really good because there are no trees on the property, but there are some trees on the neighbor&#39;s property and trees across the street from the neighborhood. at this point, it was flying behind some trees to the right of the yard and it was silent. my flashlight on my phone was pointing towards the ground so i could see where i was walking. the drone (i assume it was a military drone because it was the size of a truck) was silent. It was not a traditional, recreational drone because it didnt have the little spinny things to let it hover.</p>

<p>anyway, as i was walking around my garage to the backyard, i was curious so i stood there with my flashlight aiming down and stared at it. it flew across the backyard. this part&#39;s hard to explain. it basically flew all the way across the yard(from the right side to the left) and past me(i was to the left of the yard), then turned around and started descending towards me. at the point it got close and started to make noise. you could hear it gliding through the wind as it was turning and descending towards me. i turned around and started running to my back patio and banged on the door for my grandparents to let me in. i was totally gripped with fear. </p>

<p>it was weird because when i turned around to start running, it felt like i was in a dream. i was so terrified. my first thought was &quot;oh shit, i&#39;m about to get abducted.&quot; I literally said &quot;oh shit&quot; and before i started running. </p>

<p>I went in and told my grandparents what happened and they went outside to check and it was gone. i obviously didnt go out to check. i was shaking with fear and adrenaline for at least fifteen minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>So i have a couple of theories and questions. one, are drones attracted to light? i had my flashlight pointed towards the ground the entire time and the automatic flood light was on the side of the house. </p>

<p>two, was it intimidation so i wouldn&#39;t take a picture? i wasn&#39;t going to take a picture because i had to have my flashlight on, yes, the flood light was on the side of the house, but i was walking around to the back yard. did they think i was going to take a picture?</p>

<p>third, do drones follow people and why the hell would a drone descend towards me? this thing was huge, the size of a truck, and looks just like the drones in the pictures that people see at night. </p>

<p>fourth, do the people operating the drone just like to freak the fuck out of people? they were probably trying to scare me away i think, but if they just flew away, i wouldn&#39;t have been able to take a picture, and i wouldn&#39;t have the ability to observe them. i was in my own backyard. </p>

<p>like i said, it got really really close and my instincts kicked in and i started running. many thoughts were going through my head. one, &quot;oh shit, i&#39;m about to get abducted&quot; and my second thought was &quot;this thing is gonna crash into me.&quot; it was that close.</p>

<p>so what the actual fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this thing was too big to be any kid of civilian aircraft. plus, i live in an extremely rural area, and my neighborhood has a lot of older people in it. it looked exactly like military aircrafts that so many people film and record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it didn&#39;t look anything like that. you&#39;re right, civilian aircrafts can be big, but in terms of drones and according to my location, it was not likely civilian. i cannot find a drone this size on the market for civilians to buy. it was not a plane, it made no engine noises at all, all you could hear was it gliding through the wind, and only once it was close. if you can find a civilian drone that looks exactly like i described, completely triangular, the size of a truck, with three lights on each corner and a blinking red light, it would still be incredibly bizarre and incredibly unlikely that someone in my poor ass neighborhood would buy a drone of that size.</p>
