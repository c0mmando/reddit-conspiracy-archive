<p>occurs when your body has too many bases. It can occur due to decreased blood levels of carbon dioxide, which is an acid. It can also occur due to increased blood levels of bicarbonate, which is a base.</p>

<p>Which is a side effect of <strong>ingesting sodium bicarbonate</strong> as much as it is injecting.</p>

<p><a href="http://drsircus.com/sodium-bicarbonate-baking-soda/side-effects-contraindications/">1</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>metabolic alkalosis develops in a person who has ingested too much base from substances such as baking soda (bicarbonate of soda).  Severe metabolic alkalosis (ie, blood pH &gt;7.55) is a serious medical problem. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mechanism exists. But wait:</p>

<p>This condition may also be related to other underlying health issues such as <strong>low potassium</strong> <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/alkalosis#overview1">1</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is potassium found in diet? yes it is.</p>

<p>The entire argument against Alkaline diet is appeal to authority, strawmans &amp; claims of negatives. It doesn&#39;t make every claim about the diet correct (the cited example about blood is a straw man since not every proponent claims this) but <em>whatever</em> function the diet may have even if undetected is more evidence than nothing.

<p>It was for time immemorial. In fact it wasn&#39;t until the ~1900s that the medical establishment even commanded any public respect. That was shortly after they were warehousing people to experiment on them in &quot;nuthouses&quot; [drilling into live brains, that sort of thing].</p>

<p>Then you have bioweapons research [Africa/US], the SS-experiments, the US-DOE/Manhatten radiation experiments, the bioweapons deployment tests, the Syphillus Experiments (intentionally infecting people with it), the experiments on Intellectually Disabled.</p>

<p>These were all related or connected to the major drug manufacturers and their interests.</p>

<p>The original &quot;Spanish Flu&quot; history does not add up either, as people reported symptoms that simply do not exist from &#39;Flu&#39;, which was proven when supposed the same &quot;strain&quot; made a come back in recent years. Coughing fits of projectile-blood, coagulated blood coughing fits, severe meningitis, etc. </p>

<p>Hard to track down the original reports and histories however...</p>

<p>It&#39;s proven by default with the placebo effect. Better than some pharmaceutical concoctions as they have more negative consequences than they are worth.</p>

<p>Vioxx - Fraudulently marketed: Caused mini-strokes &amp; other injury.</p>

<p>Paxil - Criminal off label promotion and fraud (psychological problems in patients)</p>

<p>Bextra - Fraudulently marketed: Stroke, Angina, Heart Attack, liver necrosis, hepatitis.</p>

<p>Oxycontin - Fraudulently marketed: Severe addiction</p>

<p>If the OP isn&#39;t posting bait (intentionally) perhaps its best to respect their parent&#39;s beliefs. As empirical evidence suggests their industry is entirely full of shit, and there is no simple answer that works for every person. If someone wishes to subject themselves to pharm companies and the latest drug so be it. </p>

<p>Why must their beliefs be forced on everyone else?</p>

IMO we would&#39;ve gone in with or without 9/11, the WMD lie would&#39;ve existed with or without it, 9/11 just swayed opinions so it was easier. And think of it this way, if he wanted to got into Iraq why were most of the terrorists Saudis? </p>

It takes a while to acquire knowledge and truly see truth from fiction. I suggest that you go easy on your Dad and start watching alternate points of view eg. (Youtube) The Corbett report. If one of your 6 appears hear what he has to say.
James is rational and fact driven which will allow you to do your own research to corroborate or debunk the claims he and others make. This is the only way to be sure that &quot;Theories&quot; are true or not.  Good Luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4) 9/11 was a false flag operation</p>

<p>It certainly did not go down the way the gov narrative says it did. When there are that many &quot;coincidences&quot; you have to start to ask who knew what in advance. At best, elements of our government knew it was going to happen and let it happen because they needed a &quot;pearl harbor&quot; event (their own words). Worst case scenario, they were involved in its preparation at some level.  Operation Northwoods shows you that they will perform false flags to justify war efforts. It is fact.</p>

<p>5) There is a group of people (illuminati) controlling most of the world&#39;s wealth and power</p>

<p>Why is that so hard to understand? Bilderberg group for example is a group of powerful people that meet in secret and discuss agendas <a href="https://stopsyjonizmowi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bilderberg.jpg">https://stopsyjonizmowi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bilderberg.jpg</a> </p>

<p>JFK warned us about secret societies, secret oaths and secret proceedings. It is fact that many politicians and rich families are deeply involved in secret societies and groups like this. </p>

Unfortunately knowing these things will give a person a cynical outlook on life and lead to anti-social behavior. Its hard to spend time with people who are not &quot;woke&quot; becouse to an individual with this world view these people will seem easily distracted from whats really happening in the world. Take some time and independently investigate all the things your Dad is interested in. Look at things and study opinions from both sides of an issue and then come to an informed personal decision on what you believe to be true about these subjects. Then engage your father with this new found understanding and watch your relationship grow.</p>

<p>I will give you some info on 1 because I have it:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of shady shit going on with vaccines, and a lot of damage control. It seems like it&#39;s an ends justifies the means thing, either to maintain public confidence in our system, prevent massive economic turmoil, or the belief that the negative effects of vaccines are outweighed by the positive, or some combination of those. Problem with that last factor is that 1) alternatives to achieving those positives aren&#39;t investigated (like maximizing a healthy immune system via systematic exposure and nutrition) and 2) they don&#39;t get to make decisions for the rest of us after debating the facts in a back room and spreading propaganda to the rest of us. Anyway, check these articles out:</p>

</ul>

<p>Let me know if you want more. Probably the thing that&#39;s easiest to see is this: why did they put thimerisol (a mercury containing preservative) in vaccines when, not only had they not done safety studies on it*, but IT&#39;S NOT EVEN NECESSARY, as evidenced by the fact that many vaccines, even different formulations of the same vaccines, don&#39;t contain it! Why are they fucking around with our health using substances they don&#39;t understand and have every reason to believe may be harmful?</p>

<p>*(they since had Pichichero do one, which immediately came under criticism for unfounded conclusions-- see the Thomas Burbacher study)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically there is nothing you can do OP. Your dad will either snap out after being proven wrong again and again or he will just sink deeper and start believing the earth is flat. There is a good chance he is also mentally ill. Most of these conspiracy people have already made up their minds where they stand on these things. They want to feel like they are in the know, and that they are somehow better and more intelligent than the average person. It&#39;s more to do with their ego than it is to do with facts, curiosity or a willingness to learn. When they think the government/jews are conspiring against people with flouride and they spend 200 dollars on a fancy water filter, they care more about justifying their stupid purchase and feeling superior to everyone else then actually knowing what they are talking about.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe that is just my brainwashed calcified pineal gland talking, or maybe I&#39;m just one of (((them)))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol wtf is a calcified pineal gland? Regardless of fluoride, would you rather have tap water or tap water through a britta?  Imagine you just woke up after drinking a bottle of jack while you were laying into people online for having different perspectives than you.  Would you rather drink toilet water or some nice cold filtered water?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would drink whatever is closest. And if you read what it says on a britta filter, it doesn&#39;t even talk about flouride, it talks about getting rid of trace elements that can be found in some plumbing systems. And britta filters are like 30-60 bucks. whatever you tried to do there, did not work. Which isn&#39;t surprising given where this is posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t even know filters were made to remove fluoride.  Have you seen one?  I just thought it was weird you were saying that people paying for water purification is pointless and requires justification.  I personally would prefer clean tasting water if I were hung over.  I was curious, so I asked.   My main point for replying to your comment was to ask you what a calcified peniel gland is.  It was the first thing I typed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s likely that the bigger problem is your father is grossly misinformed on all these issues, yet the mindset that &quot;he knows the truth&quot; gives him a sense of power and certainty in his life where he otherwise has very little. </p>

<p>This is the allure of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for you, you posted your question on a sub that&#39;s full of people very much like your father. (This explains all the shitty replies to your genuine post.)</p>

<p>As far as the conspiracy angle goes, there are aspects to each of his theories that may have some varying semblance of truth --</p>

<p>(Vaccines dont cause autism; fluoride isn&#39;t dangerous in the levels in drinking water; turmeric is a good anti-inflammatory but take it with black pepper and remember its not a panacea; no one knows exactly what happened on 9/11 and probably wont for a while; income inequality is a huge problem but it wont be solved by trickle down economics; crystals don&#39;t have healing properties)</p>

<p>-- but none of them are so pressing to his personal life that it should be causing rifts.</p>

<p>I&#39;d guess he&#39;s depressed and is grasping at the thing that gives him a sense of control.  Try to get him to reconnect with the things that gave him joy before the divorce. (He can still believe whatever he wants, it just doesn&#39;t have to be all consuming.)</p>

<p>Props to you for caring about your father. Best of luck to you both.</p>
