<p>The former presidents, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H W Bush are all in their 90&#39;s. Bill Clinton and George Bush are both in their 70&#39;s which is also a long life span. John McCain and George Soros are in their 80&#39;s</p>

<p>Nobody is dying anymore...</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to mention Elizabeth II is in her 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it pretty rare to live to your 90&#39;s? What are the odds <em>all</em> the important political figures have long life spans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you live in the US?  If you are unable to get insured right now it&#39;s because our healthcare is a clusterfuck of policies designed only to make us even more dependent on the federal government.  Once we are able to pass reform that gets insurance companies to actually compete against each other everyone in the work force will get access to the best medicine and and medical staff the world has to offer.  Through free market competition insurance companies will be racing against each other to get as many people understand their umbrella.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t give a shit about you. Go read the actual contents of their latest healthcare reform bill. They want you to die if you get sick so their rich friends can get more tax breaks. If privatized healthcare was going to work, it would be working right now. But the only group it&#39;s working for is the elite. </p>
