        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This Twitter user claims they are from Rhode Island, but accidently turns on location on Twitter, and shows they are actually posting from Russia.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the article that explains it all: <a href="http://www.propornot.com/2017/03/anatomy-of-russian-propaganda-troll.html?m=1">http://www.propornot.com/2017/03/anatomy-of-russian-propaganda-troll.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>&quot;Extreme liberalism in many cases is a diagnosable mental disorder&quot; is their description. Sounds familiar?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a spreadsheet they made of all the tweets before Twitter deleted the account: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msQ4-X0xu0vxq5zs0M_R_qf_joOPpwkBxe_wgHhG2rE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msQ4-X0xu0vxq5zs0M_R_qf_joOPpwkBxe_wgHhG2rE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Each and every quote they made is the variety that you would see in the Donald, r/news and many other places</p>

<p>I strongly suggest opening the PDF or at least checking the article, but here&#39;s a screenshot of some of the tweets, that look exactly like the stuff coming out of the Donald and other places they can try to influence us <a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5zdAjyJ">https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5zdAjyJ</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s actually most disturbing is that people in communities like the Donald don&#39;t pick up on these forced narratives. Russia is showing just how good it is at making propaganda, that Americans will readily help to spread it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;political catfish&quot;? Are you serious? Is this r/conspiracy? So let&#39;s talk about the deep state, how our government is trying to destroy our country, or at least keep us divided.. but when a Russian operative tries to undermind us, influence us, in order to weaken our country (that would only benefit the deep state), they&#39;re &quot;political catfish&quot;. Not worth discussing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am serious, tweeting about how &quot;liberalism is a mental disorder&quot; isn&#39;t new to the political landscape. Just because a &quot;Russian Operative&quot; is also joining in on the shit posting doesn&#39;t mean that Vladimir Putin is spreading mass propaganda around and brainwashing the US.

    <div class="md"><p>Because.. fake news? </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny when you&#39;ll embrace the idea that a certain news organization is fake news, but you&#39;ll quote them if they say something you agree with.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the exact kind of thing Russia uses, and it works for you.. I examine everything I read, regardless of source, then I apply critical thinking. </p>

<p>Is this true, is it an opinion, or is it just bullshit?</p>

<p>I&#39;m like a CNN article, because CNN is just fake news? </p>

<p>Jesus fucking Christ, the very fact that you would accept anything from one news source, is always fake, just shows how easily you&#39;re manipulated.</p>

<p>Literally, it&#39;s easy to see, how Russian propaganda works. CNN=bad, why? Actually.. you answer that.</p>

<p>Give me some non Russian propaganda that shows CNN is fake news, in non meme form.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<p>Why does something have to be new to the political landscape to be relevant? Perhaps they introduced it and they try to keep it in the narrative? </p>

<p>Me, personally, when Russians are obviously trying to pit one group of Americans at another, keep us divided, and maintain that divide.. that&#39;s an assault on America.</p>

<p>How is a Russian operative (that you&#39;re defending) who&#39;s trying to divide our nation, using propaganda similar to yours, a conspiracy? Well fuck, you tell me, you&#39;re the one spending your time creating a list of &quot;fake news&quot; for.. what? Why not Fox?</p>

<p>I like that you&#39;re back at your catfish argument.. and tinder? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a Russian, you&#39;ve come to accept everything they&#39;ve pushed, and it&#39;s pathetic. The Donald really did kill brain cells. Go back to making fun of incels and trolling the Communists, making lists for Russia.. it&#39;s what you&#39;re good at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I would actually be far more interested in seeing how they&#39;re trying to manipulate the left. I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m left of center.. but the right (at least vote wise) will gladly upvote anything anti Killary, while the left doesn&#39;t seem nearly as united on any front. How do you manipulate people that can&#39;t agree on any particular message? I mean fuck, that&#39;s the simplest reason Hillary didn&#39;t stand a chance. There&#39;s no bullet points for someone on the left to run on.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#39;re sketchy, I don&#39;t know, but they have screenshots to back up their claim, and had enough foresight to create a document that archived what was said.</p>

<p>Sadly my computer just died, and Google docs cuts off the comments if I zoom out too much, hence the shitty screenshot.</p>

<p>But seriously, I&#39;d love to see how Russians try to influence the left, it&#39;s gotta be more than posting things for the right they think will trigger us.</p>

<p>Either way, Russia obviously is doing what they can to divide us, and from what I&#39;ve seen.. it&#39;s working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left and the right are both deeply fractured. </p>

<p>On the right, you have the paleocons, the social conservatives, the big biz cons, the libertarians, the alt-right, the white supremacists, and neoreactionaries, just to name the major factions.</p>

<p>On the left, you have the &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#39;Democrats&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#39; like Hillary, the Berniecrats, the Greens, the socialists, the SJWs and other idpol groups, the socdems, the demsocs, the socialists, and the communists to name the big groups.</p>

<p>I think the critical point in society will come when both lefties and righties realize that they generally (that is, discounting the nazis, the monarchists, and the tankies) are against tyranny. And when they realize that the mainstream left and mainstream right in Washington have joined forces and essentially become one party, we might finally see some real change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen so many labels, and honestly don&#39;t know what half of them are supposed to mean..</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll agree with what I think you were trying to say, once Americans stop worrying about labels, and truly realize there&#39;s an establishment that benefits from any and all labels, except the label of being an American.. that&#39;s when things might get better. Because we aren&#39;t defined by labels, we&#39;re defined as people who want America to be great again, aka, not run by the establishment.</p>

<p>The one cause I&#39;ve seen repeatedly said by the right, that I think no one on the left would argue against.. is term limits for anyone in politics.</p>

<p>I wish, the idea that the left and the right both embraced as the most important change we need: term limits. No branch of our government should be run by people who have been in power more than 8 years, much less 20+ years, still ruling over us while they&#39;re on their death beds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Term limits would limit politicians ability to abuse power, it&#39;s a good first step.</p>

<p>The thing I don&#39;t understand about the right right now, is how supportive they are of deregulating everything.. if there&#39;s a deep state, it&#39;s because the rich are too rich, and that money is what makes it possible.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no built in system for diminishing returns, that&#39;s what taxes used to be.. under Eisenhower, the tax rate for making 200k a year was 90%.. effectively, the richer you were, the more you paid in taxes. Diminishing returns. Mind you, 200k a year back then is equivalent to 1.7m a year now.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a revolution would accomplish anything, not if they&#39;re still well funded, and definitely not when we have a multi billionaire as president, with all branches under Republican control.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t help that you have the Donald embracing the ideas of Russian propaganda, saying &quot;they need to do what our president says&quot;, when I&#39;m reality, most AMERICANS should understand that they should represent the states they were elected by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found the Russian? /s?</p>

<p>If you read the article, it&#39;s pretty strong evidence of the exact talking points I see made in social media from the right. </p>

<p>I mean, how much evidence do you need to believe that Russians are trying to manipulate us? Do they need to do a Facebook live video, while in front of a Russian monument, while.. I can&#39;t even go on. What the fuck do you need to be convinced that Russia is trying to undermind the USA?</p>

<p>Honestly. No bullshit. If you&#39;re sharing Russian propaganda, wouldn&#39;t you want to know about it?!</p>

<p>Am I going to trust an article trying to downplay Russia&#39;s involvement written by a Russian?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lame attempt at showing actual evidence of Russia trying to influence our country?</p>

<p>The &quot;Russia narrative&quot; that you speak of, would be Trump/Russia collusion.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with Trump, but everything to do with the &quot;silent majority&quot;.</p>

<p>Do I even give a fuck about &quot;Trump/Russia collusion&quot;? Hint, I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Do I care if the &quot;silent majority&quot; is actually Russians trying to push things that divide us? Yes.</p>

<p>Down vote me for saying this. Fuck Russia, fuck what they think we want, fuck them for pushing what they think is the &quot;silent majority&quot;.</p>

<p>And fuck you, if you would support the message of a Russian &quot;American*, defending your silent &quot;majority&quot; status.</p>

<p>Bottom line, you either support our country, or you&#39;re part of the country that is Russian, and wants to undermind what either side stands for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck you? That was unnecessary. What are you Antifa? It is about Trump and the false Russia narrative. That&#39;s all its ever been, that&#39;s where the whole &quot;Russian influencing the election&quot; came from. It&#39;s all bullshit. Where is your post about Ukraine and the DNC influencing and meddling with the election, which has mountains of evidence and proof supporting it unlike Russia/Trump which has zilch and used to hide the Ukraine/DNC trying to rig the primary???</p>

<p>So show me this mountain of evidence? And you&#39;re literally commenting on the evidence that you say there&#39;s &quot;zilch&quot; of. A literal Russian posting as a Trump supporter, for who knows how long, each thing he said lines up with the talking points that actually get upvotes in the Donald.</p>

<p>So while you think you&#39;re special for realizing that&#39;s a duck on Mars, you&#39;re extra special if you can dismiss this without any actual reason.</p>

<p>So the choices are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support your status as being a subject for the government/corporations here in the states </li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>Be a subject to Russia</li>
</ul>

<p>Really? I guess when you&#39;ve been mind fucked for so long your servitude to the rulers that use you doesn&#39;t really come into question huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Click the second link, he gets plenty of retweets over time.. and really, what is more important is it confirms the concepts that Russia pushes for, so when you start seeing certain things get upvoted like crazy in The Donald, you can at least know the Russian propaganda is working.</p>

<p>And really, I don&#39;t think you do get more influence out of a Reddit poster. The Donald is an echo chamber, who&#39;s going to see what they say, when they ban anyone who goes against what they say?</p>

<p>We see them spew that shit in other places and they typically get slapped down quick..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who&#39;s talking about the election? This is pushing a very specific narrative now.</p>

<p>There&#39;s reasons people are still talking about Hillary daily, why you just felt it was a valid talking point.. what person ran for president and lost, besides her, and gets talked about constantly? Have you ever thought to question why?</p>

<p>Probably not since you came with that bullshit out of nowhere, rather than say anything of value.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s cool, defend mother Russia, deflect, compile more propaganda, and keep Putin happy.</p>
