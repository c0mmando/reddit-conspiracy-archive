       This Twitter user claims they are from Rhode Island, but accidently turns on location on Twitter, and shows they are actually posting from Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the article that explains it all:
       <a href="http://www.propornot.com/2017/03/anatomy-of-russian-propaganda-troll.html?m=1">
        http://www.propornot.com/2017/03/anatomy-of-russian-propaganda-troll.html?m=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Extreme liberalism in many cases is a diagnosable mental disorder" is their description. Sounds familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a spreadsheet they made of all the tweets before Twitter deleted the account:
       <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msQ4-X0xu0vxq5zs0M_R_qf_joOPpwkBxe_wgHhG2rE/edit?usp=sharing">
        https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msQ4-X0xu0vxq5zs0M_R_qf_joOPpwkBxe_wgHhG2rE/edit?usp=sharing
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Each and every quote they made is the variety that you would see in the Donald, r/news and many other places
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly suggest opening the PDF or at least checking the article, but here's a screenshot of some of the tweets, that look exactly like the stuff coming out of the Donald and other places they can try to influence us
       <a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5zdAjyJ">
        https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5zdAjyJ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's actually most disturbing is that people in communities like the Donald don't pick up on these forced narratives. Russia is showing just how good it is at making propaganda, that Americans will readily help to spread it.

       "political catfish"? Are you serious? Is this r/conspiracy? So let's talk about the deep state, how our government is trying to destroy our country, or at least keep us divided.. but when a Russian operative tries to undermind us, influence us, in order to weaken our country (that would only benefit the deep state), they're "political catfish". Not worth discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously don't get why this is so easily dismissed, unless the whole point is you agree with Russia?

       Yes I am serious, tweeting about how "liberalism is a mental disorder" isn't new to the political landscape. Just because a "Russian Operative" is also joining in on the shit posting doesn't mean that Vladimir Putin is spreading mass propaganda around and brainwashing the US. I enjoy conspiracies but this post is written like a CNN article

       Because.. fake news?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny when you'll embrace the idea that a certain news organization is fake news, but you'll quote them if they say something you agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the exact kind of thing Russia uses, and it works for you.. I examine everything I read, regardless of source, then I apply critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this true, is it an opinion, or is it just bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm like a CNN article, because CNN is just fake news?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus fucking Christ, the very fact that you would accept anything from one news source, is always fake, just shows how easily you're manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally, it's easy to see, how Russian propaganda works. CNN=bad, why? Actually.. you answer that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me some non Russian propaganda that shows CNN is fake news, in non meme form.

       Looking at your post history, I can see how my other comment gave you an out, a way to get away from the actual topic that we are supposed to be discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would a Russian be "shitposting" as a "Rhode Island native", that often?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does something have to be new to the political landscape to be relevant? Perhaps they introduced it and they try to keep it in the narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Me, personally, when Russians are obviously trying to pit one group of Americans at another, keep us divided, and maintain that divide.. that's an assault on America.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, going back to your post history, obviously we have plenty of people already doing that.. whether you're Russian or not, I'm sure they would be proud of your hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, you should look at it yourself, and seriously look yourself in the mirror, and decide if that's what kind of human being you want to be.

       So you ask me why CNN is fake news, once I provide plenty of sources you run away, now your telling me to "look inside yourself and see what kind of person you wanna be". I want to be the kind of person who doesn't paint an entire nation of people as a big scary boogey man because the only way that my side lost is because of cheating. How is a russian person pretending to be from rhode island even a conspiracy? Does every catfish on tinder deserve a fucking reddit post? Why don't you look into actual conspiracies like what happened to seth rich?

       I'm sure every 24 hour news station is guilty of the same, I'm sure fox is just as guilty, hell, I've seen it live on air.. but why are you building a list of CNN videos, what purpose do you have?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is a Russian operative (that you're defending) who's trying to divide our nation, using propaganda similar to yours, a conspiracy? Well fuck, you tell me, you're the one spending your time creating a list of "fake news" for.. what? Why not Fox?

       Seth Rich, also another thing the Russian tweeted about..
      </p>

       If you're not a Russian, you've come to accept everything they've pushed, and it's pathetic. The Donald really did kill brain cells. Go back to making fun of incels and trolling the Communists, making lists for Russia.. it's what you're good at.

       Who's talking about the election? This is pushing a very specific narrative now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's reasons people are still talking about Hillary daily, why you just felt it was a valid talking point.. what person ran for president and lost, besides her, and gets talked about constantly? Have you ever thought to question why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not since you came with that bullshit out of nowhere, rather than say anything of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's cool, defend mother Russia, deflect, compile more propaganda, and keep Putin happy.

       I agree. I would actually be far more interested in seeing how they're trying to manipulate the left. I'll admit, I'm left of center.. but the right (at least vote wise) will gladly upvote anything anti Killary, while the left doesn't seem nearly as united on any front. How do you manipulate people that can't agree on any particular message? I mean fuck, that's the simplest reason Hillary didn't stand a chance. There's no bullet points for someone on the left to run on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps they're sketchy, I don't know, but they have screenshots to back up their claim, and had enough foresight to create a document that archived what was said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly my computer just died, and Google docs cuts off the comments if I zoom out too much, hence the shitty screenshot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, I'd love to see how Russians try to influence the left, it's gotta be more than posting things for the right they think will trigger us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, Russia obviously is doing what they can to divide us, and from what I've seen.. it's working.

       The left and the right are both deeply fractured.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the right, you have the paleocons, the social conservatives, the big biz cons, the libertarians, the alt-right, the white supremacists, and neoreactionaries, just to name the major factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the left, you have the """""""""""""""""'Democrats""""""""""""""""' like Hillary, the Berniecrats, the Greens, the socialists, the SJWs and other idpol groups, the socdems, the demsocs, the socialists, and the communists to name the big groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the critical point in society will come when both lefties and righties realize that they generally (that is, discounting the nazis, the monarchists, and the tankies) are against tyranny. And when they realize that the mainstream left and mainstream right in Washington have joined forces and essentially become one party, we might finally see some real change.

       I've never seen so many labels, and honestly don't know what half of them are supposed to mean..
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll agree with what I think you were trying to say, once Americans stop worrying about labels, and truly realize there's an establishment that benefits from any and all labels, except the label of being an American.. that's when things might get better. Because we aren't defined by labels, we're defined as people who want America to be great again, aka, not run by the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one cause I've seen repeatedly said by the right, that I think no one on the left would argue against.. is term limits for anyone in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish, the idea that the left and the right both embraced as the most important change we need: term limits. No branch of our government should be run by people who have been in power more than 8 years, much less 20+ years, still ruling over us while they're on their death beds.

       Term limits will help, and I agree everyone should be for them, but I think the core of the issue is the deep state. And I'm not sure how to fix it besides outright revolution.

       Term limits would limit politicians ability to abuse power, it's a good first step.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I don't understand about the right right now, is how supportive they are of deregulating everything.. if there's a deep state, it's because the rich are too rich, and that money is what makes it possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no built in system for diminishing returns, that's what taxes used to be.. under Eisenhower, the tax rate for making 200k a year was 90%.. effectively, the richer you were, the more you paid in taxes. Diminishing returns. Mind you, 200k a year back then is equivalent to 1.7m a year now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think a revolution would accomplish anything, not if they're still well funded, and definitely not when we have a multi billionaire as president, with all branches under Republican control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't help that you have the Donald embracing the ideas of Russian propaganda, saying "they need to do what our president says", when I'm reality, most AMERICANS should understand that they should represent the states they were elected by.

       The "Russia narrative" that you speak of, would be Trump/Russia collusion.

       This has nothing to do with Trump, but everything to do with the "silent majority".

       Down vote me for saying this. Fuck Russia, fuck what they think we want, fuck them for pushing what they think is the "silent majority".

       Because anyone you don't agree with is antifa? Come on, get real. And whatever bullshit you're on about with Ukraine sounds like it would have come directly from the mouth of a Russian. You're welcome to post some links, but know I'm skeptical enough to not believe that's a duck on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       So show me this mountain of evidence? And you're literally commenting on the evidence that you say there's "zilch" of. A literal Russian posting as a Trump supporter, for who knows how long, each thing he said lines up with the talking points that actually get upvotes in the Donald.
      </p>

       Look at all those  0 retweets , handful of targeted people with typical right wing talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       you get more influence and exposure out of a typical conservative reddit poster.

       Click the second link, he gets plenty of retweets over time.. and really, what is more important is it confirms the concepts that Russia pushes for, so when you start seeing certain things get upvoted like crazy in The Donald, you can at least know the Russian propaganda is working.
      </p>
      <p>
       And really, I don't think you do get more influence out of a Reddit poster. The Donald is an echo chamber, who's going to see what they say, when they ban anyone who goes against what they say?
      </p>
      <p>
       We see them spew that shit in other places and they typically get slapped down quick..

       Found the Russian? /s?

       If you read the article, it's pretty strong evidence of the exact talking points I see made in social media from the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, how much evidence do you need to believe that Russians are trying to manipulate us? Do they need to do a Facebook live video, while in front of a Russian monument, while.. I can't even go on. What the fuck do you need to be convinced that Russia is trying to undermind the USA?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly. No bullshit. If you're sharing Russian propaganda, wouldn't you want to know about it?!

       Because anyone you don't agree with is antifa? Come on, get real. And whatever bullshit you're on about with Ukraine sounds like it would have come directly from the mouth of a Russian. You're welcome to post some links, but know I'm skeptical enough to not believe that's a duck on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       So show me this mountain of evidence? And you're literally commenting on the evidence that you say there's "zilch" of. A literal Russian posting as a Trump supporter, for who knows how long, each thing he said lines up with the talking points that actually get upvotes in the Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while you think you're special for realizing that's a duck on Mars, you're extra special if you can dismiss this without any actual reason.

       Who's talking about the election? This is pushing a very specific narrative now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's reasons people are still talking about Hillary daily, why you just felt it was a valid talking point.. what person ran for president and lost, besides her, and gets talked about constantly? Have you ever thought to question why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not since you came with that bullshit out of nowhere, rather than say anything of value.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's cool, defend mother Russia, deflect, compile more propaganda, and keep Putin happy.
