       It definitely is a star and planet alignment and sign over Jerusalem. But I don't see it as a sign of the rapture or the impending coming of Nibiru. I do think it's a sign marking the beginning of the Revelation Seals being opened. With the first seal opening with the rider on the white horse, the anti-Christ. But, again the exact timing of when the anti-christ announces himself to the world is unknown.

       Most of the world does not know the details of this alignment and the verse from Revelation. I think we can all agree on that. So it would come as a surprise to most everyone on earth, save for those in the 'secret society know' that are connected to the real powers that be, and conspiracy theorists/truth seekers. All others most likely don't know, or are informed with a small snippet from msn, yahoo!, bbc or their local weatherman.

       It's based on Revelation 12.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
       </p>
       <p>
        2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
       </p>
       <p>
        4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

       PSA: I think it's bullshit but I know at least what the alignment is
      </p>
      <p>
       Jupiter is in Virgo (leaving actually) and has been there for 9 months, the Sun is in Virgo, and the Moon is at the feet of Virgo. In addition, Three planets (Mars, Mercury, and Venus iirc) will be aligned and in Leo (which is at the head of Virgo), all of which is supposedly aligning with passages from Revelation 12
      </p>
      <p>
       12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun
       <em>
        (the sun is in Virgo)
       </em>
       , and the moon under her feet
       <em>
        (moon also in Virgo)
       </em>
       , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
       <em>
        (Leo's nine main stars and three planets in Leo)
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
        <em>
         (Jupiter has been in the "belly" of Virgo for 9 months and is in the process of leaving)

       Fair enough.  But you're presenting the info, and making a case for it, so you're the one who gets to handle the following "debate".
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are always sources.  And every year, the sources are the imagination of a religious zealot, filtered through the prism of the book, to project their own beliefs, hopes, fears, misunderstandings, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bible thumpers aren't the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       ones who do it.  "Channeling", new age frauds draw from the same well, year after year.  With how often we've been on the verge of the "Great Awakening", it's a miracle that anybody gets
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       amount of sleep, what with all the wakeyness going on.  We're always
       <em>
        so close
       </em>
       to the new age of aquarius (even though it's still hundreds of years away).

      <p>
       There's always an apocalypse to sell, and there's always a market of gullible chumps to buy what they're selling.

       The "prediction and prophecy" loosely (key term) fit on both an astronomical and religious level. There's a fair amount of stretching and weaving on both sides to make it work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that if you do believe it, you're taking a huge part of context out of literally the next 5 verses in Revelation, which pretty much tosses this whole thing out the window. Except nobody cares to read anything except the doom and gloom stuff.

       1) Not the first time in 7000 years. It's the 5th time in 1000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I don't need an hour and a half lecture to tell you nothing is going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) This stupid theory is thriving due to Bible misinterpretation and people who believe numerology has a place in Christian Eschatology.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) When nothing happens, it won't matter, since the "theory" or whatever you call it allows for months, if not years of a buffer period because it technically says it's the beginning of the end. So any stupid little event that happens tomorrow is going to get jumped all over by you and everyone else who believes this nonsense as a sign.

       See that's the issue, you're spreading misinformation without even understanding the entire situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are you completely circumventing and disregarding a bunch of the Bible, but you have no back up or support for your claims. I respect your opinion and what you believe, you're free to do so, but replying to comments and answering questions incorrectly only causes more confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to spread your opinion on why it's significant, at least explain to them why and how you came to said conclusion if they ask.

       Forgive me for assuming, but it's either going to be about Nibiru, or it'll AT LEAST make some kind of fathomable sense and talk about Rev12, the alignment, Jupiter, etc, and how it portrays to what they believe is the beginning of the end. I know, I know the story and the reason why people think it's significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody's going to watch a 90 minute lunatic spree though as evidence. Evidence is fact based, and if you legitimately believe something could be up, I highly recommend you shorten your arguments to key points. That literally goes for everything, that's a life tip. You just come off as a crackpot (forgive me for the term, I'm not actually saying you are one) If you say "World might end, here's a 90 minute YouTube video".

       3 separate people have "done the math" on the signs and all come to same conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       All sourced and if you bothered to wath Scotts video as i suggest maybe youd understand tomorrows alignment is unique.

       The 5 times in last 1000 years is wrong. Not all of the signs have happened.

       And if you read my comments ive already said this Niburu shit is a load of clickbait doomsday crap.

       Ive provided 2 informative non sensationalized videos and a sourced website.

       The coolest thing about the Book of Revelation, is that it reflects more information about the reader than it does the author.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been projecting their own beliefs and interpretations from this book for centuries.  They've been wrong all along.  And they'll be wrong tomorrow.  They'll be wrong the day after that, and for the next month's "apocalypse" too, and the next year's, and continuing on, into the future.

       You are incapable of free thought. Every conceivable thought you could possibly have has already been imagine by someone else already.

       The only reason you "think" is because of ideas that have been imparted onto you.

       You're a moronic thoughtless zombie.  You believe things based on no empirical scientific evidence.  You read these crapshoot conspiracy theories and instead of doing actual research you buy into their fearmongering illogical mumbo jumbo.  When absolutely nothing happens I hope you somehow come to the realization that you were a gullible dweeb.  But knowing you instead of admitting you are wrong and growing as a living person you'll make excuses and more excuses.

       There are several possible time lines for the "end days". Let us also remember that Revelation is just that: A vision given by God to John, so that he may record them. It's not a "play by play" with a set schedule or due date.

       Why would He have John record it?  You are leaving out other prophecies that more concrete and fast approaching like the one world govt and we will be losing the ability to use cash to buy or sell.  Together with those, this alignment has more validity. The other prophecies follow it.

       True dat, so if the elite do a false flag to deceive the world for Lucifer's return, then that may make the Rev 12 sign valid, as signs are meant to warn us of impending dangers.  But lets wait and see I don't expect thing to happen immediately after a sign, but the gears will be in motion.

       Most of the world does not know the details of this alignment and the verse from Revelation. I think we can all agree on that. So it would come as a surprise to most everyone on earth, save for those in the 'secret society know' that are connected to the real powers that be, and conspiracy theorists/truth seekers. All others most likely don't know, or are informed with a small snippet from msn, yahoo!, bbc or their local weatherman.
