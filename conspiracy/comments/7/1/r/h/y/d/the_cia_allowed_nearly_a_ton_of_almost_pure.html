        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since Venezuela went off the petrodollar, has the biggest oil reserve in the world, and is now being eyeballed for US &quot;intervention.&quot; I thought I&#39;d dig into their drug activity, as this is something the CIA is also interested in as a means to make off-the-books cash. </p>

<p>Came across this gem. Living up to their other name, The Cocaine Import Agency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CIA, in spite of objections from the Drug Enforcement Administration, in 1990 allowed at least one ton of nearly pure cocaine to be shipped into Miami International Airport. The CIA claimed to have done this as a way of gathering information about Colombian drug cartels. But the cocaine ended up being sold on the street.[37][38] </p>

<p>Of course people care, they&#39;re committing crimes then turning around and jailing people for committing the exact same crimes... and all on expense of our tax dollars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They let them make the deal in order to capture them and try to get to the head of the snake a very powerful men in Venezuela called diosdado cabello people thinks he controls a cartel called &quot;cartel de los soles&quot; the a drug cartel fueled by the military in Venezuela and ran by families tied directly to the actual president first lady cilia flores, they call them the narco sobrinos &quot; narco nephew&#39;s&quot; and are being held and prosecuted in New York right now, they are giving away crucial information on all the operation they have, from passport forgery to drug trafficking and weapon smugglin.</p>

<p>It all sounds like a Netflix movie but it&#39;s the freaking truth, about Venezuela nationalizing petroleum it was ok at the moment PDVSA ( Venezuelan only petroleum company) got nationalized in the Bonanza of 130$ per barrel, rendering the state 11 trillion dollars bonus, but and I must add somebody in PDVSA and the central bank stole almost all the money leaving PDVSA almost in bankruptcy, people think United States had money in there but it was the way around  50% of citgo it&#39;s from Venezuela broken and shaking PDVSA or was I don&#39;t know right now what&#39;s the status on that.</p>

<p>Now they are moving to China to plot against the US to sell futures on petroleum and gold to try to hit US economy and make it weak against Yuan and EUR but that&#39;s just me talking weird  things I read in the web! </p>
