<p>I watched this video and felt 100% this human wanted to die. Suicide by cop. So I remembered transgenders had a 40-50% chance of suicide in studies and wanted a discussion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mw2cJMYDmA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mw2cJMYDmA</a></p>

<p>I acknowledge everyone is born in different environments and bodies can receive more or less estrogen or testosterone, that can determine if they <strong>feel</strong> male or female. I am sure some are genuine and do not feel suicidal and happy with their gender choice.</p>

<p>However, shoving propaganda down our throats (like teachers radicalising our kids or liberals celebrities cross dressing their kids) does not help the situation and the issue is clearly obvious and a serious problem NONE OF THEM have openly talked about. The high suicide rate! Does that make sense because surely they know?? If they know, do they not care? To me, they don&#39;t!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the liberals put trams on a pedestal is a bit of a pushed narrative. Liberalism is all about personal freedom and broadening views and experiences. They defend trans, and I use defend purposely, because the freedom is thier believe. On the flip side, you live with the consequences of your choices in the liberal agenda. They fight for the choice regardless of effect.</p>

<p>I mentioned defend because Trans people being attacked goes against thier Liberty philosophy rather than a Trans agenda. All they want is Trans people to be treated like everyone else and do thier thing.</p>

<p>This is obviously against conservative family values. But for liberals it has nothing to do with family values rather than an alternate family value agenda.</p>

<p>Point: Why do libs put trans on a pedestal </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s part of cultural marxism/political correctness. Where classical Marxism says workers are oppressed by rich capitalists, cultural Marxism states that all minorities are oppressed by the majority.</p>

<p>Once you understand this, it makes sense why majority ethnicity (white), religion (Christian), sexual orientation (straight) and gender (male) are open to unending criticism and attack. While everyone else is suddenly cool.</p>

<p>The problem here is that this weakens society by dividing it up across all kinds of lines ie. identity politics. Not only that, but many attitudes and practices that are unhealthy for individuals and society are being promoted. Tolerance is one thing, but when you start promoting (and even celebrating) things that weaken your society/nation, there are always consequences.</p>

<p>If someone wants to surgically remove their peepee, let them. But don&#39;t expect me to cheer them on or even care about it. And don&#39;t try and teach my kids that there&#39;s anything special or wonderful about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, &quot;science&quot; does not say either male or female, and basic googling would tell you that.  It is not a state of mind.  There&#39;s lots of things that you used to be classified as mental illness that no longer are.</p>

<p>It all reads like you have issues with liberals, which is weird, because you talk about peace and love and no bashing, which are liberal values.</p>

<p>You act like people are being forced to be transgender and that&#39;s why they&#39;re suicidal.  Nah, it couldn&#39;t be the bullying and lack of acceptance, could it?</p>

<p>Who are these celebrities that you say are cross dressing their children, and why should you care?  I&#39;m guessing you mean someone&#39;s son is wearing dresses, because I can&#39;t figure out how a girl would dress like a boy.</p>

<p>Just try opening your mind a little bit and be more accepting of people and maybe the suicide rate wouldn&#39;t be so high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In human beings, science say male and female, you&#39;re wrong. I do not have to google to know this because it is common sense. Women are impregnated BY MEN, babies are born and the cycle continues. You cannot argue you need two men to be able to conceive, or vice versa. It is IMPOSSIBLE.</p>

<p>And so back to full circle. You linked acceptance of transgenders as the one cause of a high suicide rate. Therefore you agree with me that there is a such a thing as a high suicide rate among them. Then you state that it may be because of people&#39;s rejection causes this high rate. </p>

<p>Did you read what I wrote? I said that it is mental disorder. If one is bullied or feel rejected, AND THEN COMMIT SUICIDE because of it, that is the classic definition of mental illness. it is not I accept them, or you, or millions of people, it is self acceptance that would make them whole. Even you, who clearly support these people, are propagating misinforming and division, hence creating this suicide cycle, and not solving anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, gender identifies a set of physical traits, which you can objectively identify. Gender is only important from health and reproductive perspectives. </p>

<p>Any other meaning tied to it is social and mental. People are objectively male or female (or hermaphroditic but that&#39;s a whole other conversation).</p>

<p>If someone thinks they are a different gender than they are, that is a mental perception of themselves. Which is fine by me, they aren&#39;t hurting anybody by thinking so. It&#39;s still a socially accepted mental illness though. In spite of all evidence to the contrary, they believe something other than reality. </p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone calls themselves because it shouldn&#39;t mean a damn thing to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a product of population density. As more people are crowded into smaller spaces we will see more of non-reproducing strategies. Our species will continue to grow but a side effect will be a certain number of these behaviors that are supportive of the population but not increasing it. Other cultures have produced other solutions. If you really want to know what is happening you have to study from a really larger perspective. Some cultures send there children off the be killed others, becoming part of a monistic movement, imprisonment, suicide or find a way to curb growth through gender or roll reassignment. MOHO is to get women on board they are the controlling factor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got it thanks. I don&#39;t have a FB and I read an article a while back talking about how they added new genders to the drop down list.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad that we have now progressed and people who have no idea what gender is and think it means any emotion they feel is a gender. (i.e. a helicopter) can finally have equality!</p>
