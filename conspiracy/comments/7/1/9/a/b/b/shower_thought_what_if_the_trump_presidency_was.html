<p>I would suggest reading <em>Lloyd&#39;s Introduction to jurisprudence</em> and <em>Introduction to Jurisprudence and Legal Theory</em>.  If you are actually interested in the implications, then review <em>Connally v General Construction Co. 269US385 (1926)</em>.  If you are still confused following that, which I doubt would be possible, then I&#39;d be happy to simplify for you further.  But unless you show some initiative in regards to educating yourself, I&#39;m not going to sit here and teach you something you can readily learn for yourself.</p>

<p>Superficially it seems interesting, but to anybody who has actually studied the matter, you see that it falls apart quickly.
