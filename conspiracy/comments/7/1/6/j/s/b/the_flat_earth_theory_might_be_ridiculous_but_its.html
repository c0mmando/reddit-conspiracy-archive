<p>There are also physicists who spend their lives proving the Earth is flat, in isolated geodetic grid sections.</p>

<p>Also a bunch of physicists who argue that the Earth isn&#39;t round so much as space-time is. </p>

<p>Belief in a round earth is no different than belief in a flat earth. It&#39;s still a belief. How can it be a round ball in a flat universe? (Rhetorical question)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is measurably flat in a local frame (according to the leading theories and people who model it) so your claim is empirically false.</p>

<p>Officially, up to 260km2. </p>

<p>One would have to do a spherical triangle experiment to get as close to a direct measurement as possible to measure the geodetic frames and larger geodesy of the Earth. Limiting the required &quot;belief&quot;.</p>

<p>That experiment has never been done (at least not easily available to the public). Nor have the angular deviations (to level) between geodetic frames, been measured and benchmarked in simplistic modelling.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t argue that the Earth is flat so much as it simply notes how belief is required for either, as an absolutist claim cannot be supported the way it&#39;s implied. Not even in the official interpretations are the claims supported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh &quot;credibility&quot; - Appeal to Authority. Again.</p>

<p>It was already stated that both interpretations require belief. They require modelling. Direct observation is the only means to impart knowledge and in that some things can never be truly &quot;known.&quot; The most direct measurement for the Earth was never done [or doesn&#39;t seem available publicly]</p>

<p>The geodesy is mapped using <a href="http://fgg-web.fgg.uni-lj.si/%7E/mkuhar/Zalozba/Geodesy_Gravity_Wahr.pdf">gravitational potential</a> and by definition, gravity is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus gravitation is interpreted geometrically as an effect of the <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA084099">curvature of space-time.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you apply both concepts together Earth is not modelling as a sphere, it&#39;s a gravitational potential of warped space time - that the geodesy is derived from.</p>

<p>Evidence was provided it appears to beyond your reasoning skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes a 360 degree field of vision yields a 360 degree horizon. That same image can be taken at 1 km, 10 km, or 100 km or 300 km. The actual area of the earth in view is only a few hundred/thousand kilometres.</p>

<p>Which means the curvature seen in the photograph-video does not represent the actual curvature of the earth [in fact the curvature would have to be measured from the nadir point to the horizon]. </p>

<p>The horizon will always be 2 radians of view [just as it is on the flat plane from a local perspective], and there will always be a circle underneath. If it were flat or a sphere [though the former would require vanishing points - the latter uses the sphere model]. </p>

<p>If you were on top of a large enough flat, square surface, it would also appear round because of vanishing points and perspective.</p>

<p>This is why flat earthers get bent out of shape over the apparent size and shape of continents vs the larger earth. Yet neither believers [sphere or flat] like discussing this subject. There are some very peculiar attributes when analyzing it.</p>

<p>The ISS cannot actually take a picture of the Earth (officially), they can only few something like ~1500 kilometres of it. It has a 360 degree horizon. It&#39;s not the curvature since it has a 360 degree horizon no matter the height above it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loaded question. It could be modelled as either as already stated. Do you think it shows a sphere? How?</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/iv6jtkg.png">Tell me if you see anything intuitively strange in this model (which was done to scale</a></p>

<p>This is what the ISS sees. That black circle is the true field of view on the spherical model. On a flat model is merely a small sub-section of it with vanishing points.</p>

<p>Hopefully you weren&#39;t under the impression/assumption that the ISS was videoing the entire earth in frame. </p>

<p>ISS travels 17,150 mi/h, 90 minutes per orbit. Circumference of Earth is 24,901 mi. </p>

<p>5400 seconds of travel. Each second 4.6 mi of earth should enter and exit the FOV. 60 seconds is 276 mi or 444 km.</p>

<p>There is something that is amiss however. <a href="http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/hdist.htm">Distance to horizon puts the distance to horizon from ISS as 1500km, the total viewing area ~3000km.</a></p>

<p>However if you actually watch a livestream and note the time it takes for something to come into and exit the field of view, it&#39;s about 60-90 seconds. Which implies 444km - 666km from one angle. It&#39;s about half of what it&#39;s supposed to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly deny history, in so far as the historical narrative is controlled by the powers that be, scientific theory is useful, but it&#39;s not the end all, be all, accepting mainstream science blindly, without performing your own experiments, is letting others dictate your worldview, if you blindly trust paid government scientists and your textbooks, that&#39;s on you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with this. nothing can be trusted to be true because we make things up as we go. to have blind faith in science, religion, etc is pointless because sooner or later it will be &#39;prove&#39; otherwise. 
especially when scientific study is controlled by the government.
that being said it is always interesting to listen to flat earthers because their reality is so different and their understanding/denial(what have you) is completely different from yours. </p>
