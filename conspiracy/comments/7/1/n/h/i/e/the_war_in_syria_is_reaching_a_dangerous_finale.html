      <p>
       US/Israel coalition fucked up royally in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turkey has agreed to clean up the Idlib Province of HTS. It has moved few forces into Dlib border area. Russia has given US a warning that Syrian or Russian task forces operating near Deir Ezzor city would soon turn their attention to Oil fields and SDF will be met with fierce fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syrian war took a turn when:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         US tried a coup against Erdogan.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They turned against Qatar who was a major player in the Syrian war effort.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They have lost the trust of the Iraq government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They positioned and used Kurds who want to only gain Land.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Iraq has turned to Iran as a major supporter in the region. Turkey feels threatened and is looking to Russian aid and advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have lost all region except the oil fields which the SDF has no claim to internationally, so fighting for this would really expose their game in Syria. This is why an NK nuke distraction is needed asap to cover the Insane news that American Military is fighting in Syria to stop the Syrian government from taking back its legal government owned oil fields. We can't have the masses figuring out the US is squatting on Syrian oil fields? Cue the NK distractions and nuke fear porn!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The MiddleEast hasn't ever looked this anti American.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: The Zionists are one false flag away WWE.

       Erdogon befriended Russia after the coup. Russia accepted even though turkey had shot down one of their jets.

       Not sure what this has to do with the sandpeople king staging the coup himself. Obviously him and putin have a lot in common and a nice arms deal certainly helps to further that friendship.

       Even if the sultan was behind it, we (or just I) don't know what/who was behind him, and this is focusing on one sub-issue of the post – a bit of forum sliding.

       The war in Syria is turned Twice against the zionists. 
1. When Russia stepped in 2014
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         During the Erdogan coup attempt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Qatar bizarre embargo.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       We know that the war turned at this point because Turkey halted all terrorist movements through its border regions. At this point, we say the Zionist Coalition move away from FSA forces to the SDF forces along the north border regions of Syria/ Turkey to army the Kurdish forces in that region and like clock work the Media started the Kurdish fighters propaganda in the west. This move was clear to anyone that the Zionsts were changing their strategy to counter Turkey. Erdogan felt this pressure heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Qatar did not like the new strategy to destablize Turkey. When Zionists made this move and abandoned Qatar's FSA and Isis militants, it pissed off many players invested in the Syria war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war in Syria morphed into a Kurdish  State. All the players involved like Tukey, Qatar, Jordan suddenly found themselves supporting the future destabilization of Turkey and  Iraq tp create a vassal Kurdish State for the Zionists to occupy for "peace".

       No, I do not believe you and other people like you who, inundated with propaganda, say you want to defend troops who have invaded another country that did absolutely nothing to us, are malicious.  That's completely not the point I'm making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I'm making is that you saying you want to defend the American troops (who are in fact invading another country and murdering innocent people) is a signal for you to question your own beliefs that were molded by said propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nonsensical to suggest people who have invaded a country deserve "protection."  They do not, except by their own leaders who have put them in harm's way for financial gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in the country that has been invaded have every right to defend themselves against American troops, and that puts those troops in harm's way.

       Ummm.  I'm not sure how many ways I can explain this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll give one last shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you invade someone's home, and they pull a gun on you, and you shoot them dead first, who was wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting you "turn on the troops."  (Although your saying that proves how badly propagandized you really are).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're killing people who have done nothing wrong, you're wrong.  And you do what you have to do not to, you don't just say, "Well, I'll just kill innocent people for the  six months I'm here and when I'm done I won't kill anymore innocent people."
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you do kill them in their home, you don't deserve protection from those innocent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we agree on this- you do deserve protection from the imperialists who put you there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't being insulting.  I was explaining my point which you specifically asked for- you just don't like my point Bc it reveals your cognitive dissonance about this issue.

       I'm not sure why you continue to call my disagreement insults.  Please know that there is no intention to insult and the assumption that there is is yours and yours alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe you like to use the insult line to create empathy for your points from any readers.  No worries.  Likely no one else but you and I are reading this by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if anyone else is reading (besides OP alts), then I ask specifically that said reader take all comments equally and fairly; please do not assume I'm right simply bc I make better points and substantiate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So- you continue to put conditions upon what is a very simple point: you shouldn't kill someone who has done nothing to harm you- even if you joined the military and that's what they tell you to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We teach this in our preschools, 
right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's return to our analogy.  We have an intruder and a homeowner, and you've suggested that if the intruder has seen photos or other evidence of homeowner's wrongdoing, then he has every right to break and enter, then kill the homeowner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that how any of this works, friend?  If you have a friend tell you her child was molested, does someone in your friend group vanish in the middle of the night, vigilante style?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do we rely on a system where the police arrest the suspect, the suspect goes to trial and is found guilty/innocent, and the consequences are prescribed by the laws of the land?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to you, nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our. Troops. Are. In. Their. Home.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an American soldier has such little integrity that s/he cannot see that murdering innocent people in their own home is wrong, then they do not deserve any protection from those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't get any simpler than "don't kill people who haven't done anything wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think of my own life, as brainwashed  as I was, I cannot recall a time that I would have murdered any person innocent of wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And neither should they.

       Well its a great sub to follow the war day by day with all information available .  Most users would not be of a conspiracy mind ,rather in dealing in facts ,evidence ,and trusting the word and statements of military and media . A lot of those people refuse to see the bigger picture until there is undeniable evidence produced , such as the evidence of 2.2 billion dollars of weapons transferred to what they know are jihadists  but laughably call moderates. One just has to listen to Trump over last few days and his promise to tear up the deal with Iran . That means war and a big regional one at that . They have tried various methods and proxy groups to splinter ,weaken , and isolate Syria ,but all have failed due to Russia and Iran .  The latest and final effort is the Kurds seizing lands and oil fields near the Iraq border . When this fails the only option left  is the Zionist provoked war against Lebanon and Iran. Its quite obvious and they ratchet up the rhetoric a little more each day now .

      <p>
       This is just Turkish propaganda. There is a greater likelihood that Erdogan himself arranged this false-flag of a coup so he could undermine the military, attack political opponents such as the HDP, and get a vote on the imperial presidency, all of which he was able to achieve. It was all a textbook strategy by an authoritarian, who now runs Turkey along with his AKP allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the SDF are no zionist puppets. Instead, they have been the most effective anti-ISIS force in Syria, but who are the people that have most often used this "puppets of Israel" attack against the SDF? Turks, especially those of the pro-Erdogan/Islamist variety.

      <p>
       Syria doesn't have great oil resources, which is why it wasn't even a top-fifty producer of oil before the war. Yes, the SDF would love to use the oil fields as a bargaining chip with the Assad government, but this war isn't by seizing Sryia's oil by any means just because it's a pittance amount of it compared to what the US produces just by itself.

       the kurds have been bought out with the promise of statehood by the US and Israel. its pretty obvious watching this from the start ISIS is controlled by US/Israel and they have been transferring ISIS held land to them to stop the SAA taking it back. now that we are nearing the end of ISIS the Kurds are making bold statements claiming they wont let the Syrian government cross the Euphrates river and retake oil fields from ISIS. lately the SDF have been taking land in Deir Ez Zor with no real resistance whatsoever because the US needs them to take the oil fields before the SAA get there first. when Erdogan realised the US was going with plan B and backing the kurds he carried out a false coup to consolidate power and launched an invasion into Syria. the aim of the US/Israel now is to get Kurdistan recognized and build loads of bases there as a buffer between Iraq/Syria and Iran.

       ISIS/ISIL used to be a part of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which was al-Zarqāwī's group that fought the US occupation in that nation.

        especially after he released Salafists from jail in an attempt to undermine the early opposition to the regime.

       The SDF is pragmatic. I don't see them going to war over a few oil fields. I suspect that they will use these resources as bargaining chips in the future.

       Useless idiots? I wholly disagree. The SDF/YPG has been possibly the most important anti-ISIS force in Syria, defeating the caliphate's jihadists in a number of major battles, including in Raqqa, ISIS's capital city, which is on the verge of falling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SAA's recent liberation of Deir-Ezzor wouldn't even have been possible if it weren't for the SDF clearing out ISIS around Tabqa and Raqqa.

       Israel has no involvement with the SDF, providing them with no funds or weapons, so I have no idea what you are even bringing them up. Also, the YPG (which is the backbone of the SDF) is on friendly terms with Russia in Afrin, the northwestern part of Syria, so it's far more complicated of a situation than you're making it out to be.

       Exactly, the end goal of zionist was to creat a giant crater of disputed Kurdish state smack in the Middle of the border regions of Irab
n, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. They made that map to divide this region in 2000! Their plans have not changed.Turkey was the last hold out with Iran as well.

       So I guess Nixon never pulled off Watergate and Iran-Contra was just a lie too, right? Because, love it or hate it, the Washington Post has been a major player in uncovering government malfeasance in the past.

       I certainly don't trust Turkish state media (such as The Daily Sabah) more than Western media, which at least follows some ethical rules even if they always don't live up to it.

       Erdogan and the AKP have been critical of Israel for some time now and they aren't exactly best buddies right. In fact, people within the AKP are more likely to accuse the CIA and Israel of staging the coup more than anything else.

       MSM will not tell you what the war in Syria is really about, so I will give it a go, having read plenty on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US and its allies want to run a gas pipeline from Qatar to Europe and It has to pass through Syria to get there. Being aligned with Russia, Syria said no, as it would disrupt Russian gas sales to Europe. So Assad had to go, but Russia to protect their gas sales, which are a huge source of income for them, entered the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that the US have screwed up this time and unless they commit ground troops, risking a direct fight with Russia, they may lose this particular land grab. The US backed Turkey coup attempt, was another screw up. The pipeline needs to go though Turkey as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is up to its eyeballs in this as well. Smashing Syria fits with their long term greater Israel strategy. Also no more Syria means they get to keep the Golan Heights. Can't hand them back to the rightful owner if they don't exist anymore.
