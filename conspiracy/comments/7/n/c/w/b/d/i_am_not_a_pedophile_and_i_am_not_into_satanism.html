       That's funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some who still maintain that Nancy Reagan was tasked with picking up the slack when "Ronnie" was diminished from dementia and that she engaged and relied upon the advice an astrologer for guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows if it's accurate. The whole political/media struggle is fraught with peril.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks, I never cared for the Reagans, especially "just say no" (Hollywood blowjob queen) Nancy. I thought they were an ideological and moral facade.

       Probably what most here have done. Try and spread awareness of the subject and facts pertaining to the case, as well as the coincidences that we in the conspiracy forums view (some do at least) it as circumstantial evidence. Weather or not you believe thats enough to convict is irrelevant, as otgers will retain their perogatives and perspectives.

       I believe in proof and a fair investigation. Because if someone can be convicted based on speculation then there's nothing stopping the government just throwing wild claims around about us, and convicting us based on speculation - Rather than proof.

       Amazing how that "nothing" lead to a couple of indictments and guilty pleas.  I'd be amazed to see what "something" looks like.

       The investigation isn't just into Trump.. it's into his campaign and their relationship with Russia.  The indictments involved members of his campaign working with Russia and lying about it under oath.  I mean, I guess it is possible that Trump hired people to work for his campaign and they went behind his back to meet with Russians in an effort to help the Trump campaign for the Presidency and he knew nothing about anything going on.  Sure.. We'll have to wait until the investigation is actually complete to know for sure.

       I love the part in the thread where the strawman comments start getting upvotes, as if to pretend people actually think, you included, the person you're responding to believes weird should equal a prison sentence. So obviously disingenuous.

       Personally with you on this, been to a lot of Art shows and there is some crazy shit out there. Some people like shock value art. I looked up stuff he has, some were like never ending fantasy movie type things. The kids in the bathroom are what people trip on him for. They make me cringe that he has them, but if some 50 year old Japanese woman artist had them, there would be no issue.

       Very well said. Your use of the word deviancy is perfectly chosen.

       I reject the normalization of things that harm all other humans, regardless of their race, age, sex, or nationality. This includes the current machinations of MSM in their vile gender mutilation nonsense.

       Camile Paglia, a noted liberal (not leftist) said it best, (paraphrased) ...you can do whatever you want to your genitalia, every cell in your body is what you were born as, and none of these homosexual men or women engaging in civil unions, in the legal sense, are meeting any test requisite of deeming it a "marriage."

       I would be willing to bet that someone as overtly creepy as Podesta and his ilk, can only go down one path - that of a true anti-human monster.

       You sure are right -  People who place high value on money have never had
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is more valuable than time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once, I wanted to return a favor to a doctor, and I could not think of what to give him. He had everything, materially, that he needed. Everything I thought of was either trite or was going to cause him to have to spend time or effort...(baseball tickets, dinner gift card, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he had just bought a new car, a BMW M5, for his wife. He drove it over and I got to see it, drive it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought him this $25 bottle of car wax. The best. He had to pay someone to wax the car, 'cause he had no time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told him I felt bad, cause, in the end, it cost him. I told him the only thing it seemed like he didn't have was time. So, I asked, "How could you give someone a gift of time - unless you were simply doing something for them instead of them doing it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       We never came up with an good answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, I got him a bottle of decent wine, nothing special, just a nice inexpensive, tasty white wine - because he was a good friend...I could ask advice, etc. He called me and said he and his wife had a couple of steaks and drank that wine and did
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       the night before, just took a break. From all the running, and schedules. The time they "made" was more valuable than the steaks, the wine, or the wax.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can one give a gift of time? Its worth is incalculable.

       I think he's at U. of CT. He made a study of the relationship between population growth and affluence based upon the prevalence and size of ancient Greek coin hoards?

       I doubt it's so much knowledge that's lacking, but rather being able to manage it/who controls both the knowledge and the pathways.

       How the hell does one land on the path to being a societal anthropologist? I suppose it helps to have a father who was a principal in the study of AI who gets exiled from the U.S.S.R. (Yes I had to look it up)

       There were actually three Djurdjevic paintings that Podesta displayed on his walls:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://i.imgur.com/h2dY2sy.png">
         Biljana Djurdjevic, "School Girl", 2005, Paradise Lost series

       <li>
        <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lTK0UBH.png">
         Biljana Djurdjevic, "Synchronized Swimming", 2007/2008, Living in Oblivion Series
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0vekdCZ.png">
         Biljana Djurdjevic, "Moor", 2010, Hotbed series
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The art in Tony Podesta's home was featured in
       <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">
        this June 2015 article
       </a>
       . I've collected the images from that in
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2enor">
        this imgur album
       </a>
       . There's quite a range of art, including the three paintings by Djurdjevic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tony Podesta and his then-wife Heather had a vast collection of art, numbering more than 2000 museum-quality works at its peak, before they divorced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some works from their collection:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mbNkA">
         Album 1
        </a>
        - Many from the
        <a href="https://nmwa.org/">

       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/a/zOujY">
         Album 3
        </a>
        - From the
        <a href="http://www.phillipscollection.org/search?i=1&amp;amp;tpc_q=Podesta&amp;amp;q1=Collection&amp;amp;x1=tpc_type">

         National Gallery Art pieces from the Podesta Collection
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As you can see, there's a wide variety of art. A few pieces in his collection have disturbing themes, but I dare anybody to explain in complete sentences what's wrong with that. Some of the most popular art has disturbing themes.

       "Some of the most popular art" as you put it, is really only popular among a small elite group of exclusive gallery owners and art merchants who flog it as the next "most popular" thing or most up and coming artist and the extremely wealthy patrons and fawning art critics alike who are all willing to applaud and go along with those announcements like a bunch of trained seals, not to mention paying exorbitant and ridiculous prices for it, or putting it on display to show just how very smart, modern, sophisticated, and above all the rest of us, they happen to think they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the vast majority of people wouldn't give you ten cents for most of it or need to view it for more for than 10 seconds before telling you that it's a lot of pretentious and trumped-up nonsense without any redeeming or artistic merit that they can humanly perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       That in their eyes it's nothing more than the wealthy and extremely wealthy being self-indulgent, extravagant, decadent and deliberately provocative for no other reason than that they have the money to do it and get away with it and there's nothing they like better than being able to flaunt that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now no one ever argues with or disagrees about the obvious artistic qualities or merits all those same ordinary people happen to perceive when it comes to the music, literature, theatre or films that they individually and collectively make "popular" in a very big way or as widely known and appreciated as they eventually become or even being referring to as "classics" in their ability to remain poignant and relevant against the test of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, they're quite capable of discerning and perceiving works that both have and have more artistic merit and qualities to them than others and their judgement about how appealing or impressive, interesting or important they feel any of those works to be is by and large both reliable and valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I posit to you that their sensibilities and verdict on a so called "art world" filled with so called "popular works" that they aren't impressed or moved to appreciate or support in any way, shape, or form is in fact just as sound and will always have and be the very last word on that.

       It's a lie because Tony Podesta doesn't own any of the art in question. Even if you read the sources put forth by pizzagate people you will see that. They take creepy looking paintings by an artist and tries to make it look like Podesta owns them when he does not. He owns other, less offensive art by that same artist.

       It's a lie, just like the rest of Pizzagate is a lie.

       It sounds more like you are interested in wasting my time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have an opinion that [the] Sun does not exist, I might be interested in what makes you think that way, or even question your seemingly odd perception, relative to my own. Just because I was instructed that there is a Sun and that since we can observe something that is labeled the "Sun", does not negate your opinion. You are free to deny its existence, call it something else, or question my opinion, regardless. Don't think that I am going to drag you kicking and screaming into the sunlight,hold you by the ears, point and yell, "See it's right there". I am not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not lack evidence that having artistic depictions of children in suggestive poses is counter to my idea of someone who is contributing to a stable society, because it is my opinion based on my life experience. That life experience of viewing both productive and counterproductive behaviors, in itself, is evidence enough for me to form a perfectly valid opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is your prerogative to argue to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a mistake for you to deny the existence of the perverse artifacts that were being discussed, clearly as mistaken as you would be to tell me I cannot reasonably consider their possession and/or display to be the behavior of a fucking creep.

      <p>
       I am not responsible for your porch, or your delusions.

       Further, you "lol" far more than someone I would generally take seriously. Pediatric sado-machism is not a laughing matter.

       I don’t want to be rude, but perhaps if you look at Djurdjevics paintings of children and instantly think pedophilia, then you might be over-sexualizing the human body (not surprising or necessarily your fault if you are American).
      </p>
      <p>
       If that’s the case, then don’t ever set foot in a German Sauna or your head might explode.  Or maybe you’d just call die Polizei (lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       Djurdjevic has a fairly easily recognizable theme in her art (admittedly not the most original theme) of depicting humans in peculiar or gruesome situations; perhaps to convey a feeling of uncomfortable self-awareness?  Maybe.  Existential dread?  Maybe.  Or maybe she’s just trying to normalize the human body and tragedy by depicting different types of people in vulnerable situations.  Or maybe it’s meaningless to her.  If you can’t look at her paintings of children and not comprehend that she obviously didn’t make that for pedophiles, then you’re maybe just a one dimensional thinker when it comes to art.  Or worse: you’re projecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not even that into her work and I can still easily recognize that she wasn’t intending to make ‘pedo art’ as you say.  It honestly wouldn’t have crossed my mind unless somebody mentioned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are over-sexualizing the human body, as I stated
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Going into viewing her art with a preconceived thought that it’s pedophile art (almost as if the title of an article told you to do so)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>

       Undetermined. All we actually know is that he has been close friends with our country's most powerful child molester since they were in their twenties. Him and Hastert, Camp Nose, Japan. Having art that alludes to child abuse and torture while keeping company like that makes him suspicious to some people.

       No, we don't know that. He wrote in an email that he'd kept in touch with Hastert, not that he was close friends. And that was written before the abuse allegations came out. And of course he would have kept in touch: he was a political lobbyist for crissakes and Hastert was speaker of the  House of Representatives! He'd have been a shit lobbyist if he didn't keep in touch with someone so politically prominent.

       You may be too young to realise this yet, but most people over the course of their lives meet someone who has or who will break the law. That does not make them complicit in the other's crimes.

       He kept in touch with a buddy he met at an overseas 'young leaders' camp, for 50 years, as they both became two of the most powerful people in DC/on the planet. Podesta hired his son. I'm comfortable presuming this friendship is of the 'close' variety, don't care if you aren't.

       If you think Hastert rose to 2nd in line to the presidency without this dirt ever being uncovered you are a child. Somebody knew in DC. Wonder who?

       Josh Hastert was a lobbyist. He got a job with Podesta's firm. Even if Podesta personally intervened in his hiring, how does that implicate him in Hastert's crimes?

       These conversations always devolve into this strawman - no claims of crimes committed have been put forth here, don't know why you are making it sound like they have. But I am certainly making a claim that his relationship with Hastert and the incestuous nature of DC power players makes it hard for me to believe he had 0% knowledge of his abuse. If this last sentence stirs some feverish defensiveness in you, I simply don't know why.

       How exactly do you find out that someone abused a child if that child is not talking? Sadly, it is not uncommon for people abused as children to keep quiet about the abuse because of misplaced feelings of guilt or because they don't think they'd be believed or because the abuser threatened them  with terrible consequences if they told. It's not uncommon for years or decades to pass before they reveal the abuse (if they ever do). So, how do you dig up that kind of dirt? It fits your conspiracy theory to think that people in power must have known but that's not necessarily the case.

       I'm comfortable with this - if you have known Hastert for 50 years and you're meteoric rise through the DC power structure was coterminous with his, then I would consider that person likely to be 'in the know', wonder who else falls in this camp
      </p>
      <p>
       The abused victim was receiving regular large cash payments from Hastert, that was how this story eventually broke to the public, his withdrawals were violating basic banking guidelines. Do you think you could rise to the position of Speaker of the House while making regular hush money payments without anybody else in DC finding out? Seems far fetched to me. More likely plenty of people knew, and thats how he was controlled and allowed to rise up the ranks. "Nobody knew and they were all in shock" just seems ridiculous frankly.

       No it's not. If you're saying that you don't think Podesta is a child abuser then why do you care what art he owns or who he knows?

       That pretty much says it all. You want to believe in conspiracies involving political figures being "controlled" and "allowed to rise up the ranks" based on zero evidence. To me, that's what's ridiculous.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Should we wait thirty years for the victims to come forward with a weirdly signed yearbook?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes. Unless you have evidence of illegality or reasonable cause (and 4chan made-up "code words" is certainly not that), then yes, you have to wait for a complaint to be made. You can't just call the police on someone because you don't like their taste in art.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are you expecting trafficked children to call the police, jump on Twitter?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You have no evidence there are any children being trafficked. I could likewise insist that the police investigate you for murder because your victims can't complain. See what a nonsense that becomes?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I guess, let it go and wait 30 years??
Let what go? You're constantly begging the question and assuming that it's a fact that they're abusing children.

       The theme though...May just be an indication of a politician with power liking younger grls and not the a child trafficking ring.

       Just one politician that had a proliferation for..blood, semen and feces that was next to the expected  2016 POTUS who exuded an information-lockdown type of autocratic government. So nobody dared asks a tough question, not the MSM who were lickin their lips at killing NN and getting their monopoly on lockdown.

       Anyone who did ask a tough question was let go from their job, because the twisted fucks realized "if we want what we bought(kill NetNetr,Make warheads, bring SLAVE labour from 3rd world) we need to make sure hillary wins"

       was a bit of performance art that later became a book of "recipes", then became a name used by Abramovic for social dinners. There was never any actual ingestion of blood or semen or breast milk. Have you even bothered to read the recipes in
       <em>
        Spirit Cooking

       ?

        They're obviously allegorical and not meant literally.
       </a>
       They have a recipe calling for 13,000 grams of jealousy, meals of rose quartz, obsidian, and tourmaline, and drinks of liquid silver. they also mention being on top of a volcano. But pizzagaters only ever mention the breast milk and semen because to talk about the rest would reveal that it's just art. It's like claiming Harry Potter is a real-life course in witchcraft.

       News anchors and pundits won't show the works of podesta or jimmycomet because doing so would break the law, cant distribute depictions of minors engaged in sexual acts..especially for the purpose of making money(read, MSM is fakenews).
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure the inmate in PC think its just art as well... So many tentacles of corruption have infected everything just trying to get good optics in the 2016 election, still no real reason why Alefantis, a deviant that wouldve turned up in any security checks, was allowed to get close to the president.

       Bullshit. None of the artworks Podesta is said to own shows minors engaged in sexual acts. Some of Alefantis's Instagram images were sexually explicit but they were all of adults. Stop making shit up.

       Show me where the White House ever claimed to have spent that much on hot dogs. All you have is an email where someone says they heard they spent that much. That's taking gossip as fact and then inventing a child abuse conspiracy to explain it.

       Not likely "art" in your grandfather's books, more like "souvenirs" or "mementos" taken from a tough foe in tough contest that he was lucky to come back from, because a lot of others didn't.

       They probably weren't anything you could say he actually admired or valued, either, simply remembrances of a significant point and time in his life that he'd never forget for all kinds of reasons.

       Absolutely right, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you collect Nazi memorabillia, aaannnddd
      </p>
      <p>
       Have pictures of nazi bigwigs, listen to racist skinhead music. Hang classic German art. won't associate with nonwhites, into runes, Nordic pagan religion. Speak or write out Nazi code (,"88" "14 words" rahowa, uses 3 parenthesis around a person's name to indicate they are a Jew,) hang out with old guys who were fascists in the "good old days", support far right businesses like guys that sell old flags and surplus German gear.  Suspicious Nazi friends.etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then nobody would be crazy to think you a neo Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       So compare to podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hangs peado type art in his home. He hangs out with this lady who is an thelemic occultist with links to Aliester Crowley. He types out code that matches peado code ("pizza" "Domino's" MAP- Minor Attracted Person) associates with non relative people that drop thier kids off in his pool as his  "entertainment' he is friends with Alefantis, a guy with many disturbing child abuse images on his Instagram. Also has his profile pic  of a roman emperor known for peadophilia. Associated with a related business that shares they're logo with a peado code. Also associated with bizzare musicians with a peado bent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's match em in both scenarios. . They both hang art that relates to the accusation.
Both listen to the related music.
Won't hang with nonwhites/ hangs with kids
Pics of Nazis/gay peado emperor pic.
Seemingly Nazi buddies/seemingly peado friends. 
Associates Nazi supply store/peado coded logo pizza place
Nordic Nazi religion/peadophilic Thelema religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in scenario one, you'd have to be  retarded to think this dude isn't a neo Nazi. Shoe fits.
Yet even though we matched them across a wide range of matching characteristics, you have trouble pointing at Podesta and saying " This guy might be a pervert"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a nice super Christian guy, one day cops came and arrested him at work (he was my boss) it turns out he was brutally raping his daughters. In my newspaper, they catch peados regularly. They're everywhere. Why is it so beyond the pale that this guy could he one too? What makes him so special that dozens of data points indicate he is likely to have that orientation. One, maybe two things about him, and I could strike it off and dismiss it maybe. This guy has like 50 data points. They all point in one direction. That this guy is a pervert.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's likely that just like the Saville case in UK, and the dutroux affair in Belgium, that the establishment Intel agencies, at the behest of the Rothschild family, which  Alafantis'  is a member of, control the people in power through child sexual l.blackmail.  they record tapes of politicians raping children. The confront him with the tapes, and he does thier bidding. They probably aggressively promote these compromised people to get closer to the top.

       No, it's not on my wish list and neither are the police investigating people based on spurious claims. Do you think people should be investigated simply because someone doesn't like their taste in art or their favourite films? Because I don't.

       Going back to your guys lame analogy, let's say that there was a place where a bunch of crosses were being burnt on lawns and a black guy had been lynched. Whilst doorknocking for the Shriners you notice that someones house has a bunch of Nazi paraphernalia all over the walls.... Ah fuck it, I'm going to drink more, it helps me forget that people like you and Rockran exist.

       So, point me to the child-abuse crimes that have been proven that correspond to the lynching and cross-burning in your analogy.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be accurate, your analogy should really be that someone has accused the owner of the Nazi paraphernalia of lynching and cross-burning based solely on their collection and not because any actual lynching or cross burning has occurred. Or how about accusing someone who has a large gun collection of being involved in a mass shooting (even though one hasn't been reported) just because they like guns?

       Totally would depend on the demeanor of the person and heavily influenced by how long/well I'd known them. If it was a personal friend of mine whom I'd known for ~10-15 years and was known to have an interest in history, collect artifacts, had relatives who had actually fought the Nazis and taken this stuff as memento, or other similar reason for having a room full of authentic Nazi memorabilia then I would have no problem with that. Hell, if I had the opportunity to acquire an authentic Nazi sword or something, I would go for it. That in no way makes me a Nazi, Nazi sympathizer, neo-Nazi, or anything else for that matter; it just makes me a guy that is fascinated by many different events in history and not necessarily bothered by the morbidity of an item, who was able to acquire an object which is probably pretty hard to come by.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the owner of the collection/items had "1488" tattooed around his throat or I really didn't know him that well but had the impression that he was unhinged/violent/racist/etc, THEN I would certainly be suspicious as all fuck.

       You make a good point.  I am someone who does see the artistic side of expressing any aspect of humanity, wether it be fucked up, cheerful or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Art makes you feel (or possibly project an absence of feeling in certain circumstances) and what that feeling is really doesn’t matter.  It could be anything.  You could be absolutely terrified of an art piece, and that power to make you feel that fear, joy or whatever is incredible and is what draws people to art in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like most of these comments are rooted in the assumption that this man has taken an interest in this artwork simply because it gets his willy wet and he smiles with glee whilst looking at it.  While that obviously is a possibility, its not complicated to understand that that probably isn’t the case.  Perhaps if his extensive art collection was literally ONLY these type of paintings, then you might want to start waving some red flags
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like art goes a lot deeper than what 90% of the people in this thread are willing to admit.
Fuck Tony Podesta for other reasons but I’m not gonna break my ankles jumping to ridiculous conclusions on this one.  You’d think people in this sub wouldn’t think in such absolutes.

       These articles are dumb, half the time they avoid giving the artists' names. This is so they can interpret them however they want, regardless of what the artist is trying to say.

       Do you have trouble with the concept of 500k people in this sub? This sub doesn't have a concensus. We can only, as individuals, do our best to seek evidence, weigh it out and come to our best educated guess and form a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think y'all call your comment "whataboutism"?? Is the concept that if you think MJ was not a pedo then you can't believe
       <em>
        anyone else is
       </em>
       ?? Or if a handful of folks think MJ was not a pedo they speak for the whole sub, therefore the whole sub can't scrutinize anyone else? This is the laziest thinking I've ever come across.

       That's the rumor behind the significance of red shoes. That and the occult meaning in brainwashing with the Wizard of Oz. Also allegedly the special red shoes of the pope are made of human flesh. There were a few popes who refused to wear them. I heard about this as someone was explaining how the current pope was ecstatic and filled with glee to be able to put on the special red shoes. Insinuating he was evil and all that jazz. Believable when you consider the horrors of the catholic church.

       None of the art that Podesta owns is "kiddie porn". If you want to know what constitutes child porn in your jurisdiction, look it up, but it will generally be along the lines of images of a minor (or what appears to be a minor) engaging in explicit sexual conduct or that is sufficiently sexually suggestive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And producing child porn is not the same as free speech. You can advocate for the right to break laws until the cows come home as far as I'm concerned, but the second you go from talking about it to actually breaking the laws, then you've moved from protected free speech to committing an illegal act.

       No, that's not child porn. It's definitely unsettling, and so it should be because the artist is drawing on the Balkan war, violence and child abuse in those works. But it's not child porn. But since you clearly think it is, have you reported Biljana Djurdjevic? If not, why not?

       Fucken creeper more like it. Screams free speech for the protection of disturbing kids paintings and will happily oblige to whatever our politicians define as “too much”. Like he’s completely fine if they turn around tomorrow and deem any sexual painting of a child legal, as long as it’s deemed art, because politicians said it’s ok.

       I was hoping your opening rebuttal would start with that. So you’re saying it’s not kiddie porn and it’s free speech, my question was when do you think that line get crossed? The original poster mentioned this is provocative and your rebuttal to them was free speech when discussing racial possessions. So you’re implying this is a form of free speech, when do you think that line gets crossed?

       Child porn is defined legally. Nothing that Tony Podesta owns has been shown to fit that definition. Nothing that he owns has been shown to depict minors in sexually explicit conduct or overly sexually suggestive conduct. Some of the works he owns are disturbing, but that's not surprising given the background of the artist.

       What do you mean "When do I define the line"? I'm not responsible for defining child porn. It's been defined by politicians and their definition is interpreted by the judiciary. If you think any artwork Podesta owns is child porn, then report him and report the artist.

       I actually am slightly uncomfortable with the notion of criminalising drawings or paintings, just as I would be if certain topics were deemed illegal to write about. But none of the artworks that Podesta is said to own come anywhere close to child porn and none of them give me any cause for concern. I'm more disturbed by ToysRUs selling
       <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/buy/sports/mcfarlane-toys-amcs-the-walking-dead-tv-series-role-play-negans-bat-lucille-14517-114217376">

       or the "barely legal" sections of porn sites than I am by any of Podesta's art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think they're child porn? If so, have you reported the artists and Podesta?

       I didn't say I "would not care" – please do not misrepresent my answers. I said I am slightly uncomfortable with the notion of criminalising drawings or paintings as I am with criminalising written works. Much as I may find the subject matter that some people choose to create reprehensible, I think that criminalising works of the imagination is in general a bad idea. I don't know why you find that disturbing. I agree with the notion that daylight is the best disinfectant. It is, however, a subject I am open to discussion about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take it that you think that it should be illegal for people to write about or make fictional films or art about certain subjects. Do you then have no problem with restrictions on free speech?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You keep saying YOU don’t think the Podesta images are disturbing ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There you go again, misrepresenting my position. Why do you feel the need to do that? I specifically stated that "Some of the works [Podesta] owns are disturbing". And, no, I have not been deflecting as to when something becomes disturbing because you've been asking me when something "crosses the line" into "kiddie porn". And that is legally defined, and that definition is one that I am comfortable with. There are many images or things that I find disturbing, but I don't think disturbing should be illegal per se. That would rule out most horror films and many crime stories. And it would make it illegal for artists to comment on disturbing subjects (such as child abuse or murder) through their chosen medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, why do you ignore my question to you? I ask again: Do you think the works Podesta owns are child porn? If so, have you reported the artists and Podesta?

       Of course you’re saying you won’t care, it took 3 comments of me asking for you to finally admit that the only time you will agree that the you personally find something that breaches child porn is when it strictly meets the definition as written in the law. My question to you was, well, what if the definition was shifted? Sounds awfully like you would merrily shift with it and continue to scream free speech defence for anything below it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What, does a drawing, animation or painting magically turn gruesome and disgusting to you? only when it crosses the legal definition? What if they changed that definition to no longer class any animation, drawing or painting as child porn? I can see you happily defending those pieces on Reddit in your replies on the grounds of free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not talking about Posdesta, although that was a good introduction, I was talking about it in a general terms as you happily stood up and bumped your chest in the free speech defence.
      </p>
      <p>
       “My 6 min render i did in 4K at 60fps isn’t child porn, it’s art.” Awfully great loop hole for you mob isn’t it. Seems like this conversation isnt going anywhere and you don’t seem to be providing any constructive rebuttal so I’ll leave the conversation as is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep trying to defend art until the micromillimetre before it breaches the legal definition and I’ll go on my way.

       Yet more misrepresentation. I don't know why you find it so hard to understand that child porn is legally defined, as it should be, and that it's not up to me to define what breaches that line.

       If the legislature changed the definition to something I wasn't comfortable with, then I would exercise my political power and vote for a party that had views closest to mine. But that doesn't change the fact that child porn would still be clearly defined. It is not, and should not be, a label that can be used to describe any picture of a child that someone doesn't like. Which is exactly what it sounds to me like you want: the ability to have child porn be anything anyone wants it to be. If you don't like an artwork that depicts a child in a non-sexual way, then you want to be able to call that child porn. And, if someone else finds another painting disturbing, then they get to call that painting child porn too. You're the one who sounds like they're arguing for a movable feast.

       But I am asking you about his artworks. So why do you keep ignoring my question? I've been answering yours but you clearly feel uncomfortable committing yourself to an answer on this. Why is that? If you can ask me what I think crosses the line into child porn, why won't you say if you think these artworks are child porn? I think that's the real reason you're leaving the conversation – you just don't want to admit either that you think they are child porn but have felt no need or responsibility to do anything about that or that, like me, you don't think they're child porn at all.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, that's not what I said. You seem to be able to maintain your argument only if you are able to invent a position for me. Something doesn't have to be art to be defended under free speech. As I noted, free speech protects even the most reprehensible views. It's not about trying to portray them as art, it's about whether things are best exposed to public scrutiny and debate or left to fester underground.

       You implied he had images of "bloody children tied up to a bed".

       No, but that's what pizzagaters normally claim, ignoring the fact that the WaPo article does not specifically say the photos in the bedroom are of naked teenagers. But even that supposedly shocking series is pretty run-of-the-mill portrait photography.

       Apart from Hastert, who they would clearly know from political circles, who else are you talking about? Just about every other politician and lobbyist in Washington over those years would have also known Hastert, so what does that prove? Nothing.

       Denny was a friend, not just a colleague. Alefantis was a friend (whose sister wrote a letter defeding a pedoohile) and Hillary knowingly defended one and laughed about it (and I'm not talking about Bill). I'm sure Epstein was in their circles too.

       Even if he and Hastert were friends, so what? Do you know every dirty little secret of all your friends?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Alefantis, he isn't a convicted paedophile. So, your claim that he had "numerous connections to convicted pedophiles" comes down to Hastert and (you think) Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for Hillary, she was a lawyer who had been requested by a judge to defend that client. She apparently did not want to defend him but felt she had no choice.
       <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/audio-hillary-clinton-speaks-of-defense-of-child-rapist-in-newly-unearthed-tapes/">
        Yes, she laughed three times when describing the case.
       </a>
       One time was when she said that the defendant passing a polygraph forever destroyed her faith in polygraphs. The second was when she was saying that, yes, she did have a right to view the evidence. And the third time was when she said that a New York expert was ready to testify to prevent "this miscarriage of justice". The way it sounds to me is that she's laughing either at the willingness of the guy to come up and testify or at the notion that the case was a miscarriage of justice. She's hardly laughing at a child being raped.

       It's not a 'dirty little secret' wtf. There are multiple dimensions to shitty behaviour, as you know, other shit has come up too. So I can't imagine he's a great guy other than his one 'dirty little secret'

       Same for Hillary, she's got plenty of 'dirty little secrets' in her closet also.

       I was asking you if you knew all your friends' dirty little secrets; I wasn't making a judgment on the abuse Hastert committed. And my question stands: do you know everything about your friends? If one of them were revealed tomorrow to have committed some illegal act, would that reflect on you?

       Well, no it doesn't. You made a claim – that Podesta had "numerous connections to convicted pedophiles" – but the only one you can name is Hastert. Saying you're sure he must have known Esptein doesn't count.

Your stupid ass opinions about politics have no reason to be here. Even if their is a 10% chance this is all true, pizzagate and everything with it then it should be followed down to the last clue. Because anyone who harms an innocent child, never mind those in power, and walks around with their head up should have the same shit done to them that they have put the children through. You both fucking know this I hope. So STOP DERAILING IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ABOUT HELPING FORGOTTEN SCARED CHILDREN.

       Do either of you have children or know children you love? Yeah? Then shut the fuck up with your insane justifications for making this about more shitty people in power.

       You derailed the subject matter. Spare me your moral outrage about kid fucking? Really? Are you that shitty of a person? Would you even consider that you are being ridiculous?
      </p>
      <p>
       I never get involved in these topics because of people like you. Do you understand how you come off with your dumb egotistical bullshit. Fuck pizzagate, fuck smear campaigns. What do you care? If something like a middle aged fat guy gets the noose for harming children shouldn't that be something everyone can get behind? Have you been to a shelter? Have you worked with abused children? Do you understand the unfathomable shit people do to them? Do you understand your whole world is centered around news talking points while actual life is fucking whizzing right by your big head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will debate and respect your opinion on any other subject matter, but to defend any of this for any politician in any respect until all the facts come out is garbage. I've worked with foster children in inner cities, have you? Your argument is that i need to call the police and lay a complaint? ABOUT WHAT? What the fuck are you even saying? Pizzagate is a term, that turned into a hashtag on twitter - a cesspool website. So the term I could care less about. But it brought out subject matter that is happening, and needs whatever publicity it can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop using politics as a crutch. Do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       care that much about your party? Seriously? Even if your a fucking shill and got paid for such ignorance, 10000 showers can't wash the filth off the blatant carelessness of such a non political topic. Making this about you and your opinions is just awful. Think more, type less. Please God.

       Exactly. Pizzagate is just bullshit – there is nothing there justfiying police investigation. If you think that any of the pizzagate narrative is evidence of criminal behaviour, then why haven't you acted upon it? If you don't think it's evidence, then why are you arguing with me?

       And their is a fuck ton of stuff that if you don't think is odd then you are lying to yourself and believing that lie. Something your politicians are professionals at. I never dove into the rabbit hole of pizzagate completely but you think a person with this much influence in society would be transparent and explain all the fucking oddities and child porn cloaked as art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides all that. I just want to know, people like you. Why, seriously why do you care to argue for these people? Do you know them? Honestly, even if I disagree'd at least I have the common sense to know liking someone in power for no reason other then what the news tells me should probably not over take the whole message of exposing potential horrific child abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has the podesta's done to have such a rabid protective fan base? Some of the most loyal fans I've ever seen. And I'm 99% sure almost ever single one didn't even know his name 2 years ago. I can't change your mind though man, so hopefully the people that are on the ground doing amazing work to try and fix some part of this deeply ignored issue will do so with the evidence you need to make you shut your mouth. And big things will come out if this is kept up. Because its fucking everywhere, you live in a serious bubble. Hope you break out of it someday, the air is way better when your not kissing so much ass.

       I have nothing invested in US politicians or political parties; I'm not American. That does not mean, however, that I'm going to ignore the obviously partisan nature of the people pushing pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, there is not "a fuck ton of stuff". When you take the time to look at it – instead of just blindly accepting the pizzagate story  – you quickly find it's all misrepresentation, lies, and guilt by association. Crap doesn't turn into evidence just by piling more crap on top of it. Give me access to thousands of your emails and personal photos and I could make up some "code words" and dubious claims about you, too.

       I'm not arguing for anyone, I'm arguing against the baseless claims and the cyber vigilanteism. That's what you guys never seem able to comprehend – that someone could abhor child abuse but also abhor the lynch-mob mentality. I believe in innocent until proven guilty and I don't believe in persecuting people because you don't like their taste in art. Remember that quotation of Martin Niemöller's "First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out"? Well, I don't believe in not speaking out when there's no evidence just because the crime someone is being accused of is horrendous.

       When you have a website set up where people can just hit a down arrow and move on its basically culling people to that would post more thought provoking and different views on subjects without being this delusional. Living a life where you are right no matter what it put in your face and proving it over and over while not understanding the clearly written reasoning I was pissed is really shitty. Other subjects.. they can jack that ego off all they want. But if it concerns possible abuses of children, unless you're a sociopath I think you can put away the fallacy that politics is more important. Or even has a place of importance in comparison to fucking with others LIVES. Politics end when you die, and children, the one thing as adults we should do everything to protect has others playing God for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we even need to explain this to people man?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we really live entrenched with this many narcissists.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said he's not from the country and doesn't care about politics. Yet he brings up US partisan politics in a post showing a millionaire known scumbag that
       <em>
        put himself willingly
       </em>
       in a job that should be the most scrutinized in the country having art bordering on insanity. And he made the reasoning for his unwavering position that Tony Podesta was the product of a lynch mob mentality! When this fat piece of shit is already known for things unrelated to just the whole sexualization of children thing. No big deal. Just a character assassination of a millionaire self absorbed, moral lacking person that influences things that are supposed to be in the interest of the country. Its so backwards on here I don't even know what to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person that has no clue what pizzagate is saw this exchange it'd be a trip to see the popular opinion is the guy arguing against the other guy simply stating it's not about pizzagate, its about the needed awareness it brings to the public conscious. We can't just down arrow and ignore the harsh reality of innocence being torn to shreds everywhere around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wish more people with an even head could see this exchange and wonder why he has so many positive little arrows and I have the ones saying I'm in the wrong. Obviously this place is rigged. I wish they could just disable the stupid feature and let people argue on merit and facts. Which means if you agree or disagree you'd have to not be lazy and prove why you would vehemently defend a guy who in all actuality is someone they would actively try and avoid away from their safe E bubble.

       The art in Tony Podesta's home was featured in

       Tony Podesta and his then-wife Heather had a vast collection of art, numbering more than 2000 museum-quality works at its peak, before they divorced.

       Here are some works from their collection:

       As you can see, there's a wide variety of art. A few pieces in his collection have disturbing themes, but I dare anybody to explain in complete sentences what's wrong with that. Some of the most popular art has disturbing themes.

       Biggest problem is how this piece of news has neither been properly investigated, verified etc by the MSM ...or hardly even mentioned. That is what is deeply disturbing and would make anyone suspicious of the Media that operates what are known as Lies of Omission.  Not mentioning or suppressing pertinent facts is regarded as being as bad as outright lying about facts.

       There's a guy over here in the UK called Chris Spivey. I don't agree with everything he has to say, not by a long shot but there is some merit in the things he says. He had a lot to say about Woolwich and Lee Rigby which again I didn't agree with all of it but he certainly brought up a LOT of interesting questions about the event. Not long after he had police smashing his door and warrants and was taken to court and eventually he was made to take down all the evidence and information he had posted down (why if what he was saying was false anyway?). He also has a daughter and grandson who both live with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways sometime before all that happened he wrote an article regarding this sort of "art" which included a painting that Elton John owns and some old album cover (Pink Floyd maybe) as well as other popular art of this kind (Brooke Shields photo I seem to remember?). In this article he's absolutely slating it and asking how it's not illegal and only has the images to reference them. Police clean his house out on a warrant and he's arrested for owning indecent images of children. All of what he had was media that's already in the public domain, yet he was arrested and threatened to have his grandson took away. Social services colliding with police and others in what dragged out for months and months over images which anyone can google right now. Elton John literally owns the painting which Chris got arrested for having on his computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it was obviously good leverage against him because it resulted in all his research being took down and he hasn't been the same guy since. His old articles used to be so in depth and well researched but now he seems like he's gone a bit mental, n I'm sure he's been warned to stop poking around cos he got too close to the truth...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway double standards was my point! Elton John owns a painting which Chris Spivey was arrested for having a copy of. HTF does that work

       This is full of conjecture and "less than circumstantial" evidence, whatever that word would be. An example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the first "artist" in Tony's collection mentioned in the article is Serbian painter Biljana Djurdjevic. Here's a selection of her work (more photos available here and on her website):
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Tony Podesta likes a certain artist, but
       <em>
        look what else this artist has done!
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Comet Ping Pong is billed as a "kid-friendly" restaurant. I wouldn't go that far, considering the promotional "artwork" associated with the restaurant, not to mention Alefantis's Instagram, where he has posted hardcore pornography in an art gallery
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There must be something sinister going on at Comet because the person also posted PORNOGRAPHY IN AN ART GALLERY
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "As John said, it doesn't get any better than this" (from Doug Band to John Podesta, Huma Abedin and others - includes "pizza.jpg" as an attachment, a photo of two Asian women and a young girl eating pizza)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Clicked the JPG because I thought the Asian women might be cute, and I wanted to see how
       <em>

       this young girl eating pizza was. Link was broken though, of course.

       It's pretty telling that in pizzagate the culprits are all democrats. Even more telling is the fact that no victims have come forward or parents of children. More telling than that is podesta is already guilty in their minds based on emails they falsely believe are code and some art he owns and some he doesn't but is attributed to him anyways. Then a guy brings a gun into the pizza place and shoots it up finding nothing. You literally have Trump barging into teenage girls dressing rooms and making weird sexual comments about his daughter yet he escapes these weird leaps of logic to paint him as a sexual deviant because this has turned into a political weapon. Then y'all come and bring up the subject just like they expected y'all to do and you fall for it so easily

       This sub has become a space for alt-right outrage porn for the pearl-clutches. Ppl here will will cry a river if someone from TMOR makes fun of them claiming harassment etc. and then turn around and participate in an internet smear campaign calling someone a pedophile for art they may or may not even own.

       I mean you can fail to comprehend an idea that’s well laid out for you and call someone a “retard” for that but that probably says more about your own mental state.  I’ll try again cause I’m genuinely trying to help you understand a new concept here.  Also to help you just take a step back a little so you don’t break your ankles with the rest of these people jumping to conclusions without concrete evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny part is Tony Podesta apparently doesn’t even own that one, if you are referring to the one with the drains and white tiles.  You also missed the fact that their hands aren’t bound, they are holding them behind their back.  But even beyond that you are still failing to see the bigger picture in her art.  I mean, that’s fine.  You can be one dimensional and think Biljana is a pedophile but I would argue that would probably point to you having a mental incapacity for seeing such a complex idea as so black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       As she is Serbian I think most her art comes directly from trying to articulate the dread that her country and surrounding countries feel from such recent, major conflicts and atrocities.  I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s exactly what it is, but it could be something else.  Also wouldn’t be surprised if it’s standard “normalizing the body” artwork.  I think you should keep in mind that in Biljanas country (and many other countries) nudity and the human body are far less taboo than in the United States.  Furthermore, nobody is even nude in any of her paintings.  Even the paintings of adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Necessary to state one more time: Tony Podesta doesn’t even own the one you are referring to.  He does own one depicting a little girl but it’s an almost alien-like little girl, sitting on a chair, fully clothed.  If that doesn’t convey the straw man reach of all of this to you, then I don’t know what will.

       Even if he and Hastert were friends, so what? Do you know every dirty little secret of all your friends?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Alefantis, he isn't a convicted paedophile. So, your claim that he had "numerous connections to convicted pedophiles" comes down to Hastert and (you think) Epstein.

       And as for Hillary, she was a lawyer who had been requested by a judge to defend that client. She apparently did not want to defend him but felt she had no choice.
       <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/audio-hillary-clinton-speaks-of-defense-of-child-rapist-in-newly-unearthed-tapes/">
        Yes, she laughed three times when describing the case.
       </a>
       One time was when she said that the defendant passing a polygraph forever destroyed her faith in polygraphs. The second was when she was saying that, yes, she did have a right to view the evidence. And the third time was when she said that a New York expert was ready to testify to prevent "this miscarriage of justice". The way it sounds to me is that she's laughing either at the willingness of the guy to come up and testify or at the notion that the case was a miscarriage of justice. She's hardly laughing at a child being raped.

        the only time you will agree that the you personally find something that breaches child porn is when it strictly meets the definition as written in the law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yet more misrepresentation. I don't know why you find it so hard to understand that child porn is legally defined, as it should be, and that it's not up to me to define what breaches that line.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        what if the definition was shifted? Sounds awfully like you would merrily shift with it ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If the legislature changed the definition to something I wasn't comfortable with, then I would exercise my political power and vote for a party that had views closest to mine. But that doesn't change the fact that child porn would still be clearly defined. It is not, and should not be, a label that can be used to describe any picture of a child that someone doesn't like. Which is exactly what it sounds to me like you want: the ability to have child porn be anything anyone wants it to be. If you don't like an artwork that depicts a child in a non-sexual way, then you want to be able to call that child porn. And, if someone else finds another painting disturbing, then they get to call that painting child porn too. You're the one who sounds like they're arguing for a movable feast.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am not talking about Podesta,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But I am asking you about his artworks. So why do you keep ignoring my question? I've been answering yours but you clearly feel uncomfortable committing yourself to an answer on this. Why is that? If you can ask me what I think crosses the line into child porn, why won't you say if you think these artworks are child porn? I think that's the real reason you're leaving the conversation – you just don't want to admit either that you think they are child porn but have felt no need or responsibility to do anything about that or that, like me, you don't think they're child porn at all.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “My 6 min render i did in 4K at 60fps isn’t child porn, it’s art.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, that's not what I said. You seem to be able to maintain your argument only if you are able to invent a position for me. Something doesn't have to be art to be defended under free speech. As I noted, free speech protects even the most reprehensible views. It's not about trying to portray them as art, it's about whether things are best exposed to public scrutiny and debate or left to fester underground.
