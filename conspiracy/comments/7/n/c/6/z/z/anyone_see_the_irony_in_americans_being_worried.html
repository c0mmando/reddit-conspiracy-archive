<p>Police have escaped their stations refusing to combat people and the regime is very scared of the amount of protesters. There are reports of prominent clerics escaping on private flights.</p>

<p>Some locations in Ahvaz are taken over by protesters and there is no police presence.  </p>

<p>It is rumored Khamenei was taken from his house by protesters.</p>

<p>A clergy school was set on fire, police stations and vehicles are being set on fire, a financial institution was set on fire, protestors have taken over the city of Izeh and are currently fighting the Iranian regime over it, hospitals reported 10 citizens died and 30 were injured with 3 regime forces dead fighting over Izeh and their internet is cut off.  </p>

<p>&#39;Iran doesn&#39;t have a Rothschild controlled central bank&#39; meet Ahmad Vahidi, an Iranian military commander of the Revolutionary Guards with 32 million dollars in Dubai and 65 million dollars in Turkey.</p>

<p>as per some videos, mexico, venesuala, the occupy movement, greece, and pussy hats all looked more impresive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just heard the wife of Cernovich, Shauna claim that her elders/parents were to blame for the fall back in 1979...and then she deferred to Mike saying he &quot;understood the whole History better...&quot; and I suffered through the rest of that train wreck only feeling worse for her child!</p>

<p>Back in 1979 as a young American parent, I sat in my very own home with a very dear friend from Persia as we watched in terror the whole thing on this new program with a Howdy Doodie puppet Ted Copple or Tom Brokejaw <em>telling us what we needed to see</em>. </p>

<p>My friend said that nothing looked right about the clashes/protest and it caught everyone by complete surprise. He was an Engineer at M-K and we all lost touch as his own personal storm unfolded over the next couple of years. His Uncle, his sponsor was a Doctor on the east Coast - DC/ Virginia / Maryland - I cannot remember...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seriously doubt these reports, there is no way that Iranian Security &amp; Intelligence Services would let situation deteriorate to that level. Just like previous attempts, it won&#39;t get anywhere. Iranians are very good in flushing out foreign agents, so it&#39;s just a matter of time before they round up chaos instigators. Iran is one of the most difficult countries for foreign intelligence to infiltrate. Just ask Mossad how many agents they lost... </p>
