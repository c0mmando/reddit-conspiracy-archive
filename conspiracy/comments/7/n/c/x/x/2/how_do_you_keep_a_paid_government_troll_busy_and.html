       I'd have to say that your views of Trump in your very opening reply? Would be at the total opposite end of the ANTIFA movement. - Which in that case nevertheless is worthy in said actions I would have to admit.

       Assuming or Labeling of a Pedo though without said proof however is a blind statement.

Im quite sure that #opDEATHEATERS would have a great time exposing this said Pedo.. lol

       You know as well as I that they are simply puppets.
They fulfill an agenda that runs so deep it has to reply on breaking the hopes and dreams of humanity in order to fulfill its own hopes and dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
       This agenda driving force and master behind the puppet is nothing more than what we know as the Cabal. So our hate for said presidents? Matter none. Again bro they are expendable puppets.

       I beleive Osama is dead and he probably died before he could be found. I think the US would have parade him around and publicly execute him, I would have.

       My MIND and Consciousness would have to be at ease i would say in order for what ever ( proof ) they would deliver. The proof in which they did however show/bring to our people? I don't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? My consciousness is uneasy and not convinced.
Sad but they the powers that be have made me this way.

       Everything I knew as truth or was told as truth?
After 20 years of digging? Know to be a bad illusion of  his-story.
Someones else's truth or path.

       The system teaches this everyday in our education system.
And it's a BLASPHEMY to ones inner core soul.

       I don't think can answer because you don't know what proof you desire, you just know you'll feel it when you see it. This is normal for people.

       He's not a billionaire yet but will be when his term is finished. Proving that Trump is a billionaire, you can't but you can tell me to prove he is a billionaire and I can't.
