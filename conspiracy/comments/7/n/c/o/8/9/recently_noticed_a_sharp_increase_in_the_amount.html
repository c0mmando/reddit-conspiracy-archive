<p>TMOR has already linked to this thread.</p>

<p><a href="https://NP.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7nczes/the_hero_that_rconspiracy_deserves_continues_his/?st=JBVU7N67&amp;amp;sh=dd60c499">https://NP.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7nczes/the_hero_that_rconspiracy_deserves_continues_his/?st=JBVU7N67&amp;amp;sh=dd60c499</a></p>

<p>There is a big difference between criticism of Israel and legitimate hatred for the Jewish people.</p>

<p>If you point this rhetoric out as &quot;anti semetic&quot;, they throw in this copy paste rebuttal like,</p>

<p>&quot;But they&#39;re not real Semites dude. They&#39;re khazars posing as Jews&quot; or some goofy, unsourced claim that justifies their behavior. It&#39;s always the same fucking reply.</p>

<p>Look, bottom line is this; If you criticize Israel here, can you do it in a way that won&#39;t make lurkers and newbies here roll their eyes at you as a racist idiot? It&#39;s well known that this sub is a target and that people are trying to demonize us. </p>

<p>Especially after the creation of r/isrconspiracyracist</p>

<p>Branding us as racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti Jewish is a big part of the shills, social engineers, and the bitches over at TopMindsOfReddit&#39;s MO. </p>

<p>This way, they can limit the amount of people who take refuge here and subscribe to the quickly expanding conspiracy culture and the truth movement.</p>

<p>And call out idiots who post blatant trolling comments like that. We need to make it known that anything racist or blatantly anti Jewish isn&#39;t representative of our culture. </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to even entertain the idea that there may be a staged anti-semetic false flag, perhaps a shooting at a synagogue or some thing blamed on a crazy conspiracy theorist to demonize our movement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This type of hysteria is bullshit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m starting to even entertain the idea that there may be a staged anti-semetic false flag, perhaps a shooting at a synagogue or some thing <strong>blamed on a crazy conspiracy theorist to demonize</strong> our movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you see people in here discussing Zionists that isn&#39;t a racist discussion. Someone comments or discusses USraelSaud as a known factor in World tumult since forever...that isn&#39;t &quot;racist&quot; it is a standing factor to rooting out Deep State Assassins that create these New Wars for Regime Change!</p>

<p>If you see comments using bigoted language you exercise your &quot;Report&quot; tab and insert #1 as the issue. Rinse and repeat if others are using bigoted language or remarks in the same thread. </p>

<p><strong>Do not join in the fray! Report!</strong> </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in here nearly eight years now and we do not support or condone Bigoted posts. Never have. Never will. I personally resent your unwarranted hysterics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If as much effort was spent trying to stop the criminality of Israel and its backers as is put in to trying to stop the exposure of said criminality, maybe you wouldn&#39;t have this problem. </p>

<p>Israel was, at a minimum, complicit in 9/11. Israel&#39;s backers have subsequently manipulated the US government into destroying its enemies, like Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Israel has manipulated Saudia Arabia into blockading Qatar primarily to silence one of the few news organizations that is unafraid to cover Israel objectively, Al Jazeera. </p>

<p>Israel clandestinely obtained nuclear weapons, yet it is beating the war drums to have the US destroy Iran for the exact same reason. This will likely lead to a global conflict with significant casualties, but Israel isn&#39;t concerned because it is always American blood that is spilled fighting Israel&#39;s wars. </p>

<p>Israel&#39;s backers use organizations like AIPAC to circumvent American democracy (rr) and then use the MSM to claim that Russia has done the same thing. </p>

<p>The US given Israel the most modern military in the Middle East which they use to routinely slaughter Palestinian civilians to maintain an apartheid state. </p>

<p>More that ever, exposure of Israel&#39;s corruption is what is needed,  instead of your proposed self-censorship based on your concern with what the hasbara at TMOR might say. </p>
