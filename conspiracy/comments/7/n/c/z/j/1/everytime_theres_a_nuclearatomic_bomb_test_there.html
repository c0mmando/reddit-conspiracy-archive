        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it possible that the US government is hinting at Extraterrestrial life knowing that they will appear again due to jim jong un nuclear tests?</p>

<p>So i am speculating that maybe it is possible the CIA is tweeting UFO pictures along with the recent release of the UFO sighting video as a result of the nuclear testing Jim jong un has been exercising</p>

<p>They are trying to play it safe by hinting at UFOs</p>

<p>Maybe they know Jim will cause an influx of aliens visiting earth with his nuclear tests .  With all the cameras we have now their cover will be blown, maybe  spacex was really aliens or a false flag to see how people would react to the discrediting of a REALLY realistic video .  </p>

<p>interesting times, i will tell you everything has a reason , the fact that that video was released and the CIA had published a picture of a UFO is not for nothing keep an eye open!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Aquarius document, which I found on Steven Greers &quot;sirius&quot; seems to be a military document (scanned) that states ufo&#39;s have been around for a long time, are interested in the nukes, because they seem to frequent military bases that store nuclear material, and seem to be researching us as a species. They are unlikely to be a threat, as they have had ample opportunity, but have not taken much agresive action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, never heard of this document. The name &quot;aquarius&quot; does peak my interest. I just read it here (<a href="http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/project-aquarius-documents/">http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/project-aquarius-documents/</a> ) What is up with the quarter coins at the corner of each page? </p>

<p>Curious that they say nuclear bases are of interest to them. I would think an advanced alien species already has nuclear stuff or even more advanced ways to utilize energy. It would be so cool if they publicly released this info and it was well known, imagine how inspired people would be to create new tech if we had a confirmed new ET species. </p>

We just think they are here now because the alien uses are exploiting a loophole cleverly hidden in section III of a standard CHASE credit card agreement detailing an exploit of non locality creating a temporal loophole in space time so we can f ourselves forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short of a complete resurfacing event, such as has been theorized to have occurred on Venus, they are unconcerned about events outside the artificial reality they have created inside their crustal biome computer. It&#39;s photographically stored and obsessively copied so that even the destruction of a large part of the crust from an impact would only slow down their simulated universes. There would be no permanent damage to them or their existence.</p>

<p>They are only marginally interested in us. We&#39;re no more than a flock of pigeons in Times Square to them. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh look! Something shiny, let me waddle over here. Oh there&#39;s a puddle of water, let me waddle over there and drink some, oh look there is something to eat over here. Let me fight with that bird over that scrap of bread.&quot;</p>

<p>They have already simulated entire civilizations thousands of times more diverse and interesting than our own. They have very little interest in our mediocre civilization or artwork of campbell&#39;s soup cans.</p>

<p>Imagine their surprise when their ancient automated systems, interrupted them in their artificial games and universes to inform them that the apes had mastered the atom. Suddenly fighters started seeing &quot;foo fighters&quot; around their jets during WWII...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re last sentence was VERY close to the reality. There ARE extra-dimensional and extra/intra-terrestrial beings on and in our environs. However 98 or more percent of them are either original humans from earth &quot;one&quot; or are they extra-spacial/extra-dimensional humans travelling through space/time to visit, observe, educate and predicate upon themselves. Most likely it is terribly uncommon that a non-human would even exist at that level of mentality. I&#39;ll admit here to being a humanist and thus biased but i fully believe that humanity&#39;s physical form is the hight of evolution. Must humanoids described all follow the same schematic. Assuming that dna and rna type proteins and acids are required for all life then the code of &quot;two arms, two legs, and a head&quot; is extremely common for a reason. I believe it&#39;s that part of the code in particular that nature (sophia) uses to code ultra intelligent life. Not merely sentient life. Dolphins are sentient. But not all that bright. Dogs are sentient but again lack a capacity for metacognition. Just a rambling thought.</p>

<p>My opinion is that benevolent extraterrestrials likely do exist, however if they can help dissolve nukes (and I have like you, heard of similar stories, also from military officials (I think there was even an interview on Larry King) that discuss aliens deactivating nuclear warheads), then why can&#39;t they help even more than that? Why were all the nuclear test allowed? Why were Hiroshima and Nagasaki allowed? </p>

<p>The only alternative theory that I can think of (that seems reasonable to me) stems from an esoteric viewpoint, which is that they are not allowed to help for more than a certain degree due to karmic law (considering here they know even more about the metaphysical structure of the Cosmos than us).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s a bit speculative but I truely think that their abilities are not entirely limitless nor do they see into the future.</p>

<p>You mentioned Hiro/Naga but you must remember: the Manhattan Project was the most secretive military project to have ever existed. People enriching uranium for those bombs didn&#39;t even know what they were doing (&quot;turn this knob when this gauge reads this&quot;, etc). The aforentiomed nuclear tests and missile silos however were <em>known</em> locations and computer guided ICBMs would likely be easier for them to intercept than dumb-bombs like Fatman and LittleBoy. The time frame between Trinity Test and Hiro/Naga was very small too; never giving the ETs time to react, but a long cold war with stationary missiles did.</p>

<p>Aliens, although powerful, are not Gods, nor do they want to be seen as such. They likely do however have incredibly advanced cloning and bioengineering capabilities so capturing animals and plant life in the event of nuclear catastrophe would seem like just another science project for them. An important one however. There are also other military men who say we already have a space force, and part of President Reagan&#39;s SWDI spending went to a laser network around earth that shoots down ET craft.... but... there are many tangents I could go down.</p>

<p>I also STRONGLY believe that their intention is to stay completely out of our history, as to not damage our culture (Star Trek&#39;s Prime Directive basically) but I think that once humanity can globally prove itself as &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot; they will start visiting Earth in droves. This, I believe, will be a cultural singularity that every species reaches eventually. When a single isolated species grows to join the intergalactic community.</p>

<p>I am intrigued at this though:</p>

<p>Any more sources for this? I&#39;m not saying this isn&#39;t true, I&#39;d just be curious to read more about this. I often wonder whether the massive &quot;black budget&quot; of trillions of dollars related to the Pentagon is perhaps going into some sort of &quot;space defense&quot; program. Though I seriously doubt we could defend from any legitimate and serious invasion (I personally doubt all extraterrestrials are benevolent, but I&#39;m sure many are).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the first nuke was tested it was done on a &quot;history eraser&quot; basis. There was absolutely no way of knowing whether or not the resulting atomic fision would actually stop. There was concern that that particular test would end all of existence period. They did the test anyway... It is HIGHLY possible that the nature of electromagnetism caused some kind of friction that eventually slowed and then stopped the resulting nuclear reaction. It is possible that in an environment with little to no friction that blast would carry on for light millennia. Until it hits something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends upon the true composition of space. If it is made of water as many religious and historical tests suggest then the &quot;void&quot; of space may actually slow the expansion. If it is actually a plasmatic fluid. If however there are gaps in this aqueous void as i suspect then there in those places the expansion would go on infinitum until it collided with another aqueous void. Being that i can not legally reproduce fision explosions and can not take myself to the watery void of space this will all have to remain speculation and conjecture. Though all of it is indeed based on provable math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes i am well aware. In fact einstein was very much against the concept because it ruined his theory of relativity. He spent the latter half of his life trying to disprove it. And failing. It&#39;s THAT math that I started with. And the math of his opposition. Much of the scientific study in that era regards quite a bit of this particular subject. I also happened to find documents that mathematically described a possible electrostatic friction through mathematical proofs. I believe the paper was from Berkley but im not certain. I do know it was behind a paywall but the paper mostly cited other previous works. Tesla did a MUCH better job of describing all of this with mathematic principals.

<p>Although I do agree that we have some major problems in the prison industry. Prison profiteering is on the same scale of evilness as plantations keeping slaves around if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory as to why this could be it and it goes salongthe lines that nuclear weapons either don&#39;t exist or aren&#39;t the most powerful weapon anymore. </p>

<p>It all goes back to Tesla. I think most people hear have heard and believe about free energy and the weapons that can go along with it, like Tesla death Ray, and even larger explosions bigger and more powerful then nuclear bombs. </p>

<p>If the technology is real what we know of as ufo was created in the 40s possibly earlier. The Nazis were known to be testing the tech and the US sure as shit was too. The power of the scalar energy (what it is known by) if also real, it is about the same age and would put to shame what a supposed nuclear bomb could do. </p>

<p>That to me is what is going on in North Korea and such. If they are learning about and testing this Tesla tech then that is why, whether by spying, maybe assisting or also preparing people is why the increased spottings have been happening. It&#39;s had been a theory of mine for a while. Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr - NK testing is not nuclear and is really Tesla scalar technology which is why there is an increase in sighting of other tells technology like supposed ufo during those times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re last sentence was VERY close to the reality. There ARE extra-dimensional and extra/intra-terrestrial beings on and in our environs. However 98 or more percent of them are either original humans from earth &quot;one&quot; or are they extra-spacial/extra-dimensional humans travelling through space/time to visit, observe, educate and predicate upon themselves. Most likely it is terribly uncommon that a non-human would even exist at that level of mentality. I&#39;ll admit here to being a humanist and thus biased but i fully believe that humanity&#39;s physical form is the hight of evolution. Must humanoids described all follow the same schematic. Assuming that dna and rna type proteins and acids are required for all life then the code of &quot;two arms, two legs, and a head&quot; is extremely common for a reason. I believe it&#39;s that part of the code in particular that nature (sophia) uses to code ultra intelligent life. Not merely sentient life. Dolphins are sentient. But not all that bright. Dogs are sentient but again lack a capacity for metacognition. Just a rambling thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>One of the strongest UFO encounters I&#39;ve heard of was reiterated by 3 separate military witnesses. </p>

<p>It involved orbs of red light sinking into the ground near a titan 2 missile silo. </p>

<p>Diagnostics on the missile shortly after showed the nuclear material transmuted entirely to Lead; the warhead now worthless.</p>
