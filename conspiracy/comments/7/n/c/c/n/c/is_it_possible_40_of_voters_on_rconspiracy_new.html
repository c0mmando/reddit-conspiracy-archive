<p>This seems to be the trend for my posts: initially like 100% upvoted for first 5 votes, then 50-65% upvoted for the next 15 votes, then goes back up to 70% from there.</p>

<p>Do you guys observe the same trends?</p>

<p>Is there some option that someone has to comment in a thread for them to vote? That&#39;d be good.</p>

<p>He&#39;s whining because he&#39;s a racist bigot. Why do the many so brave posters of conspiracy whine like children when not everyone agrees with them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a recurring thing. There&#39;ll be two posts about something on Wednesday and then a post on Saturday asking why nobody every talks about it, but what&#39;s really trigged it is someone didn&#39;t get their upvotes (Internet fucking points), and it hurt their feelings.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s an allegation made by Bryce Taylor who a youtube body analysis expert said was not lying.</p>

<p>There are people that have had intercourse with dolphins, one woman did it as part of a NASA experiment.</p>

<p>Sylvestor Stallone has had allegations made about him and a teen threesome.</p>

<p>That thread was really popular by the way. The threads I can&#39;t understand getting downvoted to 60% are non offensive like &quot;what if conspiracy theorists are the majority&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking through your post history it seems like you are JIDF. Why do you come to r/conspiracy if you don&#39;t like conspiracy theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any problem with conspiracy theorists. I don&#39;t believe most that are presented here, I think most theories have very easy but boring explanations.</p>

<p>I browse the subreddit because it&#39;s a really interesting look into human behavior. The way so many of the claims around here are presented without any evidence, are false, and then when people take the time to point out that people are making false claims, they get called shills, and the poser WHINES about getting downvoted. I&#39;ve never seen such thin-skinned people.</p>

<p>I&#39;d really just like you to stop lying, for whatever reason you do it, and take the time to sit back and critically examine some of the things you do.</p>

<p>An example of a false belief of yours (you probably have a conspiracy about it) is right here. Swartz was not a founder of Reddit. You&#39;ve made him into something he was not. Based on your repeated comments, yoiu&#39;d probably hate him were he alive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the kind of thing that you can correct after five minutes of Googling, but you and other people love to bring it up from time to time.</p>

<p>The &quot;proof&quot; of the holocaust always turns out to be fake, like photos that are clearly doctored, shrunken head that was nicked from a museum and planted by US PSYOP division, gas chambers that are really bomb shelters they admit they altered.</p>

<p>Germany apologised just means some traitors, paid or blackmailed by Jews, said something it so Jews could line their pockets with German taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>For the odd fact is that writing a fake Holocaust memoir has become, by now, a dog-bites-man story. Misha Defonseca is just the latest example of a genre that also includes Herman Rosenblat, author of the Oprah-endorsed Angel at the Fence—whose fraud was first exposed by The New Republic—and Benjamin Wilkomirski, author of Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood.</p>

<p>Each of these books was popular and celebrated, before knowledgeable readers began to raise questions about their incredible details.</p>

<p>If you do not respond to me it is because you are a liar.</p>

<p>If you do respond to me it&#39;s because you are a liar trying to cover his tracks.</p>

<p>Do you see how no matter what you do, you &quot;prove&quot; my theory that you are a liar is correct? That&#39;s what you just did.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve still got it backwards.</p>

<p>The economists in question look at the data and say &quot;on one hand this could mean X but on the other hand it could mean Y&quot;.</p>

<p>What you are doing is saying &quot;This data could mean X, but this other data that contradicts the first also means X&quot;</p>

It&#39;s one thing if the submission statement is totally out of left field, but often, it&#39;s just a straightforward statement of the obvious conspiracy theory implied by the link itself. The link will be heavily upvoted, but the submission statement buried at the bottom deeply in the negative, while trolls bashing the post are at the top.

I feel telling things bluntly to people does nothing but put their guards up and sets the stage for a battle where no one gives any regard to the other&#39;s point.

I just came from checking the Field house and I have a <strong>square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.</strong>
Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.</p>

<p>I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>The realtor found a handkerchief <strong>(I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.</strong> Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>Susaner</p>

<hr/>

<p>What context could drive these two people to describe this handkerchief so differently? </p>

<p>When you put this in together with all of the other absurd food related emails exchanged then the context begins to change.</p>

Do you not find it odd that you&#39;re on a rampage, trying to label anyone who asks for facts to prove a hypothesis as some paid agent of a shady organization out to get you? Personally, I find it funny. So not only do I downvote theories here because they have no evidence, I also enjoy the stupor people like you work yourselves into without the slightest bit of self awareness. </p>

<p>As for Pizzagate specifically, it LITERALLY has less evidence than a flat earth theory. Let that sink in. </p>

<p>So no, I haven&#39;t proven your point. But in your mind, of course I have. Because your mind doesn&#39;t think critically. It believes what it wants without evidence. And with a mind like that, literally anything is possible. Except admitting that you&#39;re wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some conspiracy facts. Start running.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Try improving your reading comprehension. The title of the thread is there are shills on r/conspiracy, and you rock up concern trolling pizzagate. I don&#39;t have to address your talking points, merely point out that you appear to be a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to stop obsessing with the numbers.  There&#39;s tons of reasons why it wasn&#39;t consistent.  If I had to guess it&#39;s because anyone who disagreed with you didn&#39;t even see the thread or find it even worth downvoting until it was gaining traction and visibility.  Add to that the type of user who hangs out on the new section of this sub is probably the exact type of user this question is pandering to.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any problem with conspiracy theorists. I don&#39;t believe most that are presented here, I think most theories have very easy but boring explanations.</p>

<p>I browse the subreddit because it&#39;s a really interesting look into human behavior. The way so many of the claims around here are presented without any evidence, are false, and then when people take the time to point out that people are making false claims, they get called shills, and the poser WHINES about getting downvoted. I&#39;ve never seen such thin-skinned people.</p>

<p>I&#39;d really just like you to stop lying, for whatever reason you do it, and take the time to sit back and critically examine some of the things you do.</p>

<p>An example of a false belief of yours (you probably have a conspiracy about it) is right here. Swartz was not a founder of Reddit. You&#39;ve made him into something he was not. Based on your repeated comments, yoiu&#39;d probably hate him were he alive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the kind of thing that you can correct after five minutes of Googling, but you and other people love to bring it up from time to time.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve still got it backwards.</p>

<p>The economists in question look at the data and say &quot;on one hand this could mean X but on the other hand it could mean Y&quot;.</p>

<p>What you are doing is saying &quot;This data could mean X, but this other data that contradicts the first also means X&quot;</p>

<p>You never even consider the Y possibility - that you&#39;re wrong.</p>
