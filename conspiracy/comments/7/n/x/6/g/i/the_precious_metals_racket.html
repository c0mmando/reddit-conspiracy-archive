       So I just came back from a couple of places to sell some silver coins I had bought years ago from Midas Resources (as advertised on Alex Jones).  Some funny things I've noticed.   First, I didn't get even close in metal value to what the market price is and the market price is higher than it was then.  That was interesting.  Secondly, the places to sell it here require ID.   And not just any ID but something that has your address on it.  So first place I went to I didn't have ID on me and I walked back to get my passport, and second place I went to (to compare prices) wouldn't even take that.  This is in York Region, Ontario, Canada notorious mob hotspot.  Apparently it's a bylaw here.  So, no exchange today.  What's funny is that they need your address, and they take your picture.  It's as if they're profiling people to shake down.  Fascinating and not at all surprising.

       a berkey water filter probably isn't bad (it's coming from infowars so it may very well be a scam), but it's also probably no better than a much cheaper water filter like Britta or something.

       Market price is what it's traded at, of course you won't get that retail. Same with FOREX or anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need ID because of all the thieves wanting to sell what they've stolen. Look at your local laws for pawn shops and even scrap metal merchants, they're probably the same.

       yeah this is a setup though.  it prevents people from buying/selling without official approval.  that would be acceptable if society was constructed in a way where there wasn't scarcity.  but as it currently stands, it's too authoritarian for me.

       well if someone needs to steal something then i reckon society hasn't figured out the scarcity problem yet, and that person could just as easily be me in a spot of need.  so no i wouldn't really mind.

       People buy silver and gold from television ads and when the time comes to sell that gold, who's going to trust them as real, solid precious metal?  The guys from Argentina's collapse explained that in hard times, buyers will only pay junk gold prices even if your coin is a US Treasury minted coin. So... buy cheap gold, not the good .999 proof stuff

       Buddy, gold "collector's" coins peddled by the likes of Alex Jones and Glenn Beck are a scam. Alex Jones is a complete snake oil salesman charlatan. Hell, did we already forget Beck being caught in his scam? It doesn't matter if some 1933 eagle gold coin was the hottest thinkfor collectors when you purchased your marked up pieces under the assurance that gold never goes down in the long run. You purchased a collectable piece. The ideal for collectors changes. Quite often. You might as well by some Alex Jones endorsed baseball cards. It's pretty much the same idea. If you want invest in precious metals, invest in them on the markets. But, i ask you to consider two things when throwing your hard earned money into gold as a way to protect yourself from the economic sky that you believe is falling, 1) Is the person trying to sell you gold to protect you from the collapsing economy also the same person telling you that the economy is collapsing? and 2) If the economy does collapse into ruin, can you eat and drink that g

       i bought it as a backup in the event of a grid down scenario if i needed to trade.  that was the purpose of it.  i didn't buy it to invest in anything but my self-sufficiency in a particular scenario.

       You wrote a post about how you bought some gold coins off of infowars and when you tried to sell them you were unable to find someone to purchase them at a price satisfactory to whqt you thought you should be getting.Your title even highly suggests you think investing in precious metals is a scam. Myself and others alerted you to the fact that these gold coins being hawked to listeners of right wing radio hosts were pretty often, if not always, scams. I even went further to say that if someone trying to sell you something to protect yourself from the sky falling is the same person trying to convince you that the sky is falling, be wary! You replied that you didn't buy the coins to invest, but as safety in case a "grid down" aka "the sky is falling" situation happened and you only wanted what would be adequate in that situation. I asked why you would care if you couldn't get current market value then if what you were offered was adequate for a "grid down" situation. And now we are here so I ask, how did I distort what you are saying?

       calm down, chief. The fact that you started off your post going on about not getting market rate made me think that was a large reason for your post. My bad that I didn't realize your real post was about buyers wanted your contact info before buying, out of good faith, some coins you have most likely never had tested for purity. I didn't realize in that situation it made the consumer a fascist. My apologies. You know what, friend, you go buy whatever Jones tells you to buy. Someone will be very happy with the sale.

       i'm not the one upset.  you're the one responding like that.  honestly i have no emotional investment, other than the annoyance of the fascist shit.

      <p>
       imagine you are a mirror to yourself.  you're allowing your perception of what i said as you would feel about it if it were you saying the same thing to dictate your response to it.  it's self-windup.  do you see what i'm saying?  and i'm not saying this to piss you off or to elicit an emotional response.  truly.  i'm just trying to articulate accurately.

       lolz, "I've got something to sell and you better buy it no questions asked and without needing any knowledge of who I am that's trying trying to sell it to you. If you don't like it you are a fascist!" You don't get it that you were the person selling something and the buyers are trying to protect themselves, do you? Smh, smart shopping and buyer protection: next level fascism.

       why would they need consumer information?  of what relevance to the transaction itself is the identity of one of the transactors?  zero relevance.  the merit of the item, sure.  that's relevant.  but the person?  no.  and i explained why.  if you want to spin this up into some unnecessary conflict too, you're on your own.

       I don't know what you do for a living, but at any company I have worked at that purchases goods from suppliers, you better believe we know damn well who exactly they are for our consumer protection. I never realized that was a form of fascism. You do you, though, Gordie. You insist on only purchasing from nameless, unidentifiable entities to fight fascism...

       it's a frickin substance.  you weigh it.  the determination of veracity of whether it's a silver coin is pretty easy to do.

       Well, apparently they have their reasons to not simply do it that way and as the consumer it is their right. Deal with it. If you don't like it find someone who is willing to blindly buy silver coins off you. It has nothing to do with fascism, though.

       fair enough.  that's your opinion.  to me it's fascist because it's someone telling you what you can trade because of
       <em>

       </em>
       you are.  to each his own.

       You should check out
       <a href="/r/coins">
        /r/coins
       </a>
       for advice. Selling to a private individual will normally get you a better price, because coin dealers will always have a margin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what type of coins they were, but anyone thinking of buying coins should go for bullion coins (ie no numismatic premium) and avoid coins from private mints.
