        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">55</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Jac0b777.html">Jac0b777</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On this subreddit we talk about a great many things. Political conspiracies,, international conspiracies, financial conspiracies, paranormal conspiracies, science-related conspiracies....</p>

<p>But there is one that is so often missed. And yet it is crucial.</p>

<p>It is the conspiracy of the mind. The conspiracy of how you have been brainwashed. How you live in a penitentiary, a prison of your inner world.</p>

<p>In your mind there exists a maze. A maze of thoughts and beliefs, all of them related to emotions you experience in your body. This maze is similar to a prison, it is a prison that has been imposed on you by society, by those that have raised you and by yourself. </p>

<p>Everyone that is indoctrinated in this society shares many aspects of this prison. Many of the bars and the graffiti on the wall of your cell are the same, or have similar qualities to them as those of the person next to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As within so without, as above so below” - Hermes Trismegistus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thought precedes action. And because of this, your thoughts and with them your emotions, decide your reality. Not only your reality, but the reality of everyone on this planet.</p>

<p>Because of this, the main point of change must be your own mind. The main aspect of existence every single person that wants to create a change in this world needs to explore is their own internal world. Their own internal reality. </p>

<p>In order to save the world we need to save ourselves. In order to save ourselves we must break free from the mental/emotional prisons that have become our internal companions and have bled into our external reality.</p>

<p>You must dissolve the bars, the pain and the confusion, the lies, the brainwashing...that is keeping you in the mentality of fear, slavery, deadness, hate and apathy.</p>

<p>The prison has been constructed over a long period of time. Interacting and believing in the reality of your prison has strengthened it throughout the years. Thus, let me warn you, deconstructing it will not come overnight. But doing so is one of the most valuable undertakings you can do both for yourself and for the world.</p>

<p>So how do we deconstruct our internal prison?</p>

<p>The main thing, the fundamental principle in dissolving internal illusions and pain is and will always be the same – awareness.</p>

<p>If you are not aware of the fact that you are in a prison and how your prison is constructed, you cannot get out of it. In the case of the internal prison, awareness is even more powerful than in the case of an external one. Thus in many cases, simply bringing your limiting, your painful, your destructive thoughts and emotions to the light of your awareness will already be enough to dissolve them.</p>

<p>Awareness is magical. It is the core of who you are. And by being aware you will find that you will literally transmute what you become aware of into gold. </p>

<p>This is also the core of any meditative practice – bringing your pain and illusions to light, using your breath to steady your awareness, seeing your limiting thoughts as simply thoughts (not necessarily true and not necessarily part of who you are), bringing clarity and light to the situation – and through all of this dissolving the bars on your prison cell.</p>

<p>Looking within is crucial. So don&#39;t be afraid to start right where you are with who you are and how you feel right now. Your breath will aid you and a healthy body will help you as well (exercise and a good diet are amazing) in keeping your awareness steady and clear - and not getting overwhelmed by what you may find.</p>

<p>Thus, become aware. Look at your thoughts, examine them. Write them down. Keeping a journal of your thoughts, your feelings is incredibly liberating – it gives your awareness the ability to far more easily dissolve and see through your limitations. Talking to someone can be amazing as well – if not, then talking out loud, to yourself, can also be a very healing practice in bringing your inner narrative into awareness.</p>

<p>When simply seeing your thoughts and limitations is not enough, go deeper. With emotions, embrace them with love and compassion, let them go and look within them to find the source of your pain (for more on how to deal with this, may this link be of assistance: <a href="http://www.embraceyourexperience.com/2017/12/embracing-dissolving-inner-pain-suffering.html">Embracing and Dissolving Inner Pain and Suffering</a>).</p>

<p>For thoughts and long standing beliefs, the key is to question them. Doubt them, do not believe them at face value. Do you believe you are a loser? Unimportant? That your life has no value? Do you believe our society is doomed? Do you believe you have no power? No possibility to help the world or yourself? </p>

<p>Question these beliefs, otherwise they will run your life into ruin and destroy you.</p>

<p>Ask yourself - “Am I sure this belief is true?”, “Am I 100% sure without a doubt?”, “What is my evidence in believing this is true?”, “Is there any evidence to the contrary?”
“How do I feel when I think this thought, believe this belief?” “Who would I be without this thought/belief?”</p>

<p>These questions are a modified version of &#39;The Work&#39;, which is a self-psychotherapeutic practice from Katie Byron. Available in her book &#39;Loving What Is&#39;, but also available totally free on her site <a href="http://thework.com/en/do-work">http://thework.com/en/do-work</a>. It is a wonderful process/practice and I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>By questioning your beliefs, by doubting them, you will soon see that many of them are based on pure fiction. They are lies you have been led to believe by our society and by others that have been brainwashed by it as well. If you truly honestly introspect and find your core beliefs, beliefs from which your whole reality, your sense of self and your world springs – and question them – you will change your whole world.</p>

<p>Negative, limiting beliefs are like a black hole, sucking life energy away from you. You don&#39;t have to believe things that are bringing you down, that are making your life hell. By seeing how you feel when you think these beliefs you will witness the pain they are causing you. Then you can choose to drop them, you can choose to question them and live your life forward without them.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even need to replace the negative beliefs with positive ones. You can if it helps, but you can also simply be without beliefs. And you don&#39;t need to be scared by that notion, by that idea. Being without  thoughts and beliefs (or at least having less of them) does not make you blank. On the contrary. It makes you intuitively see and discern the truth and fills you with aliveness that is at your core – it gives you both clarity and peace.  Both of which are at your deepest nature.</p>

<p>Because there is one thing you will notice. And perhaps this is just might be the greatest “conspiracy” of them all.</p>

<p>Underneath all of your pain, your thoughts and limiting beliefs, all the garbage superimposed on who you are... you will find that there is this peace, this stillness, this freedom.</p>

<p>This is your natural state. You don&#39;t need to put anything positive onto who you are, because your natural state is one of freedom. Your natural state is not blankness, nor guilt, or pain, or fear, constant dread and dissatisfaction. Society has told you that without the constant stream of thoughts, without the narrative, without the emotional drama – you would be dead inside, blank. Nothing could be further from the truth. Without the drama and the pain, without the negativity and misery, without greed and envy, without fear and hate....you are free. </p>

<p>And that freedom can be both passive and active. It may take you on a journey of your life if you follow it (and if you wish to be free, follow it you must), or it may guide you to simply calmly sit and sip your morning tea while reading your favourite book. Whatever is appropriate will come forth in an expression of unique spontaneity. If you come to the principle of stillness and freedom beneath all else, you will know what to do if you choose to follow it. And if you follow it you will be helping and healing not only yourself, but the whole of our world.</p>

<p>Your freedom is at the bottom of the final rabbit-hole. And that rabbit hole is you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Much love to you all and may 2018 be a year that ignites the sparks of peace and freedom for every individual and this planet as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus to me is one of the greatest spiritual masters that have walked this Earth. I have connected to him many times through prayer and meditation and he is pretty much pure peace and love. At this point I have been doing this for so often and so long that I can connect to him with merely an intention and calling his name. The more you open up to him, the deeper the connection can get. It can even be too intense at times, especially if you are holding any anger, grief, fear, resentment, resistance....inside of you. This is because opening to abruptly to the powerful energy that Jesus possesses cleanses of you that negativity on the inner level.</p>

<p>My personal metaphysical and spiritual beliefs are more based on eastern views (in regards to meditation...etc.), but I have always had a much greater connection to Jesus than to any eastern spiritual teacher/master (the Buddha for example).</p>

<p>If you want a bit more detailed take on what my perspective is on this  subject and how I view it, I&#39;ll link two comments below where I explained this to two other users on different subreddits:</p>
