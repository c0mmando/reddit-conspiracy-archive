       I do NOT hate Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT anti semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, despite my honest confessions, people will still brand me some kind of "Nazi Jew Hater" just because I question the political actions of the world and Israel alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot speak my mind openly, peacefully, and calmly without being attacked every time, predictably so, when any topic is raised that does not praise the glory of Israel.

       so post dumb conspiracies and the one that gets the most downvotes is the real conspiracy? I don't want to be associated with posting dumb conspiracies. Perhaps we can search the sub for tne most downvoted posts to get an idea on what conspiracies are real.

       Um, neither are dumb conspiracies and they are actually interlinked, that's the point. The problem is one gets parroted while the other gets buried, by design, imo.

       Ah...I replied to the right user, but the wrong post. Meant to ask you to elaborate or link to past posts on the Rome-Judea connection. I've come across it in my own research outside of this sub, but have yet to connect all the dots. I'll keep digging.

       Here’s a hot tip for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       When you talk about your theories that are ethnically or racially motivated, people have no responsibility to listen or care.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not what free speech is. Free speech guarantees the
       <em>
        government
       </em>
       cannot interfere with your speech. When you experience ridicule for your ideas, you are not being oppressed or having your rights infringed. The Jews would probably know how that actually feels, maybe they could tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening is that you are putting your ideas of anti-Zionism or whatever, into the zeitgeist... and it decides it doesn’t like it.

       Then you’d be better off talking about it in much more secretive and controlled settings that aren’t publically accessible.

       I just don’t see that as the case, however. I see people with racist beliefs they can’t admit to themselves looking for external justifications for said beliefs.

       Bias is bad right? If you have a bias, you are going to prejudge things and people. Prejudice is always wrong, correct? So you have admitted you are a bigot that has prejudices. Youre literally a nazi. Repent and conform.

       I just said everybody has biases. You. Me. OP. Everybody. The only thing to do is be aware of them. Try to subvert them to avoid prejudice. It is almost always wrong except for the fact that prejudging people and experiences is also kind of necessary to categorize the world around us. I’m going to be on edge around a cop who is suspicious of me, and that is probably a rational behavior based on past experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re really trying to make me out to be the bad guy in a thread where some antisemite talks about how  “tha joos r bad”? That’s literal Nazi talk! Goddamn, you have a lot of prejudices you’re trying really hard to avoid consciously confronting.

       You’re really trying to reduce complicated concepts down to simplistic ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the abstract, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would not approach a large animal that you are not familiar with unless you are incredibly naive (prejudice: large animals are inherently dangerous). However, you could be wrong about the necessity of this caution. Maybe it’s a horse (prejudice: horses are domesticated animals) that is well-used to human contact. But wait! Maybe it is a horse, but it’s a stallion with mares around and he is
       <em>
        pissed
       </em>
       you’re interrupting his mating opportunities (prejudice: male animals are dangerous). Ah, but no, he is actually pissed because you don’t know how to act around a horse and you’re scaring him. He’s been gelded and the presence of mates wasn’t affecting his behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a lot of potential subversions and reaffirmations of the original conceit (large animals the dangerous), and could have stopped at any one of those ideas because of true
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       false conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In practice, I see racially and ethnically predicated biases on this sub all the time that aren’t based on reality or fail to acknowledge the presence of alternate conclusions. The conclusion reached is nearly always the one that abdicates the holder of responsibility for their own racist beliefs. “I’m not a racist, the Jews
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       a threat,
       <em>
        you’re
       </em>
       racist against white people for not seeing that!”
      </p>
      <p>
       It is intellectually bankrupt and reductive.

       They have to control the narrative or else annoying Gentiles might reach the wrong conclusions. As for popular media, it’s not a question of
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       they control it, they absolutely must control it to cover for a history of conspiring against the rest of us.

       More credible than a random redditor, many prominent jews have publicly admitted the same.

        "I think there’s a resurgence of antisemitism because at this point in time, Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural, and I think we’re gonna be a part of the throes of that transformation...Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century.
        <strong>
         Jews are going to be at the center of that.
        </strong>
        It’s a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode,
        <strong>
         and Jews will be resented because of our leading role.
        </strong>
        But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive."

       It's funny how progressive neoliberal SJWs/students hate Israel just as much, but are somehow immune to being called nazis for it, even though they express their hatred openly by booing israeli speakers at events and even banning jewish gay people from events like Pride for "offending" muslims.

       This is like the Hutus calling the Tutsis, 'a possible problem'.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in fact, they are both divided and conquered.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, let's play the reduction game:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is everyone in the US, a US provocateur?  no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is everyone in Israel, an Israeli provocateur? no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is every jew then a provocateur?  no.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, how can you say 'the Jews', in any regard, with clarity, if you dont actually mean 'the whole lot of Jews', and specifically mean a particular group of people who might happen to be jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you screw up that moment of clarity, you are in-fact saying two different things, regardless of what you intend to mean; as it's not what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, this is like saying, "Cecil Rhodes was a conspiratorial-racists, so the 'whites' or the 'English' are all provocateurs".
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, language hold propositions. If you dont mean to generalize everyone, perhaps due to a lack of accuracy or clarity in your ability to describe what you actually mean, then you will no doubt confuse others, when you accidentally describe those you mean not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you in-fact mean to say, unless you are an anti-Semite making hurtful cartoons, is that a few Jewish members of current and ancient sects, practice a crypto-religion - among other groups (christian, Muslim, and left-handed alike) - in an attempt to worship the destructive side of the material god form.
      </p>

       The originals, who were Jewish, started from 1666.

       Nobody is THE authority. We only have our own ascertations, and we can only learn to trust trustworthy sources in order to ascertain things we cannot know or see ourselves.

       I’m not hating Jews because somebody tells me they rule the world secretly and can’t show me any decent evidence. We tried that whole “scapegoat the Jews” thing and it led to unimaginable evils being perpetrated.
