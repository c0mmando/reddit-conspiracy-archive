<p>TWO YEARS LATER....</p>

<p>The mainstream media finally picked up the story as NASA published various uninteresting statistics and reports. So yes, HERE IS RECENT HISTORICAL PROOF THAT NASA CAN AND DOES ENGAGE IN LARGE SCALE COVER-UPS OF DATA.</p>

<p>the CME would not be the end of the world, but the first few days could be some of the worst. 1-2 days preparation would give civilized people and communities to time to prepare.</p>

<p>Yes, Los Angeles is doomed, because the city is full of human shit, but on the other hand, NYC, would be fine, Chicago is a toss up, unfortunately places like Utah would probably also be fine, as well as Boston.....</p>

<p>There is a difference between a world ending event like a meteor, and even then I would still want to know, but at least I can see the argument there.</p>

<p>Good little slave? That was unnecessary, especially why his comment was logically sound. Society WOULD find itself surrounded by mass chaos. 
Period. </p>

<p>You are plainly delusional if you choose to believe the entirety of humanity could handle ‘the’ news of an impending disaster... while at first it may be slow (as the selfish, righteous, and proud would find it difficult to believe), once understanding took hold, it would be an interesting Katrina-esque destabilization (and almost certainly incredibly worse).</p>

<p>There must be some misunderstanding, as such a blanket statement indicates how little you actually understand; that you might argue such ridiculously immature drivel suggests youth or perhaps a learning disability? </p>

<p>I think the info has been previously and exhaustively well discussed, so this post is kind of similar to an article about how the night is a very dark time for me.....aaaaaaand every single living thing on the planet. </p>

<p>But</p>

<p>It’s not exactly incorrect! Just.....pointless and misguided. </p>

<p>Only problem is, it never happened. Yes there was a radio show, and yes 1 or 2 maybe dozen total assholes went nuts, but 99.9999% of America did not, and yet to this day, it is held up as an example of public panic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You&#39;re entire question is framed incorrectly.</p>

<p>it&#39;s old RAND CORP studies done by intellectuals in think tanks who are/were barely human beings themselves, much less experts on real human beings and societies.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take an extreme example. Can you at least agree that in an orderly civilized country like Japan there would be very little panic? Obviously we are not a homogeneous country like Japan, but we have parts that are close and communities and people who aren&#39;t complete fucking sociopaths.</p>

<p>Your perspective is obviously based on some low class hood situation in the inner city, or maybe even Hollywood or Oakland where yes, people are only 1 step away from eating each other, but you have to understand in more civilized upper class areas people aren&#39;t like this and won&#39;t start chopping up neighbors for food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite quotes from any movie in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>However, I always find myself nitpicking on it.</p>

<p>I get he was, it is, alluding the the assumed and apparent ignorance of a vast majority, especially the last 100 years of propaganda.</p>

<p>1500 years ago the church, did wonders in eradicating free thought and suppressing knowledge. Up until that time, celestial bodies and the motion of the cosmos was heavily studied and well documented. It&#39;s proof verified in the monumental buildings that still stand across the globe from every major civilisation.</p>

<p>500 years ago, with the last 1000 years of bred ignorance and despotic religious overtones, everyone was taught that the earth was flat because of that.</p>

<p>And 15 minutes ago I knew I was going to wake up and have a cup of coffee. I can&#39;t wait to find out we actually aren&#39;t alone on this planet, so I&#39;ll imagine we are until tomorrow, as tomorrow never comes.</p>

<p>I think this is true to an extent, we forget that people have a functional limit to how much actual pandemonium they can keep up.</p>

<p>But then again, look what has happened in rioting.  You have a good 24-72 hour surge in literal chaos -- looting, assault, killing, arson.  For the really big riots (like the Rodney King LA riots), it kind of takes on its own dimension -- the cops barely try to contain it, and people intensify their chaos knowing the cops can&#39;t or won&#39;t stop it.</p>

<p>I could definitely see something like a major event being predicted and demand for resources outstripping available supply and this devolving into riots and looting, and depending on the destructive potential of the predicted event, the government failing to gain any kind of civil order.  Either because they can&#39;t maintain discipline (troops/cop desert their jobs) or they&#39;re just reserving their own troops/supplies for post-event containment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Heh, you&#39;ve just described the day-day mindset of hard core preppers.  They&#39;re sort of mass panicking in a very controlled and thoughtful manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it would take much MUCH longer to re-establish power, as this type of storm damages transformers, and our infrastructure is not prepared for this.</p>

<p>1 study noted that the only suppliers of these massive Power Converters which would have to be replaced was China and there is a five year backlog even if we did invest in this type of preparation, which we haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>ALSO many satellites in orbit which aren&#39;t properly shielded would be damaged and would have to be replaced. Anything depending on satellites is going to be out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember one time the power went out on a Sunday afternoon once in the smallish city in New England where I live. No big wind storm, no real obvious reason.</p>

<p>After a few hours we decided to get the battery powered radio out to check what&#39;s going on. Because it was Sunday the big radio stations were just playing recorded shows. The only station that was live was a small Portuguese station and they were beeing flooded with calls by panicking locals.</p>

<p>People were freaking from the lack of info and this was only after a couple of hours. Can you imagine if it was a couple of days? </p>

<p>The outage ended up being a main line snapped from ice buildup and it took about 8 hours to restore power.</p>

<p>After this small event and seeing 1st hand the reaction of people I have no doubt that people would not handle a real attack on the power grid whether informed or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no.. most areas don&#39;t have anywhere near enough food on supply to provide the local populace for any length of time. We rely on regular food transports on cooled trucks to cooled warehouses. If the electrical grid is wiped out food transports are shut down and food supplies spoil and run out.</p>

<p>Simply put, if we were forced to rebuild the electric grid it would probably be all but impossible. The infrastructure would be shut down and also anyone who could do it would likely be dead from starvation.</p>

<p>Maybe you knew that, but still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all - thanks for the links. </p>

<p>Second of all - not a personal attack, but you’re coming across as a bit of an asshole. Most of the people here just want a discussion, not to attack you. </p>

<p>Thirdly - I know you are looking for sources, and people have cited Katrina and War of the Worlds, but just look at any major natural disaster. Looting. It happens. It’s undeniable. Yeah sure people will queue up and wait to buy stuff with enough warning. What happens when that guy buys the last of the water and the sleeping bags? The rest of the crowd is just going to let him leave? Hell no man, they’re gonna get violent. They see that as their last chance of survival. It’ll get ugly fast. </p>

<p>Now whether or not we are better off with warning? Yes we are. Collectively though I do not think we are mature enough as a species to adapt to the situation. As small groups, yes we could. But all it takes is one asshole and it will descend into pandemonium. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting, OP, thanks.</p>

<p>Also, I agree wih your philanthropic view that humanity is much more civilized that it’s given credit for.</p>

<p>Comments such as thenone by <a href="/u/tortillastomper">/u/tortillastomper</a> definitely reflect the mainstream belief (which happens to be inculcated). Every other TV show, series, movie, best-selling book, etc. rarely miss an occasion to depict humans as beasts that would still be living in caves if it were not for the enlightened elite, the “builders of civilisation”. According to this belief system people need to be herded around, and are akin to domesticated animals that would barely be able to feed themselves if not fed by the benevolent sheperds.</p>

<p>Interestingly, people who buy into this propaganda <a href="https://xkcd.com/610/">never see themselves as beasts; only every one else.</a></p>

<p>This actually goes quite deep; as far as the intrinsic bias in the way we teach history. Indeed the real conspiracy of history is not that it’s mostly a lie, but rather that it focuses on the recitation of war crimes by psychopathic conspirators (rather than actual event that helped shape our current world).</p>

<p>I highly recommend <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5sgk1p/the_real_conspiracy_of_history_the_biggest_scam/">this OP I wrote a while ago about this very subject.</a></p>

<p>TLDR: Had civilization not built the Sistine chapel, Gothic cathedrals, Loire castles, Versailles, etc. and other stuff we generally find &quot;marvelous&quot;, humans would already have understood who they are, and would have already (peacefully) colonized the galaxy.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember something about this. Can&#39;t recall how many years ago I heard about it, though. After I heard about the near-disaster I didn&#39;t think too hard about it and just kinda forgot all about it.</p>

<p>So... the sun is capable of throwing an EMP blast that can wipe out all electronics worldwide. And no heat, refrigeration, or flushing toilets would be a problem. Should we like... do something about that? If the sun can throw an EMP blast once it can do it again.</p>

By day the end of the first day, once people realize they have been tossed back into the dark ages, the looting starts within 24 hours... and it just goes down hill from there.

<p>From an esoteric/metaphysical vantage point for those that resonate with it (my perspective):</p>

<p>I feel like humanity is dodging bullets. </p>

<p>From an esoteric perspective this would mean that the collective consciousness was aware and at peace enough to not create this calamity, which is very positive and entails that humanity is moving forward. The collective reality is co-created by all sentient beings within it, thus this means that the negativity that would cause such a manifestation was dissolved in time. Inner growth and resolution of our own pain and limitations is needed in going forward, to prevent more apocalyptic events like this from potentially occurring.</p>

It&#39;s one thing if your own toilet stops up, you can go to the corner store and use that for a little while, but when every toilet is down? Yikes!</p>

<p>After a few days people might figure something out that doesn&#39;t make a mess, but in the meantime... yikes! I think the solution is to have a metal bucket to poop in and set the poop on fire somewhere where you won&#39;t burn your house down. Letting the poop burn to ashes should kill off any gross diseases. So, it&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t a way to reasonably solve this until the plumbing comes back online, my concern is that people will have to shit <em>now</em>, and won&#39;t have time to think about where it goes!</p>

<p>In all seriousness: The story also points out that many rushed to aid the man. People were drunk, many thought it was an act or performance, not a tragedy. </p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s hard to grasp such things, things beyond normal comprehension, right away. When the first WTC tower fell on television, I literally could not comprehend it for a few seconds. I genuinely did not understand what was happening. </p>
