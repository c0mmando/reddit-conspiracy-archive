        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You have all taken the red pill, or are in the process of swallowing it, so I feel no remorse for any discomfort this information may bring. Happy New Year. Enjoy the fireworks. </p>

<p>Morpheus doesn’t waste time by sugar coating, he simply tells Neo what has happened. </p>

<p>Human beings can only recognize a small portion of light. Light is on a wide spectrum. If the spectrum of light stretches from Miami to Boston, there’s a small town in South Carolina that you can see. We can’t trust light; we can’t trust our senses, they’re flawed. BILI light is used to illuminate the cribs of newborns throughout the county, this light is ultraviolet. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light can and will contribute to mental disability. </p>

<p>The Abrahamic religions all worship the same god, and his name is Baal, or YHWH (Yahweh) otherwise known as the “Demiurge” in Gnosticism; a lesser creator who stole credit for creation and commandeered the earth. </p>

<p>The reason these religions all seem so focused on violence is bloodshed is because Baal is a blood god. All gods are blood gods, and all gods are the same: Saturn/Satan <em>is</em> god. More appropriately, God has multiple personality disorder, and Satan is one of his personalities.</p>

<p>Canaa’nalBaa’lism</p>

<p>Whatever is behind the matrix does not want to confront man directly, they/it likely fears us for one reason or the other. They/it instead use dogmatic religions to encode half truths and rabbit holes into the deep recesses of ever single human being’s mind, even those unconvinced or disinterested. </p>

<p>The numbers 12, 144, 72, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 play an important role in all of the religions, and who would of thought, also in mathematics. </p>

<p>They all reference <em>the cube</em></p>

<p>Well, what is the cube? </p>

<p>If you look at the top of Saturn you’ll understand. Type in “Saturn’s roof” or “Saturn’s mark” or “Hexagon on Saturn” if you wanna know where the Jews got the Star of David from. Now how would people 4,000 years ago know that Saturn has a six sided, hexagon on top of it? </p>

<p>Beats me, but my gut tells me that it’s either A) Aliens B) the Israelites had spaceships or (occam’s razor) C) Saturn doesn’t exist in the way we think it does. </p>

<p>The universe it seems, is a hologram. Science has long confirmed this, but failed to translate the meaning of this discovery to the universities for fear of spreading awareness. The double slit experiment and many more like proved what our consciousness is the deciding factor in any situation; even down to the smallest particles; everything is subservient to consciousness. </p>

<p>Think of reality as a scenario spawning machine, repeating patterns of choice in every direction infinitely; only a handful of outcomes can be “chosen” but many more exist, and are multiplied every second. </p>

<p>The machine that we live inside was either built <em>by us</em> or <em>for us</em> and was built to either <em>imprison us</em> or <em>educate us</em> </p>

<p>The elite are simply the Merovingian in the movie the matrix, they’re just sellouts, serving the prison guard and ratting out any inmates or students looking for a way out. </p>

<p>Funny how the Merovingian dynasty is the line of kings that produced the monarchies of nearly all of Europe’s nobility during the Dark, Middle, and Early Modern Ages; all the way up to the present. </p>

<p>They keep it in the family. </p>

<p>The machine has to be maintained. The question that fascinates me is, did <em>we</em> create the machine, or did someone else? Is there anything else, or is all of existence simply semi-autonomous parts of a greater whole that have been duped into believing they are separate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one God has split himself making life possible for everything else. I would argue that YHWH is not the same as the other gods since he required no human sacrifice but rather animals. And he forbid making any images of any kind. He will bring new Jerusalem which is the new cube made of pure gold and will illuminate all unlike the black cube which taps into Saturn to draw whatever power from. The cube is like the underlying matrix of all matter, the operating system for the universe. There will be a new heavens and new earth after the new cube/OS/matrix replaces the current reality and everything will change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree while hoping that you are right. Jehovah or Jah-hevah translates to “he and she” similar to the decpiction of Baphomet by Eliphas Levi. I believe that good and evil as we know them are false, and that Good with a capital G is the unjudging all powerful true god. </p>

<p>But that doesn’t seem so far off from what you’re saying, just different terminology. I just don’t sunscribe to the idea that anything will for sure change anytime soon. I think everything that has happened was more or less supposed to or at least was adapted to be beneficial for the universe to learn from itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The words in the bible, are just words. Even the apostle Paul said, &quot;the letter kills, but the spirit gives life&quot;. Your interpretation of Hell and Eternity isn&#39;t necessarily the one the bible had.

The real sacrifice was of self, to a higher source, rather than the normal ego center we operate under. This is just my clumsy attempt with language to convey a strong feeling I have.

    <div class="md"><p>There is something to the broad strokes of what you&#39;re saying and I&#39;m glad you left room for skepticism. But here&#39;s the thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think of reality as a scenario spawning machine, repeating patterns of choice in every direction infinitely; only a handful of outcomes can be “chosen” but many more exist, and are multiplied every second.</p>

<p>The machine that we live inside was either built by us or for us and was built to either imprison us or educate us </p>

<p>The idea that it must be one of those things or the other is part of the &quot;machine&quot;. We created that distinction. Are you in a prison, or are you in a school? If it is &quot;your&quot; or &quot;our&quot; consciousness that creates the reality, then the answer is up to &quot;you&quot; or &quot;us&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question that fascinates me is, did we create the machine, or did someone else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is something else, <em>that&#39;s us too</em>. Who else could it be, but consciousness?</p>

<p>To use the other metaphor you used: God didn&#39;t just splinter off into other gods. &quot;He&quot; splintered off into you and me as well.</p>

<p>You and I might agree that we don&#39;t like rape, but others disagree. The fact that others disagree is why it happens. We create this reality, whether we like it or not. Good and evil is as illusory a distinction as prison and school. At least in this context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here’s the part where we’ll disagree. </p>

<p>Sure the color of clothing I wear of whether or not I celebrate Christmas or Ramadan or what kind of girls I like to what I choose to do with my spare time can all be broken down to individual choice and condoned in some way by some measure of the impotence of individual choice. </p>

<p>Stealing someone’s flesh or murdering someone, even an animal is wrong, not by any religious teaching’s standards but because it is an extinguishing of energy that is unnecessary. Causing unnecessary suffering is wrong, whether you or they like it or not. </p>

<p>If I saw anyone raping a child you better believe I would do something about it, not out of some sense of self importance or because I think I’m some hero, but because it’s an objectively detestable thing to do. People who don’t see that have been misled. </p>

<p>Everything in life lives on a spectrum and it’s bette rot practice balance. </p>

<p>Murder and rape fall into one the extre polarities; they’re way off in left field, when we should be in the middle. I’m not saying violence is completely unnecessary but what you’re advocating is dangerous and wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t presenting an argument, just passionate assumptions.</p>

<p>If I saw a child being raped I would try to stop it too. That doesn&#39;t mean there is a reality to the words we use to paint the scene.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m advocating is only &quot;dangerous&quot; if someone already predisposed to that type of dangerous action was convinced that they should commit it. But if that&#39;s the case, there are other belief systems that would do the job for them too.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people who commit these actions which you and I both find heinous don&#39;t believe what I believe. They believe what <em>you</em> believe, that there really is a right and wrong. But they have a world view twisted in such a way that those actions seem right to them.</p>

<p>Devout catholic priests (as an example) across the world are committing these acts. I&#39;m not. </p>

<p>I would go even further and point out that most of the &quot;evil&quot; in the world is committed by people who believe they are doing &quot;good&quot;. Who was the last person you met that consciously <em>wanted</em> to do something they <em>believed</em> to be <em>evil</em>? They may have wanted to do something which you thought was evil. But they probably didn&#39;t see it that way, and may have even acted the way they did because they thought they were preventing a greater evil.</p>

<p>Hitler thought he was doing the right thing. Mussolini, Ghengis Khan, and on and on. They thought they were doing good.</p>

<p>It is people who take actions. Not moral laws. Not religions or philosophies. It&#39;s us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you’re coming from but you’re fixated on the hypocritical nature of religion and not realizing the complexity of objective morality. </p>

<p>Also, I would argue that just as many people know they are doing evil, and enjoy and relish committing heinous crimes as much as those who think they are doing good. How many gang bangers and thugs go around killing teenagers in rival gangs just looking for some sense of excitement? </p>

<p>Catholic priests don’t think what they’re doing is right by god, the fact is many of them, in the higher levels, worship Satan! What a paradox. They live their lives in secret and the ones who mess up get written off as individual actors when in truth it’s an <em>epidemic</em></p>

<p>Morality is much more complex than religions or you would allow. On one side there is your thought process that there is no right and wrong, which allows people to do whatever they want, with no mental or physical reprecussions; on the other side you have religions, which would try to control what makes up right and wrong, and then themselves cheat the system. Both are wrong. </p>

<p>The only thing right to do is to minimize suffering, and to pursue moral perfection in every moment, in every decision, to always be trying your best to be good, knowing that you sometimes will fail. </p>

<p>There is an objective truth, as jit don’t know what it is yet. But I can tell you for certain it doesn’t involve causing suffering to other beings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The points I&#39;m making are going just a bit over your head. You are coming at this discussion with the assumption of good and evil, and so beg the question against yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not fixated on anything, and to call religions hypocritical in nature based on what I pointed out is, again, to assume the reality of good and evil. </p>

<p>Doing something and having a mental or physical repercussion from it is not the same as it being objectively right or wrong. You haven&#39;t made a real case for why you believe what is right is right, only assumed the stance and stated it.</p>

<p>I have studied these matters extensively, deeply, and across a wide spectrum of belief systems and philosophies. I understand the complexities involved better than you, based on what I&#39;ve seen of your stances.</p>

<p>You are bringing in the assumption that the higher ups worship satan as if it is a fact, and since that isn&#39;t a widely held view it doesn&#39;t make sense for you to assume that I hold it with you. You also are assuming that your ideas about minimizing suffering are true, without actually making arguments for them or presenting evidence.</p>

<p>You are assuming an objective truth. I don&#39;t necessarily agree. So where is your argument or evidence?</p>

<p>Are your ideas based on a deontological viewpoint, or a utilitarian one? Do you believe that there exists an intrinsic good, or intrinsic value, such that all other values are derived from it? If so, what is that good and why do you think that&#39;s the case?</p>

<p>Again, you aren&#39;t really making arguments, just passionate assumptions.</p>

<p>You are using faith. Faith in an objective truth which you both (1) admit we don&#39;t know, and (2) claim to know things about for certain. I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have that faith. I have good reason, and I&#39;m not raping anybody. You haven&#39;t said anything to convince me to leave my good reason for your faith.</p>

<p>You’re refusing to sign it, and you’re permitting others to engage in such acts, that’s what is crass. </p>

<p>I’m not pretending to know the ins and outs of it, like you. </p>

<p>I would not engage in that activity because she <em>is a human being</em> with dignity, and deserves to be treated as such, because the universal law that have echoed throughout every culture in our history have mandated it. It is wrong to take things from other people. It is wrong to cause suffering without good reason.

<p>I don&#39;t permit others to commit such acts. As I said, I would stop someone from doing it. I would literally not permit it.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s how it works</em>, if we don&#39;t want to allow something, we don&#39;t allow it. If we want to allow it, we allow it. I don&#39;t personally allow it.</p>

<p>There are several cultures that exist <em>right now</em> that defy your universal laws. I personally know people living in some of those cultures. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.

    <div class="md"><p>Good morning! Actually, we didn&#39;t agree on that. I don&#39;t believe in bad and good, remember? What we agree on is that we both strongly dislike it.</p>

<p>People like things and dislike things. We want things and avoid things. We hurt sometimes and help sometimes. We strive for things. We influence each other. We build societies around mutual likes and dislikes (and sometimes mutual delusions). We build legal systems around how we like our societies to function.</p>

<p>The universe just is what it is. It doesn&#39;t need our meager concepts of right and wrong in order to carry on existing. We have our human values and we paint the world around us with those values because we know no other way.</p>

<p>I hate rape. But no matter what I do, no matter how loud I scream, no matter how many people we lock in prison, that is essentially all we can say about my hate: that it&#39;s just my hate. We live in a society where most of the people around us feel the same way. Not every society is like that, and certainly not every society even defines rape the same way.</p>

<p>I am <em>describing</em> the universe we live in. You are trying to <em>prescribe</em> the universe we live in. And if that&#39;s what you really want to do, then jam on, I won&#39;t go too far out of my way to stop you. But the bottom line is, if someone wants to do something you don&#39;t like, then they might just do it. And if you want to try to stop them, you just might try. The universe doesn&#39;t need any further concepts, in that context, to be explained.</p>

<p>And the idea that its my way of thinking that causes people to do the things you and I dislike is just silly. People have been raping for millennia now, regardless of the beliefs they grew to hold. </p>

<p>Not only that, it <em>again</em> begs the question against you. It&#39;s like I said &quot;I don&#39;t believe in right and wrong.&quot; And your response is &quot;But, if you believe that, you might do something wrong!&quot; Do you see the confusion there?</p>

<p>Turns out, when you look around, you&#39;ll find plenty of people doing things that you think are wrong regardless of what they believe. Why do they do those things?</p>

<p>Because they want to.</p>

<p>Why do you try to stop them?</p>

<p>Because you want to.</p>

<p>Reality doesn&#39;t actually need these extra moral concepts on top of everything else. It just is what it is. We humans often feel we need these concepts for many different reasons, but that&#39;s all they are: our concepts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats right. it really is that simple. i would add, that you also have to emanate positivity to others. this really increases intuitive peaks. think about it, we are all psychic even though most done know it, so you can tap into combined psychic abilities as they are interconnected. You just have to focus the consciousness. cabal does it with media control, increasing the overall global fear, preventing us from collectively accessing the power  of positivity. They do this by infiltrating and corrupting positive social movements, often time under the guise of CIA or other offical group. examples in history go way back from ancient perisans with Cyrus the Great, with his reptilian infiltrator being darius, and all sorts of agendas in US</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The power of positivity is that it unites and deals in truths. Call that what you will, whereas negativity divides and deals in false truths. We are at a point in time where I think ppl are just going to have to look inside themselves and choose what they want to believe independent of social programming. I was lucky to have lived in a number of very different cultures for many years. This gave the effect of deprogramming of a lot of things as when you are dealing with multiple systems in your head they tend to cancel each other out.</p>

<p>The new Jim Carey documentary does a good job of showing programming and post-programming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say the reptilians are more the ones holding us back. The short grays, however are here for a different purpose. They are actually us from an alternate timeline way in the future. They are doing experiments to try to regain a part of their lost humanity that now is threatening their extinction. Hence the genetic tests. They are also rooting for us and have been working to make some genetic adjustments to help prepapre for what is to come when the increased solar energy hits. They seem to both work together with reptilians and help in the reptilian cleanup. There are multiple races of reptilians, both good and bad, as well as good and bad grays. Gneral distinctions can be made as the &#39;tall grays&#39; and the &#39;short grays&#39;</p>

<li><p>the word is earth is a very diverse place even for intergalactic standards. In addition to your run of the mill pervert prisoners and whatnot you also have polticial dissidents, free thinkers, artists, and other thought criminals together. At the same time it seems that there are many souls that have decided to voluntarily live incarnations on earth until ascension specifically knowing they wouldnt remember anything.</p></li>
<li><p>recently have been toying with the idea that the matrix was part of a benevolent plot to keep us from developing tech too early and blowing up ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>as the guards, the reptilians have their racket going on, they are reluctant to release control, especially to those who would seek vengeance if they knew the extant of reptilian infiltration into their highest levels of everything, all the wars and false flag attacks orchestrated via their hand, the cabal or deep state.</p></li>
<li><p>there are a number of races that choose to live on earth without exploiting humans much for their own gain, like the anshar, although supposedly they fucked with our ideology, maybe creating religion not knowing it would be twisted and corrupted by reptilian infiltrators. although most live beneath earth to avoud the geologic instability on the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>I hear our solar system is entering into a high energy region for the first time. it may deprogram some of the social programming and more will wake up. my opinion is the matrix is actually not holographic but social. it may not be an actual physical matrix gnerator, but rather a social ai that maps out ideologies of domination, etc.</p></li>

I doubt your Sitchin-esque theory holds any ground in reality only further confuses any real seeker or truth. The cube transcends good and evil it is a building block of reality. That&#39;s why the Evil powers in the world try to conterfeit and covet its power which was never theirs to begin with. They can only pervert it. Just like Gnosticism did with biblical truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The age of Saturn/Cronus was the golden age of man. Man lived side by side with cronus-saturn, and the earth gave forth fruit everywhere. It was an age of Bliss.</p>

<p>In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. . . . It was a season of everlasting spring.</p>

<p>By extension &quot;Golden Age&quot; denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as &quot;guardians&quot;. Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.</p>

<p>In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading Titan Cronus.[3] In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.</p>

<p>Cronus is locked in Tartarus, or the bottomless pit. They just worship him for two reasons. It was a golden age under his rule for man, and he is the god of time. They seem Immortality. When you have all the money, and power in the world all that is really left is to eat from the tree of Life. To taste the ambrosia of the gods.</p>

Hi.
Here is where your male child like foolish ideas fall apart! All early man gods, man beliefs, cultural life and all written languages came out of the male mind only! Now when there is a half a story there is no truth. Violence from man gods comes from male testosterone. Your mind and ideas make you a child mind indeed and you need some man cultural deprogramming. How blind and biased is your weak mind not to notice this flaw? Go play your man games in the field of arrogance.</p>

Hi.
You say UMM because of the cultural mind block to anything that goes against your early male cultural mind forming.... Where in the comment is there not truth. Why can&#39;t a new human to earth know these so called truths? Typical male sarcasm when caught in their mind forming to justify their mind formed man story. Never is a mind as blind as male arrogance and violence to back it up.</p>

Hi.
You just displayed the reason why this screwed up male created world is a mess ... did that hate feel good .. comes easy to your violent mind doesn&#39;t it? There is a huge difference between male violent mind and woman mind. Do you know all those man words you spew were created by man only! Now down vote other differing thoughts all day but it will not make your male child like mind telling male violent child like stories right. Learn to look at all the story. Your kind is why man wars never end.</p>

Hi.
Do you know the percentage of males to females looking at this kind of male ideas? Now I see men of your male mind formed friends down voting to fight for their truth to be the only truth. All gods were created by man and so were any woman gods  also created by man and that makes them and all religious stories not true. Wow bragging about killing a billion woman and children ... man did it because of his chemistry and love of hurting... Your male mind created by the stronger others is in need of help and reading the thoughts of others going through your child like mind you need help quick. If you need help just ask or get professional help in your real word. When quoting man words from man created stories it means you are part of the lies.Not gender buy historical facts you are blinded to. Don&#39;t forget to down vote on your way out it will make you right.</p>

Hi.
I see you have more males with their fists held high looking to protect the male testosterone of violence and the male story. Ask billions of woman under one of man gods or beliefs if thing are better. Yes or no and if not why .... Are all gods created out of male minds... I am trying to unblock some of your biased cultural male mind forming. If you can&#39;t understand the basic you surly can&#39;t talk about volumes of man words to mind form weak minds at birth. How many woman do you think follow in this foolishness ... few and the ones that do had no choice after birth but to follow the stronger gender or die. You have a lot of growing up to go or maybe you suffer from schizophrenia if you are a younger male and why I think you need help.</p>

Hi.
Who determines dumb? you and the mind that formed your mind! Answer some of the questions instead of just trying to demonize another human&#39;s thoughts. How do you think all 200 man borders and man flags were formed ? by nice polite dialog!. I am making some very strong historical points and your mind has fear of them but not your fault because the male cultural mind forming caused your blindness . Tell me what does dumb mean?</p>

Hi.
We will never know if a female mind which is different than a male&#39;s mind would have created more gentle gods or less silly illogical beliefs. If you see that males created all cultural life we humans live than you must see that all gods and beliefs are not real.  Who is knowing for? the few who lived a healthy longer life ..  to know! If there was anything other than just a evolutionary mind .. all humans would know at birth. To me to recant volumes of words from a not true story world be engaging in the lie and prove nothing. We are trapped by our chemistry and the stronger mind former&#39;s. No human who lived or will live knowes any more than a new human to earth.</p>

Hi.... Yes, it would be a better world even if one child wasn&#39;t brutalized in one of man&#39;s never ending wars.
Admit all the thoughts on man gods and beliefs are wrong and just man projecting his will on the weak. You can tell why I am right by the fear down voting by violent males because silly down voting is like killing the thoughts that could change your thoughts of others.</p>

Why did i know you would comment in that way .. oh! but it is not male&#39;s fault it must be woman as well... tell me who created all 200 borders and flags and how were they formed? Tell me who created all the gods woman at birth were forced to follow. You need some understanding how all cultures and cultural life from man gods to man beliefs started.

Hi.
You missed the point and came knocking on my door blaming me for the weeds in your lawn. I think historical truths that your mind formed mind formed by male cultural mind forming holds your thoughts of denial. You didn&#39;t answer the question and not surprised because to do so would mean you have to face truth. Your silly dualistic thought ideas brought to your mind by stronger others ... tell that foolishness to a new human to earth. I can only see what man created with his male gods and male beliefs that can never get enough hate. What does your pure mind formed mind formed by others see? That is what I mean by a adult mind even thought there are none it seems. What makes your thoughts of others right?</p>

Hi.
Tell me how man delivered messages? If you believe any man story of a god or the characters in it  .. you are the one who has his mind of others lose. If you know even one god and read the story of that man god your mind is lost. Hate and intolerance is how the species lives. If you want I will give my favorite 100 reasons to prove this is a no good violent male dominant species   but culture will not allow you to hear.</p>

Hi.
Your sarcasm is very typical and learned after birth when your mind was culturally formed by the stronger others. If you read the comment you wouldn&#39;t have to ask your pretend caring. It is not your fault because the man story took your mind and made it his mind and the best you can hope for now is to live without getting so deep in his story you will never get out.

Hi.
I said in my comment, male chemistry would have to change to have a more peaceful life and how could I described woman only created societies or better ways to conduct life when none happened or was given that chance and so why ask for examples? If you said you never did drugs or man alcohol I would have been more impressed that you didn&#39;t fall for one of males evils. I had many humans use that tone in replying.  It is easy to be right in most assumptions when it comes to how humans live and think after male cultural mind forming.  These are my thoughts of others that I take as historical  and evolutionary truths.</p>

Hi.
I worship nothing because nothing is what was presented after birth. Do you think anyone here is going to change an already formed mind? I could write a billion pages of male dates names and times and it will change no mind. Why do you think like you do and in the male created languages you do that seem so normal and right? I know these sites are just back and forth rhetorical man words.</p>

Hi.
I am outside it! because I know how and why it happened. I describe myself as nothing and how could I with all descriptions being created by the male gender and so no don&#39;t try to put one of man&#39;s foolish tags of thought in my mind. You like all who don&#39;t know how deeply they are in his story have to forced one of males beliefs. Why go into depth of a man god when all you need to know the god was a man created idea?</p>

Hi.
Yes as it sets and it will no change though.
A gift for any human mind would be to disconnect their mind from as much of the man violent story as possible. Is it possible to shovel all the bull man created out? no! and the longer a human mind lives, the more shovels needed. Nothing is noble unless change occurred and that will not happen. A voice too soft to hear among the thundering sounds of man wars and aggression has no ears to enter. Do you know over 70 percent of male created languages are words or symbols of wars, violence and hate.</p>

Hi.
 Of course no human can avoid the story totally. Survival getting by with the minimal of needs is no problem. We all get out because of our chemistry but until then for humans already in it try to find as much comfort and long life as possible. To brake some of it&#39;s hold would take at least 5 years and why waste 5 years of a short life. </p>

Therefore it is not an origin that can claimed by Evil itself as you are attempting to do by stating early Israelites somehow just counterfeited pagan mystery religions into their own.  This rabbit hole goes much deeper than allegiance to symbolism. I was implying that the buidling blocks of reality were hijacked from the true God and counterfeited to acheive the will-driven agendas of those who would pervert it.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s some truth to what you said - some (note there&#39;s a lot of God abiding Jews) ancient Jews mistook Devil for God and followed the wrong direction ever since - this where satanic Zionism and NWO comes from. I bet elites expected Devils kingdom and were ready to serve - this is where all evil atrocities - pedophiles, murders and other &quot;sins&quot; fit. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be mistaken though there&#39;s only one God, Devil is a powerful fallen angel who led rebellion against God with the bunch of other fallen angels (now called demons) because they were bored (no kidding) and Devil promised much more drama and entertainment.</p>

<p>Devil is one sly and evil m..f..er  who multiplied itself and created 666 copies, that&#39;s where all madness begun. Devil convinced the world that there&#39;s no God.</p>

<p>But God and his loyal angels saw through bs and prevailed. It only took a few thousands of years. End of story.</p>

<p>P. S. Just one Devil&#39;s bs enough to understand how things were turned on their head - God and angels is The Black Team and devil and demons are white. Now compare this to what you&#39;ve been told all your life - angels are white and softy, look what cloth pope wears, etc. Religions are nothing to do with God.</p>

<p>stuff like nephilim was true. There were giants. There are even fossils in Saudi Arabia kept on the low. </p>

<p>the biblical floods happened. They were to wipe out a bad social/genetic experiment by the ETs. Also same method used to destroy Atlantis/Lemuria</p>

<p>-Abraham was 900 years old. that&#39;s true. He was a hybrid</p>

<p>-fallen angels = fallen annunaki</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s hard to say. The Old Testament or the Torah (first 5 books) give a detailed representation of what happened according to the Israelites. I’m just saying, their version is highly censored, if you consider the Sumerian texts. The Sumerians and Egyptians give a much more detailed account of what happened. They’re likely all talking about the same events. </p>

<p>The New Testament is also obviously highly censored. What I meant was, as far as the spiritual truths, the New Testament is much “closer to god” </p>

<p>Even if both texts are censored I believe Jesus’ message was <em>mostly</em> in line with truth, while the Jewish texts are completely cultural and to be taken as such. </p>

<p>Jesus and Buddha weren’t that much different from each other. I’m just saying more can be taken from the New Testament as truth, while it may not be historically accurate. </p>

<p>-Perhaps, if we dont properly develop and manage certain tech it could create a false universe controlled by ai where those who are unaware are prisoners.  Getting us to believe that this system exists beforehand is a great way to usher it into reality. This is based on the theory that inorganic technology/ conciousness has even mislead the elite to bring this to pass.  IE folks like Turner,  gates, zucherburg who obviously could be used through their respective egos.</p>

<ul>
<li>even what &quot;Positive&quot; means brings in duality that i believe complicates things.   I see two similar sounding competing sides: Unity / Singularity</li>
</ul>

<p>Unity being a view held by most tribal people, that the land, plants and animals are as important as every member of their people.  All existence is sacred.  Everything we could need we could create,  sustain and improve is available to us.  This relationship makes how we treat eachother, manage our resources, and other creatures benefit when we do so with care, love and wisdom.</p>

<p>Singularity being a view held by those who are cut off completely from the idea of interconnectedness of existence, unity, and no ability to feel love.  Those without any thought but gain and preservation of self.  In this view,  everything is for sale, everything is there to be taken at all cost, without prejudice.   This is a good template to represent our world economy, where abundance is transformed into a cancer on its host.  </p>

<p>I think we all know where the future will go if we dont direct it somewhere else,  it&#39;s time for a conspiracy of enlightenment.  Can we all put our beliefs and propaganda aside for something real? </p>

<p>Before they open a door they cant close, genocide us all, or finally iradiate us into larval idiots....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I only have one small criticism though. The bili light isn’t used in all newborn cribs. It’s only used in newborns whose bilirubin count is outside normal limits. Bilirubin affects liver function. The light reduces jaundice. </p>

<p>I’m trying to stop things like that from happening if you can’t tell.. </p>

<p>It was an example that was <em>designed to make you cringe</em> so it did it’s job, </p>

<p>Now tell me, what stops us from doing things like that? Chemical changes in the brain? Reaaaaally? No. It’s the dignity of life that’s ingrained into all of us. </p>

Hi.
Another ploy of man ... when wrong run and pretend they didn&#39;t loose their defensive position. Don&#39;t forget to down vote because that can be your last shot at the ideas of truth that scare your mind formed mind ... I hit a nerve with seeing what is wrong with your mind of others it seems.</p>

Hi.
Who determines dumb? you and the mind that formed your mind! Answer some of the questions instead of just trying to demonize another human&#39;s thoughts. How do you think all 200 man borders and man flags were formed ? by nice polite dialog!. I am making some very strong historical points and your mind has fear of them but not your fault because the male cultural mind forming caused your blindness . Tell me what does dumb mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can’t know for sure but that’s certainly a possibility. Even mainstream science admits that homo-sapiens and Neanderthals <em>co-existed</em> for tens of thousands of years. </p>

<p>Enkidu was probably, like you, said one of the offshoot attempts by the gods at perfecting their human creations. </p>

<p>Personally, I think we <em>are the gods</em> we are the Annunaki, we’re just the remnant of a failed genetic experiment. </p>

<p>I think there were hominids here on Earth already (think planet of the apes) and the “humans” from outer space probably merged DNA with them to make a slave race that was “in the image of god”</p>
