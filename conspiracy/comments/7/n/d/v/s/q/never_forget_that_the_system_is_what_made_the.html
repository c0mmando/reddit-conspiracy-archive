        And the System is censoring Aaron Swartz in real time. Googling his name would get one video and only by misspelling his name would also get the other documentary with 2 million views
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But that was a few hours ago and now none of the vidoes show up.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you have no idea who he is and his relation to reddit, He merged his Infogami (both nascent YC projects) six months after Steve &amp; Alexis founded reddit in 2005
      </p>
      <p>
       After hacking MIT to release educational information he was charged by the government for a maximum of 50 years in federal prison and $1 million in fines
      </p>
      <p>
       It just occurred to me that they wanted him to take the guilty plea so that the media would make it look like it's actually immoral to share educational information outside of their indoctrination
      </p>
      <p>
       Never forget the insidiousness of the System my friends
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a documentary for those interested
      </p>
      <p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        OH and guess what. Google is censoring this documentary. It only shows up if you misspell his name
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's what I was going to say when I was originally making this post. I don't even know if it's algorithms or if Google is stalking me. The 2 mill video shows up seventh in videos after some nonsense. Well actually the nonsense is pretty par for the course for this subreddit sometimes lmao and it could be true for god's sake

       What for? They've burned down the library of Alexandria before. Now we have the internet, and books yes of course. They flick a switch, the system goes down and won't be long before we have a worldwide Book of Eli situation, 'cept there won't be enough bunnies left.

       I save books, especially law books, and medical books. My favorite book describes water laws regarding my home state. I would think that people on this site would know that laws are being rewritten fraudulently, thanks to the oops of computers.

       Exactly. Can't remember where I saw the video of some professor who had dozens of versions of the same book spanning decades and you could see how it slowly changed into something completely different than the original. Almost unrecognizable but with the same title.

       Yea. I know. Certain people donâ€™t really have much to say, but they must say it and you must not question it. Itâ€™s the exact same behavior most people in the sub rally against.

       Bet a bundle it was more of a "suicide." Right after that the reorganizing and vote smudging in Reddit got crazy with the new guy yishan. The ever growing explosion of shills took over every sub after that. Reddit is too powerful a news source and propaganda pusher to allow completely organic discussion.

       I have when people answer like that without even thinking of a few possibilities first. How hard would it be really to find some sort of signal, radio wave, micro wave or whatever, that disrupts brain patterns and makes somebody feel shitty? How about stimulated? Maybe even aroused? How much does sound play a part? Can't be too hard to give someone muscle spasms remotely can it?  How about making a person dizzy?  So many more hypotheticals.

       Nuclear powered submarines, drones, quantum computers, satellites, super-sonic stealth planes, monkeys with iphones and on and on and dude wants to say a microwave gun makes that makes you sad sounds bogus. Sprayface probably thinks you need to clean the burrito grease out of the oven before converting it to a gun.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's no doubt that EMF and RF radiation can adversely affect the body. In thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies, researchers have shown that every-day levels of exposure result in adverse biological effects such as genetic damage, changes to important hormones and neurotransmitters, the stress response in cells, sperm damage, changes in brain wave patterns and sometimes breaches of the blood-brain-barrier. Some changes are consistent with cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Governments and EMF-emitting industries generally maintain that these changes are not important for health and that only the heating effects of radiation cause health problems. However, many scientists disagree and believe that the long-term consequences of these sorts of changes could cause problems.

       foil works as an antenna. spending as much time out of doors is best. that's why they usually stalk the people they test the weapons on, to make them spend all day indoors (out of fear). it's much harder to track and aim these weapons when the target is moving outdoors (though not impossible, just requires more satellites).

       His crime was aiming to right the real crime that's ongoing. A huge proportion, I suspect the vast majority, of paywalled academic studies were publicly funded via government grants. Taxpayers pay for the research, researchers submit their work for free (or even for a fee paid to the publisher, if they want their work printed with colour figures, etc.), publishers profit from all that public funding and free (for them) expert labour, and the information remains accessible only to those who pay these for-profit companies or belong to an institution that does. It's sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       (IMO, public research funding should be increased at
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       enough to allow all publicly funded research to be printed in open access journals, because anything else is theft of information from the public to pad the pockets of publishers.)

       Right wing trolls tend to get blocked more because the right wing operates more on lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give a couple of right-wing lies just within the last month:
      </p>
      <p>
       The right wing made a big fuss about Melania putting up the nativity scene at the white house, claiming it's the first time it's been there in 8 years.  The truth is that it's been there every year, even while Obama was president.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've also been claiming recently that we could now say "Merry Christmas" again, as if we hadn't been allowed to.  Yet there was no law on the books banning those words, nobody has ever admitted there was was someone holding a gun to their heads keeping them from saying it, and Obama himself even said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these are just the minor lies.  The right wing has enveloped itself in it's narrative so much that they can't even tell what the truth is anymore.  And they think that they need to educate others with these lies, hence why right wing trolls get blocked from sources like Wikipedia.  Funny....despite how much the right wing complains about "rights" and "freedom"....they really hate it when people have access to truthful information.

       The left lies SooOoOoOoo much. And when they're not lying they're at least bending or spinning.

       The right lies too. But they tend to be more realistic and less opportunistic than the left.

       You literally just proved there is no basis for the right wing outrage over "Merry Christmas", other than a perverted desire to try to force people to say what you want them to say.  Again, flying in the face of all that "freedom" the right wing claims to love so damn much.

       I'm saying there's an obvious double standard about Christmas itself. Right wing people are fine with Hanukkah and will be happy to wish Jewish people a happy one. But there's no question the media and advertisers shy away from saying Merry Christmas when they say happy holidays

       in the last year, weâ€™ve had a left wing presidential candidate try to rig  an election, rig a debate, commit treason by selling nuclear materials to our enemies, sponsor and arm ISIS, then use that terrorist group as an excuse to invade a sovereign country, ISIS TOOK SLAVES, the Democratic party paid people in other lands to murder and take slaves which created a migrant crisis that led to on fo the largest modern migrations away from the war zone. and itâ€™s a left / right thing.

       That's a brilliant observation. Perhaps we should take this conversation to more productive subs in general. I'd hate to see this kind of thought float off into the fog. I'll do some research of the concept soon. In the mean time does anyone have any suggestions about where this conversation may already be taking place? Or ideas about getting something like this moving?

       I think a regional open source university would be much better. As some comments have already stated here, a one world open source platform could too easily be used for nefarious purposes. If a very important piece of information was deleted then the entire world would lose it.

       I agree. Someone else brought this up and i think it's quite pertinent. Multiple local sources would be a mich better system. Granted some would still hide certain information. But it would be less easy to horde massive stores of it.

       how about we violently revolt, rifle through all stolen IPs (All ips ever, temporary moratorium on property rights) and decide which to open source without consent? those business whom profited off of those IPs will have 100% private and public assets stolen from them as well and redistributed as the kickstart to a new capitalist economy with stronger controls.

       Actually, he ended up not getting hammered for that one.  The one he got hammered for was trying to get the US law codes into the hands of the public, because the government demands obscene amounts of money for the public to access the very laws they are supposed to be held to.

       It was even

       screwed up than the initial situation everyone heard about.  All he was trying to do was get rightfully publicly accessible information, and get it actually available to the public, and not behind paywalls.

       The LII had similar goals as Swartz, but Swartz was rather upset by the fact that we had to turn to non-profit organizations to get the laws from our government at reasonable cost.  Instead of the government, being the creator of laws, allowing the public access to them.

       He was trying to download a massive amount of information, very quickly, from servers the government watches like a hawk, because they want to nickel and dime you for every piece of data that goes through.

       I was not aware of the Aaron Swartz story and his legacy, but  I'll never forget him now.  Thank you for linking that wonderful documentary. I cried myself to sleep after watching the entire story and woke up mad as hell for what our government &amp; official's did to him. Our justice system is so far gone, I don't think it can ever be repaired! God Bless his beautiful family.

       I'm sorry. Please post your search results. The Anonymous video you're referring is #7 in the video search results. Googling his name gives me over 400k results, half the top results mention the controversy, openly discuss the government driving him to suicide with unceasing harassment and threats of lifetime imprisonment.

       But... what are we going to do about it? Arrest the people responsible? How do you propose doing this if the system isn't willing to do so?

       No. I'm dead serious. I would love a revolution and to overhaul the system. But only if there are absolutely NO deaths in the process. None, not even the enemy can die in the process.

      <p>
       The revolution must be
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       peaceful as well as extremely efficient and intelligent for it to be effective, otherwise we become the very fascists we were trying to overcome in the first place. This is why every revolution has always failed. The minute the good guys resort to violence we lose the fight and become the oppressor.

       It is very simple, all I suggest is you look around closely, you put 2 and 2 together you will get 5. Look at the universities, media, domestic and foreign politics / relations. Look at mentors of our past leaders, think about the ones who've been assassinated

       You know what sounds fun is a personal networking project where it auto-downloads all the research papers that my account has access to. Imagine the database and knowledge compendium that I could create with that. The unlimited access restrictions are so vague. Surely they would applaud the efforts!

       I was always of the mind that 'they' approached him and wanted control/monitoring/access to reddit, looking ahead, and estimating that it would be huge and a good source of data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he refused and they watched him and put bogus charges on him to force compliance. Instead, he resisted and ultimately killed himself.

       Thank you for posting this! Thanks for SAYING this! I cant to this day NOT TEAR UP just hearing his name because THIS SHOWS WHAT OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS TODAY. We eat or kill our young and our creative visionaries. The biggest sign of human decline. Im reading this on New Years day. Im embarking on a new mission to find a way to better educate and nurture discovery and SHARE IT OPENLY. Im a 65 yr old aspie who didnt know it&amp;  who was so inspired and made hopeful by Aaron's taking on the rotten self serving interests of academia in such an open , elegant way. I hope the evil pathetic DoJ career obsessed cunt of a federal prosecutor who literally threatened him to death is haunted to death for her deeds. Ill wager however, shes still out wreaking havoc and hunting for trophies to further her own federally funded career. Perhaps I should pray nfor those like her who seem to have no inkling or use for harboring a soul or who have made the deadly mistake of pretending that federal LAW has any positive relation to JUSTICE today. Aarons soul was manifested and lives on! And seeing this post and the comments here is reason enough to rejoice and not despair or succumb to it.WHAT A BEAUTIFUL POST TO FIND HERE ON NEW YEARS DAY RIPAaron. We who dream of better things will never forget you, even though we miss you. I for one will carry on shining the light in your name and spirit. Namaste, with an open mind, open SOURCE, open heart, open pollinators, and an open carry.

       Xalli be prepared for the inevitable flak of system generated troll ballers. Yes. Your suspicion is on target. They have already infected the interwebz with their bots. More bots than humans interacting throughout it these days. S'okay. We persist and will prevail. With diligence and intent. Be aware that if you are human and continue to act in the interests of altruism and self preservation, and  NOT in the interests of maintaining status quo for the system , above yourself, then you are already identified and targeted by their bots. Bots dont die, they degrade. The humies that program them however, still bleed, suffer and die.  So farthe laws of nature still prevail. Stay safe and aware freind.
