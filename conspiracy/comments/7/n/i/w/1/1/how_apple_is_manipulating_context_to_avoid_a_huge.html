       Apple is doing corporate damage control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original complaint was that Apple was intentionally slowing down previous model iphones so people would want to upgrade sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple wants to avoid a huge class action lawsuit payout so they spun the story to be that "we slowed down phones to protect older phones battery usage!" BULLSHIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       They came up with this phony story so they could promote the "goodwill gesture" of replacement batteries that they get to also collect $29 per battery exchange so it essentially gets the upgrader to agree that they won't participate in a class action in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       IN NO WAY does that solve they problem of Apple intentionally slowing down peoples phones. It's a cover to protect them from making people's iphones feel obsolete in a faster time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total scam.

       Except... The inability to remove and replace the battery easily was a design choice made a decade ago now.  A design choice that purposefully limits your options and locks you in to needing to turn to Apple and their exorbitant prices to get it fixed.  They literally are lobbying for laws that will make it against the law to fix your own devices or have them fixed by a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being, they wouldn't have ever had to do ANY of this, had batteries been easily and simply replaceable.  Planned obsolescence.  Fuck Apple.

       replace it yourself relatively easily (~$20) or pay a 3rd party repair shop to do it (~$30-70). Those are hardly "exorbitant" costs.

       So lets be clear for a second: any device that contains a consumable component totally has a EOL (end of life) date. The question is how far out that date is, and what (if anything) a consumer can do to mitigate that date. This is true for every phone; LiIo battery tech is what it is. I hardly see how Apple is unique in their handling of this aspect of their phones. Like all other major manufacturers their batteries will eventually degrade and you can choose to replace your phone, or pay to replace the battery.

         It is not relatively easy for people who had no experience at all working on hardware.  Sure, it's easy for us, but for the average consumer, it is not, making the design inherently anti-consumer, since its not that hard to design a phone that has a battery that is removed without needing special tools.

       I also covered how they can easily take it in (to a third party or to Apple) and pay a relatively small price (relative to the cost of the phone) to have them replace the battery.

      <p>
       Easy on the hyperbole. There are plenty of reasons that basically the whole industry moved to sealed phone designs as soon as LiIo tech progressed to the point where it could support a  ~2 year life. (Vastly improved ability to waterproof, more efficient space utilization due to the removal of mounting hardware, etc). You're welcome to disagree with those reasons and argue a "removable battery" is more important, but acting like there aren't straightforward and valid reasons for the industry-wide shift is just silly.

      <p>
       You should read past click-bait headlines my friend. Apple doesn't want to outlaw third party repairs (and even if they did, such a law would almost certainly be overturned very quickly). They are lobbying against laws that require manufacturers to disclose and provide all diagnostics tools and software access to third parties/users. There are plenty of reasons for this. As Apple themselves notes in the quote from your article, one of the main reasons is biometrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biometrics rely on UID entangled codes that link the sensor(s) to the secure enclave. In order to prevent hacking attempts, the enclave will recognize/reject any attempt to substitute a new sensor or hack around the security by messing with the hardware. If the sensor has to be replaced/repaired it has to be done with Apple so that the pairing can be re-validated. If they were prohibited by overly broad laws (like the one in question) from placing software restrictions on certain types of repairs (like biometrics) they would basically be forced to open a massive back door in their security architecture.

       I just learned of it and read a couple of articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla offered a 75kwh battery at purchase time.  You could save some bucks by not taking that battery and getting a smaller one.  Instead of physically swapping the battery Tesla just employs a software trick to restrict usage of the battery.

       I don't see the issue in that. You paid for the smaller battery but lucked out because you actually had extra when you needed it. I've heard of this practice done in cpu manufacturing. When you have top of the line cpus where one core doesn't pass qc it is sometimes sold as a lower end model with the faulty core disabled.

       Even if there is a .01% save in battery life their claim would not be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       What needs to be established and made precedent is that updates deliberately slow the phone to promote the purchase of newer models.

       They didn’t do it to “save battery life”. They did it to stop shutdowns.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple example - when you overclock your CPU, you can increase the frequency to a point that your power supply cannot supply enough electricity for the system to boot. It shuts down straight away.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a battery degrades, in some situations it cannot provide enough voltage to the CPU so the phone shuts down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Apple did was for the phones with degraded batteries, rather than have the CPU complete all the work at once, requiring a lot of volts, it uses a series of peaks which require a lower frequency, this stops the phone crashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether or not all of that , they have done on purpose so people upgrade their phones, I’m not sure of.
      </p>
      <p>
       But one thing is for sure - if it turns out to be true that they have done this on purpose to brick older phones, they will lose 90% of their customers.

       I mean there are many engineering reasons to make the phone sealed. (Vastly improved ability to waterproof, more efficient space utilization due to the removal of mounting hardware, etc). You can totally disagree with their decision and argue the benefits of a removable battery outweigh the cons, but its not like there aren't valid reasons the whole industry pretty much moved to sealed designs as soon as LiIo tech improved to a point where they could last ~2 years.

       What degrades is the BATTERY. When the battery degrades it cannot provide enough power to the CPU in some situation.

       ALL batteries have this problem.  Apple introduced software to fix this, by lowering the CPUs voltage requirement, the battery can supply enough power and the phone doesn’t crash.

       If the voltage is ever low enough it will crash or not start up in any case. Update or not.

       All CPUs produced today have variable voltage rates built in which adjust dynamically.

       Could it be their voltage adjustments were faulty causing the phone to crash? Which is what this patch fixed. If so, what's the affected devices?

       No, let me explain again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly - yes, the CPU voltage is dynamic. Meaning, the frequency and voltage will only increase when required.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem was - when the CPU required this frequency and voltage, the degraded battery was not able to provide this and the phone crashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Apple did was reduce the frequency and voltage required during these peaks so that the degraded battery was able to supply the required volts and the phone did not crash.

       What I'm saying is, having the phone crash in a usable voltage, by not being able to adjust it correctly, is the bug.

      <p>
       If my phone can run at a lower voltage without it crashing, it should work.

       I have answered your question multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they have introduced is software to monitor the health of your battery whilst monitoring all other aspects of your device, to dynamically adjust the frequency and voltage of your CPU to ensure that your phone doesn’t shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why changing the battery fixed the problem.

       Oh, I understand it. You're just accepting their bullshit lie about it when they clocked the CPUs lower than nessasary to give the false impression of your phone slowing down. This is just the excuse the idiots buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       No software update is going to magically make your phone run on less voltage. If iphones were crashing on peek performance when the CPUs weren't clocking back enough properly, which you say this update fixed. Then when did this start happening and what iPhones are affected?

       Actually, I think I understand why you’re confused
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain this
      </p>
      <p>
       Your CPU CANNOT adjusts its own frequency or voltage depending on the SUPPLY OF POWER.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it does, is it changes its frequency and power depending on its NEEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it needs 2.0GHZ and 1.3v it’s going to ASK for this. If it doesn’t get it, the phone crashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Apple has done, is written code into iOS to allow the phone to calculate an “upper limit” of frequency and voltage that the CPU can request, depending on the current health of the battery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make sense now?

       Not really, but I support companies who are either transitioning to a standardized Filemaker Pro/Ipad-Iphone remote field infrastructure or away from it to a more open source AWS cloud based DB device independent infrastructure. Before that I was using Apple products as a programming enthusiast/plus doing graphic design for my own companies since 1985.

       Well, for what’s it’s worth, my MacBook Pro is over 2 years old now yet works perfectly, exactly how it was when I got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My partners iPad is over 3 years old. It’s definitely slower than when I bought it for her, however has no other problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now saying that they timebomb their own products... you really need to think if it actually makes sense to do something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a company purposely sabotage their own products to stop working. This won’t drive upgrades of Apple products.. it will mean ppl will think their products are complete shit that break really quickly, and they will consider using other products.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, throttling CPUs just enough to annoy someone, making them think their phone is getting old.. maybe time for an upgrade? Completely plausible, even highly likely.

       I think they will. People buy Apple because they trust them, if they feel like they can’t trust them anymore they’ll buy another companies products.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the sad thing is, no matter which company’s product you buy, 99% of them are completely corrupt anyway , so it really doesn’t matter what you buy, you’re fucked either way.

       I cannot attest to the longevity of the current battery, I plug it in every night and do not use it while driving. Generally use it for shopping lists, navigation, phone calls in stores, texting, bubble level for woodworking, and for light photography. (None of these phones are really a camera) I honestly don't think I could get a full daylight of heavy use out of it, but I do have access to car/home and a portable battery pack (like you can jump a car, but about the same size as another phone)

       I don't disagree with that at all. But everyone who has owned multiple iphones or ipads have suspected for years that as soon as a new model is released.....suddenly the previous one becomes noticeably laggy compared to previous performance.

       Okay... so where is your proof of this? Nothing that has come out in this recent saga confirms this suspicion. It shows selective throttling in specific high-voltage draw circumstances on devices with degraded batteries. It isn't a wholesale "slow down" of all old devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, why the heck would they even do that in the first place if their goal was to drive new phone sales? A central tenant of driving loyalty/repurchase behavior is providing a quality product experience for the duration of usage and
       <em>
        particularly
       </em>
       at end of life when consumers are considering their replacement/next purchase. Intentionally screwing with phones right when people are in this stage of purchase evaluation would be silly.

       It's not to regulate the lifespan of the batteries, but to prevent random shudowns because old batteries can't supply enough power.
You can't use more energy then the battery is able to provide, no amount of code can change that.

       If a computer doesn't get the energy it need, it cannot work. The iPhone 6 and 6s did have the issue where it shut down unexpectedly after it's battery got older.
       <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-6-6s-sudden-shutdown-weve-almost-fully-cured-issue-with-ios-10-2-1-says-apple/">
        Here's a link from February talking about this exact issue.
       </a>
       If your device pulls too much power, you either have to reduce the power usage or increase the power you can supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple here decided to go the "It just works" route and decided to decrease the power usage when enough power cannot be supplied.
(And now they're discounting battery changes, which fixes the issue by increasing the power available to the device.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually care about this stuff, buy an android with removable battery and put LineageOS on it.

       my guess is that this was happening before warranties were expiring and therefore they did this to prevent all the warranty claims. If your phone is just shutting off while under warranty, thats something they would have to handle. But if its just slow, they dont have to do anything and can drag it out past the warranty expiration.

       Most warranties don't cover battery wear, so no warranty claims.
"Slowness" is very subjective at best, if you tell people you've updated something, you'll get people telling you how slow it is, others telling you that i runs much better while you didn't change anything.

       harsh but fair. the manner in which they did the slowdown makes it obvious it wasn't just to help out their users. they tried to slow their devices down behind the scenes and on the low. yeah...i'm sure it was just to "help battery life." honestly i don't even know why it bears mentioning in

       that something which is so obviously corporate malfeasance is exactly what it appears to be. it's odd to me how frequently the comments section here reads like a good portion of the userbase has no business being on a conspiracy subreddit in the first place..

       All Apple had to do is add a "reduce battery consumption" option in settings, and automatically enable it 2 years in (or pop a notification that they were enabling it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people could turn it back off, or even turn it on early if they wanted extended battery life.

       Except that this issue has nothing to do with battery life, it has to do with battery
       <em>
        health
       </em>
       . The problem isn't with phones getting decreased life. The problem is that aging batteries eventually reach a point where they can't supply the peak voltage that may be required in high draw situations. This can cause random sporadic shutdowns to protect the electronics. The throttling is designed to recognize degraded batteries and to spread peak performance request out over several CPU cycles so that they don't cause the phone to shutdown due to a overly high voltage draw.

       Except it would really be called "enable the mode where your phone will randomly/sporadically shut down when it tries to draw too much power". Which is a laughably stupid mode... which is why it wouldn't be incorporated.

       Sure, but does it help to have the IOS slowed down.   That should be easy to test.

       Battery degradation is real, but saying it comes to 1h is exaggerated out of proportion, or you're using your phone wrong.

       Only after 2 years of use do I notice my battery life losing its initial strength, and by that I mean no more than 20%.

       reducing the CPU speed 3x because battery life went from 4 to 3 hours is utter bs reason.

       I bought two Apple TV gen 2. I used one &amp; when the next release came out the Apple box started rebooting all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other one the person I gifted to is not a tech person &amp; never hooked it up. They gave it back to us &amp; I set it up. Worked great.....so I decide to update it to the current OS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately the thing starts rebooting all the time like the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You go search Apple TV "spontaneous reboot" &amp; you won't believe the number of complaints out there that Apple just ignores or 
'workarounds' that don't work.

       I've had 3 Macbook Pros that have had graphic card issues just after the warranty period has ended. The only reason I stay in the Mac ecosystem is that I have a obscenely insane business base that relies on Apple. I am the exception. I feel sorry for all of these
people who scrimp &amp; save to buy Apple &amp; then it degrades before it's time because of timebombing.

       Actually, I think I understand why you’re confused
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain this
      </p>
      <p>
       Your CPU CANNOT adjusts its own frequency or voltage depending on the SUPPLY OF POWER.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it does, is it changes its frequency and power depending on its NEEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it needs 2.0GHZ and 1.3v it’s going to ASK for this. If it doesn’t get it, the phone crashes.

       What Apple has done, is written code into iOS to allow the phone to calculate an “upper limit” of frequency and voltage that the CPU can request, depending on the current health of the battery.

       I decided to upgrade my iPhone a couple months ago. I know, stupid. After the upgrade battery life was more than halved. It's improved a little bit since, but.... it showed me that Apple isn't a company we can trust.

       Well, for what’s it’s worth, my MacBook Pro is over 2 years old now yet works perfectly, exactly how it was when I got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My partners iPad is over 3 years old. It’s definitely slower than when I bought it for her, however has no other problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now saying that they timebomb their own products... you really need to think if it actually makes sense to do something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a company purposely sabotage their own products to stop working. This won’t drive upgrades of Apple products.. it will mean ppl will think their products are complete shit that break really quickly, and they will consider using other products.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, throttling CPUs just enough to annoy someone, making them think their phone is getting old.. maybe time for an upgrade? Completely plausible, even highly likely.

       My old MacBook Pro ran all software just fine for seven years, but the internet got worse and worse with every update.
      </p>
      <p>
       I finally upgraded because they stopped releasing software updates for IE and my bank's website stopped loading.  I knew Chrome and others would stop soon, too, so I got a new laptop.  My old one also had the battery go bad and it was hard to find legacy parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know enough about programming to know what all these software updates ever actually do, but I believe my old laptop had a 32-bit OS.  Still seems like the internet should function reasonably well in legacy devices as long as your device and software are still compatible with each other.

       But Apple is slowing down hardware that should have at least 4-5 years of service at the very next iphone/ipad release.

       What I'm saying is, having the phone crash in a usable voltage, by not being able to adjust it correctly, is the bug.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my phone can run at a lower voltage without it crashing, it should work.

       This is what the update fixed. If the update fixed this flaw. Which devices are affected and when did this flaw start? Just answer the question.

       I have answered your question multiple times.

      <p>
       What they have introduced is software to monitor the health of your battery whilst monitoring all other aspects of your device, to dynamically adjust the frequency and voltage of your CPU to ensure that your phone doesn’t shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why changing the battery fixed the problem.

       Actually, I think I understand why you’re confused
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain this
      </p>
      <p>
       Your CPU CANNOT adjusts its own frequency or voltage depending on the SUPPLY OF POWER.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it does, is it changes its frequency and power depending on its NEEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it needs 2.0GHZ and 1.3v it’s going to ASK for this. If it doesn’t get it, the phone crashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Apple has done, is written code into iOS to allow the phone to calculate an “upper limit” of frequency and voltage that the CPU can request, depending on the current health of the battery.

       I mean there are many engineering reasons to make the phone sealed. (Vastly improved ability to waterproof, more efficient space utilization due to the removal of mounting hardware, etc). You can totally disagree with their decision and argue the benefits of a removable battery outweigh the cons, but its not like there aren't valid reasons the whole industry pretty much moved to sealed designs as soon as LiIo tech improved to a point where they could last ~2 years.

       Except it would really be called "enable the mode where your phone will randomly/sporadically shut down when it tries to draw too much power". Which is a laughably stupid mode... which is why it wouldn't be incorporated.
