       This set from the Robin Hood Benefit in May of this year (or last year now, technically) is really....weird. I've never seen it until last night. Never heard of Robin Hood Benefit but apparently the crowd is primarily rich, affluent people. The first thing Dave says is "thanks for having me at this illuminati bake sale or whatever it is I'm at right now." He mentions seeing a black person and that she owns BET. He tells a long, drawn out story about his encounter with a homeless man that is not a joke, no punch line, just a sad story of him treating a homeless man like shit, then feeling bad about it. It's really strange. He also says his wife is mad at him for something he said, but that that's what happens in a marriage, and then he NEVER explains what he said that made "his wife" mad, and he never gives any resolution to that story. Is the story an analogy for the media (or illuminati if you buy into that) being mad at Dave, and Dave trying to make amends? It honestly feels like it could be. It's that strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just wondering wtf is going on here? It's not funny at all. I don't get the sense Dave even means for it to be funny. My thought is that this crowd is very affluent and probably full of media moguls and rich types....and that Dave is subtly making fun of them to their faces. And if that's the case, it's gangster, lol. But watch this and give me your take on what's going on with this.  This is really weird and out of character for Dave.  But fits in perfectly with many of the conspiracy theories about him and the powers that be trying to control his voice, and therefore his influence on people.

       It was nothing but race baiting.  He talked about how rich white people intimate to him they call poor whites trash because he's rich and the only way for whites to treat blacks with respect is if they are rich.  Then he went on to claim white privilege was behind transgenderism.
       <br/>
       Go watch the show asshat. 
It was the unfunniest shit I've seen Chappelle do.  He looked like he was on some hard drugs too.

       What fucking show are YOU talking about?  Because it ain't the show I posted in the OP.  Literally nothing you said was what he said in the OP video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me guess, you just assumed I was talking about the new Netflix specials he released and you didn't watch the actual video in my OP, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't lie either.  Own up to it and admit you didn't watch the video in the OP before commenting out of your ass.

       It's to avoid a vote brigade and try to get honest votes out of people. Sometimes people see a comment with some downvotes and want to be on the "right side" of the popular opinion of the thread and down vote, rather than just voting based on the comment. Hiding the score for some time after a comment is a way mods try to create more unbiased voting. The people you're commenting on have no control over their score being hidden(unless they're mods). You're going tinfoil hat over a very normal thing in a lot of subreddits.

       Watch his recent special, he talks about dancing with a girl turns out to be transgender then he ends up "titty fucking her". I'm believing he just can't come to grips with the sacrifices he made for fame. Hollywood is run by manipulating and blackmailing naive people into being your puppet, simple as that.

       Why do you guys have your score hidden?  I want my score to be seen, personally.  So I'm just tryin to understand somebody that wants it to be a secret.  That makes no sense to me.

       A lot of people in the YT comments (yeah I know, consider the source) were speculating he is a celebrity imposter.  And I gotta say, i don't buy into all the kinda shit necessarily BUT I will say this...new Dave Chappelle does seem awfully different.  I mean shit, I'VE aged 10+ years since Chappelle's Show was on and I don't look like a gigantic mutant version of myself with a 10x deeper voice.  I'm not sayin' I buy into the clone or imposter theory.  Not at all.  But I will say "Dave" seems a helluva lot different these days doesn't he?  I mean, I'm just sayin'

       Said the very same groups that benefit from you not knowing. How the hell would you even know, all you know is what some media sources say. There are multiple celebrities that have talked about this and they specifically say it's not like Dolly the Sheep, and that they have facilities with bodies kept in tanks.
