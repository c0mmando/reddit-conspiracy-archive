    <div class="md"><p>War has always been the driving force for aeronautics as far as I know and drones are the way of the future. As far as commercial tech it seems to only be about greater efficiency every 8-10 years. As someone that works in R&amp;D Iâ€™m witness to the decline and I can only guess itâ€™s the lack of war. Itâ€™s still a Marvel either way and most of it is automated via computers so thereâ€™s that. Hardly a conspiracy though, maybe a sort of Mooreâ€™s law?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are right about war being a driving force for advancement in Aeronautics. The USA has been at war ever since ww2 though. Our Rockets are still using the same tech that the ones we launched with the computing power of a calculator used. Of course there has been incrementally small advancements, Aeronautics has been totally stagnant. </p>

<p>Imagine what the great minds of this world have created/thought up with the computing power available to them today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Absolutely. I am astounded we made such leaps and bounds so fast. Then it all came to a crashing halt once our computing technology got better and better SIGNIFICANTLY. </p>

<p>Please dont take this post in the wrong way, i am also gobsmacked at what our species has done but it just seems like as we were getting started it came to a real slow progress. </p>

<p>It may not be a conspiracy, sure.  But it seems strange to me on so many levels that we are obviously being left out of the loop regarding advancements being made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Computers have jumped leaps and bounds due to the ability to miniaturize components.</p>

<p>Aviation tech is about materials and energy efficiency. Uni-body designs, composite materials and stealth tech are some pretty amazing advances.</p>

<p>The problem is that the consumer market doesn&#39;t really require much of the advances recently seen in the military side. </p>

<p>But you also have to take into account private companies like Space-X. I don&#39;t think anyone would have guessed private companies would be able to go into space as all previous space programs required the budget of super powers.</p>

<p>Have they really? The current digital supercomputers work exactly the same way the first PC did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying that jet engines have jumped leaps and bounds because they are many times more powerful, fuel-efficient, and reliable than they were in WWII.</p>

<p>Miniaturization and efficiency should be viewed as furthering the technology. </p>

<p>But if you want to compare jet engines to cutting edge such as scramjets, ion, electromagnetic, solar sails, plasma engines . There are plenty of revolutionary propulsion systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry? Stagnant? The development of stealth aircraft would not have been possible without supercomputers. We&#39;ve had aircraft that can fly at several times the speed of sound, faster than a rifle bullet. We&#39;ve had vertical take-off and landing aircraft. We&#39;ve even had aircraft that can fly around the globe without stopping using nothing but solar power.</p>

<p>And we have aircraft that can take-off fly halfway round the world and land at an airport without a human being on-board or even remotely controlling it.</p>

<p>What makes you think &quot;aeronautic tech&quot; has stagnated?</p>

<p>You know those computers? The most powerful supercomputer on the planet works exactly the same way the first PC did. The only difference is the components have been miniaturised so that more of them fit into the box.</p>
