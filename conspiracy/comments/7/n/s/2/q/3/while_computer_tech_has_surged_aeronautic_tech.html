       War has always been the driving force for aeronautics as far as I know and drones are the way of the future. As far as commercial tech it seems to only be about greater efficiency every 8-10 years. As someone that works in R&amp;D Iâ€™m witness to the decline and I can only guess itâ€™s the lack of war. Itâ€™s still a Marvel either way and most of it is automated via computers so thereâ€™s that. Hardly a conspiracy though, maybe a sort of Mooreâ€™s law?

       Yes you are right about war being a driving force for advancement in Aeronautics. The USA has been at war ever since ww2 though. Our Rockets are still using the same tech that the ones we launched with the computing power of a calculator used. Of course there has been incrementally small advancements, Aeronautics has been totally stagnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine what the great minds of this world have created/thought up with the computing power available to them today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it always hidden from the public. We are kept in dark on this one. Thats what I think.

       Meh. WWII jet engines had thrust of 1600-1900 lbf. Todays fighter jet has 35,000-40,000. For comparison the V2 rocket had thrust of 56,000. Our jets are more comparable to their rockets. Largest modern jet, from a 777, has thrust rated at 81-115 and a record high of 127,000

       Man had their first powered flight in 1903. In 1969 they traveled all the way to the moon. I cant find a single thing minute about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took man thousands of years to master flight and then in such a short time comparably they visited our closest celestial body.

       Yes. Absolutely. I am astounded we made such leaps and bounds so fast. Then it all came to a crashing halt once our computing technology got better and better SIGNIFICANTLY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please dont take this post in the wrong way, i am also gobsmacked at what our species has done but it just seems like as we were getting started it came to a real slow progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may not be a conspiracy, sure.  But it seems strange to me on so many levels that we are obviously being left out of the loop regarding advancements being made.

       Read the comments. I've already said that I now realize it hasnt been as stagnant. Keep in mind the moon rockets were based off the v1 and v2 rockets the nazis used.

       Why doesn everyone on reddit talk like a pretentious douche if they dont agree. You can get a point across without that know-it-all attitude. Ive demonstrated in every comment that im completely open to all ideas and my original stance has changed with the comments that have come.

       Mostly because of how little thought you put into your initial post.
      </p>

       Think about how your post and your comments come across? You didn't do any research or think/reason through whether your initial assumption was correct. You just posted what popped into my your head.

       Congratulations. You've now internalized something they try to teach us in primary school.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be diplomas ready-to-print for moments like this.

       Computers have jumped leaps and bounds due to the ability to miniaturize components.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aviation tech is about materials and energy efficiency. Uni-body designs, composite materials and stealth tech are some pretty amazing advances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the consumer market doesn't really require much of the advances recently seen in the military side.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you also have to take into account private companies like Space-X. I don't think anyone would have guessed private companies would be able to go into space as all previous space programs required the budget of super powers.

       Have they really? The current digital supercomputers work exactly the same way the first PC did.

      <p>
       It's like saying that jet engines have jumped leaps and bounds because they are many times more powerful, fuel-efficient, and reliable than they were in WWII.

       Except one took up a whole floor and the other fits in your pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miniaturization and efficiency should be viewed as furthering the technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you want to compare jet engines to cutting edge such as scramjets, ion, electromagnetic, solar sails, plasma engines . There are plenty of revolutionary propulsion systems.

       For sure opened my eyes a little more than they were. Aeronautics hasn't stagnanted as much as I originally thought. Or Computers havent evolved leaps and bounds ahead of aeronautics.

       This isnt a University thesis, it is a spur of the moment post written on my phone on my lunch break.
      </p>
      <p>
       As ive said many times, my original statement is revised and i dont think aeronautics has stagnanted as much as computer tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im open to growing and learning. I just wanted to share a simple thought since i have been seeing all this UFO stuff going on.

       No need to be a dick. Id expect someone that habgs out on r/drugs and r/LSD to be a little less pretentious - wouldnt you?

       Sorry? Stagnant? The development of stealth aircraft would not have been possible without supercomputers. We've had aircraft that can fly at several times the speed of sound, faster than a rifle bullet. We've had vertical take-off and landing aircraft. We've even had aircraft that can fly around the globe without stopping using nothing but solar power.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we have aircraft that can take-off fly halfway round the world and land at an airport without a human being on-board or even remotely controlling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes you think "aeronautic tech" has stagnated?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know those computers? The most powerful supercomputer on the planet works exactly the same way the first PC did. The only difference is the components have been miniaturised so that more of them fit into the box.

       This post was just something on my mind. I'm not trying to have an argument because, i am no Engineer nor a Scientist or Pilot. I am just a bloke that is seeing a lot of 'ufo' shit and this crossed my mind.

       Thanks for your comment though, you made some great points as have a lot of people that commented.

       I still personally think we have plenty more advanced things we havent been informed about. Sure i could be wrong but it makes sense to me.
