       This is not the guy. You can get a vibe from watching someone and pick up on their energy. The old Dave was lighthearted and did a lot of voices and had much more of a southern accent. This replacement is sounds like Dave if he was 85 years old. No ones voice changes that much in the course of a few years. Maybe it's HGH, but is it not possible he was taken out for revealing the truth about the cabal? I posted earlier and was downvoted to hell, so I'm considering this a test since it's after hours and there may be less people to CTR. Thoughts?

       In my opinion, Dave has neither been cloned, replaced or reprogrammed. You say he was much more lighthearted before he quick his show? Yeah I wonder why, I wonder why after walking away from 50 mil, being called a crack head and general character assassination happening in the media daily for no fucking reason. Of course the guy is not as lighthearted anymore. Have you even seen the latest specials? He goes hard and deep on shit that he probably shouldn't be saying, and he hints that his career ended years ago. It just feels to me that Dave is now quitting while he is on top, but he will continue to do shows etc but he doesn't need to, and he doesn't give a fuck about what Hollywood tells him anymore because he's gone solo.

       Yeah. This stand-up was by far the most negative one on about Trump. I was disappointed, too, but this is absolutely the real Dave Chappelle.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's been lifting weights, and smoking for 20 years. He has a lower voice. However, if you watch how he pops his leg with the microphone in the clip OP posted, he still does that same move in his latest Netflix stand-up in Hollywood talking about the Metoo news.

       Absolutely incorrect. Not the same at all. Doesn't mean he is swapped, but it's a totally different approach.

       I thought it was trash as well but it's subjective obviously. He starts out the thing saying "I'm so good at jokes I can write them backwards," and then went on for 10 minutes bragging.. not funny to me

       He dropped some serious bombs in part 2 of his new Netflix special. Even provided anecdotal story -accompanied by the book,
       <em>
        Pimp
       </em>
       - about why he left CC, and concluded by saying along the lines of, "And that's how it all works." Imo, that goes against what the cabal would have him say.

       Controlled opposition is my guess. Their new "woke" comedian. I don't know, something seems totally off. His voice aged 50 years and the fact that he is smoking in the special is a convenient cover for why...

       He
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       seem a lot different from before. Very hard to deny that. There's a lot of factors that could play into it. Age, smoking and working out are the top three that come to mind. Age would lower the pitch of your voice. Same with smoking. Age could also affect your demeanor. Working out can drastically change the way you used to look, and could also, deepen your voice due to increase in testosterone (Fact check me on that one in case I'm talking out of my ass. I'm just guessing ;)). I'm just throwing out suggestions for his change. All that said, I don't know any more than you do if he is a clone or not.

       Why is "Are you upset he doesn't like Trump" the common 'go to' argument? I see it frequently come up in any subject being talked about. Someone takes a stance, then another person, with a dissenting position, will say something like "You just don't like it because blah blah insulted Trump." Even though Trump isn't mentioned at all, he's still brought up. This happened in another Dave Chapelle post where someone posted that they didn't like the special. Is it because it's easy dismiss any idea after that? Or has the association of negativity and Trump replaced every effect in the cause-and-effect relationship? I, truly, want to understand the rationale behind it.

       I didn't 'attack' you. I am suggesting you get over yourself. Dave is a COMEDIAN. It's comedy. Relax. It's an ACT. A show. The 'bragging' is part of the joke. Chill out ffs
