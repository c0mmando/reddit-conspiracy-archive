       I believe Trump was selected by the elites as a "catalyst" for social unrest between the American population, and also as a "trojan horse" for the fast growing and increasingly problematic conspiracy culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have effectively generated this cult-like following with him, and gave him good PR with conspiracy theorists. As a matter of fact, nearly all of the leading alternative media figures (Alex Jones, PJW) seemed to have flipped in unison in support of not only Trump as an "outsider", but conservative and republican ideals as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like a large scale psy op, pre-planned to "merge" conspiracy theorist culture with extreme conservative and pro-Trump/anti democrat values.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is to destroy the non partisan appeal that the conspiracy community has, which often draws in new lurkers and users.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       My insights and observations of the current administration have led me to this conclusion, and unfortunately it seems as if some parts of the truth movement have fallen prey to this dirty scripted trick.

       This is one of the most intellectually dishonest claims I've seen Trump apologists make.  Don't believe your own eyes or thoughts, he's actually on our side but needs to make everyone else believe he's not.

       Ok, I wasn't accusing you of being a Trump supporter, I'm just saying this is a claim I've seen, mostly from Trump supporters, who are willing to look past blatant deviations from his campaign promises, and things they would normally criticize with any other president, and suggest that things aren't how they seem. That there's a secret hidden agenda that defies logic and common sense, and Trump is actually fooling everyone else but "us", and he's actually on our side in a secret 007 kind of way.
      </p>
      <p>
       4D chess indicates to me that we shouldn't believe our own eyes and have blind faith in Trump.

       I have a question for you... If Trump assumed his actual role and duty (under the organic constitution), declared martial law, cleaned house, and returned us back to a Republic, what would you say?

       I personally am vehemently opposed to any president taking such authoritarian, draconian measures, even if I support them or voted for them. Suspending the Constitution and our Bill of Rights under any circumstance is absolutely a no go for me. I am deeply skeptical of the federal government no matter whose in charge of it.

       You'd fight tooth and nail with those trying to take down your captors... You may very well be fighting against someone who is trying to take the whole thing down... You hate this, because your captors have given you crumbs and conditioned you. Any rebellion is against your own good, because it's against the captors, ultimately. Think about it. I'm not saying this is the truth, or is actually happening, but... it could be, and you'd never even see it...

       It's funny you got downvoted, but it's such a good point. I'm still pretty unsure of Trump, but a year is not a long time as president at all. Most go in trying to get a single agenda item done in their first term, and hope it's a big enough deal to carry them through the next election.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is actually draining the swamp we'd start to see crumbs (and I think we are), but we wouldn't see any solid results until most of the bad actors are in custody or cornered in someway.

       exactly.  all i know really, is that certain types of designs will create certain types of responses, and watching stuff over a longer frame of time will show the manifestations of this.  other than that, the data in i'll assume is bad, and i'll also assume i've got stuff completely upside down and backwards.

       trump's a setup designed to ride an outrage train that will facilitate bad acts under the guise of righteousness.  i reckon it's a much deeper rabbithole than people are psychologically capable of handling.  matrix-y shit.  end of the day we're in a simulation and there are AIs that can completely control our perception and, for many people, emotional response.

       You’re probably right, but I think it’s more complicated than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       First (I’m sure I’ll gsf flak for this) you’re operating under the assumption that
       <em>
        all secret societies are bad
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        everything the NWO does is bad
       </em>
       but I don’t necessarily think that’s the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think their are different factions and I think we are witnessing a civil war within the elite, else Saudi Billionaires wouldn’t be getting arrested and Canadian CEOs wouldn’t be getting iced at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionist’s are bad news, and that’s who I think Trump works for, but we honestly can’t be sure. He’s acting like a real dictator, albeit a fat, stupid one. He’s not listening to anyone. I’ve been watching his moves, closely. I really think, for the first time in my lifetime, that we’re dealing with a real man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that doesn’t mean it’s a good thing. If anything, it’s
       <em>
        more dangerous
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       scripted. We’ve gone off reservation. And maybe the media has completely pulled a fast one on all of the right wingers and maybe I’m just confused, but that Trump guy’s days are numbered.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Rothschilds are coming out of the den of snakes’ pit of hell they live in to confront Trump, and stick their reptile necks out in public, you know something is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory, some kind of elite turf war going on and Trump’s the muscle guy for a new group.

       I've entertained the idea that we're witnessing an epic battle between two factions of "secret societies" or men behind the curtain. Trump didn't just show up as an outsider and get elected by the sheer will of the people. Someone put him there. They, whoever they are, outsmarted and outspent the usual "they" that puts presidents in,and they're pissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not saying it's a good thing. It's just a random observation. I personally think Trump is Jesuit controlled. He went to a Jesuit college after all, Fordham University.

      <p>
       Hey, farfetched, but this is a conspiracy sub after all.

       I think we traded the group that wanted to keep a lid on things for the group that wants to be the heroes and push humanity farther into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, with Obama/Clinton’s group we were likely going to be killed gulag style. With Trump’s group, they want us alive so we can contribute to a amoral Nazi empire.

       Without a villain, you can’t have a hero. They need bigger and bigger heroes, until America is finally destroyed.

       I believe this has merit, and I think a lot of people suspected a similar Trojan Horse with this election.  The lunacy of it all, and the over-the-top behavior (by both candidates) was, as stated "WWE-like."
      </p>
      <p>
       By all accounts, this would also mean that the elite hung out Hillary to dry, as I truly do think she believed she had been selected by the hidden hand.  It would explain her shell-shock post-election, but 50%+ of the country was shocked as well (good or bad).

       I think you are partially right, but only in a very broad strokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're witnessing here is the war between the king (or Kings) and the usuper with his cohorts. Both side want absolute power and control, but comes from different grounds. The Kings, who while gradually loosing their grip on the serfs, still holds the church, the army and the land. Because the Kings still holds these things, the usuper has to breaking them one by one, while getting the serfs to follow and setting them up to die for him. So the fight ensured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Trump (as the usurper) are trying to took down the pillars of power one by one and took over, while the Kings (the shadow govt) are trying to pull his army off and took him down. So far, Trump has took down the church (the media) and the Kings are furious. So they have to employ their army (the Intel agency) to take him down. Which is why we see shit like this today since no side has full control yet.

       Nobody thinks Trump was a "populist outsider" except for the most deluded of his supporters. He's a billionaire real estate mogul who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

       Yes, he is. Trump was a donor to the Clintons for many years. He is on record praising both Hillary and Bill, and said Bill was an excellent President. He went from "Lock her up" to saying that she had suffered enough over the course of a week after winning the election. He filled his cabinets with other millionaires and billionaires

       I agree with most of what op says but I think Hillary was selected but trump was co-opted after a humiliating defeat for most of tptb. Trump is a text book narcissistic asshole, easy to control, all you gotta do is massage his ego a little or play chicken or dare him to do stuff, $ will work good too ofcourse, he's putty in multiple tptb factions hands. Perhaps both were selected, seems to me cock bros pick one side Rothschild's pick the other but if these guys loose they don't throw in the towel, they just salvage and readjust. Now trumps just being pimped out to who ever wants a turn , at least he's entertaining I suppose.

       Couple clarifying questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you mean by "conspiracy community";  This sub, other sites like GLP, underground networks, or mostly independents connecting in some other way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you demonstrate when or how said community, or communities, had a primarily non-partisan appeal in the past?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure that any greater CT community has ever been non-partisan: every single one has been segregated by its own beliefs based on my experience of being in the CT game for decades.

       Trump is neither a populist nor am outsider. He's a run of the mill pro-corperation anti-worker politician who's been in the swamp for as long as the Clinton's.

       I think we traded the group that wanted to keep a lid on things for the group that wants to be the heroes and push humanity farther into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, with Obama/Clinton’s group we were likely going to be killed gulag style. With Trump’s group, they want us alive so we can contribute to a amoral Nazi empire.
