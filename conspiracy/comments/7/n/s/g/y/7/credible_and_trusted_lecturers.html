    <div class="md"><p>I love Corey Goodes stuff, even if it&#39;s lies it&#39;s an amazing story that is well worth listening to! I became a bit convinced by him just because he appears to be telling the truth with regard to his body language etc, and he also predicted a general direction of the way things would go geopolitically that was somewhat borne out. A lot of people say he&#39;s nonsense but in some ways the effort put into people dismissing him while not actually providing any evidence that he&#39;s a liar indicates he perhaps has some people worried.  The things he says are astonishing but at the same time he recalls all kinds of extremely little irrelevant details and appears to hold up well to all manner of questioning. So I guess we will see-I&#39;m skeptical but it&#39;s such a great story that it&#39;s not wasting my time to listen to it either way 😊</p>

    <div class="md"><p>William Cooper lays an unparalleled foundation of knowledge with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iCLykzJ0d8&amp;amp;list=PL11E33A6AEEB2674F">Mystery Babylon</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GChemEEDRNM&amp;amp;list=PL5llvwa-5byTu0wrp9AU_SuC6hK4yKr66">II</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5-JMTDYACI&amp;amp;list=PL5llvwa-5byThdyn7tKMHaqt9IHoMLl5j">III</a> series.</p>

<p>Personally and I have listened to everyone from Jones to Rense, Maxwell to Wilcock, Hancock to Tsarion and a thousand in between. I&#39;ve spent money on films, books, subscriptions - even forum access... I haven&#39;t seen it all, but I&#39;ve seen a lot...</p>

<p>After Cooper&#39;s death, Alex Jones and a cadre of associated people (some at the &quot;business&quot; level, some personal, some through marriage and many through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_National_Policy">Council for National Policy</a> - which through no more than 2 steps of separation, encompasses almost EVERY conspiracy researcher there is. <strong>Yes people, I&#39;m saying 95% of conspiracy researchers are shills.</strong></p>

<p>After Cooper&#39;s death and the flood in of new faces and (indeed) business models we became apathetic with doing our OWN research and relied on others to do it for us (myself included). </p>

<p>One day I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dayglow76/videos">Josh Reeves</a> older shows on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TGRFP/videos">fan page</a> and it just clicked. It was on purpose. We are offered the gamut!</p>

<p>The loud mouth snake oil sales man, the heretics, the hippies, the scientists, the far right, the far left, the &quot;saviour&quot; and his dragon army - fucking EVERYTHING. <strong>They throw everything at us SO THAT SOMETHING STICKS!</strong></p>

<p>So now, I listen to everything - and if I hear things I think are true, I absorb them and move on.</p>

<p>The people I still have some shreds of respect for (as they have not outed themselves in one manner or another and have purpose and add VALUE) are: Bill Cooper, Josh Reeves, Graham Hancock, Manly Palmer Hall (he was not a mason IN LIFE, it was given to him posthumously and was not his choice. They basically branded his corpse with their logo and people think he was evil...), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHighersideChats/videos">Greg Carlwood of Higherside Chats</a>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYYA_wC8eYY">The episode with Josh Reeves</a> is awesome).</p>

<p>He&#39;s not <em>really</em> a conspiracy researcher but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JMEMantzel">this guy</a> lives on an island with him family and his videos are educational and lift me up on shitty days.</p>

<p>Hope you find something you like!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>before you jump into the mystery babylon and even graham hancock. might i suggest starting recently then working backwards. this gives you context as to why you would even listen to these lecturers in the first place. </p>

<p>professor danny sheehan of the romero institute has a &quot;rulers of the realm&quot; lecture series on youtube. it&#39;s an absolutely must watch and it&#39;ll make your journey into william cooper and graham hancock much more worth while. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>good, then you&#39;re primed for the Sheehan Rulers of the realm lectures, all on youtube btw. It&#39;s very detailed oriented, you will learn history better, and will take you from the HW Bush/Clinton era all the way to 1896 William Mckinley and even 1861 Civil War. </p>
