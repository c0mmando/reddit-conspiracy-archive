       So I've recently been watching Alex Jones, his videos on Bilderberg, and the "shadow government." What really scares me is the information about the georgia guidestones and the elite's plan to reduce the world population down to 500 million. As a 19 year old, this makes me feel depressed and hopeless. How did you guys cope when you first learned about this stuff? It's honestly some of the scariest shit I've ever seen because I believe it to be real. What are your thoughts, how did you deal with uncovering the truth? Advice wpuld help.

       The guidestones are a bit of a mystery. Its scary that those people have the power to do what they want. I tend to just not think about it when it becomes too much to think about.

       Man I learnt about this in 2007, more than a decade ago now. I was 15. Let me tell you this;
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fantastic to be aware of the world but please, for your own sanity, don't go into a downward spiral trying to figure it all out. Take it for what it is and ENJOY your youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I turned to Pot and would smoke myself into a mindless oblivion, watching conspiracy docos at every chance i got, reading forums as much as i could, then 2012 came and i got the fuck over it and just started actually LIVING.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit will eat you up, IF YOU LET IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, my young friend, take everything you see and read with a grain of salt. Who the fuck knows where the next 10 years will take us. I've witnessed 9/11 through to a Reality TV stat becoming POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow we are all still here though. Don't ignore your real passions and Hobbies and get overcome with conspiracy. Live while youre young and healthy.

       Seriously.  When shit didn't hit the fan in 2012 it was a bit of a reality check.  Because the conspiracy community

       You've gotta just live life and enjoy as much as you can, OP. Don't let it consume you. Whenever I'm afraid or anxious, I always repeat to myself what my grandma has always told me: 'Focus on the task in front of you, and create one if you don't have one.' The task could be anything at all, from washing the dishes to just putting on your shoes and going for a walk or a run while listening to some music... It really helps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck, OP ♡

       Thank you!!! I truly believe all this too. We have the power to create our own reality. Our thoughts and words hold great power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I know this, I'm guilty of not doing it (or doing it incorrectly). I always joke around (in real life and on the internet) about all the laundry I do and how it is never-ending. Well, guess what? It stays never-ending because I'm using the wrong words and thoughts! (I just figured this out today.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So now I have to change my words and thoughts and say, "All my laundry is done!" I need to speak it into existence!

       Yes, I have always been a positive person. Now, that doesn't mean that my life is perfect. It is not. Nobody's life is perfect. But I do always tend to look at the bright side.

       I'd recommend finding a really well rounder survivalist guide. I decided on the US army survival manual. I've got an EMT cert and the big ass book that came with the class so I didn't look too hard.

       Just a side note for anyone reading this. Buy books! It's obvious, but we take our connection to knowledge for granted. When the lights go out you will realize how dumb most of us really are. Buy books.

       Be wary of people like Alex Jones. Understand that
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of the conspiracy content out there is purposefully designed to make you scared, angry, depressed, ungrounded, and hopeless. Thats how they want you to feel. Check out James Corbett, Media Monarchy, or the Higherside Chats for some truth talk without the fear mongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cope by spending time with my loved ones and working on my life's goals and hobbies- things that make the world
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       , not scarier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, spend time in nature. Frequently.
       <em>
        Without
       </em>
       electronic distrations.

       I second this very good advice. You will come to see Alex Jones as part truth, part insanity and part male enhancement turbulent juice.

       Corbett kept me me on the rails in the beginning and I owe that bald bastard soooo much.

       Lots of conspiracy stuff is meant to rile people up; don't buy into it. Instead of getting bummed, you could feel honored to want to know truth, and could possibly help our World. As a young person, you could be one of the ones to work toward change!

       379 A.D. 
Vicious writing by St. John Chrysostom and St. Ambrose in Milan who said: "The Jews are the most worthless of all men. They are lecherous, greedy, rapacious. They are perfidious murderers of Christ. They worship the Devil. Their religion is a sickness. The Jews are the odious assassins of Christ and for killing God there is no expiation possible, no indulgence or pardon. Christians may never cease vengeance, and the Jew must live in servitude forever. God always hated the Jews. It is essential that all Christians hate them." He was called the Bishop with the Golden Tongue. St. Ambrose, Bishop of the Church offered to burn the synagogue himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       395 A.D. 
St. Gregory of Nyssa in sermons and writings characterized Jews as assassins of the Prophets, companions of the Devil, a race of vipers, a Sanhedrin of Demons, enemies of all that is beautiful, hogs and goats in their lewd grossness.

       Most authorities, however, agree on the following account. The whole of Egypt was once plagued by a wasting disease which caused bodily disfigurement. So pharaoh Bocchorisnote went to the oracle of Hammonnote to ask for a cure, and was told to purify his kingdom by expelling the victims to other lands, as they lay under a divine curse. Thus a multitude of sufferers was rounded up, herded together, and abandoned in the wilderness. Here the exiles tearfully resigned themselves to their fate. But one of them, who was called Moses, urged his companions not to wait passively for help from god or man, for both had deserted them: they should trust to their own initiative and to whatever guidance first helped them to extricate themselves from their present plight. They agreed, and started off at random into the unknown. But exhaustion set in, chiefly through lack of water, and the level plain was already strewn with the bodies of those who had collapsed and were at their last gasp when a herd of wild asses left their pasture and made for the spade of a wooded crag. Moses followed them and was able to bring to light a number of abundant channels of water whose presence he had deduced from a grassy patch of ground. This relieved their thirst. They traveled on for six days without a break, and on the seventh they expelled the previous inhabitants of Canaan, took over their lands and in them built a holy city and temple.

       No... we really don't have the ability to make food without soil.  Sorry.  I've been doing aquaponics as a hobby for six years.  It requires a lot of energy.  It requires a lot of water.  There is a large portion of the typical diet (things like grains) that you simply cannot grow hydroponically.  Structures to support soil-less growing are expensive --
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can certainly find examples of niche environments where one or two of those factors can be minimized, but it's almost always at the expense of others.  Unfortunately those are the kinds of "breakthroughs" that make it into tech blogs and onto
       <a href="/r/futurology">
        /r/futurology
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Take aeroponics as an example.  Okay, no soil.  But you've increased your water consumption by, what, ten times?  And you've added energy and equipment costs.  That all adds up.  It's not a silver bullet.

       Have to say this first as its currently the top comment: Over population is not a myth. Substantial efforts to support A certain population are easily done. It just needs done on a large scale and in an area that can support the growth.

      <p>
       That being said, more than half of the ground grown food in this country, The U.S. ... I want to say America but it's not ... is thrown out because it's appearance is unpalatable to be sold at market.

      <p>
       Food from the Oceans is being depleted at levels that are only recoverable provided we leave anything left
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not globalist to separate your food supply from your native habitat. To go a step further, to also ensure that the natural habitat never suffers from your ability to provide a substantial food supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       How Did I cope? Before I started decision making of my own I sought out those much older than me and provoked conversation that they experienced themselves. The hand that feeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask the questions to answers you feel need questions asked for. How did so and such come to this conclusion; where was it that X had the balls to resist Z, and where did funding for both come from, I mean was B really playing both sides?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all being played. It is all a game. And trust me not one of us are actually players.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accept that you are able to carve out your own niche and let no one infringe upon that niche and you'll be gold. Stay out of the city. Own more than 2 acres. Grow/raise your own food. If you don't have to be electrically tied to the city don't be; solar panelling is much cheaper now. Find a valley. Bore a well for water. 2 if you can, but use one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignore the guidestones. Visit the mounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't watch television. If you do, learn from it; not be entertained by it.

       Fall in love, not in line.

       Alex Jones is not who you think he is. He is in on it. This detailed site proves he is former "comedian" Bill Hicks. See for yourself. Start meditating everyday. That's the only way to break free from the grip they have you in. notice how everyone is miserable? There's a way out. Self-actualization, transcendence, and meditation.

       The world has been ending for thousands of years, my guy. Get out there and see it. Every inch you can. If you have a chance to see something new, make it happen. Go to national forests, parks and monuments. See real mountains, bears in broad day, bison, eagles, rivers, streams, oceans and the like. I saw a guy catch a massive sting ray on a beach in Florida once. I saw the Milky Way in Death Valley, flagstaff, Zion and at the Grand Canyon. I’ve watched a fish get caught, cooked and eaten in the span of 15 minutes.

       There’s so much beauty out there that the ugly will never overshadow it. They’ll lose in the end, but only when we all realize each of of us combined can over take their wealth. Fuck them. Live.

       <strong>
        best
       </strong>
       solution to anxiety, depression, freaking-out-due-to-current-affairs is to unplug, go outside and explore.  The world is a beautiful and magical place.

      <p>
       The 2nd best solution is to focus on your microcosm:  foster friendships and family (if possible).  Create your own little village.

       There is no puzzle for you to solve. You are not expected to do anyone's part but your own part. If you are a good person keep being a good person. There are more good people that bad people but the bad people are more organized. You should not go out looking to find ways of binding the good people together, but just make sure you don't fall for the tricks - the reasons for keeping the good people apart.

       Know that at the bottom of the rabbit hole there is freedom. No matter what conspiracies you will find, dig deeper and you will find freedom. The greatest conspiracy is that you are distracted externally, while true freedom, peace and joy are to be met when looking within and dissolving your fears, pain and suffering.

       I agree with the majority. Don't watch Alex Jones, he's just too crazy. 
Also, drinking/smoking are not the answer, as they will only make things harder in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion the best thing to do is just give your mind a break from the stress frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       And only continue "waking up" slowly, if you try to learn too much too fast you could quite literally go insane. So just take your time, if you're getting too scared/stressed/worried about things, just take a break for a couple days, even a couple weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's always TONS of other people working/thinking on the worlds issues. We're always moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I'd also suggest checking out Alan Watts.
Just search "Alan Watts" on youtube and pick an video that seems interesting. I listen to him talk. I listen to his talks almost every night while I try to sleep.

       Everything in life is a teacher. In your walk, you’ll learn a lot of terrible things, some of which may or may not even be true, but the world has gotten very dark. However, it will inspire you if you let it, it will grip you, push you, make you feel fulfilled, and enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are spiritual beings and the universe is so much cooler and more complex than they tell you in high school.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice; seek balance. Learn what you can but don’t forget to be a human being. Be kind and lift your fellow man up. We are all in this together whether we like it or not.

       Don't be.  Nothing has changed the whole time and you're not a target of any kind.

       They want people asleep to achieve their goals.  Now is the time when people need to be more confident in standing up and speaking their minds.

      <p>
       The media is meant to speak for you, don't let them.  Be your own voice and advocate for your own brand of change.

       I don't advise advocating for violence as they are geared up to combat exactly that and paint people who want immediate and sudden change as terrorists or whatever else.

       Realising how the world works can be depressing, especially after a while when theories are often conflicting and unproven. But with your new knowledge of how the banking system and social media are designed to enslave you in a world of debt envy and depression, you can break free and live an honest life. Don't be scared many things are out of your control, your own happiness and that of your loved ones is in your hands.

       Just do the things you CAN do.

      <p>
       Try to eat organic and research what bottled water isn't fluoridated.

      <p>
       And try to stay away from food packaged in plastic (BPA).

       Try to spread the word too. Slowly or ppl will think you are a nut case because the MSM has conditioned the population to react that way to the TRUTH.

       This is all meant to happen. Probably gonna get a lot of shit for this but whatever. Book of revelation prophecises about signs of end times, and there are a lot of connections between what is written and what is happening right now. This book was for me the gateway for me believing in the existence of god. If you ever feel lost and need guidance to get on your feet you can refer to scripture, I'd recommend not  starting from the beginning because genesis and exodus could be kinda boring. Ecclesiates gives a way more fun impression :-)

       Realize that, yes the world we live in is not the one taught to us in school, but that still the vast majority of conspiracy theories are likely wrong, partially wrong or just good ol' dis-information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Alex Jones is not the #1 source out there, infowars needs to post new content on a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       regular basis, they are a business making money, simple as that. He probably started with a good heart, wanting to warn the world of certain things. But once you run out of the topics you want to speak about, you just create new ones. Keep the content rolling or ad revenue and vitamin sales drop. Watch enough of these big name conspiracy guys and you'll see them contradict themselves over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not very old but I've lived through 20 or so world ending conspiracies so far, not counting the obviously bogus ones even.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Georgia Guidestones may be done by a real group of people who really do want to reduce the population, but who's to say that those people aren't anything more than a handful of people with no power of any kind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Find videos from honest researches you show their research and don't just give big hotel ballroom speeches with slides as their evidence. The Sandy Hook and 9/11 researches are a good example, they use science and facts whenever possible to back them up (well the good ones do). They may not have proved anything yet, but they are approaching the subject as actual researches, not fear propagandists. These are the people you should watch, people who are school teachers and brick layers, or whatever, they make a living and this is their passion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If conspiracy theories are your source of income, you'll find some even where there are none.

       Alex Jones is a showman. His act is making you feel scared and helpless. Some of what he says may be true, but most of it is hysterical baloney. Try reading some of the stuff that debunks him; get a bit of balance.

       Most conspiracy theories are bullshit, just focus on the shit you need to endure in your daily life and use the conspiracy angle to better understand why that has become so.

       Look at the world rationally. You have no real reason to be afraid. A lot of Alex Jones' stuff is just fear mongering. It is fun to read about this stuff and watch vids and stuff, but take it with a big grain of salt. Not all of this stuff is real.

       I got physically ill the first time I watched Loose Change. The way to cope is to realize that all you can do is focus on playing the game (work/school/etc) to acquire resources and power, and hopefully get yourself to a point where you can shape the world around you. Getting depressed and worrying about this shit you can't control doesn't help. Making more money, and affecting the lives of the people around you in a positive way does.

       I went deep into the rabbit hole and I was worried very much like you. It took a while, but eventually I adopted the Buddhist approach which is that everything is impermanent and your only source of suffering is how you perceive the world. So basically, I worry about my own little sphere and I stopped worrying about what these lizard fucks are doing with whatever arbitrary laws and institutions that they want to put in place. Go with the flow. The only thing you can change is yourself.

       Part of being a good conspiracy theorist is to know that EVERYTHING is a lie.  Don't be a victim to onesided thinking.  Sure the mainstream is lying to you, but the other side lies just as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Balance the two and come to your own conclusion.  Remember, everyone has an agenda.  That agenda is usually about making money.  Alex Jones is a multi-millionaire and has a staff he needs to pay every month.  Therefore he has every motive to instill fear and doubt in people.  Simply, the more controversial he is, the more revenues he generates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe conspiracies exist.  I believe there are plenty of bad actors in this world.  But I also believe that good can overcome bad as long as people stay vigilant.  This is why we all need to hear different theories or alternative explanations with an open mind.  Staying vigilant means learning about all explanations of reality and making an informed decision based on facts, not on people's credibility.

       When I first wake up, I usually grab a coffee. 😁 
Although maybe spark a doobie to calm your nerves too, that should sort you out!
      </p>
      <p>
       On a serious note though, once you start opening up your eyes to the shit going on in this world, things will never look the same. Just live your life as best you can. If you ever have a chance to make a real, POSITIVE change in this world, do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, there is propaganda everywhere. Question everything, think critically. Try not to let your emotions control you - the easiest way for people to control others is through their emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Alex jones should be taken with a HUGE dose of skepticism. I personally avoid giving him any of my attention.

       One advice I can give you is don't be scared.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not supposed to act against things you can't control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just live a happy life with positive feelings, and you will raise people awareness around you too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a book I've read called "
       <a href="https://ufile.io/lsvhv">
        Awaken the Minds
       </a>
       " you might want to read too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for Alex Jones, if he's half-truth then means he's also half-lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be warry of half-truths because they are also lies.
