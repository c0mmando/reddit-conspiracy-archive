    <div class="md"><p>Since I only have a <em>basic</em> grasp of the Bible thus far, that is a lot to consider. Quite interesting and very conceivable since both Hebrews and Christians dis-like Flavius.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit behind... not knowing how the Dead Sea Scrolls and all of the other ancient writings stack up against these claims. </p>

<p>Then the other proponents of the authors work at the end are into Sun/Earth worship, or just being good human beings to one another and evolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am definitely going to look into this book more. I think the points he made throughout the doc pass the smell test. Like yourself I don&#39;t have a lot of bible history knowledge, which is probably a good thing considering this information. I do know a little about Jesus&#39;s missing 30 years, which would really line up pretty well with what they said about back dating trickery. It is really saddening to think we have only moved forward with technology while our collective consciousness has been in chains. Humanity is gullible as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess my life lived as agnostic but still spiritual, is unsettled on finding G_D bottled up or trapped in a building of money grubbers, cheaters and kid diddlers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not inclined to Idol worship nor atheism so for me, that does leave Creation. </p>

<p>I was given a book &quot;The Shack* by William P. Young a number of years ago which I found moving in its simplicity. I passed it around to a number of people until it didn&#39;t come back. The guy did his time in prison, a Hells Angels Brat - he was sincere about his conversion so who was I to question!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve argued with Pastors that couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t explain certain <em>worship rules</em> the big ones that stick out for me are baptism and communion. That a few drops of water or tears couldn&#39;t constitute baptism in a desert is just silly to my way of thinking. Communion in an unworthy manner...something about skin color and the anger my dad had about his Mormon roots. </p>

<p>Marriage and divorce was probably the toughest one for me. Brand new to all of this and dipping my toe in, it made my husband very happy so I went along always questioning things. Till it all crashed. I actually had a Pastor yelling at me that divorce was a deadly sin, one of the worst when I wasn&#39;t the one that cheated. Crazy enough he became entangled with a woman who&#39;s husband was being held hostage in Iran. I only just learned of this, (oddly in starting back over rather where I began) and I&#39;ve wondered the last few weeks... who is there to comfort his wife thru the trauma and shame after her long years of love and devotion to him. </p>

<p>Is it enough just to be a good person? My quest pushes me forward...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your openness RS. I can relate about the marriage thing, it is not easy. Throw a little one into the mix and you learn the true meaning of sacrifice, endurance and love.</p>

<p>I see you here all the time, I had you pinned for a black male, not sure now why, perhaps I was confused with another user as I don&#39;t pay much attention to usernames and this place is usually quite impersonal. Matters not. I do very much appreciate the few characters here with whom I have spoken to personally.  MKultraserialkillers is one such user. Many of the rest are just small blips.</p>

<p>I read one of Sonny Barger&#39;s books a long time ago. Not much spirituality as a recall. </p>

<p>I believe in a higher power in the sense of a power greater than myself. The word that best describes this to me is compassion. Buddhists teach helping others is the best way to help ones self. Volunteering gave me peace. As I get older I am not a part of my community as much as I used to be. Moving away from Vermont did not help much, people down here in the flatlands are harder to relate to for me. Different priorities.</p>

<p>I got side tracked with some other stuff this morning but intend to look into this whole Flavian/dead sea scrolls thing a lot more. I will be sure to send you anything I think is worth looking at. My reddit history is scrubbed every 24 hours for privacy reasons so don&#39;t wonder when this disappears tom.</p>

<p>I thinks being a good person and helping those in need as they cross your path is enough.</p>

<p>I stayed married just shy of twenty years. Raised our kids, his kid and I had custody of his former ex wifes second child for an entire year - my step son the oldest was in danger and I was damned tired of prancing around his first Princess wife and his pacifist BS. He and I are still best friends.</p>

<p>Worst I&#39;ve ever been treated was by people that used their religion to hide behind or to advance their community positions. Lots of Mormon stuff and yes, they vet and discriminate. </p>

<p>Like yourself, I try not to read into &quot;peoples&quot; on line personas. I was raised in a beautiful mess of seven kids and my father was just a really honest man. My mom - not so much.</p>

Hi.
All gods and beliefs were created out of male minds only! making them all not true and yet billions follow the lie.
How do you un - mind form a human after male cultural mind forming at birth? you can&#39;t, no matter how much logic one uses. The human species is a male created mind leaving woman with only male gods and beliefs ... facts and not gender bias like the entire male cultural created life is. I am sure you fell for one of the 5200 man created gods or beliefs making your mind no better.</p>

Hi.
I don&#39;t have to see anything to know all the foolishness was male created and it makes all man god stories and the characters in his story man lies. who do you think was running around killing and forcing humans after birth or by fear to follow a man god?  Some want to take apart a man god story one story at a time but to save time just say they are nothing more than males pushing male testosterone of war and intolerance. No you did nothing wrong and I am just saying why go in depth about male foolishness of a child mind. A mind takes years to be mind formed and a few words will do nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only male gods? What about the Phoenicians? They were are highly developed society predating Judaism by quite a ways that worshiped a female god. There society also held women in very high regard, many women were in prominent leadership positions. What about shamanism around the world in tribal environments? Where the shaman, very often female, is the conduit to the spirit realm?
While I do agree that most modern monotheistic religions were created by men to shift the paradigm of power away from women, it is an overstatement to say All religions throughout time have been invented by men with only male gods</p>

Hi.
Name these woman gods craeted out of the minds of woman that millions follow.
Again you refer back to when males made woman gods out of male minds.... Do you believe woman had woman only armies or woman setting around a fire with males and deciding what god the two genders should create?  9 months and taking care of the 9 month new human was a huge impediment. Like Said name them and not the ones males created out of the weak violent male mind? Your mind is his mind and you had no idea how it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Astarte was the Main Goddess of those peoples. There are many more examples. though in modern history, we only see the major monotheistic religions getting attention that is only for the last 4,000 years or so, we had at least another 4,000 year before the take over of modern religion and it was a very female dominated spirituality. This is one of the reasons the new religions had to be enforced by the sword. Millions of people around the world didn&#39;t like the new Gods and they rebelled. There are tons of resources available if this is a topic you are really interested in. PM me if that is the case</p>

Hi ....again you show up with woman that were created out of a male mind... you didn&#39;t answer the questions. If you really believe that your mind is deeper than I thought but not your fault. My friend I know of what I say and a billions names of man created cultures with dates and logic will chance no human&#39;s mind formed by male cultural mind forming.

Hi.
All male out of a male&#39;s minds ... I didn&#39;t have a say as to how or why man was the creator of the species cultural life but it was probably an evolutionary need. It happened that way and not saying it was the male gender&#39;s premeditated doing or the males fault but it certainly a mess man made while pushing his story forward. Would you want to be a woman in early man&#39;s story. In the future no gods will be needed and yes, both can and will do just as good a job on forming cultural life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda depends how early you want to go 
Take it with a grain of salt, even though your probably a robot </p>

<p>for last 4,000 Years or so, life has been pretty dang tough for women. But there was period in there, before the last 4,000ish Years where women held a very different status in the community. It’s wasnt great and I get your point, but if your really interested in where religion made a shift towards male dominated monotheism in the West that is where you would want to start </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you say is not really accurate outside the monotheist semitic religions. In Greco-Roman religion female gods were extremely important and central, as well as in other European religions. It would seem that women deities were also prominent in Japanese, Middle Eastern, and other cultures, but I am not knowledgeable of these cultures.</p>

Hi.
No you don&#39;t because you don&#39;t know or care and so stop being phony, another trait of males. you missed my point by this condescending comment of yours formed from the minds of the stronger others proves it. Your mind of others in his story makes your mind his mind.</p>

Hi.
So lets see you are the one who decides if a human is sane or not! another male ploy is to run to a more defensive position when things are going bad . Do you know the site you are on and you are saying some ones mind is not right. Cowards run from truth... run run fast to your man stories. You are talking in depth about a man god that says you believe the man story and so whose mind doesn&#39;t work OK?
These are the males you accept that comment to me...Lol You&#39;re insane and cant even form a coherent sentence. Of course men did everything cuz men are smarter stronger etc due to evolution. Women dont have the capacity to be philosophers, thinkers, inventors. Of course there are outliers, but on average thats just how it is biologically. No matriarchal societies have existed due to his reason.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess my life lived as agnostic but still spiritual, is unsettled on finding G_D bottled up or trapped in a building of money grubbers, cheaters and kid diddlers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not inclined to Idol worship nor atheism so for me, that does leave Creation. </p>

<p>I was given a book &quot;The Shack* by William P. Young a number of years ago which I found moving in its simplicity. I passed it around to a number of people until it didn&#39;t come back. The guy did his time in prison, a Hells Angels Brat - he was sincere about his conversion so who was I to question!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve argued with Pastors that couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t explain certain <em>worship rules</em> the big ones that stick out for me are baptism and communion. That a few drops of water or tears couldn&#39;t constitute baptism in a desert is just silly to my way of thinking. Communion in an unworthy manner...something about skin color and the anger my dad had about his Mormon roots. </p>

<p>Marriage and divorce was probably the toughest one for me. Brand new to all of this and dipping my toe in, it made my husband very happy so I went along always questioning things. Till it all crashed. I actually had a Pastor yelling at me that divorce was a deadly sin, one of the worst when I wasn&#39;t the one that cheated. Crazy enough he became entangled with a woman who&#39;s husband was being held hostage in Iran. I only just learned of this, (oddly in starting back over rather where I began) and I&#39;ve wondered the last few weeks... who is there to comfort his wife thru the trauma and shame after her long years of love and devotion to him. </p>

<p>Is it enough just to be a good person? My quest pushes me forward...</p>
