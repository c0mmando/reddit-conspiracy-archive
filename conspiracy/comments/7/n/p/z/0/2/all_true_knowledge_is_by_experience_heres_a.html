<p>Why not take the same journey I took to see how I went about finding something strange. Maybe, it wont be strange to you, if you walk through the same process. Hopefully, you&#39;ll provide an explanation after the same journey. </p>

<p>ALSO: philosophically, there is categorically knowledge by experience, knowledge by reference, and then knowledge by structure. </p>

<p>Knowledge by experience: you sensually process something and associated events with concepts to understand such in a linguistic accommodation .</p>

<p>knowledge by reference: you conceptually reference something and associate it to your current conceptual associations, as a form of linguistic accomidation. like, reading a book</p>

<p>Knowledge by structure: there is propositional qualities to language, and as such, implied meaning with narratives given. I say circle, and you have to assume, &quot;no corners&quot;. </p>

<p>IS that what you process this as?</p>

<p>In such, how would you have presented information more effectively?</p>

<p>*think of the term, &quot;priming&quot;, and why I would not want to expose the name-content before you see it who it is.</p>

<p>okay. okay. Maybe, some people do just know a little more about how to present a topic for a desired effect because they have a background in psychology enough to know NOT to expose the name before the clue that aids in linking a narrative: it&#39;s called a &#39;surprise&#39;, and lateral priming. </p>

<p>You dont know what lateral priming is...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a means of eliciting associated content to other associated but not elicited content. It&#39;s called &#39;lateral-activation&#39; in a text book.</p>

<p>People are not equals to one another. By the way. your feelings are your responsibility and not mine to nurture. That was your mothers job. Im here to show you what a state actor looks like.</p>

<p>That sounds more likely. I too am getting annoyed with the amount of &quot;hey watch <em>this</em> video about cool shit&quot; threads where the OP contributes SFA except the link  i.e. I can see how you mistook their &#39;desires&#39; for an &#39;unpolluted/uninfluenced&#39; opinion from us readers explains that completely; but in this case I think the OP&#39;s replies to you were sufficient to show they are sincere in their posting an unusually styled thread.</p>

<p>as for the &#39;formal education&#39;, idk about your previous interactions with this person, but these days it&#39;s a moot point ... 95%+ of college degrees are effectively useless when it comes to getting a job/making money/enjoying it</p>

<p>IMHO so long as you can read and write confidently,  then it&#39;s up to how curious you are and how much you take in as to how well &#39;educated&#39; you become, in this world where the info is at one&#39;s fingertips</p>

<p>mate, you think GHWB was any intellectual genius? The fucking retarded puppet somehow conned enough people into his election! And <em>over</em> 75% of the richest people in the world have no tertiary education, they learned &quot;on the go&quot; ... just as anyone can do in this day and age</p>

<p>so go for it! ;D</p>

<p>idk about that, except in &#39;elite&#39; professions like medicine and other sciences maybe .. but AI&#39;s are gonna change &#39;advice giving&#39; and &#39;diagnostics&#39; like we can&#39;t imagine. </p>

<p>Although lawyers and drs will become professions of a bygone era in the next few decades ... the guesswork will go, the chess games of the past will be over before they begin!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to give me time to respond, troll</p>

<p>by the way, attacking the speaker is a fallacy, and attempting to associate like qualities by membership is like saying all people on the basketball team, or in the army, are the same and deserving of respect. . . Yeah, right. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreading_activation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreading_activation</a></p>

<p>Combine the two, and in a sub-field of psychology (called NLP) you have the term &#39;Lateral-priming&#39; (as you&#39;re not just priming concepts, you&#39;re priming the entire mind subliminally for a process of desired activation). </p>

<p>Why &#39;lateral&#39;? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nlpworld.co.uk/nlp-glossary/l/lateral-thinking/">https://www.nlpworld.co.uk/nlp-glossary/l/lateral-thinking/</a></p>

<p>Following the structure of NLP that I was formally taught, like the structure of language that must be followed to form a meaningful sentence, I &quot;chunk&quot; laterally, as opposed to &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, in the &#39;hierarchy of ideas&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/%7Egary/cs200/f06/slides/Jung-Beeman-cogsci200-11-20-2006.pdf">http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/cs200/f06/slides/Jung-Beeman-cogsci200-11-20-2006.pdf</a></p>

<p>Research demands more than a one min google search. I actually got my old text book out, and looked up the answer for you, as &#39;spreading activation&#39;; even though you&#39;re just being a &#39;troll&#39;, by and by.</p>

<p>&#39;Anaphoric reference&#39; is the term for a prepositionally implied parsing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont major in NLP.</p>

<p>NLP is a sub-field of psychological study, in the area of psycho-linguistics (neuro-linguistics). It&#39;s a therapeutic area of certification and board membership; think hypnotherapy or ERPT.</p>

<p>You attend college, hopefully an accredited university, for a BA in psychology (generally, 130 credit hours in the US). Then it&#39;s masters, which is another 40 credit hours, or so. </p>

<p>You can also get a Psy.D, which is about the same credit hours but has a focus in therapy; think &#39;applied psychology&#39;. </p>

<p>Then, to practice therapy, you have to become certified in therapies, join boards, pay dues, and keep up to date with information [with some providing annual/bi-annual testing].</p>

<p>Hope this educates you that much further. You seem to be learning a whole lot hanging out with me.</p>
