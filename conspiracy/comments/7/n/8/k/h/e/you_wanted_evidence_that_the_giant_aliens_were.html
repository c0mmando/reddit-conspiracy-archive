<p>Second, a lot of the &#39;proof&#39; online found of &#39;giant skeletons&#39; is fake and photoshopped. One person on this website:
<a href="https://ancientneareast.org/2012/10/01/a-giant-misconception/">https://ancientneareast.org/2012/10/01/a-giant-misconception/</a></p>

<p>Confessed to altering photos to make it look that way.</p>

<p>Another website showing &#39;giant skeleton&#39; is a hoax: <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071214-giant-skeleton_2.html">https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071214-giant-skeleton_2.html</a></p>

<p>You have to understand, the alien narrative has long been part of this world but has not had any real evidence. If anything, these &#39;giants&#39; that people spoke of could have just been people who ate plenty of nutritious food, especially meat, and grew bigger than most people. They probably had advanced technology compared to the simple people they encountered. It&#39;d be like if tall Dutch people went deep into the Amazon and met tribal people that never experienced the outside world. They would think these pale, tall creature were aliens.</p>

<p>Look at these people in China, skeletons founds that were around 1.9 m or 6&#39;2&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/skeletons-china-giants-5000-year-old-archaeologists-discovered-jiaojia-jinan-shandong-a7824326.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/skeletons-china-giants-5000-year-old-archaeologists-discovered-jiaojia-jinan-shandong-a7824326.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although not particularly unusual by 21st-century Western standards, it is thought their height would have seen them tower over many of their contemporaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe alive they would have been like 6&#39;5&quot; or something, but compared to heights today, that&#39;s not &#39;giant&#39;.</p>

<p>They also lived comfortable lives these &#39;giant&#39; skeletons</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people living in the region 5,000 years ago are believed to have had relatively comfortable lives; the rows of houses that have been excavated suggested their living quarters had separate bedrooms and kitchens, according to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#39;Taller men&#39; were also found, but they were suggested to have better access to food.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taller men were found buried in larger graves, which could be due to them having a higher status and having access to better food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you look at the reality of things, it seems that people just keep lying and making things seem more grandiose than they really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem very well educated in this. In case you haven’t seen it already, I highly suggest you check out the YouTube channel of an independent and highly educated researcher who is diving deep into this, with help from a lot of universities. He also explains how every 12,900 years or so we pass through a belt of asteroids and it basically wrecks our shit each time, resetting the planet in a circular pattern of time. Our ancestors probably knew this too, which is why they’d build things like the pyramids (or at least the pyramids ancestor), to serve as a marking and warning perhaps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We just need to get our space program up and running. Satellites to mark the asteroids, big rockets to push them off course. It’s theorized that the asteroid impacts released enough energy over the ancient ice sheets to cause many massive floods over the period of 100 years or so? My dating might be a bit off, but if you look at places like the northwest badlands of The USA, you see incredibly clear geological evidence for massive floods from that exact time period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My one question with R1a1a, wouldn’t it be also found in the ancestors of the inhabitants of the Americas? Some evidence points to the idea of a global civilization sometime within the past 10/15,000 years. Wouldn’t that have left the marker pretty much everywhere in the world? Or would it be possible that it only spread locally, and despite being globally connected, perhaps our ancestors were segregated too, preventing certain genes from spreading everywhere? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off no one admitted to faking giants. There was a contest to see who could make the best giant images. So all those fake dig sites as youtube video covers where never really meant to fool anyone. It&#39;s just foolish people who did not understand.</p>

<p>Second, if you do some serious research you may just find evidence of another race of hominids. At one point in earths history their were at least 6 different species of hominid sharing the planet. </p>

<p>It has become quite clear that the crown and the Smithsonian have gone out of their way to hide another race of hominids that inhabited the Americas. This other group was 7-9 feet tall with double rows of teeth. They wore copper armor/jewerly from Michigan and may be the ones who built the extensive network of stone walls and chambers that can be found throughout New England.</p>

<p>I have rarely come across any researchers who claim they were aliens so not sure what network you have tapped into. A great place to start looking into this would be Jim Vierras tedx on the mound builders or the new redheads of New Zealand doc which you can find on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, people were taking about aliens and they always include giants in there. I&#39;m like but why?</p>

<p>I will take a look for sure. The denisovans imparted some of their DNA onto us as well. The red hair that we have grew separate from let&#39;s say, the Neanderthal DNA. I think it was thanks to the Toba eruption. Humans bottlenecked because of the eruption and also mutated their genes (some). If you notice red heads can produce their own vitamin D for example.</p>

<p>Look at the Persian Gulf and Jeffrey Rose. He was able to find information of an earlier human migration and an area where back then was not flooded and people had access to food and water. These also produced changes in genes.</p>

<p>Look at the Pavlovians, which I believe are the true ancestors of the Atlanteans, and see how they were great hunters. These all provide markers into further exploration of true human origins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depending on the technology of those who came before, giants could be referring to some kind of robotic exoskeleton perhaps? Our technological levels have only really advanced rapidly in the past few hundred years. Perhaps the time of the height of the ancient civilization was only a few hundred years as well, before its downfall. Still long enough to inspire incredible worldwide feats that would be past down in humanity’s stories and scriptures for thousands of years to come. The ancient stories past down from culture to culture often talk in vague and very embellished ways. In the same vague way that a lot of the references to flying ships are often read, or depicted.  My theory is that they are probably lighter than air airships, aka zeppelins, blimps, hot air balloons, and at one period rudimentary, if not advanced flight, perhaps even limited space travel?Lower sea levels would have given our ancestors access to different and potentially more abundant sources of natural gases including hydrogen and helium. We already know they were world wide. Perhaps they achieved this via air travel with lighter than air vessels? Vessels which easily could carry hundreds of not thousands of tons of designed correctly? Lift giant monolithic stones such as Stonehenge and the pyramid stones? Carry a people all around the globe and help disseminate a gene throughout the entire earth. When the north and south are totally frozen, and you don’t have any sea lanes, and yet you see a world wide civilization with apparently incredible ease of communication and access, it just screams air travel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many of our technologies today first find their origin long before recorded history, past down in religious texts, ancient monuments, and through generation after generation of storytelling. I wonder if when we map our DNA well enough we will be able to see the point between 12,900 years and 11,600 years when ice caps melted and destroyed what was once here. Stress markers unlike anything seen in DNA, due to the scale of the cataclysm maybe? From what I know, even world war 2 left its descendants with generational ptsd. Perhaps something like that can be found in our ancestors DNA, via the medium of our own DNA. </p>
