       Exactly. We can't trust them. Even if there were a few good guys left I've no doubt that TPTB have shit on them or will trump up stuff. We can't trust anyone at the top. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.

       Self rule is better than foreign rule.   Self rule where there is less corruption is better than corrupt self rule.    I am not asking for perfection here.   I am just reminding people that what we argue about is not even our own agenda on what to argue about.

       Oh... you still believe in justice. See, justice was an illusion. People always thought the laws were equally applied but as the internet grew, people began to report real news, not fabricated, packaged news, it was discovered that only the peasants are punished for disobeying laws.   Even when we read that ABC Inc got fined $500 million for polluting our clean river with sludge, we learn through locals on the internet that the same company saved $3 billion by not having to legally transport that sludge to a facility for treatment and that the 500 million wasn't really a fine, it was a payoff.

       It does and has effected nearly every american directly now. Either by a loved one serving in the war, getting caught up in a terrorist act, hit hard by the recession etc. 
We are cottled, lazy, and ignorance is bliss. The last 4 generations have not had to witness any type of real tradgedy or hardship first hand yet. And the better part of the past three generations, havent seen or experienced any sort of real death happen in front of them. 
No revolutions or pride of such things being taught by parents. No blood in the streets to show the real consequences of a weakness in the power structure. No famine, disease, genocide, up close or at home wars to be seen or heard. Just nothing. 
So the vast majority of people from age 18 all the way to 50 yrs old have been directly effected but not personally witnessed it or what it means or could mean or even represent, by their own eyes yet.
When your money means nothing anymore. When your children and everyone you knows children are dying from famine, or disease. When youre swept up in a genocide or war happening not just in your country but on your street. 
Not until a large majority of Americans witness this, then communicate, then agree with one another, and then still come together as an organized collective to form a coup or make some kind of stand for change, not until of this has taken place will anything ever come close to changing in any meaningful way. And to have all of those circumstances happen in a giant society like america at the right time and place will take years upon years, a lot of mass death and loss, and the right circumstances of events to take place at just the right time. 
Yea, our government has dome fucked up shit. And yea the publics becoming aware of that. But we still have led and enjoyed a much much better quality of life in America across the board, ragrdless of gender sex race or circumstance than anywhere else on the planet and have done so for the better part of over 50 years. For most peoples families much much longer than that. 
Enjoy living in the best country in the world while it lasts and be grateful youve not had to nor your loved ones had to witness such atrocities or feel such pain and terror. Our soldiers dont fight in vain ya know. And wars and military spending have both accomplished at least that for us so far and that is a priceless way of life most do kill for some daily trying to get for their own families. 
Wake. Up. 
 Even then they could be over powered and fail to change anything.

       A fine on an profit of $500 million should be $1 billion, not $25 million.  Make it cost more to be illegal than legal and the problem dries up. The reason the courts don't do this is because the payoffs dry up too.

       Exactly. People have been getting away with the same and worse since the beginning of time. Usually under a guise set up by some form of ruling class for every civilization worth mentioning since the beginning of time. And some not worth mentioning were run this way as well. 
A strong naïveté, lack of history knowledge, and strong belief in what youve been told and taught by your own government causes people to be baffled and caught up on things like this. 
Its more baffling someone thinks someone with as much power and notoriety as him would be arrested and tried for this... Almost two decades after the war was started.

       No one has proven, hell no one has shown a shred if evidence that the us gave supplies or money to isis.

      <p>
       There's a huge difference between doing that stuff too group that morphed into isis and doing it to isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of isis arms were captured at Iraqi military bases. You all do remember thousands of Iraqi troops fleeing like cowards from a couple hundred isis fighters back in 2014 that led to them taking over a third of the country right?

       There IS proof the US was glad to see ISIS fighting Assad,  did nothing to stop the oil trading etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS folded only when Russia got involved,  and then it is proven,  moved to Libya under US protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the US funding needs to be more completely documented.   US training,  US supplying,  the evidence is overwhelming.    Remember the state department assistance in the Toyota truck shipments?

       I thought most ended up in Turkey and since Incirlik Air Base was more important the US and others didn't apply much pressure. But one of those links says that most was used domestically. Still, a lot did make its way to Turkey so there is that, though obviously that's after it has been extracted and transported.

       ISIS has risen and fallen again and again based on the US position of supporting one day,  and attacking the next.  A book could be written about it.    One of the biggest turning points was Russia entering the fray in 2015.    This instance was from 2014.  But thanks for sharing.

       Are the Russians even in Iraq? You talk like ISIS is only in Syria. They aren't. The US has had ground personnel in Iraq fighting ISIS for years. We've been bombing ISIS for years. We've helped take multiple major cities from ISIS, including their capital Raqqa (which is in Syria).
      </p>
      <p>
       And now you want to give Russia all the credit because they strolled in late to the party? And only showed up at all because their lackey Assad was losing too much ground?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't even fight ISIS much early on, they focused on anti-Assad forces like the FSA. You're just peddling Kremlin propaganda.

       No,  I am interested in the facts,  not lies.   Russia has stuck to the facts.    If Assad fell,  they would have lost their naval base on the Meditaranean.   That is why they got involved,  also because after the Ukraine/Crimea thing,   Russia decided to defend what it considered to be its legitmate interests.   The US has been antagonistic to the Putin regime leading up to 2013.    Enough was enough for them,   and the US mission has been corrupt and hypocritical.   I am embarrased for the US policies,  they are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like you think your version of geopolitical details spells out a legitimate involvement by the US.    White Helmets are glorified.    Problem is the US was caught.    Obama should not have continued the neocon objectives.    He has brought shame to America and that is why exGIs are killing themselves by the dozens,  daily.

       vets have always lacked support and therapy.    this time they also do not believe in what they did,  in fact,  they know what they did was criminal genocide,  and they know they were acting as mercenaries for American fascist scum.    I would like to see some therapy for that.   Starting with putting all that scum on trial for war crimes.

       That’s not an assertion. It is a fact. Just look her up and read about the blow back from her own party. They hate her. I don’t have an angle.

       ELL in all honestly, they didn’t LIE about the WMDs. They got the intelligence from a single unverified source that was known to be untruthful, but took the report for fact. Normally, to take any action there is required multiple corroborating information sources, from trusted sources. So they heard what they wanted to hear and went in.

       Id first point you to a couple books that are essential reads for all Americans imo. War is a Racket by Smedley Butler (

        https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html
       </a>
       )
and Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins. Here is a pdf on the united diversity website library (formatting is poor in PDF though)
       <a href="http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Money_and_Economics/confessions_of_an_economic_hitman.pdf">
        http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Money_and_Economics/confessions_of_an_economic_hitman.pdf

       Alternatively I would point you to The Corbett Report, where you can find tons of information on this and many other topics relating to corruption. A couple related videos I could find quickly:

       You can when they lie about doing it and then cover it up. Only Congress can declare war. If Congress was not in the know then it was illegal. Even then, keeping it from the American people, while maybe not illegal, is grounds for impeachment, especially when it sparks the destabilization of Europe through mass migration invasions and new failed terrorist states like Libya now is.

       You are not understanding what I mean. The official Obama admin's policy was to support ISIS. So nobody who have given them a weapon or fund were violating any laws. They lied in public like on TV or in the media reports, which is not illegal anyway.

       I know it's creeping towards a slippery slope, but blatant support of terrorism online should be criminalized. If you say, "I'm so happy there was a terrorist attack and dozens of infidels were killed!" on Twitter following a terrorist attack, I want you to at least get a visit from the police.

       I thought most ended up in Turkey and since Incirlik Air Base was more important the US and others didn't apply much pressure. But one of those links says that most was used domestically. Still, a lot did make its way to Turkey so there is that, though obviously that's after it has been extracted and transported.

       ISIS has risen and fallen again and again based on the US position of supporting one day,  and attacking the next.  A book could be written about it.    One of the biggest turning points was Russia entering the fray in 2015.    This instance was from 2014.  But thanks for sharing.
