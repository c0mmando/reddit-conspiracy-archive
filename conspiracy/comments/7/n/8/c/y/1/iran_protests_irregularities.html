        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is there even a question if these protests are another cia funded-promoted regime change- destabilization color revolution situation?</p>

<p>Before I saw a single article or comment or post saying this was the case, I saw preemptive articles- comments- posts saying that “they are real don’t be fooled” and stuff like “there is no question that they are real and don’t believe the people saying they are fake it’s pathetic” like it’s so obvious that the us- saudi- Israeli alliance would want to do this in Iran..</p>

<p>I mean come on..  this could have been a constant state of affairs from 2009 until now and it would have been an easy conclusion to come to that this isn’t spontaneous or grassroots.  This is the wet dream of the zionists, Saudis, and the USA.  </p>

<p>There hasn’t been a second to breath between the JCPOA- Netanyahus cartoon bomb- the preemptive attack threats- the Qatar blockade- the Al Jazeera hatred- the Iran in Syria foaming at the mouth- the Yemen war- the fucking Lebanon leader mysteriously missing, ending up in Saudi resigning and threatening Hezbollah...</p>

<p>Iran is literally #1 for being a target of the worst alliance known in history... wall st- Israeli zionists- Saudi kings -Christian evangelists..  </p>

<p>This is war and there are no rules.. they assasinate Iranian scientists.. they use computer code to obliterate their centrifuges- they threaten nuclear war- they blockage-embargo- sanction.. and worse </p>

<p>The Iranian people are not stupid..  and yes, the revolutionary Islamic leadership has some characteristics that are less then ideal.. such as being theocratic, and Iran has economic issues like everyone else..</p>

<p>But seriously? Since the time of the shah and earlier Iran has been a target.. the west literally genocided Syria recently.. the endinrg hasn’t been ideal .. but I bet you netanyahu wouldn’t mind a similar slaughter in Iran ... surgical strikes on leadership and a full on civil war in the gen pop..</p>

<p>I was inspired to write this because I just read a Fox News article supporting revolution.. Fox News.. promoting revolutionary resistance and struggle against governments .. L M A O..   </p>

<p>How Can they be serious?? Who falls for this shit?  I’ll hold my breath on the publication of a Fox News article promoting revolutionary violence in Israel from Palestinians, Saudi from Yemenis and Saudis, and America from us all..</p>

<p>Fox said.. THESE IRAN PROTESTS ARE VERY POWERFUL AND REAL.. what the fuck??? So fox gets to choose which discontent people are real? And which protests they hold are powerful?? Shut the fuck up man.   This is way way way too obvious.. even more then the Venezuela destabilization and subsequent protests and opposition by the rich and upper middle class ..</p>

<p>This is the MOST OBVIOUS color protest “event” ever and we should have had it marked on our calendars out of predictability. They want Iran crushed .. the color revolution model works.. they are using it.</p>

<p>Anything else is propaganda and stupidity. The Iranian people will one day need a real revolution.. but this is wartime and their people aren’t puppets of the West.. they support their country against the alliance of the west..  they are very capable of being discontent and having protests,  but this is not that.</p>

<p>The Iran protests are not spontaneous and real.. sorry zionists and anti Muslim sociopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not one to call everything a shill or whatever, I actually don’t think I’ve used shill more then once ever online, but  people jumping  up to pre-emptively do damage control and situational management on something as predictable as this is kind of bold and scary..</p>

<p>I would expect conspiracy, honestly pre-election conspiracy, to laugh these people off of the sub.. </p>

<p>How confident do you have to be of the big lie to jump up and declare these protests, in this geopolitical environment, with this recent historical development, are 100% totally real and beyond questioning?  </p>

<p>That’s a huge red flag if I’ve ever seen one.  Trying to make people weary of any skepticism involving protests in the number one target country for fake protests and destabilizing techniques. </p>

<p>Get real.</p>

<p>If these protests aren’t us-Israel-Saudi inspired, funded, promoted, and maybe even totally operated by.. then holy shit what a coincidence and what a time for the Iranian people, who enjoy quite a bit of secular freedom, to turn on their own country and push to destabilize..</p>

<p>To be honest, this IS a good time for any segment of the population that has been already organized and pushing for systemic change to try to breach the proverbial tipping point, since they are more then likely to have extremely powerful allies, funding, intel, support, behind them (most likely co-opting them)..</p>

<p>This is the only logical way that these protests aren’t being directed by foreign powers.  But I doubt it.. the leadership WAS the revolution .
It’s more likely, in the words of the fox article, that media can make or break a protests momentum in the early stages.. (I.e occupy somewhat. Bums, hippies, unemployed pissing and shitting and getting high and not knowing what they stand for. Literally what fox and everyone else said)..   and the alliance from hell is telling the news media to try to Maximize this protest and flare it up into a Syria level event.. </p>

<p>Fuck this world and fuck the anti-human revolutions .. it’s amazing to me that struggle against government is used by the wealthy and powerful to hurt us.. they stole our tactic.. and they literally play us like it’s the SIMS game.. hey let’s start a revolution and kill the previous revolutionaries and then put a new shah in charge which will end up in another revolution which will be co-opted and etc etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao.  It’s funny I found myself defending Islam against hatred and attacks for so long, and I still do if the opposing argument is unjust, but I hate religion and I hate theocrats and I would hate, and be hated by Islamic fundamentalists. </p>

<p>It’s like I need to destroy the powerful interests trying to destroy Islam, and then destroy Islam once it’s the last main religion left.  </p>

<p>What it comes down to is people hate things that need to be hated, but always for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Example:  </p>

<p>Obama- should be hated for starting wars, bailing out banks, lying to get elected by playing a populist leftist etc</p>

<p>—-hated for being a “Muslim terrorist hitler gay ??cia plant?? Who tried to kill us with healthcare</p>

<p>Trump- should be hated for being a Zionist was mongering total liar Goldman Sachs reality tv low class billionaire who lied to get elected by playing a populist right winger</p>

<p>—-hated for something about Russia? Hated for random shit?</p>

<p>So we fix Islam last? Great.. that’s never happening</p>

<p>What’s wrong with Iran? Their entire country is run by Islamic extremists and heir people are free.. What’s wrong with wanting their people to go back to the way things were before the Islamic revolution? </p>

<p>Why is everything on this sub about Zionists and the influence tiny Israel has over foreign policy.. It gets kind of tiring when you don’t provide any proof. But the story sounds nice.. half compelling</p>

<p>But yeah, CIA and deep state are totally paying the people off in Iran to go into the streets and risk getting killed...</p>

<p>Islam needs be crushed first. If Not, it will become majority global religion and we will have to have ww3 to put em back in check again like during the EU invasions via the Ottomans in the 1600&#39;s.</p>

<p>Or, they reform to be modern and live peacefully among others, but I doubt that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is worthy of further debate.  I said crush last because they are the least powerful of the big 3 religions. If you could stop American and Israeli war machinery, and use those weapons, directed by a coalition of secular, neutral human beings to destroy Islamic power , and  just leave the people to worship whoever they want without having the power to direct religious or religious majority armies.. we’d Be better off.   I guess you could take out islams most powerful interests, but you need to stay dedicated after to take out Judaism and Catholicism.  The order only matters because if Islam falls first, I feel the other two become even more omnipotent .</p>

<p>I think that Christianity and Judaism is for the most part peaceful and allows for coexistence of others. Its really the radical branches of both that are the issue, such Jews in Israel who are for the crushing/death/destruction of Islam and Palestinians.</p>

<p>I think the ultimate solutions will be when A.I. Genetically Engineers Super Humans with 1000+ I.Q. who are 7 feet tall, 500 year life spans, and engineered to live on other planets where there bodies are able to quickly adjust to different atmospheres.</p>

<p>Hopefully they can leave and colonize other planets while the syupid old version of us here, basically kill the planet and each other via global wars.</p>

<p>Then the new version will be peaceful and One. It would be like how we currently see monkeys and really would care too much if they all went extinct, that&#39;s how the Humans 2.0 would see us and would be gone and on to bigger and better things by then</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  It’s crazy to me that even the right wingers are pro war, pro Zionism, pro suffering.. whatever</p>

<p>How can you be pro life and pro war?</p>

<p>All humans, regardless of political affiliation, prejudice, or ideology should be strongly anti-war.. it’s like a litmus test for if you are a puppet or not... </p>

<p>But when I ask around.. at work, with girls, with family.. they usually support war.. as necessary, as not so bad, as a given, as so blatantly needed and acceptable as to lower the credibility of my ideas just by asking..</p>

<p>War is not necessary in almost all cases.. only when we let something get so powerful that it is capable of exerting it’s will on Everyone, do we need violence.   Right now the only acceptable violence is against the power structures we have let grow.. after they fall.. war should be abolished .. nation on nation war is a scam .. people against the system war is needed..</p>

<p>Besides that.. all Americans need to do.. all humans need to do for hay matter,  is be bipartisan on the issue of WAR IS BAD, and we make a major change..</p>

<p>How can you support war?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>=[. I think a lot of people are just so used to the idea of violence being normal.  Getting into a fist fight is ok, and no one feels bad for the loser. Everyone likes a fight. War to them is similar but simultaneously 1000 more extreme and also not even a reality. War is out of sight out of mind, so no one FEELS it.   Ahh.

    <div class="md"><p>What your friends, (who seem to think that wars are somehow necessary, or not so bad), really need is a nice big bloody war ripping-up their own streets and houses and indiscriminately killing people all over the place, with no food, no clean water, no power, and no way to know from one minute to the next if they&#39;re going to get shot to pieces or blown to bits by either side.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons so many US soldiers commit suicide was because they thought wars were necessary and not so bad, too, until they became the mass murderers and destroyers of all kinds of ordinary people they went into those wars being told and believing they were there to help and protect them from something &quot;worse&quot;. </p>

<p>The real truth is that nothing is actually worse than war itself, not living under a despot or some authoritarian regime, megalomaniac king, or anything else. </p>

<p>In the pursuit of ordinary everyday life by ordinary everyday people, what matters most is a roof over your head, food on the table, and the ability to be with and take care of the people you love on an ongoing basis. </p>

<p>Every political state depends on preserving the ability of ordinary people to have at least that much. It&#39;s only when large numbers of them don&#39;t have that, that they will rebel and they won&#39;t care who or what offers to provide and give at least that much back to them in choosing to fight against and replace any authorities who have failed them in that. No one fights very long or very hard over any ideological differences before finding out that the real war was never actually about them at all.</p>

You matter and I know life is hard, but just seeing the obvious and declaring it plainly and clearly is a great thing. I appreciate you all I really do.  Happy you see this</p>

<p>If you can see this, you will be able to see it when it comes here, but don’t jump to conclusions.. analyze and come to a logical conclusion as always.. a communist or right wing mass movement in america could be a grassroots thing at some point.. it’s not always Soros or Goldman Sachs..  until it is.  =]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie bro =] I’m more weather underground, black panther, Bolshevik,  then I am a Social democrat.  But I’ll take it yeah whatever.</p>

<p>By the way, you shouldn’t paint this sub with such a broad “we love socialism and wealth redistribution” sarcasm brush.  A lot of people here want workers to assert more control over the machines they work on, the profits that they generate, and the social policies that go with it all.</p>

<p>Everyone who is sane wants wealth redistribution, when 1% of the population controls at least 40% of the nations total wealth.. while every city has extreme poverty, opiate addiction is skyrocketing, working families can’t put food on the table, get adequate healthcare, educate their children, or have an effect on the Political process .</p>

<p>Just because you blindly subscribed to right wing, anti-human being, pro oligarch talking points that were literally designed and promoted by wealthy interests to manipulate you along ideological, racial, religious, and economic lines.. doesn’t mean that you have a point or that other people also believe these things.   Many do think like you, but you are a major obstacle to the creation of a better world buddy. Being a promoter of the interests of the wealthy, while being an average American, is insane and sociopathic. You are commiting slow suicide, and brining Many others with you, for no reason other then the profit of others, low intelligence and or gullibility, and the sick Stockholm syndrome complex that affects some segment of the working class in relation to the obscenely grotesquely wealthy.</p>

<p>I love you brother, just get some better ideas, ones that help others. Socialism isn’t perfect but it’s an attempt at a better world.  Capitalism isn’t working. If you can come up with a better system please work it out on paper and post it.  It may change the world </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re mistaken. Iran deserves real freedom, not corporate sponsored, not U.S. military sponsored, Goldman Sachs sponsored freedom. I know you mean well, but you just have to dig a little deeper to find the truth as to why we&#39;re really in the Middle East dropping bombs, and why war mongers from both parties in our government have had in its crosshairs the climax, being the toppling of Iran, for over a decade. Our intelligence community has a well funded apparatus in place in a lot of countries that are able to fund and support local anti-government groups, stage protests, egg on and provoke the standing government into armed conflict, then swoop in with the &quot;solution&quot; to stop the violence. Our war machine&#39;s solution is turning their country into the next Libya/ Syria under the guise of giving them &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;. False pretenses. The Iranian people don&#39;t deserve the violence that&#39;s about to happen to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this.  I’ve been trying hard not to alienate right wingers or say anything that will end a debate prematurely.. but it’s hard with these new recruits to the conspiracy world ..</p>

<p>They are all taking the same political line and it’s a bad one.  They have a worldview where “liberals” and democrats and the “elite” and whoever else is the source of all evil.. then they name cosmetic problems usually, and their prescription for these problems are usually evil and twisted. </p>

<p>It’s like the struggle against power went mainstream, but the election skewed people’s minds and now it’s a game. The game being humiliate and destroy the “other side”.  That would be fine if it was the right vs the establishment neo liberals.. but there is more then 2 sides, and the sides that are full of good people who want real, healthy, bipartisan, even apolitical betterment of society and the USA in particular, get marginalized and become impotent. It’s almost as if it’s all by design.   </p>

<p>The sudden influx of pseudo- conspiratorial Donald Trump fanatics have not caused a massive awakening as previously thought possible, but has actually made things more complicated and congested and confusing. </p>

<p>America is a tough problem to solve with all the different ideologies and the total mistrust of any one of them reigning supreme. Blah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The headline I saw from CNN today was: “there’s something different about these protests in Iran” with an inspiring photo of a young woman w no hijab raising her fist in defiance. Cool right? Spreading democracy right? No the drums of war are beating loud in the Persian gulf and I pray to whatever dirty exists for the continuation of peace in Iran. A truly beautiful country, culture, and people it would really truly be a shame to see one of the last bastions of resistance to zionism fall. This comment in no way supports theocratic control of Iran but it is their country and their business the West has fucked w Iranian affairs for long enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>=[. I think a lot of people are just so used to the idea of violence being normal.  Getting into a fist fight is ok, and no one feels bad for the loser. Everyone likes a fight. War to them is similar but simultaneously 1000 more extreme and also not even a reality. War is out of sight out of mind, so no one FEELS it.   Ahh. I could really put this nicely into words but this wasn’t it </p>
