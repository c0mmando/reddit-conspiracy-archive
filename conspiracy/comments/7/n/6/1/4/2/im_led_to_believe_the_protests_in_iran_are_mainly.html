       Doesn't add up..no one is mentioning the sanctions. How could they leave this fact out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I see this as more proof that it's not an organic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if someone can show me some people who are encouraging the protests that are also pointing to the fact that US sanctions on Iran play a huge role in the quality of life in Iran...including food prices...I might think differently.

       Remember when we were told we are invadimg Iraq for "Freedom and Democracy"?   That is the reason fed to the people to get them to go along.   The real reason is hidden from us.

      <p>
       Same with Iran.   I am sure that Iranian women believe this so they will go along, but they are not being told the real reason.

       I will assume you know about what is going on in Europe- the no go zones, and the European women being forced to follow Sharia law.

       I reread your original comment, and yes, they are inadvertently fighting for a Rothschild central bank.   It is a Hegelian dielectic.

       Well, I remember when people freaked out over trump dropping a few bombs on Syria. At first it seemed like we were headed back into a fake war, but given that trump was with China and needed to convince China not to do shit with NK, it was pretty evident in hindsight he was trying to make clear that NK shit would not be tolerated. He also said we weren’t going into Syria. Granted, trump has yet to say that Assad is the good guy. He has condemned both the rebels and Assad and cut off arming rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore I’m reluctant to say that trump is absolutely trying to institute Rothschild banks. But I know that if he stabilizes a place it’s only because there will be a central bank.

       I have a nephew in Syria , 3 years old. Dying because of sanctions. His brain is swelling and the hospitals have no way to put in a shunt he desperately needs. All of the hospitals are working with bare bones , or are in heaps of rubble. But I am sure this is Americas way, starve , bomb , infiltration. I  can’t do shit for him . I live here, he is there. Everything I have sent , gets returned.  Don’t get me wrong, I am happy to be in my own country. But knowing what my relatives have been through for years ....... and now these sanctions? I’m positive Iran is feeling it as well.   Besides our government is obviously planning another “ regime change.”

       Right but Iran is unique that instead of an autocrat it has a fully functional parliamentary democracy that's alas chained down by the Supreme Leader and Guardian Council.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if TPTB just has the President stage a coup of the religious government they'd have a loyal puppet and Iran would be a free country. Everybody wins.

       No it's entirely different. So the Supreme Leader and Guardian Council basically acts as a custodial dictator of the democracy below. If there's a candidate they don't like they remove them, they nominate and run people they like, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if any existing sectarian issues will be exacerbated by this, depends on how far the destabilization goes.

      <pre><code>3.  (SBU) The Deputy Intelligence Minister claimed some of those 
arrested in connection with the December 27 Ashura-day 'riots' were 
part of an Iranian network connected to the German Intelligence 
Service and were being guided by German diplomats in Iran.  This 
network was composed of young men and women who did propaganda work 
for the Green Path Opposition (GPO) and were in contact with 
foreign websites and elements.  One of the women in this network 
was connected to Tehran-based German diplomats who went to parties 
and private meetings associated with the network and who daily 
exchanged news and information with network members.  These German 
diplomats used these young Iranian men and women to help in their 
investigations of 'intelligence centers' and 'invited' some of 
these Iranian youth to cooperate.

        I'm sorry but US sanctions against a country half the globe away surely can't be the cause of the crisis. The majority of their trading partners will be in Eastern hemisphere anyways.

       Iranians were very happy when UN lifted many sanctions after the nuclear deal and never gave a shit about American sanctions because people are fucking used to US and Israel oppressing others and it's up to their own people to protest corruption in those countries, these are protests against corruption in the Iranian government because the market has been getting worse and worse for a long time and Iranians feel it's more productive to protest against the Iranian government instead of blaming foreign affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The protests are not 'synthetic', have been going on for about a year when MANY financial institutions were deemed illegal and people were told they wouldn't be able to collect the money they've been promised and have been gaining traction cuz of high prices. Iranians have been angry at corruption since the green revolution (which wasn't small or synthetic either) most ARE angry with US and Israel like most sensible people around the world but I hope you can understand why they're mainly angry at their own government's corruption and choose to protest against it instead of countries we can't make a big difference for if we protested against them.

       I think it's possible for rank-and-file Iranians to dislike both the US
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       their own government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they mostly blame US sanctions, it's not impossible that they see their own government's foreign policy (arming Hezbollah, meddling in Lebanon, Syria, seeking nuclear weapons, taunting the US) as a major contributing factor to those sanctions being imposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's probably not a good idea to discount the idea that they understand that spending a significant portion of GDP on nukes, arming insurgencies, etc, isn't a good way to further the economy.  I've read Iran has to import fuel because they lack refining capacity.  As an average Iranian, you might be asking yourself what actually benefits you -- a local refinery to turn your own oil into fuel, or providing Hezbollah with medium-range ballistic missiles?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to say that the US doesn't do the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       things Iran does militarily or in terms of foreign policy, but the US economy is generally
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
       thriving and those actions often aid the economy, even if indirectly (i.e. keeping the Straits of Hormuz open and oil flowing keeps the global economy stable, which benefits the US).  The Iranian economy is just too small and oil prices too low for Iran to get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sure it extends beyond that -- I think the Iranian youth is soured on a lot of the religious aspects of the government and probably links those to limitations on Iran's ability to engage with the rest of the world and prosper, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1. Yes, some segments of the economy have real problems and we may not be told the whole truth about how bad it is, but overall I think there is positive growth even if it only goes to certain people.)

       At the very least, economic sanctions of food and medicine should be considered an act of war.

       It appears to me 2018 will finally be the year the U.S. oil-backed banking cartel sinks its claws into Iran. Isis has reduced it presence in Syria, to gear up for acting as moderate rebels as soon as these protests ramp up and spill over into armed conflict. That will be our excuse to use our humanitarian love bombs to destabilize the current regime just like we have in countries before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one will not be buying into the peace and democracy propaganda soon to come through the news pipeline. If the U.S. wants to support regime change in Iran, they could at least be truthful with us. And if any part of this comment turns out to be correct, it will be the latter point that they will lie to us throughout the whole tragic affair.

       I believe Iran's army is now on the US terrorist list...so..that's a big problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as has been seen the US has no real policy or plan for when a military vacuum occurs..

       Right but Iran is unique that instead of an autocrat it has a fully functional parliamentary democracy that's alas chained down by the Supreme Leader and Guardian Council.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if TPTB just has the President stage a coup of the religious government they'd have a loyal puppet and Iran would be a free country. Everybody wins.
