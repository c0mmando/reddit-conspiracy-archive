I’m just curious. When my father passed away we had to bury him in the Mosque because my family identifies as “Muslim”. Upon arriving to the Mosque to setup the funeral and prayers, the accountant told us we had to pay MEMBERSHIP FEES in order to be buried as a Muslim &amp; to have a Imam pray for my father. We had to pay 3 months prior of membership fees, and 3 months after his death. Weeks went by and my mother told me and my husband we had to pay our membership fees. My husband &amp; I bring the way we are and NOT being religious and NOT going to spend $30 a month on a bogus membership fee brought up the fact (in private) that when we die is God going to ask if we paid membership fees? I posted this in conspiracy because I was just curious if there was more to religion and what people’s thoughts behind religion are? Not necessarily Islam, but Christian, Catholic, Buddhism and etc. </p>

Perhaps their world was in danger so they sought after a new one to keep the advancing of civilization going. Maybe they had the technology to make the apes be able to recognize and reflect on existing life and so we started to invent technologies with the help of the information that was passed down genetically in our DNA. Maybe they came back and saw we were not advancing like they wanted or killing ourselves off. So they implemented religion to keep their extraterrestrial world species alive and thriving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m late, but I think it was used as a way of control, and a way to instill morals. Like do not kill, do not steal, all that type of shit.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the decision was off of the punishment. Like you steal, cut off a hand or get branded. You kill, you get killed to. Hammurabis code I think??? I think that the punishment is still a major part for not doing shit, but now the moral part, like it&#39;s not right to kill that guy, or Its not right to steal that candy bar plays into it.

    <div class="md"><p>That was social evolution which is secular and collective, how all morality forms void of religious influence. Remember, even in America good Christians were hanging people, burning people, dismembering people for petty crimes or crimes against God. As early as 1612, Virginia Governor Sir Thomas Dale enacted the Divine, Moral and Martial Laws, which provided the death penalty for even minor offenses such as stealing grapes, killing chickens, and trading with Indians. The bases for such barbaric punishments for such minor offenses was itself Christianity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell is a Catholic conception /Hellenistic view.</p>

<p>If you look in the Bible, Hell is not a forever torment. A loving God wouldnt do that. </p>

<p>Look at John 3:16 for starters, God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not PERISH but have ETERNAL LIFE.</p>

<p>Look at PERISH and ETERNAL LIFE, does it say eternal life in suffering? No it does not. Other verses in the Bible say perish as well if you read  the underlying context of the Bible. </p>

<p>Lucifer wants you to think there is a forever Hell so that you dont ever learn about Jesus or God and fear him instead of love him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell as a concept came from the Pagan Irish way back when. The Christian bible has the best hits of the pagan religions that were routinely placed into the religion. The Old Testament is the Jewish Torah, which is probably some type of Egyptian history. </p>

<p>Control is a hot word, but consider the church built our civilization over the thousands of years and passed on its values. It&#39;s not all about God this God that. If you don&#39;t have this structure you can live in tribes ruled by warlords hunting and gathering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are not the only options.</p>

<p>There is also a great deal of a difference between the Church (be it Catholic or otherwise) and people of faith (Christian or otherwise). The Church seeks enlightenment for itself, and control over others. People of faith, including many of the great artists, mathematicians, philosophers, astronomers, etc. sought enlightenment for everyone through control of the self. </p>

<p>DaVinci, Michelangelo, Raffael, and so on, they were the Kubrick&#39;s of their time, encoding sacred (secret) knowledge in their works, so that they may be picked up on by the few with eyes to see.</p>

<p>Religions are corrupted half-truths, misrepresented to obfuscate simple Truths of what does and doesn&#39;t work in life. Read the Bible with that in mind (including the forbidden gospels of Thomas and of Mary Magdalene), and it might ring true. It certainly did with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus preached about Hell more than anyone else.  It exists and the exact opposite of what you say is true.  Lucifer wants you to not believe in it.

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that Hell isn&#39;t the Christian God&#39;s wrath. He rewards and excludes, but he isn&#39;t sending the person to Hell as punishment. It&#39;s not an act of vengeance so much as a refusal to let in.</p>

<p>Is a father who kicks out his freeloading son punishing him? Is he sentencing him to anything? Or is he saying there are certain standards that have to be met?</p>

<p>Did God kick out Adam and Eve, or did they do it to themselves?</p>

<p>The whole idea of Original Sin and Christ&#39;s sacrifice is that God wasn&#39;t happy to kick out Adam and Eve, and through Christ&#39;s sacrifice he&#39;s offering a way back out of love. The alternative isn&#39;t spiteful punishment. It&#39;s just the natural result of our stubborn refusal to acknowledge our exclusion is our own fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible (KJV) teaches that one is not a child of God until he&#39;s born again with a quickened spirit via repentance and belief in the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>Joh 8:44  Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not sending his beloved children to the lake of fire, he&#39;s sending Lucifer&#39;s spiritual children.  The sad part is that many of his children are unaware of who their spiritual father is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion and the stories it teaches are to be used as a metaphor for how one should live their life as a good person, but people take it at face value and are unable to see the actual messages in it, it is philosophy after all.  </p>

<p>I feel like most of these wars, the blind zealotry, are caused by the fact that people are unable to critically think or unable to see the metaphors that the Bible portrays.  These people take it so literally, and thus many lives were lost.  There might’ve been a time when religion helped us, but I think that time is passed, it’s just causing pointless arguments.  I feel like people need to think more, entertain the possibilities for abstractions, as well as questioning everything they see and are told, because reality is never usually what it seems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s all false. First point you&#39;re missing Is that scientific theory and theory are not the same thing. Scientific theory is law not an idea. It&#39;s tested, peer reviewed, and conclusive.
Second point is that we absolutely can observe and study evolution as it is happening. Everything you typed about a fruit fly evolving then de evolving is completely false. The theory of evolution is not something that &quot;old men in wigs&quot; simply stated over a century ago and we just go along with. It&#39;s, to this day, being tested and studied. Science is constantly trying to disprove itself. There is far more money, fame, and respect to be had in someone that can disprove the theory of evolution then for a someone to keep proving it.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be had for the scientists that sign on to the SCIENTIFIC THEORY that the earth revolves around the sun, just imagine the money and prestige that would come to someone who could disprove that theory. </p>

<p>Call it a fact then-- why you pussyfooting around?  If it&#39;s proven, then hey-- call it an indisputable fact.</p>

<p>But in FACT, it sounds more like you&#39;ve made science into some kind of weird religion.  Anything that could end up falsified in the future is just a theory, and whether it&#39;s a &quot;scientific theory&quot; or not doesn&#39;t mean shit.  Evolution could be 100% overturned with more data.</p>

<p>And yes, most of our &quot;hard science&quot; right now is maintained by a bureaucratic system that dictates that if you come up with a new theory, here is your F in your classes, and here is your grant application torn up.  So let&#39;s not pretend that you&#39;ve got some holy infallible priesthood-- not less than a hundred years after &quot;scientists&quot; ruined Semmelweis&#39;s life for saying doctors should wash their hands, and less than 50 years after &quot;scientists&quot; told us that eating grains and avoiding fat is the pathway to health. :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not called a fact because that&#39;s not how science works, and of course it could all be wrong if one day, it was disproven, but as of now it has not, so it is literally the most factual information we have to go on.
I&#39;m simply stating how science works and what we know, the fact that you find it as being portrayed as religious is on you and honestly pretty ignorant.
Your angry at the scientific method and how it works, which is very interesting.</p>

<p>Man evolved: Scientific data based on evidence. </p>

<p>Man created by a god: No evidence period.</p>

<p>At this point you&#39;re arguing based on your emotions and stubbornness. Science is not a religion, science is science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not science. There is no magic in science. Ironically, however, the claim of God is that he magically appeared out of nothing or did something create him as well?
You see science doesn&#39;t claim to know what was before the big bang. Science only makes claim to what is known so far and uses that to construct the most probable event based on evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No argument. Blatantly being stupid. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the basics. Science is not set in stone; it is not a monolithic entity that is meant to worshipped. It is not the end all be all of knowledge. It is free flowing; based on experimentation, datasets and a flow of information. Information can be manipulated to present a certain conclusion, thus data can too, and thus the basis for many academic &quot;scientific&quot; papers can too. You being retarded, and not knowing that just because something has been published, does not mean it is actually legitimate, is not my problem. The food industry does this all the time. With funding from dairy intitutions, they post pro-dairy propaganda i.e. &quot;scientific papers&quot; that present a certain conclusion, but when you read what those conclusions are actually based on, the data used and variables in play, you see that they are twisting facts. </p>

<p>Now, for the dumbarses like you out there: I am not saying that evolution is bullshit; nor am I saying that it is true. However, I am saying that it is entirely possible for it to be bullshit, even though personally I do believe in evolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After all my years in medical school, I&#39;m pretty sure I understand how science works. Are there things that can be wrong in science? Absolutely, scientists are forever trying to disprove one another or, as with some, (like the ones who disagree with climate change) are being paid to be wrong. But we are discussing specifically evolution, which has been thoroughly reviewed, tested, and scrutinize by every country and every generation since Darwin. It&#39;s validity is one of the most agreed upon scientific theories up there with gravity. </p>

<p>If i think it&#39;s true, as in, do I think that religion is actually offering people salvation etc... then sure I would agree it&#39;s a scam. My personal position is that God, at least the one depicted by the major religions does not exist. </p>

<p>However, people do receive things in return from religion. I&#39;m not sure scam is the best way to describe an organization that does provide a sense of community. Churches often provide emotional and financial support to members in need, there is a loving, welcoming atmosphere for people who find a church that suits them, and the structure and education some churches provide can also be of great benefit to it&#39;s members.</p>

<p>Scam just gives the wrong connotation for me. I think misguided is the word I would use for most churches. As a monolith perhaps the term would apply as I believe anyone at the top levels (arch bishops etc...) is complacent in underhanded exchanges of money and coverups just to benefit the image of the church &quot;brand&quot;, but on a more individual level I&#39;m not sure the same is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside of the MegaChurch realm I dont think many are a scam. Most small churches probably barely get by on what they collect in service and from outside donations. Not to say there arent small scam churches out there of course.</p>

<p>However Ive never heard of a church with a membership fee. 30$ a month seems exorbitant. I would love to see a dollar by dollar breakdown of where that money is going but then again I feel the same about most charities and for good reason.</p>

<p>Thankfully Ive never had to bury anyone personally but is it typical to have to pay for pastor at the service? Something about this whole scenario is just very wrong. Practically guilting people into dishing out this money. I dont even understand why you and your wife are brought into this &quot;billing&quot;. Is it any family member thats muslim that must pay? Any muslim attending? Anyone close enough to show up for the meeting with the accountant? </p>

<p>My view of humanity gets darker with each passing day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On this subject I recall Karl Marx&#39; comment that is usually stated (and I remembered) as &quot; religion...is the opiate of the masses.&quot;</p>

<p>Translated from the German, his full comment was &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>Personally I think religion is whatever a person wants to believe it is. For some folks it is taking literally every word of the King James version of the Christian bible. Polytheism works for other folks like millions of people in India. Jews believe in one deity, but don&#39;t accept that God became man in the body of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>Religion is usually based on belief in a hidden or higher power. This allows for a very wide set of interpretations; hence, the multitude of sects around the world. It has been intricately bond to culture and political power throughout history, and has been the go-to tool that militarily and politically dominate folks have used to advance their personal ambitions. </p>

<p>Religion, sans dogma, reminds folks to have a moral compass...treat others as you want to be treated. It also reminds us of our mortality; that we won&#39;t live forever, so we should do something worthwhile before we check out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is yes, but the real answer is a very long conversation. I&#39;m not big on labels because they don&#39;t give an accurate description but you could label me an agnostic, an atheist, a secular christian, a scientist, a humanist, and an evolutionist. In short I think religion exists because humans are conscious. What I mean by that is we are aware enough of the state of reality- to see how completely unfair and dangerous life is. This can be problematic. It&#39;s a level of anxiety most struggle to handle. Enter religion to provide a way of dealing with the shitty aspects of life and give the believer peace of mind. Because I do think there is power in belief, because whether you believe you can do something or not you are right. You must first believe something is possible and attainable before you could ever hope to achieve it. But I think all of it is in our brain. In ourselves. I do not believe in the supernatural; Some entity looking down on us, his creation, and judging us, or controlling and adjusting our reality according to our prayers or to punish us. No. Spirit or god, or whatever you want to call it is something within us. The power comes from our ability to belive or invest in something, not because some deity is rewarding us for believing in them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christians believe Jesus came in the flesh and rose from the dead after he was crucified. Believe it or not, there&#39;s fairly good evidence for this considering how ridiculous it is - namely, the unexplainable explosion of Christian belief and the wide variety of written sources talking about it very shortly after he died, plus the prophetic references in the Old Testament that forecast he would appear and what he would do before it happened. </p>

<p>Christianity is the only religion like this. Other religions are based on someone&#39;s private revelation, or someone&#39;s personal philosophy, or mythological events from long ago, which nobody can trace or verify. But the claims of Christianity are predicated on a historical reality, something that had supposedly just happened with witnesses, and it originated in the same area where these events had just happened, at practically the same exact time. There is no other religion like this, and in fact this makes Christianity the only falsifiable religion. </p>

<p>so okay. This is what the accounts of the day were saying: that a man Jesus went around performing miracles equating himself with God, and then rose from the dead. And if you accept these accounts, it suddenly makes sense to pay attention to what this guy Jesus was talking about, since the reality of these acts has the effect of authenticating that the events actually did come from God. It also makes sense to accept that the accounts of these things are sufficiently accurate accounts, since God obviously intends to communicate something if God really did this, and it wouldn&#39;t make sense that the communication could fail if it was truly God who was communicating.</p>

<p>if you follow the trail to this point, it kinda just all adds up. All the pieces you would expect to exist, they exist exactly where they&#39;re supposed to. And that includes the value of the message, and also the effect of practicing the teaching. Christianity isn&#39;t about how to behave, it&#39;s just a heads up that God wants to give eternal life to all of us. God says he&#39;ll give it to us completely for free, we just have to do it a certain way, which is to get on the same page about this Jesus guy. And that&#39;s it, he&#39;ll give us eternal life, it&#39;s finished. It&#39;s really cool, people have a lot of misunderstandings about it, but it&#39;s really good stuff. And I can testify that God really does work in it, there is no doubt to me that it&#39;s legit because God has explicitly opened my eyes and granted enormous understanding to me, showing himself to me unambiguously in a variety of ways. So all this disbelief stuff, this stuff about how unlikely it is, it&#39;s not even an issue to me, it doesn&#39;t even exist once you get past the point of taking God seriously, because God hooks it up, and he makes sure you get what you need.</p>

<p>anyway, I believe Jesus raised from the dead, absolutely. There&#39;s no other proposed explanation for where the claims of Christianity came from, since it literally benefits no one unless it&#39;s true. Not to mention the Old Testament prophecy. Not to mention the experiential data after being converted. So yeah, Jesus definitely rose from the dead, this is a real thing.</p>

<p>other religions however, many of them are deceptions. Some of them contain valid philosophies, some of them are describing real spiritual powers that actually do exist, but these powers come from demons. None of these belief systems however have the authority of God, and none of them lead to actual, literal eternal life, which is what God intends for us to have.</p>

<p>as far as the &quot;scam&quot; or control mechanism aspect, sure. Some of these belief systems seem to have been partially designed this way from the gate. And of course pretty much all of them at any time will have humans taking advantage of them to manipulate people, this certainly includes Christianity which is without a doubt the worst offender of all.</p>

<p>real Christian belief though, not a scam. Investigate what I am saying.</p>

<p>So much of today&#39;s religions were copied from earlier religions, spread by edict and force, and have not an ounce of proof more than Greek Mythology or any other ancient religion you can dig up.

<p>The bible didn&#39;t invent morality. Actually the bible contains many verses condoning rape and slavery, very immoral.</p>

<p>As a relic of history, fine, it had a place in controlling the savage masses. But don&#39;t forget,  Galileo was imprisoned for questioning that the earth was the centre of the universe.
Also millions of people were killed in Christ&#39;s name for the &#39;crime&#39; of being heretics. Add to that the numerous crimes against humanity committed by missionaries around the world.</p>

<p>So no, science was not fostered by Christianity.  It was opposed at all points and only as secularism became popular and the church lost its absolute authority were our societies with all their freedoms and &#39;lack of literal truth to be unveiled&#39; allowed to form.</p>

<p>Abrahamic religions should have no place in an intelligent modern era but survive because people indoctrinate their children and &#39;tradition&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion probably evolved naturally since we like to tell stories and feel important. Humans are on the same level as dogs and pigs but we feel more important because of our intelligence. To explain this, we invent religions that explain why we&#39;re so significant while other living creatures are going to just die off without any control whatsoever. </p>

<p>Controlling institutions are a scam. Modern religions are still partly stuck in the phase of being controlling institutions but they&#39;re slowly evolving out of it. Religions went from myths to popular political tools of dictators to massive controlling institutions dedicated to brainwash. Now it&#39;s transitioning back to myth and political tool, hence how more and more people identify as spiritual with some kind of cosmic philosophy rather than believing in some kind of actual supernatural history of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It probably didn&#39;t start as a scam.  Most early civilizations probably used religions as ways to explain the unknown.  It also often served as a set of traditions for guiding spiritual development through things like hallucinogens.</p>

<p>Sure, people have abused religion in order to accomplish their own goals.  However, I don&#39;t think the original purpose was to do that.</p>

<p>As humans become better at explaining the world around them with science and accumulated knowledge, organized religions become less and less valuable as explanations. They become relatively more valuable as just large-scale behavioral control tools.</p>

<p>I feel like most of these wars, the blind zealotry, are caused by the fact that people are unable to critically think or unable to see the metaphors that the Bible portrays.  These people take it so literally, and thus many lives were lost.  There might’ve been a time when religion helped us, but I think that time is passed, it’s just causing pointless arguments.  I feel like people need to think more, entertain the possibilities for abstractions, as well as questioning everything they see and are told, because reality is never usually what it seems. </p>
