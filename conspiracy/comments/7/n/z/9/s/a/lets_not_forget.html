Pray for the people of this country for they appear to be under full mind control at this point.

Pulled off what imo seems like a massive false flag, laid out the evidence of fraud for us to see..rubbed it in our faces and then distracted us with increasing mumbo jumbo and completely got away with it. Is this going to continue for the rest of our lives ? At what point do we organise and fight back ? How do we organise and fight back?. Have we gone too far off the deep end ?</p>

Imagine the truth were that hundreds of terrorist were planning attacks everywhere like an episode of 24 or even that what actually happened in LV was they stopped a nuclear bomb from going off.

    <div class="md"><p>The driving to Mexico thing is def confirmed. He’s listed crossing the border back into America on Oct 9 at a border crossing. I’m on mobile and don’t have links handy but you should be able to google that easy enough. One theory is the casino paid him off to keep quiet and he took the money to family in Mexico. If you watch Ellen’s interview at one point she mentions money and he says more under his breath that he’d been given enough money.    </p>

<p>As for the changes in appearance; you have to look at photos and decide for yourself. The first public photos of him are from some “awards dinner” held a whole week after the shooting to honor him for his whatever the fuck he is supposed to have done in this shooting. The timing of that alone is odd as fuck not to mention the “event” itself. And it’s just him and 3 or 4 huge “union” guys at the dinner. He does look different in those pics compared to the Ellen interview. But it’s not definitive. I would encourage you to watch how he walks/uses his cane on the Ellen show video too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...for they appear to be under full mind control at this point.&quot;</p>

<p>We are ALL under mind control and have been are entire lives. That is the entire point of Mass Media (print, radio, TV, movies, internet), entertainment is just the hook. The flickering image (projector, TV, computer monitor, smartphone, et al.) quickly changes the brainwave state of the viewer and puts us into a semi-hypnotic state where we basically go into &#39;receive only&#39; mode, turning off our critical thinking.</p>

<p>Everyone reading this is still controlled. You&#39;re either aware you are controlled, or just not as controlled as others. As long as you continue to expose yourself to Mass Media the control will continue. Being aware that you&#39;re controlled does not magically make you free, it just means now you know you are a slave. The next step it to free yourself. And it is not easy. In large part because of how thoroughly indoctrinated we all are. The ultimate purpose of mind control is NOT control of the mind and thus the person, the purpose is the suppression of our Spirits. The most accurate Truth detector is the spirit. Our will to live comes from our spirit. Our moral strength resides in the spirit. Thus keeping people spiritually dead, sick, suppressed, or ignorant makes it much easier for the few to rule the many.</p>

<p>I do not consider myself free at this point. Much more free than I was 10, 5, even one 1 ago. But still not there. </p>
