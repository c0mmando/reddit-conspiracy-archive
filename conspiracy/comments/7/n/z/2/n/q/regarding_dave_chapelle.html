        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was a post a few days ago talking about the two new specials Dave Chapelle&#39;s two new specials. Actually two I think. One was referring to alleged pedo symbols in the opening of the first one (which imo, is not just a stretch but just utter bullshit, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m posting). And another one suggesting he was cloned or some shit because people don&#39;t understand how 10 or 15 years Ages a man. I, however have a different take on them that I think is relevant here.</p>

<p>Both specials were fantastic, imo, and MUCH better than the first two (which were also really good). I watched Equanimity last night and was surprised how not just funny, but poignant it was. Today, I watched the other one, in fact I just finished it a few minutes ago, and well..</p>

<p>It&#39;s good. It&#39;s REALLY good. I still maintain that Dave is one of the good guys (so far as anyone in Hollywood can be anyway, but I DO think there&#39;s a few).
In particular, the last 15 minutes of the the second part gave me chills. </p>

<p>Throughout both specials he drops a ton of hints and references to just how much of a fucking cesspool Hollywood is. But the story about the pimp at the end is terrifying, and lays out exactly what many on here talk about when they discuss the kind of staged blackmail the elites use to control people. 
There&#39;s not a lot of laughs in that segment, but telling that story and referring to it as the Capitalist Manifesto is spot on. And for some bonus relevance he also touches on Michael Jackson in one of them, which has also been discussed here lately.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend them both to anyone on this sub, I&#39;m honestly surprised Netflix let him say this stuff; but they&#39;ve slid a handful of gems in there lately (Oliver stone&#39;s show is another one I can&#39;t recommend enough for example). Both specials are FULL of stuff like that. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for shilling for Dave Chapelle, but I honestly do believe they&#39;re both really funny and worth checking out, and wanted to balance out the insanity of the post trying to link him to pedophilia.</p>

<p>I like how he has gotten to the &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck I&#39;ll say what I want&quot; phase. Kinda like the black George Carlin in a way. Dave is a national treasure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree wholeheartedly. You can really tell in this one he&#39;s doing it because he WANTS to. And he made it sound like this is al we&#39;re getting again for a while. Like he had something he had to get out. 
Killing em softly is one of my favorite stand up specials of all time (and I watch a SHITLOAD of stand up), and Equanimity was pretty damn close tbh. I liked the last two but they weren&#39;t quite up there with KES. This time he fucking killed it.</p>

<p>2017 has been a FANTASTIC year for standup on Netflix. There&#39;s been some turds for sure but Patton oswalt, Jim Jeffries, Maria Bamford, Chris Delia, and Dave Chapelle alone made the past year hilarious (bonus points, Maria also references the fact that as an entertainer she is almost entirely paid in blood money as well).</p>

<p>I hate what happened to Louis CK, because while we all knew he was a creep by his own admission, and what he did was undoubtedly creepy, he shouldn&#39;t lose his career. What he did is about on par with Letterman, who apologized just like Louis did, and people LOVED him for his honesty. 
What Louis did was even less terrible, and he&#39;ll likely lose his career because he got lumped in with monsters like Weinstein. It fucking sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check out those other specials. My buddy and I were talking about Dave today and how we think he is the best sketch/stand up comic of our generation.

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. I&#39;m not QUITE as familiar with his sketch work as I am his standup, I didn&#39;t really get into the show until after it was cancelled, but still am a big fan.</p>

<p>Btw. John Mulaney was the other comic I was trying to think of. His newest special is hilarious. It gives a little glimpse into what bill Clinton was like in college too (his parents went to the same school). Spoiler alert: Ol&#39; Slick Willy hasn&#39;t changed much in 40 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was so bad. I actually like Amy Schumer&#39;s EARLY stuff. Then she just got worse and revealed what a one trick pony she jazz but I still gave her a chance because it was funny sometimes..</p>

<p>But I turned on her for good when she straight up plagiarized Kathleen Maddigan&#39;s bit (the food slapper one iirc). </p>

<p>It&#39;s a damn shame that a lot of the big female comics out there have become fucking hacks lately. Because I despise that &quot;women aren&#39;t funny&quot; bullshit and they aren&#39;t helping at all. There are some DAMN funny female comics out there, and it&#39;s bullshit that people like Schumer and Iliza(whose first special was great then she tanked) and Whitney Cummings are the face of female comedy while actually fantastic ones like Kathleen Maddigan, Maria Bamford, and Christina P get totally overlooked. It&#39;s a fucking travesty, because Maria and Christina in particular put out two of the best specials of ANY comic in 2017. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a female comic about 6 months ago that killed it. Found it in Netflix then it was gone last time I looked because I wanted to know her name. Girls are funny but I love this South Park rags on Amy. </p>

<p>My favorite stand up is Robin Williams live on broadway. Saw it when I was like 14 or so and it left a big impression. I miss him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! There&#39;s TONS of great women comics, it really fucking irritates me when people say that shit, because it&#39;s clear that they only watch the BIG comedians if they watch much at all. So then the only exposure they&#39;ve had is someone like amy schumer so they just say they&#39;re all like her.</p>

<p>I mean I realize not everyone is as into stand up as I am(I wanted to do it for years but between my anxiety, my stutter, and the fact that I&#39;m not that funny kinda shut that dream down lol), but still, it&#39;s not that hard to find good ones.</p>

<p>Who tf knows anymore man, it&#39;s hard to put much faith in any public figure these days, but I&#39;ve always felt like comedians are better than actors and shit.

    <div class="md"><p>No you&#39;re 100% right. That was fucking bullshit. I&#39;m not a democrat OR a republican (they&#39;re both too right wing and too rich for me) but Al Franken is one of the only people in congress that I have even a SHRED of respect for. I realize no one is perfect, especially in OUR government, but putting a juvenile, silly (but still obviously inappropriate) thing he did when he was just a comedian before he even ran for senate on the same level as Weinstein is disgusting and totally undermines legitimate sexual assaults to push another fucking partisan agenda.</p>

<p>There is degrees in sex crimes. He was opportunistic, and had a system. Both him and the first Bush use to touch women inappropriately during photos. Which is bad... But sadly 90% of recent accusations are far worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no I hope I didn&#39;t give the impression that what he did was in any way ok at ALL. But it&#39;s definitely orders of magnitude less severe than the others. Funny how a lot of these guys tied up in &quot;menghazi&quot; as I&#39;ve heard it called, are all outspoken Trump supporters. It&#39;s the oldest trick in the CIA/FBI handbook for discrediting dissenters(see MLK). Of course there&#39;s also the fact that the democrats will actually hold their leaders accountable for sexual misconduct(at least some of the time, as opposed to conservatives, which is never), not double down and run them in the Deep South for an easy win.</p>

<p>What he needs to do instead is in 2018, move on.  Put out a new special in whatever why he can.  If Netflix won&#39;t back it, then self-produce it and put it up on YouTube.</p>

<p>Then tour - can&#39;t let them keep you down forever Louis.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve apologized now it&#39;s time to press forward and take back your life.</p>

I&#39;m tired of hearing these types of jokes, because we&#39;ve been hearing them for the last year. But other than that it was an enjoyable standup </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t move to Africa, after these occurrences he wanted to find meaning in what his fight was, roots of truth. My speculation.</p>

<p>He worked and fought hard and long for where he was, so to be shit on like he was is literally being shit on. Self worth goes down the drain.</p>

<p>Dave, Jamie Foxx, Wayne Brady, Dwayne Johnson, name them... every black actor in Hollywood in the Las 20-30 years now has been forced to play a role where they get to act out the subservient, tutu wearing gutter slut. Cuz that&#39;s all they are to them. Same shit has happened to a number of white male actors also.</p>

<p>Only one reason for it, they don&#39;t want to play their games; they want to do the works they were meant to do and some leeches just want to use them.</p>

<p>If anyone who reads this has an appreciation for comedy and can also read between the lines...</p>

<p>A comedy show by the name of &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Watch just a few episodes.</p>

<p>Tell its the same reason MadTV got cancelled.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the only mainstream comedy show left? SNL? And listen to what every single person to grace their stage has to say about its &quot;creator&quot; &quot;Lorne Michaels&quot;.</p>

<p>What a game...</p>

<p>O.P you know you saw it too and your first thought was &quot;coincidence&quot; cuz we assume if it were intentional it could only mean Dave is no longer a good guy in our eyes. However, I believe it to be intential as a symbol for &quot;I know we all know&quot; </p>

<p>It is a very prominent symbol but more so than being a symbol of PG shit, its also a triangle, or pyramid, the ultimate symbol of horded knowledge and the power that it brings.</p>

<p>Listen, Dave&#39;s Iceberg story was him explaining he ran away to Africa because he basically was going to be &quot;initiated&quot; and we know how they &quot;initiate&quot; people. Blackmail pictures, shit eating, gay orgies, sacrifices, whatever.</p>

<p>He split, cuz they were trying to indenture him into the servitude of the &quot;X&quot; and he left. &quot;What of the rapes aren&#39;t the worst of it?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with the rest of what you saidC but I just don&#39;t see it. Concentric triangles have been around as symbols for millennia, and the one in the special is as different as it can be while still being a triangle.</p>

<p>I swear I&#39;m not trying to be intentionally contrarian or anything. And while I think PG is bullshit I 100% believe in some seriously messed up shit (pedophilia, black magick/Saturn shit) happening among the elite, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s happening in Comet&#39;s basement. And I think a lot of the symbols people are seeing  EVERYWHERE  are coincidental. There&#39;s only so many shapes and symbols, and especially the simple ones like the triangle.</p>

<p>But brooooooh, like the symbol itself is crazy how related it is to the talent, bookers, artists and stuff related to comet. Like I know you said you&#39;re not really into the comet aspect of elite trafficking, but if you want to take a look at this <a href="https://youtu.be/P8urOO0d7n8">documentary</a> this guy goes into it beautifully how its all connected.

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely does show up in a lot of places. And James Alefantis is creepy as FUCK, as are obviously the podestas. That&#39;s the thing with PG that makes me not trust it the most, is that there ARE a lot of truths buried in there, but there&#39;s also a lot of ridiculous shit too. </p>

<p>The whole thing&#39;s to me seems like a psyop at best. It did a LOT of damage to the conspiracy community, both as far as adding even MORE stigma to literally any non mainstream opinion, but it has also divided the community so badly that everyone is constantly at each other&#39;s throats and shit.
If any of us were, in fact, getting close to something, starting something like PG worked perfectly in so many ways.  It also takes any heat off the actual pedo networks that no one will take seriously anymore. Even with the Hollywood shit, all anyone is talking about is groping or abusing power, never mind the RAMPANT sexual abuse of child stars.

I am a stand-up connoisseur (for whatever that&#39;s worth) and I am &quot;woke&quot; for whatever that&#39;s worth. I can tell you unequivocally that that is not Dave Chappelle. (Forget the 40 lbs of muscle, and a voice that sounds like he has been smoking for 75 years and the blatant attempt to cover his tracks by smoking on stage GTFO)  I mean is he is really into fitness now or is he smoking ungodly amounts of cigarettes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt Dave Chapelle is not a bad guy, and that&#39;s why Hollywood ruined his career.</p>

<p>Someone posted another thread from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nzo4l/katt_williams_tells_what_really_happened_to_dave/">Katt Williams talking about what happened to Chapelle</a>, and its pretty revealing.</p>

<p>The story about the pimp at the end of The Bird Revelation when put into context with what Katt Williams said makes a lot of sense. Basically Chappelle was the prostitute in that story, and Hollywood was the pimp.</p>

<p>Imagine making your &quot;pimp&quot; half a billion dollars, and their fucking offer to you is 10% for $50 million after the fact to continue to keep making them even more money. All so they could continue to control him, censor his shows and movies, make him dress up like a woman, and humiliate himself in ways he wasn&#39;t comfortable with.</p>

<p>Then when he didn&#39;t play ball, they just made shit up about him to the point where he literally left his family behind and had to escape the country because the brainwashed masses actually believed what the media said about him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how fucked the media, and Hollywood is. They made an example of him and ruined his career merely because he asked for a fair cut of the profits, and didn&#39;t want to humiliate himself for money anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood has always functioned as an arm of the US government, and been responsible for propaganda and pushing different social norms.</p>

<p>Hollywood = propaganda arm of the Deep State.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley = tech arm of the Deep State.</p>

<p>Defense contractors = defense arm of the Deep State.</p>

<p>Bankers = Finance arm of the Deep State.</p>

<p>Politicians = Political arm of the Deep State.</p>

<p>The one thing all of these people have in common is that the upper echelons of these groups are all members of the same elite who govern our reality. Some of them have unusual religious beliefs and practice satanic rituals, are members of secret societies, etc. Others are just power hungry, greedy, and sociopathic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! I couldn&#39;t agree with you more, just finished watching the two specials and I was amazed at how great of a comedian and story teller Dave Chapelle is. All the while as I was laughing I couldn&#39;t help but think that there is a lot of truth to what he was saying. Of course all good jokes have a bit of truth but Dave Chapelle gave off this vibe of a deeper truth he was not able to release in a short comedy special. Theres something about these two specials that I cant pin point exactly but Dave knows something and I can only imagine what kind of things he&#39;s experienced in the deep inner workings of Hollywood. </p>
