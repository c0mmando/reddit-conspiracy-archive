       There was a post a few days ago talking about the two new specials Dave Chapelle's two new specials. Actually two I think. One was referring to alleged pedo symbols in the opening of the first one (which imo, is not just a stretch but just utter bullshit, but that's not why I'm posting). And another one suggesting he was cloned or some shit because people don't understand how 10 or 15 years Ages a man. I, however have a different take on them that I think is relevant here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both specials were fantastic, imo, and MUCH better than the first two (which were also really good). I watched Equanimity last night and was surprised how not just funny, but poignant it was. Today, I watched the other one, in fact I just finished it a few minutes ago, and well..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good. It's REALLY good. I still maintain that Dave is one of the good guys (so far as anyone in Hollywood can be anyway, but I DO think there's a few).
In particular, the last 15 minutes of the the second part gave me chills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout both specials he drops a ton of hints and references to just how much of a fucking cesspool Hollywood is. But the story about the pimp at the end is terrifying, and lays out exactly what many on here talk about when they discuss the kind of staged blackmail the elites use to control people. 
There's not a lot of laughs in that segment, but telling that story and referring to it as the Capitalist Manifesto is spot on. And for some bonus relevance he also touches on Michael Jackson in one of them, which has also been discussed here lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would definitely recommend them both to anyone on this sub, I'm honestly surprised Netflix let him say this stuff; but they've slid a handful of gems in there lately (Oliver stone's show is another one I can't recommend enough for example). Both specials are FULL of stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, sorry for shilling for Dave Chapelle, but I honestly do believe they're both really funny and worth checking out, and wanted to balance out the insanity of the post trying to link him to pedophilia.

       I watched Equanimity last night also and plan on watching the 2nd one tonight as well. I like Dave because he speaks the truth but does it in a way that most people don't realize its not part of a bit until the bit is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like how he has gotten to the "I don't give a fuck I'll say what I want" phase. Kinda like the black George Carlin in a way. Dave is a national treasure.

       I agree wholeheartedly. You can really tell in this one he's doing it because he WANTS to. And he made it sound like this is al we're getting again for a while. Like he had something he had to get out. 
Killing em softly is one of my favorite stand up specials of all time (and I watch a SHITLOAD of stand up), and Equanimity was pretty damn close tbh. I liked the last two but they weren't quite up there with KES. This time he fucking killed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2017 has been a FANTASTIC year for standup on Netflix. There's been some turds for sure but Patton oswalt, Jim Jeffries, Maria Bamford, Chris Delia, and Dave Chapelle alone made the past year hilarious (bonus points, Maria also references the fact that as an entertainer she is almost entirely paid in blood money as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate what happened to Louis CK, because while we all knew he was a creep by his own admission, and what he did was undoubtedly creepy, he shouldn't lose his career. What he did is about on par with Letterman, who apologized just like Louis did, and people LOVED him for his honesty. 
What Louis did was even less terrible, and he'll likely lose his career because he got lumped in with monsters like Weinstein. It fucking sucks.

       I'll check out those other specials. My buddy and I were talking about Dave today and how we think he is the best sketch/stand up comic of our generation. Chappelle show still holds up and is fucking hysterical. I mean he did Clayton Bigsby as his VERY FIRST sketch! How ballsy was that?

       Gotcha. I'm not QUITE as familiar with his sketch work as I am his standup, I didn't really get into the show until after it was cancelled, but still am a big fan.

       Btw. John Mulaney was the other comic I was trying to think of. His newest special is hilarious. It gives a little glimpse into what bill Clinton was like in college too (his parents went to the same school). Spoiler alert: Ol' Slick Willy hasn't changed much in 40 years.

       It was so bad. I actually like Amy Schumer's EARLY stuff. Then she just got worse and revealed what a one trick pony she jazz but I still gave her a chance because it was funny sometimes..
      </p>
      <p>
       But I turned on her for good when she straight up plagiarized Kathleen Maddigan's bit (the food slapper one iirc).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a damn shame that a lot of the big female comics out there have become fucking hacks lately. Because I despise that "women aren't funny" bullshit and they aren't helping at all. There are some DAMN funny female comics out there, and it's bullshit that people like Schumer and Iliza(whose first special was great then she tanked) and Whitney Cummings are the face of female comedy while actually fantastic ones like Kathleen Maddigan, Maria Bamford, and Christina P get totally overlooked. It's a fucking travesty, because Maria and Christina in particular put out two of the best specials of ANY comic in 2017.

       I watched a female comic about 6 months ago that killed it. Found it in Netflix then it was gone last time I looked because I wanted to know her name. Girls are funny but I love this South Park rags on Amy.

       My favorite stand up is Robin Williams live on broadway. Saw it when I was like 14 or so and it left a big impression. I miss him.

       Exactly! There's TONS of great women comics, it really fucking irritates me when people say that shit, because it's clear that they only watch the BIG comedians if they watch much at all. So then the only exposure they've had is someone like amy schumer so they just say they're all like her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I realize not everyone is as into stand up as I am(I wanted to do it for years but between my anxiety, my stutter, and the fact that I'm not that funny kinda shut that dream down lol), but still, it's not that hard to find good ones.

       Just finished the other Chappell. Some was the bottom bitch and he didn't fall for it. At least that's how I took it. But that was a very real stand up. I liked it a lot.

       Who tf knows anymore man, it's hard to put much faith in any public figure these days, but I've always felt like comedians are better than actors and shit. But maybe I'm just biased because I've always been obsessed with standup and comedians are the only celebrities I follow.

       No you're 100% right. That was fucking bullshit. I'm not a democrat OR a republican (they're both too right wing and too rich for me) but Al Franken is one of the only people in congress that I have even a SHRED of respect for. I realize no one is perfect, especially in OUR government, but putting a juvenile, silly (but still obviously inappropriate) thing he did when he was just a comedian before he even ran for senate on the same level as Weinstein is disgusting and totally undermines legitimate sexual assaults to push another fucking partisan agenda.

       I used to love what Al Franken brought to politics. Very plain spoken and great at calling out BS.

       There is degrees in sex crimes. He was opportunistic, and had a system. Both him and the first Bush use to touch women inappropriately during photos. Which is bad... But sadly 90% of recent accusations are far worse.

       Oh no I hope I didn't give the impression that what he did was in any way ok at ALL. But it's definitely orders of magnitude less severe than the others. Funny how a lot of these guys tied up in "menghazi" as I've heard it called, are all outspoken Trump supporters. It's the oldest trick in the CIA/FBI handbook for discrediting dissenters(see MLK). Of course there's also the fact that the democrats will actually hold their leaders accountable for sexual misconduct(at least some of the time, as opposed to conservatives, which is never), not double down and run them in the Deep South for an easy win.

       Louie could come back. But much of what made him a star, was how self realized he was with his personal hang ups.

       Now I think the awkwardness might be something he gets off on. And I feel a little weird about being included in that.

       Louis isn't going to lose his career.  IMO he's playing right into the hands of the people that want to destroy him.  Fuck them.

      <p>
       What he needs to do instead is in 2018, move on.  Put out a new special in whatever why he can.  If Netflix won't back it, then self-produce it and put it up on YouTube.

       I definitely agree. I hate that it seems like he's going back under the radar now but at the same time 4 specials In one year is fucking PROLIFIC. People say Louis is a machine doing one a year, so that shows just how much Dave is a whole level above even the best out there.

       There is a part in the second one where he actually says that there are far worse things in Hollywood happening than the sex scandals currently leaking, but he says he's not gonna talk about it... seriously what did he know/see that made him walk away from that kind of money/power/fame? I think he is a good person at heart and walked away when he discovered  some truly fucked up shit.

       They were gonna try and black mail him. They were threatening his family by sending him pictures of his children sleeping. My guess is it got to a point where they told him they were gonna kill him or his, unless he took a comprising photo. At which point he called their bluff and as soon as he made it out of wherever that meeting took place, "bye nigga! Goin' to Africa!" as only Dave could.

       That write-up is, as far as I have heard, a confirmed bogus story. However, it is so incredibly well-written that it's hard not to think there is some truth in it.

       I agree. I think part of the recent Chapelle smear campaign is the fact that he disses Trump in his new special, and some of the folks here can't comprehend that, even though he had a message of unity in his special. It seemed to go over their heads, blinded by partisan/demagogue support.

       You're absolutely right. He had one hell
Of a message at the beginning of Equanimity about the media fanning the flames and dividing people and fearmongering. Making people think there's a literal war between the basement dwelling Nazis and the basement dwelling antifas  when in reality any given "conflict" irl is like 23 people total.

       The only thing I didn't like about him talking about  Trump, was that several months ago he said he wasn't touching that subject because it's been overplayed by other comedians and that it was just too easy (which I think is true). 
I'm tired of hearing these types of jokes, because we've been hearing them for the last year. But other than that it was an enjoyable standup

       I think the smear campaign occurred when he suggested he was going to give Trump a chance and we should too. He got eaten alive and mentioned that in his new specials. I think you're seeing the result of him wanting to keep his business.

       Well, he did travel Africa; and if I recall correctly that was also around the time certain groups attempted to throw shit in his General direction.

       One thing I did miss watching these new performances...
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't do it with the same gumption or umpf that he usually had done. That's what made me say "matured"; that he's beyond the "I'm gonna do it because yall need to know and I am pleased to do it"; to more of a "I don't give a fuck, I've seen it, now I know it's true, they've tried to pull shit, and trust me when I say fuck off."

       what was the sequence of events that lead Dave to move to Africa?

       He didn't move to Africa, after these occurrences he wanted to find meaning in what his fight was, roots of truth. My speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       He worked and fought hard and long for where he was, so to be shit on like he was is literally being shit on. Self worth goes down the drain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave, Jamie Foxx, Wayne Brady, Dwayne Johnson, name them... every black actor in Hollywood in the Las 20-30 years now has been forced to play a role where they get to act out the subservient, tutu wearing gutter slut. Cuz that's all they are to them. Same shit has happened to a number of white male actors also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only one reason for it, they don't want to play their games; they want to do the works they were meant to do and some leeches just want to use them.

       If anyone who reads this has an appreciation for comedy and can also read between the lines...

       A comedy show by the name of "In Living Color". Watch just a few episodes.

       Tell its the same reason MadTV got cancelled.

       There weren't. But someone posted yesterday about the beginning where they have the animation overlay with that 90s motif and tried to twist it into pedo shit even though it was backwards, and still not quite the same; and only there for had a second, and mixed in with a hundred other squiggles and shapes.
Just more PG fearmongering. Dave Chapelle definitely isn't into that shit, especially considering what he talks about in the SAME FUCKING SPECIAL. He clearly isn't on the same side as them...

       Arguably a boy lover logo. It was just Dave showing us he knows too. Or a stylistic design reminiscent of early 90's a la "Do the Right Thing"
      </p>
      <p>
       O.P you know you saw it too and your first thought was "coincidence" cuz we assume if it were intentional it could only mean Dave is no longer a good guy in our eyes. However, I believe it to be intential as a symbol for "I know we all know"
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a very prominent symbol but more so than being a symbol of PG shit, its also a triangle, or pyramid, the ultimate symbol of horded knowledge and the power that it brings.

       I think the symbols were done intentionally but not cuz Dave is a pedo or whatever. He knows he's loved in the conspiracy community. He probs did it as a little "We both know, you know what I've known"
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, Dave's Iceberg story was him explaining he ran away to Africa because he basically was going to be "initiated" and we know how they "initiate" people. Blackmail pictures, shit eating, gay orgies, sacrifices, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       He split, cuz they were trying to indenture him into the servitude of the "X" and he left. "What of the rapes aren't the worst of it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave is well aware of the "X" Those symbols were intentional.

       I totally agree with the rest of what you saidC but I just don't see it. Concentric triangles have been around as symbols for millennia, and the one in the special is as different as it can be while still being a triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear I'm not trying to be intentionally contrarian or anything. And while I think PG is bullshit I 100% believe in some seriously messed up shit (pedophilia, black magick/Saturn shit) happening among the elite, I just don't think it's happening in Comet's basement. And I think a lot of the symbols people are seeing  EVERYWHERE  are coincidental. There's only so many shapes and symbols, and especially the simple ones like the triangle.

       Of course I COULD be wrong, but I really hope I'm not.

       You're not being contrarian. My Very first thought when I saw it was "you know what that is" then my next was "its just a symbol" then it was "Dave is woke, he knows someone will pick up on that".
      </p>
      <p>
       But brooooooh, like the symbol itself is crazy how related it is to the talent, bookers, artists and stuff related to comet. Like I know you said you're not really into the comet aspect of elite trafficking, but if you want to take a look at this

       this guy goes into it beautifully how its all connected. Between 24 and 29 min all he does is bring up where the symbol can be seen. Its compelling and I leave it for you if you wanna check it out.

       It definitely does show up in a lot of places. And James Alefantis is creepy as FUCK, as are obviously the podestas. That's the thing with PG that makes me not trust it the most, is that there ARE a lot of truths buried in there, but there's also a lot of ridiculous shit too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing's to me seems like a psyop at best. It did a LOT of damage to the conspiracy community, both as far as adding even MORE stigma to literally any non mainstream opinion, but it has also divided the community so badly that everyone is constantly at each other's throats and shit.
If any of us were, in fact, getting close to something, starting something like PG worked perfectly in so many ways.  It also takes any heat off the actual pedo networks that no one will take seriously anymore. Even with the Hollywood shit, all anyone is talking about is groping or abusing power, never mind the RAMPANT sexual abuse of child stars. Just like how flat earth takes the heat off of all NASAs shady doings.

       Ahhh that final thing you said. Bout nasa and flat earth. Okay that finally makes it click a little how it "could" be a psyop, but personally why would they choose something like occult worship and child torture/trafficking? Kinda hits a little close to home don't you think? I don't think Pizza gate has hurt the "conspiracy community" cuz that's like not even real. Were unorganized "theorists" of a vast diversity.  If anything over the past two years I have found people in the real world challenging their views more than ever. I brought up pizzagate at work once and have showed the video I linked you to. Vegas is a good waking up point for people too. I don't think we are discredited. "We" don't exist.

       While you know there's no we, and I know that, the unwashed masses don't. And what the psyop does is lump ALL of us, JFK theorists, 9/11 truthers, SSP believers, etc in with flat earth, pg, literal reptilians, etc. to them we're all one group and we all believe all this shit because that's what the news tells them. At least that's how it seems from what I've seen. You can't even talk to these people about PROVEN shit like the Business Plot or the Lusitania because they'll even lump that stuff in with FE. Basically, people are fucking stupid.

       Yea honestly that's on them. People that get all their info from legacy media are fucking stupid. Anyone who has chosen they want information given to them, as opposed to finding it, and those who choose to stereotype are already not on the side of intelligent discussion.

       True. It does make participating in civilized society require a bit more caution. Fortunately I don't do a lot of that these days haha but I've still learned to keep my mouth shut for the most part.

       Isn't it a shame how political correctness has killed discussion of basically everything in this country? I have taken a new policy that really shined over this last holiday. I've got a "Seattle" relative and I knew basically anything i said would piss her off cuz
       <a href="https://youtu.be/D-3Y3NDCT-Y">
        I'm a white male
       </a>
       So the second she started talking about how oppressed she was as a rich white woman i ran down my whole "men aren't even men anymore cuz fluoride" theory. Basically if you know someone can't "handle" what you have to say, go full Ted Gunderson on them. Uhhhh maybe not at work. Anywhere else though. Because someone who can't "deal" with "the possibility" of "ideas" is a zombie, and not even worth your time.

       Ill take the bait. He is controlled opposition. His shit is not as funny as it was, and if you watched it with eyes closed and without the mystique of what you think Dave Chapelle should be, you might agree. Your expectations are outrunning your neutrality.
       <br/>
       I am a stand-up connoisseur (for whatever that's worth) and I am "woke" for whatever that's worth. I can tell you unequivocally that that is not Dave Chappelle. (Forget the 40 lbs of muscle, and a voice that sounds like he has been smoking for 75 years and the blatant attempt to cover his tracks by smoking on stage GTFO)  I mean is he is really into fitness now or is he smoking ungodly amounts of cigarettes?

       Have you ever known someone his age over a period of 15 years? I've seen much more drastic changes in my own family members, former coworkers, etc.
Anythings possible though I guess. There's not much I fully believe OR discount these days. My beliefs kinda change depending on the situation (I've gotten pretty good at it over the past year, it makes for some fascinating thought exercises).

       Dave Chappelle played (la)Keith Stanfield's role in GET OUT. (Nosebleed scene at Garden party, the iconic, title sequence, yes, that man looking in the camera, definitely Dave Chappelle- interesting because his friend Jordan Peele made the movie and I said "hey that's dave" even before I knew that... AND maybe Dave Chappelle is (la)keith stanfield all the time 100%, I'm not sure. (Check out his twitter. sometimes he is LaKeith, sometimes just Keith....)

       I have no doubt Dave Chapelle is not a bad guy, and that's why Hollywood ruined his career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted another thread from
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nzo4l/katt_williams_tells_what_really_happened_to_dave/">
        Katt Williams talking about what happened to Chapelle
       </a>
       , and its pretty revealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story about the pimp at the end of The Bird Revelation when put into context with what Katt Williams said makes a lot of sense. Basically Chappelle was the prostitute in that story, and Hollywood was the pimp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine making your "pimp" half a billion dollars, and their fucking offer to you is 10% for $50 million after the fact to continue to keep making them even more money. All so they could continue to control him, censor his shows and movies, make him dress up like a woman, and humiliate himself in ways he wasn't comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when he didn't play ball, they just made shit up about him to the point where he literally left his family behind and had to escape the country because the brainwashed masses actually believed what the media said about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how fucked the media, and Hollywood is. They made an example of him and ruined his career merely because he asked for a fair cut of the profits, and didn't want to humiliate himself for money anymore.

       Exactly. I actually referenced that video here earlier. I saw it like 10 minutes after I posted this thread. Gotta love synchronicity lol.
They did the same shit to Michael Jackson and I'm sure some others too. Britney Spears comes to mind.

       But how did hollywood GET so fucked up? That's the real question. Is it just what happens in all somewhat inclusive circles where there's a lot of $ and greed? Or is something else (demonic worship/rituals/black magic) going on? the more i read, the more likely it seems to become that a lot of Hollywood's power comes from some kind of magically obtained means.

       Hollywood has always functioned as an arm of the US government, and been responsible for propaganda and pushing different social norms.

      <p>
       Hollywood = propaganda arm of the Deep State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silicon Valley = tech arm of the Deep State.

       Defense contractors = defense arm of the Deep State.

      <p>
       Politicians = Political arm of the Deep State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing all of these people have in common is that the upper echelons of these groups are all members of the same elite who govern our reality. Some of them have unusual religious beliefs and practice satanic rituals, are members of secret societies, etc. Others are just power hungry, greedy, and sociopathic.

       It isn't magic, just exploitation of human psychology.

       Great post! I couldn't agree with you more, just finished watching the two specials and I was amazed at how great of a comedian and story teller Dave Chapelle is. All the while as I was laughing I couldn't help but think that there is a lot of truth to what he was saying. Of course all good jokes have a bit of truth but Dave Chapelle gave off this vibe of a deeper truth he was not able to release in a short comedy special. Theres something about these two specials that I cant pin point exactly but Dave knows something and I can only imagine what kind of things he's experienced in the deep inner workings of Hollywood.

       I got the same vibe. Something shook him.  I really hope he's through the worst of it. I stopped calling randy quaid crazy some time ago. I'd fear for myself and my family's safety in Daves position.

       Did you guys see the Kat Williams video about Dave Chappell? It’s a short interview but gives more light on it than Dave likes to talk about. In short they tried to renew him for another season but said he only gets 10% of all profits. They told him if he refused, he would be called a crack head world wide before the time he gets back to Ohio. He refused it and the media said he went crazy and smokes crack..all within the time he was on the plane.

       Yeah. Part of the problem is that the media wants to portray him as being "on their team", they'll try to make a mountain out of any molehill when the guy's a comedian. How are you not able to crack a few Trump jokes if your job is comedian?

       Dave is red-pilled for sure and he's got his hilarious take on things. It is good that we have him as yet another prong into the Hollywood beast.

       Crazy how everyone is giving him negative reviews.  The stillbirth and braindead The Last Jedi is a sweep with the critics but the New York Times finds one of their most eloquent writers to tear Chappelle down in a long winded essay calling him a reactionary sexist, which is the opposite of his message and definition of irony.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are just trying to get people not to watch it, because if they do they will know exactly why the press is trying to suppress his message.

       Exactly. And I think he explained the situation about his "transphobia" pretty well.  But his message about unity and the media dividing us is definitely not going to be a hit with them.

       I made that post about the symbols in the intro of one of his specials and for the record I love Dave Chappelle and hope he isn't involved in anything nefarious.

      <p>
       The symbols could easily be him hinting at something around him or they could be random doodles who knows.

       Idk about Mulaney, I'd see him as closeted before a pedo. Nick Kroll definitely is creepy af though.

       Who tf knows anymore man, it's hard to put much faith in any public figure these days, but I've always felt like comedians are better than actors and shit. But maybe I'm just biased because I've always been obsessed with standup and comedians are the only celebrities I follow.

       Exactly! There's TONS of great women comics, it really fucking irritates me when people say that shit, because it's clear that they only watch the BIG comedians if they watch much at all. So then the only exposure they've had is someone like amy schumer so they just say they're all like her.

       I mean I realize not everyone is as into stand up as I am(I wanted to do it for years but between my anxiety, my stutter, and the fact that I'm not that funny kinda shut that dream down lol), but still, it's not that hard to find good ones.

       Had to shut off the John Mulaney Netflix standup. So obvious he was normalizing the sexualization of children. Hate him now.
