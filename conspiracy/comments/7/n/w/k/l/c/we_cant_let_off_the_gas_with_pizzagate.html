       Pizzagate was our battering ram. We have poured into the castle of Satanic Ritual Abuse and the castle is falling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the vampiric lords of Castle Satan have infected some of our own soldiers and the besiegers are now the besieged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this a lot for a lot of reasons but it holds the most weight here
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The only way out, is in.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot allow pizzagate to be lost amid the plethora of sexual scandals, as the Harvey Weinstein scandal and others are possibly there to muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children are being brutalized by our elected officials and our wealthy class. We
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       stop them. If we can’t do that, then we have failed our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is more sacred then the safety of children. Their good nature is the only hope we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I beg you to not give up on them.

       Your question is nonsensical. Obviauoly pizzagate was attacked from every angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should check out the list of sex trafficking rings that have been taken down in the last year. Literally thousands of adults have been arrested and thousands of children freed, mostly in the US and Canada.

       So no "Satanic Ritual Abuse" victims, witnesses or arrests thanks to pizzagate?
       <a href="http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/police-brothers-in-their-70s-80s-arrested-in-child-sex-abuse-investigation/596258669">
        I can throw you a bone and tell you that three elderly brothers in Seatle were arrested for something like this
       </a>
       , but no pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you bringing up arrests that have no connection to "Satanic Ritual Abuse" and pizzagate? There are thousands of arrests for those sorts of crimes every single year, mainly Johns who get caught by large sting operations and "trafficking" is rarely as exciting as it sounds. It can mean as little as driving a prostitute to a client or booking a room. Thousands of children haven't been freed, not even thousands of underage prostitutes.

       There are many victims that have come forward in fact voat even has a thread dedicated to victims. Unfortunately their stories are traumatizing and hard to believe that someone could survive that. So many victims prefer annonymity so they are not ridiculed or accused of lying. Victims are everywhere I can name ten off the top of my head.

       I think it's that most people aren't even clear on what "pizzagate" covers.  If it covers "politicians fucking children," then there's a lot of documented evidence for that.  Anthony Wiener sent a 15 year old his dick for God's sake.  You don't remember that?

       Well since you read all 33,000 of them..

      <p>
       “We have five fresh pizzas for your enjoyment, with for leftover pizzas for your enjoyment, they are in poor health and probably won’t survive. When you’re finished with your session you can eat your pizzas.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So, after reading 33,000 emails (bullcrap) you don’t think it’s weird that more often than not our political leaders are taking about pizza?
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget about child abuse, their obsession with pizza would be just as much worthy of talking about even if
       <em>
        they weren’t raping and killing little kids

       Don't forget the handkerchiefs too. That's the real evidence. That's the key ingredient to the spirit cooking. Cheese Pizza (a 4chan term) mixed with a little secret wifi tunnel, add a dash of paintings that make my feefees tingle, the zest of one handkerchief, and at least a healthy neckbeard portion of homophobia. That's how you get a spirit stew going baby!

       Now let's all watch &amp; wait as a random skeptic comes in and, point by point, pretends to refute all of this evidence. Then they'll go back to saying "just
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       evidence. just one piece!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then someone will post these emails again. And they'll deny again, going back to saying there's literally no evidence. Then people will post this again &amp;amp; again. Keep claiming there's no evidence guys, it's probably the absolute worst tactic you could use because it's blatantly obvious that evidence exists.

       Okay sorry, you were the first person who said anything supportive. How has it gotten like this? They must have done an incredible job. Seriously, I didn’t even have an account, I saw pizzagate here and it inspired me. I have been more vocal about this stuff than ever. I do not understand how, if these people are real ^ they discount it so fervently.

       Some don't want to believe it is a real possibility. Imagine the cognitive dissonance taking place. It isn't hard to understand why some might genuinely not believe too.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some of the opposition to pizzagate might have been paid I don't believe all of it to be so. It would be asinine to think so. People for whatever reason want to believe the best in others.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will literally take graphic detailed evidence to convince some people that it is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to also understand that the topic at hand can sound extremely absurd to an individual that couldn't fathom that kind of cruelty.  (it is in their innocences) They can't be faulted for not being able to imagine what you describe.  What pizzagate illustrates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fault those that can't believe. If you believe is it enough? If you can find truth and expose that evidence. Wouldn't that be enough. Don't place your mind where it can't help. Don't condemn your fellow brothers and sisters for their ignorance.

       Yep anyone can see that. Pizzagate is the big one and that's why there is so much resistence to it. To anyone who has spent the time looking, it's painfully obvious. It's painfully obvious just based on the the panic it has caused. Reddit was taken over last year and has become a huge propaganda machine. But what is right is right and the floodgates are open. It's just gonna take time. Many out there who are involved know it's real, no amount of shilling is going to change it. Just gotta keep pressing on.

       Oh, the children my ass.  You know damn well it was never about the kids.  Pizzagaters just desperately want to be a part of the heroic detective team that takes down Hillary and company.  They hate her and her crew so much that they aren't even able to entertain the notion of a reality in which they're wrong about these people being Devil-worshipping child rapists or whatever.  It's a completely politically-motivated witch hunt with zero direct evidence to support any of these accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the partisan agenda became even more incredibly transparent when the PizzaParty supersleuths were the same ones relentlessly defending real creeps like Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who have real-life human beings who have called them out for sexual harassment and assault of minors.

       Ok look, I was making fun before, but that's not because of the issue at hand.  It's just this post.  If there's an actual pizzagate going on, I'd love to hear more about it.  However, as someone who is not about to start nosing around the deep web or anything, all I'm seeing is insane catcalls about the basement of a place that has no basement and their only real crime seems to be allowing BDSM groups to host parties long after the kids have all gone home.  I've seen pictures of the inside and it all looks fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then all that seems to be counterarguing this viewpoint is some edited 4chan giggles such as the pizza metaphor email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I haven't been in this sub my whole time on Reddit, but I've been lurking a long while because of one simple truth:  "Even if the media admitted that the government had been hiding aliens this whole time, r/conspiracy would doubt it and demand evidence."  There's been many versions of the joke over time, but it's still true.  I've never seen the sub as a place where you absolutely must believe every single wacky tidbit that gets tossed over the fence.  Rather I've seen it as people looking for
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       .  To that end, they will hold you to the same standard as they do anything else they read.  They, myself included, want concrete.  You're up against critical thinkers, and the bread and butter of critical thinking is skepticism.  They're challenging the narrative on a daily basis, and so why would they not do the same to you?  Granted, the sub has seriously gained popularity and now there's a ton of left/right finger-wagging apologists in here, but at its core you'll still find the people I'm talking about.  Those people want to see documentation.  This goes especially for lazy ones like me who know to challenge the narrative but don't have the energy or means to go digging around and are simply hoping you'll provide the support for your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all I'm asking is that you do just that.  If you want me to take this post seriously, I'd like new information.  I want something more concrete than some weird art in Podesta's house and the fact that coworkers might schedule pool party playdates for their kids.  However, you didn't provide that.  You just tell people to go do their own research and attack them.  Call me a normie or whatever you want, but this is a great opportunity for you.  Here I am, a critical thinker, ready to believe you.  You can lay it out in a way that is done better than it was before by others, or you can yell at me to go look it up and start namecalling.  Your move.

       These people, if what I and other’s are saying is indeed factual, are master manipulators. The whole child abuse thing is just the surface. Frankly, I don’t have the stomach or the time to go hold your hand as we go detail by detail in this investigation. I’m also not tech savvy so it takes an enormous effort on my part to put together sources that would quench your thirst.

       I assure you, the dots are there to be connected. These people ritually kill (not just children) because they think it brings them closer to their dark, ancient gods.

       This isn't an open forum investigation or badges coming together.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not going to get the evidence you want because it is either being held by the CPP business, under very tight wraps, or it's in contained evidence not for the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to find some you can do it on your own.  I would start looking at DC metro police kickbacks and their service records.  See how they lie up with particular businesses and names.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also start with studying how international organized crime works and how business works with a means for pushing a market that is discreetly available.  Your clientele is going to be selected carefully and controlled.  Your product is also secret and controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will warn you though.  These business do not light the spotlight and will do what is necessary to fix the problem.

       See that's just it.  You want me to go find things and I don't have the energy even if I had the ways and means, which I do not.  You're just a second source that tells me to go find it myself.  Well... no.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a perfect opportunity here to bring a "normie" into the light, ready to believe ready-handed information, but all you two are doing so far is telling me that I need to go find my own shit and that I probably won't find any.  If this whole mess can only be seen by those both obsessive and capable enough to find even the shreds of hints that it's going on, what are you even doing here?  The results of your efforts will be nothing better than any of these other fake news outrages, because I can't see a proper trail of information and, even then, have no idea how to take action against it.  So you're just asking me to believe you with nothing to go on that this is a definitely real thing... and be fruitlessly mad about said thing.

       Why am I being targeted do you think? I’ll be honest I’m quite the activist in real life.. do you think they somehow have knowledge of who I am? Or is pizzagate just that much of a buzzword?

       I think it's the subject matter really. Pixzagate is a trigger word; it's the batman signal for paid disinformants. Every PG thread nowadays is flooded with the exact same comments you see here, which is an incredible contrast to these threads last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't worry too much about being targeted unless they're following you around in every thread and harrassing you and even then it's just shitty folks being shitty. TMOR apparently does target users in this sub, but I don't read that garbage because it reflects on the poor character of those who post there. Stay safe and stay on track

       I mean, you could find solid new objective evidence instead of regurgitating the same old, made up, or misinterpreted, or flat out debunked speculation that is pizzagate as we know it today. You could acknowledge that sexual assault happens in all strata of society and instead of playing keyboard detective and reading right wing conspiracy blogs hoping to find that one clue that is going to take down the wealthy/political elite/zionist-jewish/satanist/illuminati cabal that "controls it all," you could, in the spirit of what pizzagate has opened your eyes too in regards to sexual assault, go vonlunteer down at your local women's shelter where actual victims os sexual assault need assistance. There are many ways to keep the "spirit of pizzagate" alive, but sitting in a vacuum chamber on the likes of here or 4chan isn't the right way to do it.Getting out there and helping actual victims in your community is how you help.

       What "creepy ass" emails? Most likely they fall into the misinterpreted category. You tell me the emails and I can talk about them more. The only ones I hear peple repeatedly call "creepy" are the one where a grandma is  inviting friends to visit her farm house in which she mentions thatnthey will heat the pool for swimmimg and that her grandkids will be comingbto play in the pool. Oh, she says they will be entertainment. RED ALERT RED ALERT!!! No, not really. It is a grandma doting over her grandkids. Not sure where you are in your life, but for a lot of us we grow to a point where our family is our entertainment. I know in my family most of the time spent is paying attention tonthe littlest ones. That's just how it goes in families. We find our grandkids, nieces, nephews, etc., entertaining. There is nothing sexual about it. The other email I hear mentioned that is so "creepy" is the "infamous" pizza related map email. As they say the simplest  answer is usually the correct answer. Pizza is fucking good and there quite a few places in DC. Off the top of my head from when I lived in the city years back, you have Comet in what I want say is Cleveland Park, Two Amys in Georgetown, Radius in Mt. Pleasant, I want to say Iota down in NoVa, Red Rocks in Columbia Heights, and The Original Jumbo Slice in AdMo just to name a few. So, yes, you could make a map of pizza places to hit up in the DC area and no it doesn't mean you kill fuck kids for Satan. What other emails are there?

       There is a lot more and if you dont think they are creepy then you are really grasping at straws. And you are also leaving out the way they said the things you are trying to debunk, there is no way it is not extremely weird. I dont feel like finding a bunch of random emails because they have been posted here countless times but you should watch this video

       How is not thinking things are creepy grasping at straws? Holding up a grandmother's email inviting friends to visit a vacation home for a weekend and mentioning her grandkids would also be attending as if it were proof of a pedophile sex ring, that is the definition of grasping at straws.

       Yea because that is the only thing in the emails right? Also I didnt say it proved anything, its evidence. All those weird emails plus podesta and alefantis having weird child art and posting weird pictures of little kids isnt creepy? If trump was the one being accused of these things I guarantee you would be calling him a pedo.

       Well all I said is that it is creepy. There isn't indisputable proof so of course they cannot be charged or anything which I never said they should. But I do think its crazy for anyone to not be suspicious and think they may be.

       I think it is crazy that people have become obsessed with proving that people they dont know, have never met, and have never had any interaction with are part of a satanic cult that rapes, kills, and possibly eats children. All based on supposed "experts" on a website notorious for making things up and suggestive impressions. There were no, many independent voices that each said something was interesting about the emails because "pizza" is a known pedophile code word. Shit did not organically come about. Some source on 4chan just made up that pizza was code for child sexual abuse and after that suggestive impressioning everything started snowballing. From then on confirmation bias came into effect and anyone who wanted to could see confirmation of pedophilia in every new "clue."

       Never once did I say there was a satanic cult. Never once did i say anybody is eating kids. All I said is that those emails were creepy, thats it. And its hilarious if you think 4chan made up pizza being a pedo code word. Its been a code word for fucking YEARS. Way before 4chan even existed. The FBI has it listed in files that its a codeword.

       Why would I know your statement? I don't obsess over child porn terms. Interesting you might, though, since you know so much about child porn code words even though there is zero mention of pizza being a child sexual abuse code word in that document. Again I'll ask to be shown an official fbi doc that says pizza is a chil porn code word.

       I dont obsess over them lol. I just remember reading reddit posts a long time ago about the dark web and people would say cp and whenever someone asks it means child porn. And I cant find any fbi things saying pizza being a codeword but you can google it and see that its been a term used way before pizza gate was even a thing.

As of yet, you can't do that, but instead insist on belittling me because I don't blindly trust you. ONCE AGAIN, I WILL ASK YOU TO PROVIDE ME WITH EVIDENCENTHAT THE FBI HAS SAID "PIZZA" IS A CODE WORD FOR CHILD PORN. PUT UPMOR SHUT UP, MI AMIGO.

       Ditch the 'pizzagate' tagline. There are too many landmines there. Just go with pedophilia investigation. Aside from gps tagging at-risk and orphanated kids, there isnt really a way to bust them. The NSA definitely knows some shit but there is no transparency so we will never know the horrendous shit they decide not to pursue. Not to mention the OpSec of rich elite probably quells most of that surveillence anyway

       Thats why an actor was hired to shoot that computer. Controlled opposition. The tagline is to redpill the normies but they shouldnt be the ones to control the use of the narritive. (but they do!!)

       Okay sorry, you were the first person who said anything supportive. How has it gotten like this? They must have done an incredible job. Seriously, I didn’t even have an account, I saw pizzagate here and it inspired me. I have been more vocal about this stuff than ever. I do not understand how, if these people are real ^ they discount it so fervently.

       I'm confused. He's right--the email you quoted is not from the Wikileaks release, it's a joke email created as copy pasta. Shouldn't you want to know this if you're after the truth?

       What "creepy ass" emails? Most likely they fall into the misinterpreted category. You tell me the emails and I can talk about them more. The only ones I hear peple repeatedly call "creepy" are the one where a grandma is  inviting friends to visit her farm house in which she mentions thatnthey will heat the pool for swimmimg and that her grandkids will be comingbto play in the pool. Oh, she says they will be entertainment. RED ALERT RED ALERT!!! No, not really. It is a grandma doting over her grandkids. Not sure where you are in your life, but for a lot of us we grow to a point where our family is our entertainment. I know in my family most of the time spent is paying attention tonthe littlest ones. That's just how it goes in families. We find our grandkids, nieces, nephews, etc., entertaining. There is nothing sexual about it. The other email I hear mentioned that is so "creepy" is the "infamous" pizza related map email. As they say the simplest  answer is usually the correct answer. Pizza is fucking good and there quite a few places in DC. Off the top of my head from when I lived in the city years back, you have Comet in what I want say is Cleveland Park, Two Amys in Georgetown, Radius in Mt. Pleasant, I want to say Iota down in NoVa, Red Rocks in Columbia Heights, and The Original Jumbo Slice in AdMo just to name a few. So, yes, you could make a map of pizza places to hit up in the DC area and no it doesn't mean you kill fuck kids for Satan. What other emails are there?
