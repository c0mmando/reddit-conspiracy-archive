       Honestly, everything seems "cringy" when you're offended by people with different opinions. I had a friend who was a religious fundamentalist who loved George Carlin, but thought his opinions on religion were a little "cringy" as well.

       It's not that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcing politics into comedy, rather than do what was successful for Dave in the first place, is the same exact nose dive all of Comedy Central took when they decided to force humor regarding certain points of view to mock Trump mercilessly in an unfunny way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to be Trump. Comedy is like music and... sure you can have a plan going in... but the best stuff is by virtuosos who just dig deep and find something real that connects all of us.

       Its a lot like the Bush bashing in his years for being stupid. The left typically mocks republican presidents. Green Days American Idiot album was directly calling out W.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont mind political humor, it can be very funny but Dave tried a little too hard maybe? The crowd didn't respond to a few of his jokes and he just kinda stopped for a second then went on to the next. I noticed it most with the transgender monologue but he wrapped the trannies and trump in the same thing.

       Politics has been apart of comedy for decades. Dave was extremely political in his old comedy as well. He'd make endless jokes about Bush and Clinton. Comedy is often about poking fun at society, and whether you like it or not, Trump is extremely socially relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a big fan of trying to force politics out of comedy, regardless of where the politics lean towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, I agree with Chappelle that it shouldn't be someone's main act unless they are open about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even music has been known historically to be very political. Just look back at the unofficial soundtrack of the Vietnam war.

       The special was definitely hilarious. He starts off with his same old fashioned unexpected punchlines and hilarious delivered stories of him and other celebrities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, around the last 15 minutes he talks about Trump and jokes about his poor performance. He mentions he feels empathetic towards Trump supporters since he did grow up in the Midwest.

       Yesterday he was accussed of being pedophile thanks to the appearance of symbols in a graphic for the special. There's more than one post about him having been "replaced." And no, neither of these were mentioned after his two recent specials aired maybe 6 months back (in which he did not rail off against Trump).

        In fact, Dave was being touted as an anti-PC Woke icon because he made some shitty trans jokes in those specials.

       The cloning conspiracy started recently after his initial comeback in March. It stemmed from a podcast interview from a distorted voice claiming to be one of Dave Chappelle's first cousins. It's to be noted the channels name is
      </p>
      <p>
       The JT ANTI-NEW WORLD ORDER MOVEMENT
...and has 9.3k subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave Chappelle has been an ideological figurehead for both Conspiracy theorist and the Black community. All while being merely entertainment for everyone else. Like Carlin, Burr, and Louis C.K. He's widely known for his stand up to be very blunt and unreserved which garnered a lot of respect from his fans. It was around his comeback that a fraction of his fans started to turn on him since it was starting to become clear that his politics did not match theirs.

       It unfortunately is. There is a large faction of Trump supporters that will find some way of demonizing literally anyone who dislike Donald Trump. 
If you search "Dave Chappelle" on The_Donald, you will find that there was nothing but love and praise of Chappelle before last December. They praised an imaginary version of him as if he actually was on their side by alluding to hidden subtext that fit their agenda.
When reality set in, they either told themselves that he is a sellout (despite holding onto the exact same principles) or that he is a clone.

       Personally I don't believe so. If the government wouldnt spend unknown gobs of money developing secret technologies these speculations would be a lot easier to dismiss.

       Problem with that is that the "cousin" has never even been identified. It was based off a interview from a fringe podcast called "The JT ANTI-NEW WORLD ORDER MOVEMENT." The voice was never verified. Doesn't it stand to reason that the person in the interview actually either works for the channel or was paid for it? Just so the channel could get extra publicity.

       I feel like eveyone talking about the new dave chapelle didnt watch the whole thing. The second episode released drops some serious truth bombs on the way hollywood operates. He doesnt say anything directly but references a novel that describes his reason for leaving hollywood perfectly.

       Also liked his analogy with the bag full of money. Think he did an even better job than conveying some shit women have to deal with better than Louis C.K did when he tried to do something similar.

       Don't think it's too wise to assume too much in what some celebrities are saying. I doubt Dave was trying to covertly send secret messages about the Illuminati using code words and subtext. You start going down that road and you can conjure up all sorts of 
 wacky theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do believe there are a lot of nefarious people working within Hollywood. Like Dave said, I doubt they all sit at a round table wearing robes discussing sinister schemes and sharing their recent immoral exploits. But I think many crooked people have made it pretty high up and shamed others into silence.

       Not a fan of Pizzagate. It's way too politically convenient and relies too much on speculation. Conspiracy theories should be investigated and discussed. Not weaponized into partisan fodder.

       Guess this is what happens when you get into politics.

       It was surprising to see that even him couldn't see the irony on making fun of whom he called "ignorant naive white people" voting for trump and making fun of the "he will fight for us" phrase; and totally failed to see that this is exactly the same that happened to black people with Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a fan or either Trump or Obama as I see both Dem's and Rep's as two sides of the same coin.

       Really sad to see all that people making fun of the people that follow one puppet while cheering on a puppet themselves only achieving even greater division.

       Difference was that Obama never really waved the "first Black President" thing around as much as Trump waved around his vows to fight for the working class. Really all Obama had to do was win the first time around and that was more than enough to make history and excite the AA community. Though I think it is true that
       <br/>
       Obama's presidency wasn't perfect, no president ever led a completely successful administration, however

        political science experts

       generally rank him as
       <em>
        very slightly
       </em>
       above average.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also true that the public expected greatness from Obama early on and awarded it to him prematurely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you followed Dave Chappelle's for a long time, even during his hiatus, you would undoubtedly know it would be wrong to try to assume Dave is a racist. Regardless what you think of Obama, it doesn't really change the fact that what he said about Trump is true. It was pretty naive to assume a egotistical billionaire would "fight for the people." Yet I also agree with Dave that it's naive to call all of the people that did stupid or deplorable.

       I don't disagree that what he said about Trump is true and then some, my point is that it was also naive for black people to assume Obama would fight for them.
