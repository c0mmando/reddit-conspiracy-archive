        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we’ve spent New Year’s Eve with my wife at a house party at a friend’s house, and every soundtrack he put on was this new kind of electric music crap, with female singers and a repeating beat, I don’t know the genre since I normally don’t listen to this kind of music, I guess it’s mostly for youngsters, but after a few champagnes it can make your dance though. So to celebrate the new year I guess it’s tolerable. I have drank some, but not too much, so that I could hear the lyrics of the song.</p>

<p>What I have noticed, is that literally almost every soundtrack talked about <strong>“uniting the world”</strong> , <strong>“we are one”</strong> , <strong>“we can make the world one”</strong> , <strong>“join the world together”</strong>. Literally, I am not joking.</p>

<p>I mean this has to be a massive brainwashing operation for a Global Government.</p>

<p>And notice the electric genre has short lyrics and it’s very repetitive. So it drills the brainwashing into your head, meanwhile you are hypnotized by the beat.</p>

<p>What better way there is to brainwash people into globalism than have a bunch of drunk people in hypnotic state and suggesting a global unification to them via the music.</p>

<p>This electric genre has to be some kind of conspiracy, no wonder so many youngsters today buy into this Marxist-Globalist propaganda.</p>

<p>They go partying every Saturday and in every club they play this kind of music, totally brainwashing youngsters into supporting a Global Government.</p>

<p>I normally don’t listen to such music, but it was just so alarming to me, that it almost destroyed my mood on New Years Eve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listen to Electronic music everyday and have never heard a song like this. Everything isn’t a conspiracy. I’m sure their are artists in the EDM world who have sold out to that level of Hollywood but I would say that most are just dudes or dudets sitting in their apartment looking at a computer screen and fucking with synthesizers. Making music that’s fun to dance to, and often times repetitive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s possible. But listening to a three minute song that says “we all should unite” or whatever OP said isn’t going to brainwash you. If there’s a conspiracy to electronic music I would think it would come from some kind of frequencies being blasted at you but who knows what those frequencies are or what they would do to you. Their definitely is some very trance like and weird electronic music but it’s supposed to be like that. And if you’re tripping nuts or doing whatever then it can definitely feel like some crazy shit is happening to you but it’s usually you just over thinking it because there’s a lot of bass and it feels crazy on your body and when drugs are involved and your senses are heightened that shit can get crazy. I love it. </p>

<p>Certainly, but how would you distinguish that from just the artist putting a message in their work? That&#39;s how art is supposed to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s worse, that actually has some lyrics, it&#39;s a pop genre.</p>

<p>I  am talking about the electronic music genre which is filled with almost hypnotic beats drilling it into your heads like if it were a hammer hitting your ears. It&#39;s very weird, I don&#39;t understand how can young people like this.</p>

<p>I grew up on 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s music, it&#39;s totally weird to me what kind of crap people listen to these days.</p>

<p>People think it&#39;s everyone holding hands together, no racism, and utopia.</p>

<p>What it actually is it&#39;s a globalist bankster controlled world with chips implanted in people&#39;s skull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words, what you&#39;re talking about is inversion. TPTB have done it to education, healthcare, politics, and music I guess, so I understand where your criticism is coming from. </p>

<p>The only thing you&#39;re missing though in this specific regard is <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>Most people that come out of these events have a great time bonding with their friends and even complete strangers. There really is a tangible sense of unity amongst <em>people</em> at these things, although you seem to think that this is a bad thing because it promotes the concept of a global NWO.</p>

<p>Should the lyrics promote division? Is banding together a bad thing? Why would unity on the ground level lead to furthering political goals or subversion?</p>

<p>Have  you had any spiritual experiences? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you misunderstand me, I have no problem with the bonding aspect (although it could be criticized from a collectivism / individualism perspective).</p>

<p>Certainly lowering violence and racism is good.</p>

<p>However what I am saying is that this &quot;unity&quot; experience that these people experience is then conflated with political totalitarianism, and used against people to push for the NWO.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Let me put it like this:
* People have a bonding, and a sense of unity, and respect for eachother.
* People want a world more united and free
* The globalists realize this
* The globalists push for a Global Totalitarian Government, under the disguise of a &quot;united utopia&quot;
* People are now enslaved, have microchips in their brains, and the illusion of utopia is quickly swapped for the harsh reality.</p>

<p>Literally every superproject (EU,UN) feeds on this &quot;unity&quot; experience that youngsters (mostly liberals) experience, and they use this as a political weapon to feed their NWO project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that was a raver in the UK in the 90’s I can assure you listening to jungle/drum and bass invoked an almost tribalistic vibe to the 2-4000 people around me. That vibe was honestly geared towards getting as mangled as possible, having a wicked night and sticking 2 fingers up to the law. Music today is trash, like you say hypnotic, but a lot of people take drugs at the events. I personally would say there would be little to no chance of uniting people together through music towards a one world government. </p>

<p>Good topic though, always like to discuss music and society, plenty of conspiracies in music and the people surrounding the scene </p>

<p>They have been hearing &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;oneness&quot; from the 90&#39;s in discos, so they thought that uniting europe under a dictatorship is almost like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;oneness&quot; in the spiritual sense.</p>

<p>EDM is a huge part of my and has been for well over a decade so I&#39;m gonna lay some education down. </p>

<p>The underlining motto of EDM and Rave  culture is PLUR. Peace, Love, UNITY, Respect. These are basically the only things that matter to us. </p>

<p>Raves and the rave culture surrounding it are one of the few places were human connection transcends all things. There&#39;s no globalism/nationalism, politics, race, rich or poor, hell even language isn&#39;t a barrier. </p>

<p>This global community of love that transcends all are what&#39;s being referenced in these songs. </p>

<p>But this music literally sounded like a hypnosis. The beat was very weird electric effects and the lyrics was clear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like somebody trying to brainwash you.</p>

<p>Now we didn&#39;t have disco lights, since it was in a large livingroom. But I bet in clubs when they play the music, mixed in with disco lights and special effects, it&#39;s even more mesmerizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, you should be sceptical of all forms of music. In my opinion, and Platos, it is the greatest form of mind control (pre FM radio, TV, Internet). 
Music affects you, that&#39;s why you like it. Tonality, rythm and such, according to Plato can be altered specifically to bring about a certain mood. War drums is an example. Tyrants and governments have used it with great effect. And on top of that you can bring lyrics, words, in to it and together with the emotionally piercing tonality seed ideas and concepts. Bypassing the mind-filters (rationality, logic) you have for example in day to day conversations.</p>

<p>Now the aforementioned youtube &quot;documentary&quot; Rave new world is no fountain of information.</p>

<p>On the other hand I highly recommend this interview series with Dr Hans Utter <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=L1n5Hfy_dCg">https://hooktube.com/watch?v=L1n5Hfy_dCg</a> called &#39;Dr. Hans Utter – “Music, Mind Control, and Psychobiology, Pt. 1”&#39; It will highly enlighten you in this specific subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s possible. But listening to a three minute song that says “we all should unite” or whatever OP said isn’t going to brainwash you. If there’s a conspiracy to electronic music I would think it would come from some kind of frequencies being blasted at you but who knows what those frequencies are or what they would do to you. Their definitely is some very trance like and weird electronic music but it’s supposed to be like that. And if you’re tripping nuts or doing whatever then it can definitely feel like some crazy shit is happening to you but it’s usually you just over thinking it because there’s a lot of bass and it feels crazy on your body and when drugs are involved and your senses are heightened that shit can get crazy.
