       The OP is rather easy to follow, not sure what's so hard to understand.  He's questioning whether or not people would believe a possible alien false flag scenario if it were reported on CNN.  I interpret his Anderson Cooper title as a catch-all for the corporate-controlled mainstream media.

       Well if it were a real alien invasion it wouldn't be just Cooper. Everyone including Fox would be reporting it.

       If there were nothing going on in their own country, then they would have no data of their own to verify it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were a conspiracy, and if it included multiple countries, then at least some of the leaders in those countries would have to be part of it. Given that they all conspire to cover up WTC 7, doesn't that seem possible, and if that is possible, then wouldn't a human conspiracy be a more likely explanation than an alien invasion?

       I'd imagine this has been downvoted because it's not
       <em>

       discussing a conspiracy.

       You probably aren’t being downvoted by actual real people reading the sub. There are auto downvotes on lots of posts that doubt the “agenda”.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really depends on what is happening in the news. The downvotes are usually associated with topics or keywords they are looking to suppress.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s kinda slow today so the downvotes may just be directed at anything doubting.

       Sure, do the Freemasons have a private subreddit somewhere? I'm sure they probably do. Astroturfing exists here and it's obvious.

       A good question OP.  I've lurked here for years, signed-up to post when the Oumuamua Asteroid started to get the extraterrestrial treatment.  Following that, I've seen nothing but disinformation and probable deceit from mainstream outlets, Tom Delonge's bullshit organization, and others.

       What about probabilities? Fake aliens and alien ships have been on TV tens of thousands of times, and why would aliens use something as expensive and risky to themselves as an army of alien foot soldiers? Also, considering the capabilities and motives of humans, wouldn't a human conspiracy be far more probable?

       If I take into account the "fact" that the mainstream media and the Pentagon never let me know something unless it serves their agenda...

       Then..regarding the latest shenanigans...it all points to a fake human conspiracy...

       Now..if real aliens do show up...I'm hoping it's because they can travel in time and they have decided its best not to let us blow ourselves to smithereens...

       Yes, it's possible that aliens have already taken everything they wanted from the earth and we didn't even know it, so if they show up again, there is a good chance they might be here to help; however, a peaceful alien hoax could be use just as effectively to consolidate global power.

       I think you're being sarcastic here, but just in case; a purported false flag alien invasion has been talked about for at least ~20 years in the form of Project Blue Beam.  And while Blue Beam is pretty far-fetched, it's interesting that this stuff is coming to light now when the deep state is in most need of silly distractions.

       Nope.  I'd be asking myself why "they" want us to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very clear though based in the last few decades of predictive programming this is going to happen at some point and it certainly won't be real.

       Lol The exact same footage? Over an over?

       That would prove the opposite. That would tell me it was pre rendered footage.

       Youll probably never get me to believe in aliens.

      <p>
       Just because an elitist lackey goes on TV and interviews an "invading alien" and a high tech laser on an advnaced drone blows up a building does not mean I will bow to the whim of some cook in an monster suit with big guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am thoroughly convinced that the common ideological portrayal of "space" aliens causing mass hysteria or some other world wide crisis has been injected in to our minds in order to sell the lie of a world wide take over of a fake alien race, or in reality, the usurping of free humanity by the new world order.
