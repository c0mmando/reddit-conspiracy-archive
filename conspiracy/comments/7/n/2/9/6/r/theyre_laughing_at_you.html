You who sits and waits patiently for their sludge to come flowing down the tube and through your television nozzle. They&#39;re mocking you for waiting at their exhaust vents for a tidbit of salvation. They spite you by weaving emotionally riveting tales to poke your dopamine and then laugh as you scarf it up and beg for more.<br/>

But the mainstream comedians jokes are just soooo tired! remember will Ferrell’s impersonation of president bush? That was the funniest skit ive ever seen. But the jokes they run about Trump are just non stop, and not even funny any more. The phrase “beating a dead horse” was coined just for situations like this. </p>

<p>Who hires them?</p>

<p>HBO pays Oliver, rather elementary...  HBO is owned buy some guys I don’t feel like looking up...  most likely they, like 99% of the rest of film and television executives support the Liberals.</p>

<p>And I am sure Oliver is pretty free to say what he wants, and he is a liberal, so...  Would he have been hired if he was not a liberal, maybe that is the question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many people I know watch right wing media exclusively, and act like they&#39;re privy to some higher truth when half of what they say is complete nonsense.  The &quot;facts&quot; they give are usually Fox News bullshit like, &quot;did you know America is the only country without tariffs&quot; or something that could be googled in 20 seconds.  If you think infowars or some conservative-eagle-news.ru website is informing you then you are wrong.  Not believing what you hear if it comes from the MSM doesn&#39;t make you wise, especially if you instead believe things coming from some right wing blog-rag like breitbart that was designed to be propaganda.  So many people think that the popular MSM narrative must be wrong solely because it is popular, but that&#39;s not how facts work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure these shows are loosing viewers (would love a source if someone has one).  The slack is being picked up by YT personalities.  I personally know many young people (GenZ) that exclusively watch YT/twitch/etc.</p>

<p>All of them produce content that their audience wants to consume.  Sensationalism is in popular demand.  Once they garner a significant audience that usually trends on one side of the aisle, they have absolutely no incentive to attack the other side.  Gone are the days of Craig Kilborne / early-Jon Stewart where nobody was safe from ridicule (at least how I remember them - I could be wrong).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of years ago on US TV John Oliver championed former Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, for the success of the 1996 Australian gun buyback program, which was introduced <em>immediately</em> following the Port Arthur massacre.  (The Port Arthur massacre is alleged by many--not without evidence--to have been a black op/false flag with the intention of removing guns from the Australian public.)</p>

<p>Watch out for John Oliver.  He&#39;s definitely pushing the NWO agenda.</p>
