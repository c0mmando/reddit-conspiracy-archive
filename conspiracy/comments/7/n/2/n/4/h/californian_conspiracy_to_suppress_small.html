        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-30 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/day_care.html">day_care</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve  been attempting to start a business in California but have hit so many road-block to event starting one that I suspect that there must be an active conspiracy to stop the creation of new business by non-establishment types despite the state&#39;s reputation as being the chief innovation hub.</p>

<p>These hindrances come in 3 main types designed to stop those who aren&#39;t at least agnostic towards the establishment from succsficly starting a company in order to gain a modicum of economic influence
1. Social Barriers
2. Finacial Barriers
3. Logistic Barrier</p>

<p><strong>Social Barriers</strong> </p>

<p>Unless you are starting a tech company(Something easily controlled by the goverment) people will constantly discourage you from starting a blue-collar company claiming that it isn&#39;t worth the effort or high-risk. They even threaten to refuse to patronize your business because of your political leanings no matter how unrelated it is to your plan.</p>

<p>People have refused to even consider enrolling thier kids into my day-care because of my support of President Trump. This social pressure stems from Hollywood and the media establishment headquartered here who use the image of bankrupt blue-collar racists to convince people against starting businesses and becoming independent.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Barriers</strong> 
In our new gilded age the elite control almost all the capital required to start a business leaving us plebian masses only enough to blind ourselves in with consumerism. This has created numerous unscary financial barriers spread by regulation in the name of protecting the people that are in fact nothing more than attempts to control and capture the markets in order to benefit a small elite.</p>

<p>A legal system that allows small business to be bankrupted by a rich asshole with petty grudge while allowing large business to declare themselves exempt from the system is one of their main methods of doing so forcing small business to pay extortion money to liability insurers </p>

<p>This retards the development of all blue-collar business which involves physical risk at the expense of moving money around white-collar business that doesn&#39;t have the same problems</p>

<p>banks routinely deny loans on the basis of politics denying me a loan on the basis of personal risk while allowing high-school dropouts to borrow lavish sums to lure them into debt slavery</p>

<p><strong>Logistic Barriers</strong> </p>

<p>Lawyer are one of the primary agents and benefactors of this regime forcing us to pay registration costs and low fees in order to prevent us from going bankrupt, bad state policy leading to an overregulation of the market cause even basic tasks such depositing of cash to take unnesciarly long for small-scale operations while taking milliseconds for large companies</p>

<p>Economises of scale enforced not by the law of the markets but the law of governments retards the economy in order to ensure full goverment control by creating a dependent workforce that is easily controlled and replaced</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The only explanation that can explain all the idiosyncratic barriers towards starting a business is an active conspiracy by the goverment to stop  people from becoming indepdents and striking their own. Calafornia is the quintessital example of how this penoma takes place being where it&#39;s most pronounced while hiding it in a glitzy facade</p>

This person thinks buying insurance makes you look like a risk taker. 
And they think that they can make parents sign a waiver that mean that is they sue the daycare because their child was injured, then have to pay the daycares legal fees even if they WIN the lawsuit.</p>
