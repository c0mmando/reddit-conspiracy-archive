       It probably won’t be popular here, but those of you who are
       <em>
        read in
       </em>
       to the occult might understand what I’m getting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that part of our evolution, the next step, is veganism. Hear me out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you say, “vegetables and plants are alive too” know that that is understood. They don’t have flesh and blood though. I think that is a step towards our ascension into the better version of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       One theory in Alchemy actually suggests that man was originally part of the vegetable kingdom, which makes sense if you consider evolution; microbial life gave way to plant life which gave way to animal life which gave way to man; so on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn’t it strange how dogs behave? What they must think of us, these odd two legged creatures who take care of them and ask for nothing but their presence in return. I think that is “of god”
      </p>
      <p>
       What do pigs and cows think of us? We must seem like the most cruel of betrayers to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read much occult material, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” by Manly P. Hall comes to mind. The goal apparently, is to eventually nourish ourselves with only our breath and the sun’s radiance. Monks in the east have achieved this, though fierce dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that rejecting consuming flesh of any kind is the fastest way for an individual to become enlightened. It’s also of course healthier, to a degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, I think we should care for the animals, they are our closest relatives on Mother Earth. They deserve our protection. An animal can’t decide to show love or hate. An animal just does what animals do. I believe humanity is behaving like animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal is to not cause any suffering. Perhaps switching to a vegan diet can be a big step towards that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a theory.

       We can watch micro-organisms evolve. Do you think your superior being would make us unable to evolve when the lowest of life forms are capable of this feat? That seems unlikely if there really were a god.

       Why don’t evolution and science describe God’s plan?
      </p>
      <p>
       If God meant for the universe and life to be so complex, which we have to assume he did given how complex life and the universe are, what would someone assume that these aren’t God’s “building blocks” or designs? That seems almost arrogant to me personally. Put it this way: What makes you think you have the ability to understand or fathom on the same level as GOD?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to argue per se, I’m more curious as to why the belief in science AND God seem to be at odds for you (and others).

       YOU are an evolution of your parents! When parents passing on their genes to their offspring continues for millions of years it creates a bigger and bigger difference between the kids from million years ago to today. European ancestors being forced to drink milk from cows caused them to evolve into not being lactose intolerant, whereas asians and african usually ARE since they had rice etc. to eat during tough times.

       Thanks! I tried it on two different occasions. Once in college for about a full yead; I felt like my entire life was uplifted. I fell in love with a girl, she sort of made fun of me for it, not that that’s an excuse; so I stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried again last year. I only lasted about four months, but I realied it’s the path for me. I’ve just been being lazy, it sort of took a backseat. I had an epiphany yesterday, that I was completely rejecting what I knew what was best for me. So I’m giving it another go.

       In the book Erewhon by Samuel Butler the people weren't even allowed to pick fruit. If you wanted an apple you had to wait for it to naturally drop from the tree... and after you ate it you had to go plant the seeds.

       The great thing about the occult is that it lets you ignore science.  Humans require fatty acids for health.  These come from meat or fish or fowl.

       How so? Humans started off not eating meat, they evolved to eat meat. So in theory wouldn’t moving to a more carnivorous state be a progression? Carnivores in nature can eat once and go long periods of time without eating again. We have time and energy to do the things we do because we don’t need to constantly forage and whatnot.

       Factory farming causes suffering all by itself. The amount of pesticides used for one. Also the loss of animal life that comes from the huge Combines that harvest vegetables. Many deer fawns, rabbits ground nesting birds etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       To curb that suffering people would have to grow their own food.  Unfortunately not to many people would ever be on board with that at this stage of the human experience. So many like to be fat, dumb and entertained.

       The Jewish faith as well as the Islamic faith have strict rules about slaughtering animals for food. No suffering is the main highlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factory farming has however left behind the humane slaughter and good treatment of animals. It’s very sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I mostly agree with you. To a degree we are betraying nature with factory farming.
      </p>

       But how would you implement something like this on a global scale? The answer is that you can’t.  You can make a personal decision but you are a single drop of around 8 Billion other points of view.

       Is that so? Well, have you ever witnessed kosher or halaal slaughter? If not, you should retract your uninformed opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason they use the terribly slow and horrific method of throat-slitting is because according to their man-made guidelines (scripture) the soul of the beast is confined to the blood. And with this impeccable logic they conclude that eating blood pie makes you a beast. So much for wisdom and mercy. Look at some halaal/kosher videos and come right back here.

       Anyway, it doesn’t really matter. I like this OP better. I’ve been looking for a compelling spiritual argument for veganism.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the time being, I can’t help but seeing the traditional farm - whereby domesticated animals defecate and in turn feed the soil/plants, in which there is no gratuitous suffering - as being quite natural/righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, veganism seems like a very luxurious lifestyle. Traditionally humans (who can’t afford eating food shipped from the other side of the world) have relied on animals for proteins, especially in winter time.

       Yes, killing anything most definitely takes away the youthful universal energy that we absorb through meditation and mindfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one becomes sensitive to universal energy you can actual feel the removal of energy from yourself if you kill another living thing.

       I think their may be a group of lurkers targeting me, but that might just be paranoia. Who cares. People have seen the message. I think veganism could help us. I’m gonna do what I can to stick to it this time so I can be a better example.

       But is the goal to not cause any suffering, or to cause more joy than suffering?

       One way says it is moral to have children, the other the reverse?

       Try really, really hard. If you care enough to try really hard, you’ll find a solution. For me I think it could be veganism.

       How long were you vegan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly the first steps in improving anything need to start with yourself. I am no longer a vegan but I am a struct vegetarian for going on two decades, welcome (back) to the club.
