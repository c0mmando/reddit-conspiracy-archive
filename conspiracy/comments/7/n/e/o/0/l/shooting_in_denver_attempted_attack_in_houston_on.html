        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Check this out, y&#39;all. I&#39;m ready to peel back these layers like an onion. Both of these &quot;stories&quot; seem like they were escalated from normal events to nationally news-worthy in seconds. Both stories seem quite strange from my point of view. What say you?</p>

<p>Since 10/30, <a href="https://twitter.com/GundaleSandeep">Gundale</a> has been warning of impending attacks on Las Vegas, via routes going through Denver and Houston. He specifically mentions the Darling Tennis Stadium as part of attack.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/intoxicated-man-found-with-small-arsenal-on-top-floor-of-hyatt-regency-downtown-police-say">Man</a> with arsenal found on the top floor of the Hyatt Regency hotel in HOUSTON TX. The article says they attempted to break in and arrest him for being drunk &amp; trespassing, but he had a room. Common sense tells me this is a strange story that I don&#39;t readily believe.</p>

<p><a href="https://truepundit.com/latest-multiple-officers-shot-suspect-large-bomb-squad-swat-scene-douglas-county-colorado/">Multple officers shot, suspect; large bomb squad on the scene</a>. This is in DENVER, CO. Media makes no mention of a bomb, suspect is killed, no mention of the Twitter story or why exactly the cops were there. Local news says they went to the apartment due to a noise complaint AND made no mention of the bomb squad. The entire area surrounding this enormous apartment complex was barricaded and federal and state police arrived quickly. Over.... a noise complaint? Shooter had no criminal history.</p>

<p>The Darling Tennis Center [Facebook link removed due to subreddit policy] in Houston, TX just happens to be without power for two days, telling visitors to stay away. Presumably, getting checked for bombs. This was posted on their Facebook page.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/shooting-leaves-1-deputy-dead-in-suburban-denver">Deputy</a> killed in the Denver shootout was from Houston.</p>

<p>A comment left on this <a href="https://youtu.be/ERC9njNLrO8">YouTube</a> video says Sundeed was Hindu. This is correct as his Twitter posts, which I translated myself, translate to Hindi. He was showing a Shivalinga at a Hindu temple, giving away that he could be a Hindu priest. Commentor said he has been a student for 14 years. He said the Priests have abilities and get visions, and that Sundeed was &quot;being honest about what he sees or knows.&quot;</p>

<p>Happy New Year, guys! Will update if I find anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I steadily believe that the &quot;attack&quot; on LV months ago was a false flag designed to control a narrative - (they) found out about Paddock being there and decided to flip the script on him and use for their own purposes.</p>

<p>The lack of motive here makes no sense. I&#39;m sorry but five officers being shot for a domestic call, when the apartment is surrounded by armed officers? Something stinks about that to me. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve ever been surrounded by cops with guns drawn in your home, but I have - and you&#39;re not getting out alive or going to win. Why would someone shoot to be killed over a noise complaint? We&#39;ll never know. One of the downed officers was from Houston. </p>

<p>Not to mention, a tennis stadium losing power randomly for 2-3 days? No reason given, just a notice on their Facebook page that they&#39;ll be closed on December 28-29th. Looking at local news sites, no power outages reported for that time....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A wmd disposal team is very obvious. They&#39;re basically a bomb disposal team with big toys. </p>

<p>Local police bomb squads can&#39;t disarm nukes. That&#39;s why we give some seals special training. It&#39;s why the department of energy has special teams.</p>

<p>When cops get shot all cops come. Whether state or federal. There is a dhs and an FBI office in Denver I&#39;d imagine there is probably a Marshal&#39;s office and dea office and atf office as well. </p>

<p>Major police incidents happen daily in major cities around the country. Linking them off the word of someone that is just some random anonymous person on Twitter is laughable </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a gun show in Houston that the man was attending as well as wanting to stay for the festivities for new years. </p>

<p>I live in the area, news all morning is saying he had no intentions of doing any harm and was only there for festivities, without mentioning the gun show. Put two and two together. </p>

<p>Why he would get drunk if he planned on going on a sniper hunt? He got in an argument with other people at the hotel bar.  Which just escalated to security calling the cops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had not heard that either and looked at two primary local news sources to gather this info. </p>

<p>The stories I read made it seem as though the guy was drunk in the hotel and they believed he was trespassing and didn&#39;t have a room. Which seems strange, he could have just showed them his keycard, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are connections I didn&#39;t know about. But my first red flag was that the president tweeted about the officer who was killed and it was also on the national news. Officers are shot and killed often, so there must have been something &quot;special&quot; about this one.</p>

<p>I know TPTB use signals like imagery, dates and numbers to communicate what was an &quot;inside job&quot; so I&#39;m starting to think if it makes national news it&#39;s more so people who are in the know are updated. And of course the rest of us just see it as a news story.</p>
