       Check this out, y'all. I'm ready to peel back these layers like an onion. Both of these "stories" seem like they were escalated from normal events to nationally news-worthy in seconds. Both stories seem quite strange from my point of view. What say you?
      </p>

       Since 10/30,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/GundaleSandeep">
        Gundale
       </a>
       has been warning of impending attacks on Las Vegas, via routes going through Denver and Houston. He specifically mentions the Darling Tennis Stadium as part of attack.

        Man
       </a>
       with arsenal found on the top floor of the Hyatt Regency hotel in HOUSTON TX. The article says they attempted to break in and arrest him for being drunk &amp; trespassing, but he had a room. Common sense tells me this is a strange story that I don't readily believe.
      </p>

       <a href="https://truepundit.com/latest-multiple-officers-shot-suspect-large-bomb-squad-swat-scene-douglas-county-colorado/">
        Multple officers shot, suspect; large bomb squad on the scene
       </a>
       . This is in DENVER, CO. Media makes no mention of a bomb, suspect is killed, no mention of the Twitter story or why exactly the cops were there. Local news says they went to the apartment due to a noise complaint AND made no mention of the bomb squad. The entire area surrounding this enormous apartment complex was barricaded and federal and state police arrived quickly. Over.... a noise complaint? Shooter had no criminal history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Darling Tennis Center [Facebook link removed due to subreddit policy] in Houston, TX just happens to be without power for two days, telling visitors to stay away. Presumably, getting checked for bombs. This was posted on their Facebook page.

       video says Sundeed was Hindu. This is correct as his Twitter posts, which I translated myself, translate to Hindi. He was showing a Shivalinga at a Hindu temple, giving away that he could be a Hindu priest. Commentor said he has been a student for 14 years. He said the Priests have abilities and get visions, and that Sundeed was "being honest about what he sees or knows."

       Happy New Year, guys! Will update if I find anything else.

       I'm sure now that nothing happened, he'll say it was because of him and his warnings, they were able to stop it.  It is just some random guy on Twitter who can barely communicate in English, nothing more.

       There's absolutely no evidence that anything nefarious happened in any these events. You're simply trying to correlate unrelated events into a narrative

       I disagree. I steadily believe that the "attack" on LV months ago was a false flag designed to control a narrative - (they) found out about Paddock being there and decided to flip the script on him and use for their own purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of motive here makes no sense. I'm sorry but five officers being shot for a domestic call, when the apartment is surrounded by armed officers? Something stinks about that to me. I'm not sure if you've ever been surrounded by cops with guns drawn in your home, but I have - and you're not getting out alive or going to win. Why would someone shoot to be killed over a noise complaint? We'll never know. One of the downed officers was from Houston.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, a tennis stadium losing power randomly for 2-3 days? No reason given, just a notice on their Facebook page that they'll be closed on December 28-29th. Looking at local news sites, no power outages reported for that time....

       A wmd disposal team is very obvious. They're basically a bomb disposal team with big toys.

       Local police bomb squads can't disarm nukes. That's why we give some seals special training. It's why the department of energy has special teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       When cops get shot all cops come. Whether state or federal. There is a dhs and an FBI office in Denver I'd imagine there is probably a Marshal's office and dea office and atf office as well.

       Major police incidents happen daily in major cities around the country. Linking them off the word of someone that is just some random anonymous person on Twitter is laughable

       Actually, it's not "normal" you think it's normal because you've been trained to think that way.

       If there are no details at this time, I don't think any respectable journo will be adding in false facts or if they do add theories, will mark them as such. I only used or tried to use local primary sources in this post.

       its you that has trained yourself to think everything is a conspiracy - 'sounds strange to me' etc from preliminary press reports that always change. was my point. this point is mostly for other people who read this as you wont be able to understand it because of your overwhelming cognitive bias toward conspiracy. all the best.

       There was a gun show in Houston that the man was attending as well as wanting to stay for the festivities for new years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in the area, news all morning is saying he had no intentions of doing any harm and was only there for festivities, without mentioning the gun show. Put two and two together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why he would get drunk if he planned on going on a sniper hunt? He got in an argument with other people at the hotel bar.  Which just escalated to security calling the cops.

       Thanks for posting this, I couldn't figure out why he would go out of his way to escalate the situation with hotel security and then the police.  The gun show hasn't been mentioned in anything I have read.  This sounds like a case of too many beers and too few brains.

       I'm baffled top as to why the gun show hasn't been mentioned.

       Im pretty sure it was held at the George r brown convention center.

       I had not heard that either and looked at two primary local news sources to gather this info.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories I read made it seem as though the guy was drunk in the hotel and they believed he was trespassing and didn't have a room. Which seems strange, he could have just showed them his keycard, right?

       He was told to leave the premises. He went to his room, and I believe came back down to the lobby (bar) again. The second of which when security just called police and claimed it trespassing. Thanks when police went to his room to remove him from the premises and found the guns/ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story was stretched out across interviews on "live" news, and a brief report this morning.

       Also, I don't think there is a darling tennis center in Houston. I've never heard of it for sure, and trying to Google it only pulls up Vegas, the largest tennis center in the nation.

       These are connections I didn't know about. But my first red flag was that the president tweeted about the officer who was killed and it was also on the national news. Officers are shot and killed often, so there must have been something "special" about this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know TPTB use signals like imagery, dates and numbers to communicate what was an "inside job" so I'm starting to think if it makes national news it's more so people who are in the know are updated. And of course the rest of us just see it as a news story.

       Yep, DJT Tweeted about this immediately after it happened. I didn't mention that in my post but it did make me turn my head.

       This kind of thing happens frequently in The metro area of Denver. we seem to be a place that attracts the crazy.  Columbine Shooting. Aurora Theater shooter. The Chucky Cheese incident. The police shoot people constantly here also.

       There's absolutely no evidence that anything nefarious happened in any these events. You're simply trying to correlate unrelated events into a narrative
