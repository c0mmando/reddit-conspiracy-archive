    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. But the fact remains the same. A lot of these areas don&#39;t think it is OK. They get a lot of money from criminalization through civil forfeitures and &quot;illegal&quot; searches than they would ever hope to see with tax revenue.  If there is more money to be made through criminalization, regardless of public opinion, that is what they will do. Now that they see how much tobacco is costing in increased medicare costs, they will do everything in their power to minimize that. The almighty dollar dictates lobbying/legislation usually to a fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, Cigarettes are far more deadly than marijuana. Obviously there is more information on long term tobacco use, but the info we have now shows a different set of ailments tied to marijuana use. Tobacco causes lung cancer, emphysema, COPD, and heart disease. Cannabis is only tied to COPD and chronic bronchitis. Much less deadly. COPD is still a concern obviously. </p>

<p>Of course, someone smoking a J is getting more toxins and carcinogens than those who use bongs, and vapes. Most people use water pipes for weed, which is 98% filtered compared to dry pipes/rolled J&#39;s. Furthermore, in 5 years the availability of vaping concentrated marijuana is going to grow 10 fold. </p>

<p>This all leads me to believe the prevalence of disease-causing forms of smoking will be eliminated. Which over time will show a drastic difference in long-term illnesses caused by Cannabis compared to Tobacco. </p>

<p>Your argument is not useless, but the facts dont support what you are posing either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I realize you were pointing out the discrepancy rather than attacking one substance versus another. Or even comparing the two. I suppose I am trying to further point out that one substance (tobacco) is literally a killer, and should be phased out/eliminated. </p>

<p>There shouldnt be any of that schizophrenic behavior you describe towards the two substances because tobacco is far more dangerous. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been led to believe they are the same or even comparable, but they are far different in health effects. Cannabis should never have been demonized in the first place, and tobacco should have never been given the green light to infect its poison on the world.</p>

<p>That is the real conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen dwarfwhore - you start an argument with me because you misinterpret what I wrote. No worries. But I have no idea what you are trying to twist the discussion into now.</p>

<p>Everyone realizes that marijuana is far safer than tobacco, especially with the numerous traces of toxic chemicals found in modern cigarettes. Everyone.</p>

<p>I realize that the strawdog &quot;them&quot; are out there and they are dangerously stupid. But if you need them to prop up your argument, then probably shouldn&#39;t have made the argument to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s that people are waking up to the fact that a tobacco cigarette has had approx 600 chemicals added to it to effect the taste, the way it burns, how your brain receptors accept the nicotine etc. Tobacco wouldn&#39;t be so harmful if these chemicals weren&#39;t there. But companies like marlboro, jps, Benson and hedges want to make their product more addictive by using these chemicals to make you smoke more. Some of the chemicals used in cigarettes block the nicotine receptors in the brain so you crave more. 
Cannabis doesn&#39;t have these chemicals added to it (so far) so they are in fact slightly healthier. And at least you get high when you have smoked a joint. After smoking a cigarette you get a little hit of nicotine tons of nasty chemicals and you stink. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not hard to pinpoint at all.  Your lungs are the factory for life, if that factory has to store vegetable leaf, and inhale heated smoke daily, or even weekly  it doesnt matter if its not laced with terrible chemicals.  It still reduces your life, your breathing abilities, and your ability to get oxygen to the rest of your body. Also your immune system, the celia that keeps harmful material from the outside world on the outside, shuts down with smoking.
  So what is a cold to a non-smoker potentiall6 becomes pneumonia for a smoker.  Its not a conspiracy, its self-care to avoid it and make it harder for people to access.</p>

The states I have visited that made it legal on a recreational level tend to have more expensive product then local illegal cultivators in my non recreational state. Not any better per say. 
Tobacco is physically addictive where pot is all mental. I rolled my own and it was not an easy quit after 13 years.  I easily put down the herb though. Not hard. Any way a government can control or regulate it will.  The Tobacco tax raise back in the late 90&#39;s, I think at least, was the tipping point for that product. My $2 pack of Marlboro jumped to 4.25 and I started rolling them and buying bulk tobacco. It tasted better but still to pricey.  Glad I quit either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes...and No.  My son being born was my motivation. I really enjoyed the habit but I needed to be a strong roll model and lead by example which meant giving up the cigs.  I used this motivation to quit (heck, I quit 94 times before this, I was a pro) after two days I was in dire need of a smoke. Every time I wanted a smoke, no matter what I was doing, I tried to run around my block or business (I looked the fool) just to open my lung and get deep breaths. But after the first 48 hours I broke down...I went out and purchased the cheapest, nastiest smokes I could find....&quot;Kentucky&#39;s Best&quot;. Fired one up and man did it suck. It tasted nasty!  I took a couple hits, put it down and absorbed the headache I now had. After that I just tried to keep that thought of an unenjoyable cigarette in my head and continued with some deep breathing when I got stressed. No pills or patches. I found this worked best for me. I did break down and smoke half a cig 4 years ago when my Father died but I hated it and myself for it.  It&#39;s been 14 years since first quit and other than my Fathers funeral I don&#39;t plan on it again. Another thing that helped was I quit drinking for a few weeks and I stayed away from friends that smoked for a couple weeks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d characterize it as tobacco being primarily demonized which then results in the &quot;illegalization&quot;.</p>

<p>Most of us here pride ourselves on being free and woke, right? Then why has everyone swallowed the tobacco narrative so wholeheartedly? The hundreds and hundreds of scientific studies, you say? Just like all those vaccine studies, right? And if you really read through the scientific literature you&#39;ll see that most &quot;tobacco&quot; studies begin with a foregone conclusion (i.e. tobacco=death), and the studies that do find beneficial effects explain them as anomalous or as working through some convoluted mechanism.</p>

<p>The most glaring, widespread problem with the research I&#39;ve seen is the fact nearly all the studies use &quot;cigarettes&quot; in their methodology, but do not specify brand and/or tobacco type. I have not yet seen a study that uses pure tobacco. Although there was that <a href="http://www.eattheplanet.org/surprisingly-smoking-tobacco-from-a-pipe-may-have-health-benefits/"><strong>one time</strong> pipe smokers were evaluated and found to have a lower mortality than the non-smoking population.</a> (For those who don&#39;t know, pipe tobacco <em>tends</em> to have less additives than cigarette tobacco, and you don&#39;t inhale. Also, later studies did find higher mortality in &quot;pipe smokers&quot;, but those studies lumped &quot;pipe smokers&quot; in with &quot;cigar smokers&quot;. That is not cool. Pipe smoking is not at all like cigar smoking.)</p>

<p>And here&#39;s the thing, tobacco smoking stimulates the analytical/critical while settling the fearful. Marijuana stimulates the creative/intuitive while settling the analytical/critical. Marijuana can also cause paranoia in some cases.</p>

<p>Any wonder why &quot;they&quot; want people on marijuana rather than tobacco?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So cigars traditionally are puffed, not smoked.  Do some &#39;research&#39; on how healthy they are.  This thread is the definition of willful ignorance.  You can find a study for any bias.  So youre advocating everyone smoke to avoid Parkinsons and welcome Cancer?  The lungs have no exit, just like nothing anyone says, and no matter who dies, your decision will not change because you smoke.  Knock yourself out just dont blast people who have to deal with your dumbass 40 years later taking up all the healthcare resources that could be used on better things than your immature decision making.
