        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since this is r/conspiracy, I also expect a ton of replies from people who disagree. That&#39;s fine and, if you have a line of reasoning to back up your opinion, feel free to share it. Here&#39;s my line of reasoning...</p>

<p>What&#39;s the one thing all powerful people have in common? They&#39;re selfish fucks who want to keep it all for themselves. Not surprisingly, they&#39;re all pretty rich too.  This means they like to get out of paying taxes as much as they can. It also means they have a huge need to move their $$$ around in secret.</p>

<p>So crooked government types, business owners, drug lords and old money families all have something in common... access to the dark financial system of money laundering.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read articles about how casinos, real estate, art and crooked charities/foundations are all used to get money out of a country and into off-shore tax havens. I&#39;ve seen documentaries showing how Trillions of $$$ are stashed away in places like Panama and the Cayman Islands. </p>

<p>If there was a serious effort to shut these places down, rich people would still be rich... but there would be a lot more money to fund decent things like education, healthcare and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Yet for some strange reason, all we hear about is tax cuts and how we should be scared of Iran, Russia or North Korea. </p>

<p>&quot;You guys all be scared of this shit while we keep robbing you blind.&quot;</p>

<p>Classic distraction tactic.</p>

<p>I’m an ex Mormon, born and raised Mormon. LDS culture is very child-like. Nobody swears, drinks liquor, or smokes. At least around others. They avoid topics like sex and they are even told to “avoid loud laughter”. They are some of the most mildly mannered people you’ll ever meet. It’s really wild. </p>

<p>In some circle, it&#39;s not &quot;money laundering&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;wealth management&quot; and &quot;tax planning&quot; and then they just change the law to favour themselves through &quot;lobbying&quot;. Lots of corporations are going to bring back their money for their shareholders, paying change in taxes, after the tax bill. The vast majority of Americans won&#39;t benefit from that, but will see their social benefits cut off to pay for this. But they will say they will reinvest it and it will benefit the whole economy (they won&#39;t use the term &quot;trickle down&quot; anymore after it&#39;s been shown for the fraud that it is), and a sizeable number of people will believe it, no matter the fact that it&#39;s never been shown to work like that. Money invested in infrastructure, institutions and bettering the health and education of the population is what grow an economy, money given to rich people mostly get reinvested in bubbles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, cause corporations have much better records of doing well with money. Look around and see what of the systems that you enjoy everyday, from the highway you use, the public utility, the food and water safety, the schools that otherwise many could not afford, the emergency services you don&#39;t have to bargain with while you&#39;re in the midst of an emergency, even the justice system that they&#39;re trying to break everyday, which of that will exist without a government accountable to the people?

<p>It&#39;s not conspiracy, it&#39;s a fact</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pet peeve of mine.  I think you meant &quot;it&#39;s not a conspiracy <strong>theory</strong>, it&#39;s a fact.&quot;  But the OP never claimed it was a <em>theory</em>, they said it was an actual conspiracy.</p>

<p>A conspiracy is a group conspiring to do something (usual shady) and it is a phenomenon that absolutely does exist and nobody (who knows the definition of the word) contends that conspiracies don&#39;t exist.  A conspiracy <strong>theory</strong> is a theory that a conspiracy is occurring and that theory may or may not have merit.</p>

<p>I think that there has been such a campaign to discredit conspiracy theorists that the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; has become conflated with the phrase &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and people dismiss both as craziness.  It&#39;s really unfortunate and I try to set the record straight when I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say for sure, but probably not.</p>

<p>I would estimate that near 100% of the risk would come from your actual illegal activities being identified.  If it was in the UK you&#39;d definitely trigger a money laundering check when the money was deposited in a bank.  And the bank would forward that information to the authorities.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d gotten interesting in Bitcoin mining years ago, that could have been sitting in your wallet for years.  There was a story a few years ago about a guy who bought a pizza with Bitcoin.  That amount would be worth millions (possibly even tens of millions) now.</p>

<p>As long as you paid the tax and you hadn&#39;t been linked to the illegal source I doubt anyone would blink at it much.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has a public blockchain. There is no “claim it came from this....” when they can say “well, we see here <em>from the entire network</em> that your wallet address received 137 BTC On January 5th at 11:39pm last year; how did you purchase these coins? Can you prove that the purchase was not illicit?” </p>

<p>This is how a public ledger works. It’s not cash. It’s not private or anonymous unless you’re adept with networking fundamentals, to be honest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the tax havens are tolerated because they&#39;re probably wired up to the intelligence services -- the list of tax havens includes a lot of former and current British territories that have loopholes that make them independent from the UK tax system.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also probably tolerated because they ultimately convert a lot of their client holdings back into government bonds -- US T-bills or whatever the equivalent UK and Euro bond instruments are.  So the money actually gets put back into service funding governments (albeit for interest payments to those providing the funds).</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see a technical breakdown of how tax haven banks manage their clients money -- I&#39;m guessing its not cash, but there probably <em>is</em> a large amount of cash on hand.  I&#39;d also be curious about precious metals holdings as well as safe deposit box/vault services.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting to look at the US as a tax haven, albeit not for US entities, but for non-US/Euro citizens looking to extract wealth from their own countries.  There are tons of condos and houses in the US that sit empty and are owned by foreign nationals through US LLCs that hide the actual owners.   Some of this is &quot;thug money&quot; from kleptocratic government lackeys and some of it is more-or-less on the level people from China looking to move wealth out of China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to start a fight with you, but I don&#39;t think you really know what money laundering is or what offshore tax havens are used for.</p>

<p>Money laundering is literally the opposite of what you proposed, that is, to avoid paying taxes.  Money laundering is about making illegal income become legal through paying taxes (albeit at the lowest legal rates).</p>

<p>Why would a criminal actually want to pay taxes on his money?  So he can spend it.  Suppose you have $1million from selling drugs or something.  If you tried to buy anything substantial, like a house or a yacht, the IRS would come knocking on your door within days demanding to see where you got that money from and why you haven&#39;t paid taxes on it when it was earned.   Now, you are three times screwed because not only will your illegal activities be investigated, but all that money will confiscated due to civil forfeiture laws AND you could even be hit with income tax evasion laws.</p>

<p>Additionally, no sums of money greater than $5000 (used to be $10k but got lowered) can ever leave the country (except if you risk secretly carrying cash on a plane) without it being reported to the IRS.  </p>

<p>So in a nutshell, money can not be wired to offshore tax havens unless you&#39;ve already paid taxes on it.  (Thru laundering if it was gained by illegal means)</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t get depleted. What they do is set up a charity or foundation. Then they fund it with their own money in different ways. One is to set up a trust for the foundation so it never runs out of funding.</p>

<p>Technically the $$$ now belongs to the foundation, but the Rockefellers set it up to achieve their own agenda... so no real difference in terms of ultimate control.</p>

<p>Now these families don&#39;t seem so wealthy anymore, when in reality they&#39;ve got as much influence as ever.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Same goes for Schiffs, Warburgs, Vanderbilts etc. I just don&#39;t accept the idea that a family with so much wealth could see it erode over a few generations.</p>

<p>The reason most often given is that the wealth gets split up as the family increases in size. But that would mean the same amount spread across more people... not less $$$ in total.</p>

<p>Also, these people have what&#39;s called cultural capital. That&#39;s a fancy way of saying they know how to be wealthy and how to stay that way. If there&#39;s anything rich people know how to do, it&#39;s to get even richer.</p>

<p>If the Rockefellers were worth the equivalent of $340 Billion in 1937, they could easily be in control of 5 times that much today. Not in the form of personal wealth, but maybe through their behind the scenes control of all those foundations and organizations.</p>

If we have some and want more its a tool of slavery. The real object of their behaviour is to gain power.

They are the ones holding the majority of the money so they are the ones on the receiving end of all that energy. Its called black magic but its not the shit you&#39;ve been taught to think it is. The only thing we have is our energy everything else has to be given to us, clothes, houses, jobs,money, cars etc.  The one thing we actually own we wish away to people that are&#39;nt going to wish it back to us.

<p>You already got there.  The rulers of society are all psychopaths. And the systems in place are setup to make sure they remain in power. The money laundering is just the financial arm.</p>

<p>There is a reason that alk societies have a vampire myth. </p>

Those that try their best to do so are shit holes where the poor live next to open sewers, 5 years olds scavage the dump for aluminum cans so they can eat, and workers die from unsafe work condition with barely any compensation and no changes. Why don&#39;t you visit those places and see what countries without a functioning government, without protection for the vulnerables from the private sector, are like?</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that that large of a fortune has been depleted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t get depleted. What they do is set up a charity or foundation. Then they fund it with their own money in different ways. One is to set up a trust for the foundation so it never runs out of funding.</p>

<p>Technically the $$$ now belongs to the foundation, but the Rockefellers set it up to achieve their own agenda... so no real difference in terms of ultimate control.</p>

<p>Now these families don&#39;t seem so wealthy anymore, when in reality they&#39;ve got as much influence as ever.</p>
