<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Antisemitism&quot; being used more as a deterrent phrase in the news, political world, and other media to anyone who questions the United States government relationship with Israel&#39;s. This will probably be more prevalent as time goes once more Americans are aware of how their government is aiding Saudia Arabia in &quot;occupying&quot; Iran and later Lebanon through their &quot;friendship&quot; with Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>More soft &quot;disclosure&quot; disinformation steering towards UFO&#39;s and Aliens (UFO&#39;s doesn&#39;t = Aliens: It just means unidentified flying object) </p></li>
<li><p>Patriot Act is about to expire and will probably get renewed with scare of ISIS being on US soil.</p></li>
<li><p>No answers will be given about the Las Vegas shooting.</p></li>
<li><p>North Korea will remain the Boogeyman for now until further coverage of dealings in the Middle East are necessary for patriotic lunacy in &quot;establishing peace and democracy&quot; in the needed regions.</p></li>

<p>lol that reminds me of the time that MMA dude pretended to be a trans girl just to enter into the women&#39;s ticket. He ended up absolutely wrecking everybody out there, pretty gruesome stuff if you look into it. I dunno if they made a rule about it after they kicked him out, but they did end up having to kick him out. Also, I guess I should have mentioned this one first, but there was a time when I think Serena Williams boasted that she could take anyone from like the men&#39;s top 100-200 tennis players, so this one dude, ranked like at the bottom of the limits for the range that Serena had set, got up and was like &quot;ok, then. I&#39;ll take that challenge&quot;, so a date was set, and it was all publicized to be a girl power thing. The day comes and Serena&#39;s all pumped and what not, then there&#39;s other bro who smokes, drank the night before and is known for avoiding training. He ends up just obliterating her, and it like took the wind out of the sails of the whole event. At the end he goes &quot;top 350-500, she&#39;d wipe the floor with them&quot; lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. For myself I&#39;m still staying positive and hopeful where I wanna take my self this next year and further.  I hope all of you do too. </p>

<p>This information war is going to get worse especially now more people are &quot;seeing&quot; the facade, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s being more out and in the open for a purpose of providing a leash of &quot;truth&quot; to lead people into further control and disinformation unless you&#39;re properly checking your sources, your sources&#39; sources (etc), and thinking critically.   </p>

<p>In other words, people&#39;s held convictions and religious views are going to be used more intensely as tools to poke, prod, and lead an agenda that doesn&#39;t have the common people&#39;s interest in any way, shape, or form.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not Jews it&#39;s the concept of Zionism and the elite that are the keys here. Many citizens of Israel that are of the Jewish faith and Jewish race have a huge problem with Zionism and renounce it not wanting it to be associated with the Jewish citizens of Israel. They are also having a huge problem with their Prime Minister Netanyahu and his corruption within their political system. Does that sound familiar with any other countries where the citizens are not properly represented by their organizations and leaders?</p>

<p>Jews are NOT the problem it&#39;s the higher echelons of the elite that control their country and others. The elite have no allegiances to religion, race, country, or political beliefs. They are on a different program of overall getting Globalism as the control to &quot;unite&quot; the world.</p>

<p>You are only provoking and adding to the problem with this legitimate overall concern  getting muddied in the waters of being labeled to &quot;White Power&quot; groups and &quot;Anti-Semitic&quot; hate speech when it&#39;s clearly not.   </p>

<p>Any Jew who buys this shit has no one to blame but himself when his family is murdered in Israel </p>

<p>It’s people like you screaming about khazars and white genocide which make sure I support the most extreme measures to help Zionism- never concede to idiots like you who blame Jews for their dicks not working </p>

<p>I praise the day Israel nukes every western nation when they finally think it’s time to get rid of the Jews- I will sing glory to the death of every child who dies</p>

<p>I see what’s on this sub and I tell every liberal Jew- the goy is not your friend! They blame you for their dick not working, their poverty, every terror attack and all their problems is on the Jew </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha..point taken. I did put &quot;predictions&quot; in quotes for the purpose to be a little tongue in cheek. I mostly just wanted some dialog of where people&#39;s heads were at in what was going on in the world right now and where they see it going...since it&#39;s been more and more insane in the last couple years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, just busting your internet balls.</p>

<p>TBH... I sometimes wonder if things are getting more insane... or if we are just seeing more of the insanity with how interconnected our world is now compared to 1998 before the internet was really mainsteam. Perception vs reality kinda of thing. </p>

<p>I hope, truly, that the new year is good to us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not Jews it&#39;s the concept of Zionism and the elite that are the keys here. Many citizens of Israel that are of the Jewish faith and Jewish race have a huge problem with Zionism and renounce it not wanting it to be associated with the Jewish citizens of Israel. They are also having a huge problem with their Prime Minister Netanyahu and his corruption within their political system. Does that sound familiar with any other countries where the citizens are not properly represented by their organizations and leaders?</p>

<p>Jews are NOT the problem it&#39;s the higher echelons of the elite that control their country and others. The elite have no allegiances to religion, race, country, or political beliefs. They are on a different program of overall getting Globalism as the control to &quot;unite&quot; the world.</p>

<p>You are only provoking and adding to the problem with this legitimate overall concern  getting muddied in the waters of being labeled to &quot;White Power&quot; groups and &quot;Anti-Semitic&quot; hate speech when it&#39;s clearly not.   </p>
