       I recently started trying to read more, specifically about the things that intrigue me, like consciousness, remote viewing, aliens. I read Russel Targ’s The Reality of ESP and I throughly enjoyed it. I then started reading The Twelfth Planet by Zecharia Sitchin and I was fascinated with it...until about half way through when I decided to look into it, realizing it’s pretty well accepted that the authors information is basically nonsense. So I guess my question is: what are some must read books that are factual and intriguing, relating to things such as consciousness, aliens, basically the things that are commonly ignored and looked at as the interests of loonies. Something that makes you sit there and wonder if what is commonly accepted as truth is, in fact, wrong.

       There's certainly some speculation towards the end of the book I can't speak for, but if nothing else it gets wildly entertaining.

       Graham Hancock,  timothy leary, Terrence mckenna, Frank Herbert(he's a Sci fi writer,  but his explorations of consciousness, genetic memory, etc were ahead of their time), philip k dick(similar to Herbert but a way more intense background story) , buckminster fuller, Robert monroe (remote viewing +astral travel, his gateway program was featured in the CIA foia archives as a viable structure for psychic activity and they based much of their training off that program, in that same vein the entire cia foia archives is ripe full of original conspiracy reading, much of it written by government scientists) ..... manly p hall, dan winters, Nassim Harriman, marko rodin,  harmony of the spheres, explore the classic philosophy,  modern philosophy, history, then when you think you know it all ? presume everything is wrong and read their opponents

       Very empowering, about how modern "christianity" is nothing like Jesus preached, which you can see for yourself in the un-adultered parts of the bible and by testing his words for yourself. Basically: "love is the answer, but don't trust me, see for yourself by acting in love". Very thorough, accessible, and convincing, but again: see for yourself!

        Stalking the Wild Pendulum: On the Mechanics of Consciousness

       Bentov was highly referenced in an analysis of the Gateway Project, which was a course created by Robert Monroe of the Monroe Institute for the purpose of accelerating progress towards altered states of consciousness.  Fun fact, Bentov also designed Israel's first rocket.

       The Origin Of Consciousness by Julian Jaynes is even more important in my opinion. It provides a framework of ideas which will allow you to see history and consciousness in a new light. It contains the basis for all of our human experience.

       You should check out r/projectSTARGATE.

       As for books, I have a ton I could recommend, but I would start with 'Penetration' by Ingo Swann. Thats got conciousness, aliens, and Remote Viewing all in 1 amazing book, written by the man that coined the term "Remote Viewing."

       After hearing Targ talk about Ingo Swann so much I can’t believe I didn’t think to look for a book by the man himself. I thank you

       He's got a lot of great books, and many can be downloaded for free as pdfs. 'Penetration' is the best starter though. He also started a "History of Remote Viewing" online, but died before completing it. Still worth reading though.

       A few more books, less about actual conspiracies, and more about the nature of perception and reality would be:
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons and Persons – by Derek Parfit (an in-depth look at psychological reasons for all manner of actions taken by man)
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern Man in Search for a Soul, as well as Man and his Symbols – by Carl G. Jung (a study of psychological archetypes and symbols throughout time. Still highly relevant if you want to understand people's motivations and beliefs, as well as the stories we tell ourselves)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ishmael, My Ishmael, and The Story of B – by Daniel Quinn (a story across three books about individuals with a genuine desire to save the world, and what such a journey may entail. The Story of B is particularly interesting, as it sheds some light on the Jesuit order and their potential motivations for deception)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind – by Julian Jaynes (discussing how man's mental dynamics evolved from automatisms to conscious self-awareness and choice through the "invention" or discovery of metaphor and other mental structures, leading to the death of our gods and the establishment of God within (something like that))
      </p>
      <p>
       Siddharta – by Hermann Hesse (A must-read work on some of the eternal concepts of easter philosophy, as well as personal growth and spiritual realization. A great guide to life, along with all his other works, from Steppenwolf to The Glass Bead Game)
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditations – by Marcus Aurelius (a principal guide on Stoic philosophy)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Doors of Perception – by Aldous Huxley (describing his experience of an afternoon on mescaline, relating it to transcendental experiences of many kinds, from gold to fireworks, along the way)
      </p>
      <p>
       Gödel, Escher, Bach – by Douglas Hofstadter (this is the next book on my reading list, so I haven't yet begun. It supposedly illuminates aspects of the recursive/synchronistic/or even holographic nature of reality by drawing parallels between Gödel's mathematics, Escher's art, and Bach's musical compositions, and extending those to DNA, computer code, and a range of other domains.)
