       Mostly on sites and channels that cater to the 18-35 demographic. They never give reasons like the growing poverty rate, homelessness, etc either — its always some stupid shit like “OMG WASNT 2017 TERRIBLE BECAUSE OF LE DONALD DRUMPH?!”

       What’s up with all the pessimism and nihilism these days? It’s like they’re training everyone to be unhappy.

       Yes, started to see it in 1999 and because I managed so many powerful sites I would quell the negativity. Now these super powerful social sites are just a swamp of psychological deprivation that it is the norm, what’s expected.

       People are negative and it’s very bad for everyone to be exposed by it.

       He is far less popular then when he got elected and even then he was elected due to low voter turn out for the Democrats. Remember though, even with the low voter turn out of Democrats, a majority of the country still chose the Democrat. He is the least popular president in his first year.

       To be 100% fair I can see why kids have no hope.  I was born in 1966, I grew up in a world that taught be no matter how bad it gets I can fight back and pull my head above water.  by the mid 80's, when corporate control of America took over, when laws were passed allowing corporations to claim false bankruptcy to raid the pensions of their employees I started to realize we were fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is I had a part of my life where there was hope.  I have a 17 year old daughter and a 21 year old daughter. Their only hope is that they are insane smart like my wife, their mother, and I can't be more thankful for that.  Their cynicism makes me happy, it is the only defense mechanism they have against three generations older than them that appear to share one goal, steal every fucking dime they can so they can live a life they didn't earn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am fine with pessimism and nihillism, it is the only way the younger generation can justify watching their future being stolen from them.  There is a very smart group of kids that don't watch the Kardashian's that are shitting their pants because they know what they have to do, and their pessimism and nihilism are their only hope against the assholes trying to pick their pockets.

       I disagree when you say we're fucked, and honestly (and I saw this with respect because you are a father of two children and seem like a nice dude), that's kind of a chicken shit mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody who has given up hope or promotes these unhealthy coping mechanisms like pessimism and nihilism like you're suggesting is just kind of being a baby. We are in the midst of a massive global awakening, and the social engineers are trying to put out our fire before it spreads.

       The only way that things will truly get better is after the collapse. We've moved past the point at which it was still a possibility to combat the direction that the world/nations/humanity are being prodded. Things are going to get worse before they get better. I have hope for the future, but it may or may not be within my lifetime (and I only just turned 24) that things will truly turn around. I love the idea of hope and I think that having hope is important, law of attraction, blah blah blah, but I can't help being a realist about what I see going on around me. I've always been an idealist and I'm not just saying that, but this is different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is though, I don't care what happens to me and that's where the nihilism comes in. Because all of these things are much bigger than me as an individual. All I can do is live every day doing the best that I can and being kind.

       I'm so glad you posted this. It's all very true. I get told almost daily by people who know me that I'm negative, cynical. Those people don't realize that this is the age of deception; that we are living a life of futile peasantry masked poorly by the illusion of wealth in the form of cheap plastic bullshit and credit card debt; or that a secret world government exists and it's run by cultists; or that I've never been paid actual MONEY in my entire life and never will until the FED is abolished.

       This is my biggest thing. I was born early eighties and thought I had hope.  Now I have two kids and I don't see any hope for them.  Years ago having kids and raising a family was the American dream,  now we have a whole generation who can't find justification for even having kids,  and I can't blame them.  Blessed are the young,  for they will inherit our mistakes.

       Have you ever noticed how grim the presidential campaigns are, every time?  Both mainstream party candidates drone on endlessly about how bad the nation is, and how they can fix it.  And, four years later, same fucking issues, same promises, etc.  It's like this country sucks ass and they can't actually fix it.

       2017 started with me and my brother helping a drunk man get home. He puked on us/in my brother's car, couldn't remember where he lived, and then when we finally got him home at past 3am he decided to go walk to a gas station to get pizza. It was freezing cold, he wasn't dressed appropriately, and was still drunk. The rest of the year kinda followed the theme of that night.

       I'm a bit young, so I haven't seen a time where media wasn't horribly pessimistic. It may just be that he world has gone to shit, but it also could be trying to forcing learned helplessness onto society. (Pretty much, learned helplessness is a mindset of "well, nothing ever goes right, so it isn't worth trying", developed by bad living conditions, abuse, trauma, etc.)I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was the second one, seeing all the BS the government has pulled in the past.

       What the fuck are you talking about? That has zero to do with his popularity and approval ratings.
He is the only president, at the very least, since Truman, who has held a net negative rating at this point in his presidency.
More people disapprove of him than approve, thus making him unpopular.

       The media narrative was certainly fraught with tension and fear over undefined feelings and fictions.

       How does the corporate media reflect the lives we live?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from injecting tension through persistent dramatic crisis and an insidious reminder of the feeling of personal powerlessness in the plot lines of power incomprehensible to the harried, work a day "consumer" the corporate media is negative programming.
