       Come on guys that kind of stuff shouldn't be happening this frequent. This has to stop we need to wake people up and stop reinforcing the idea that these two parties are actually fighting against each other. All of our presidents are from the same bloodline for crying out loud...

       i guess you see what you look for.  i'm not looking for it and i tend not to read the political posts because i feel they're divisive for the most part.  unless it's a divisive issue that affects me and i see manifested around me i try not to perpetuate what i perceive as a broken model.  you could be right.  it also could just be seeded there intentionally to wind people up.  this latest mod request for submission statements seems to have really decreased the amount of windy-up spam that was plaguing this sub for a while.  but maybe you're right.  i just wish people would converse accurately and avoid the broken model type arguments.

       I appreciate your effort, I truly do.  However, a handful of posts over a year's time with vote counts ranging from zero to a couple hundred each, all of whose comment sections are at least balanced in terms of pro/anti Trump, isn't very convincing.

       I'm not sure what the original claim was, but if it was debunking the claims that this sub is "a T_D circlejerk," then it was on the mark, but with shitty evidence, so here is some actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim "this sub is a T_D circlejerk" in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don't exist and continue with the anti-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.

       If you check the comments of supposedly "pro-Trump" posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There's nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but that's complete bullshit. Posts that don't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in the first place if they weren't heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached
       <a href="/r/all">

       To the people who claim anti-Trump comments can be explained because some threads in this sub make it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , I'll show you a few threads that are below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but to be conservative, I'll keep the threshold under a 1000 to guarantee that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regulars are the ones making and upvoting these comments.

       It sure isn't racial division.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I put myself or someone I trust in power of distributing food, health care, housing, or education, I know that people will be treated fair and equally.  There is a human component of compassion and also a human component that deeply desires efficiency.  How else would we have strived to develop tools and make it this far?  How would we have come together tribally, then in villages?
      </p>
      <p>
       People who want to put the power solely in individuals are corrupted by self-interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple as that.  You either feel compassion and the sanctity of human life and believe we can develop distributed human systems to care for our needs, or--based on your own self knowledge of corruption--want to keep things out of anyone else's hands.

       I think we should be allowed to make a case for those who we feel are shills.  Just saying "no, you're a shill" isn't productive, but if there is legit reason to suspect then I think a conspiracy sub should allow for that to happen.

       The problem with calling someone a shill is that it shuts down conversation. On reddit conversations arent just for the benefit of the people talking but others who see those posts. As such if a shill argues a point and you respond by calling them a shill, then you are doing their job for them. Thats not even getting into all the times people use shill to mean "someone who disagrees with me".

       Agreed. Any decent conspiracy theorist knows two party system is just a puppet show - pseudo choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The chief problem of American political life for a long time has been how to make the two Congressional parties more national and international. The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy … [E]ither party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired, unenterprising, and vigorless. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which will be none of those things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies." Prof. Carroll Quigley in "Tragedy and Hope" (one of Bill Clinton's political mentors)

       The partisan crap from both sides has increased significantly over the past year or so. Threads from here could look like a mirror of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       . I'm not sure what that depends on, but maybe it's depending on which group of shills/trolls has brigaded a thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's one example, but there are many more if you pay attention:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m921i/friends_theorists_countrymen_lend_me_your_ears/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m921i/friends_theorists_countrymen_lend_me_your_ears/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If I find it, I'll edit in this one I remember with people defending snopes at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what the comments say, which comments were downvoted, upvoted, and by how much. What was said and what went on in that thread would never have happened here a few years ago. It seems that people are prevented from figuring out that there is a lot of nuance.

       Because you are trying to pin the division purely on t_d instead of acknowledging that r/politics and/or r/TopMinds absolutely have something to do with it too.  You are part of the problem if you do not recognize that blaming only one side is the damage that we are talking about.

       Too many people make political parties part of their self-identity. This isn't an accident, it is in fact the result of intentional efforts on the part of politicians. It serves their needs quite well, it harms the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people will keep buying into it, for much the same reasons cult members can never leave their own identity groups.

Honestly i dont think we can trust the left government... the right government is who are really looking out for our safety.

       However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.

       Anybody left in this sub who still keep ties to any individual party is missing the entire point of this sub. Granted, it's a theory in the technical sense, but I think it's pretty obvious that the major parties in the US have different agendas from the party members they "represent." The only way to remove corruption from politics in general, is to remove any material benefit from serving in office. Serving in office, in the purest sense, should be benefit-by-beneficial policy. In other words, the only reason/motivation to serving in office is the betterment if the citizenry. I believe in capitalism, when there isnt corporate interests holding the entire economy together; meanwhile the majority of Americans are just getting by.

       It's just a byproduct of trying times. When things in the world get particularly precarious, partisanship rises. This is a natural reaction for human beings: when things get tough, people tend to fall in around their in-group.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last few years are particularly bad because: 
* The internet amplifies voice, and provides the illusion of large scale support (internet bubbles).
* Governments, corporations, and political movements, utilizing AI and social media, have an unprecedented capability for propaganda and social influence (by hiding the provenance of information in the anonymity of the net).
*  Globalization is pushing very diverse cultures and diverse problems in those cultures together into one big mix. We are unequipped and too uneducated to deal with the problems of vastly different cultures -- yet we have the capability of interacting with them, regardless of our knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is important people monitor their own behavior online. Try to be as cool as possible. No one will ever agree with everyone else. Say your piece, keep as cool as possible. Move on (preferably without saying so or why) if you feel nothing good is coming out of a particular dialogue or argument.  We can change the atmosphere only by demanding better of ourselves and engaging with each other respectfully.  Understand anger, but do not respond to it with anger.

       I don't get it either.  As if one side or the other gives a flying fuck about you or me or the rest of the poors.  For the most part, the politicians have sold out to the highest bidder $$$$$$, at the expense of the American people.

       because people are fucking retarded and because of that they are blind to the fact that all we know is a lie, and that the group they're in is equally guilty as sin as the rest of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       all existing groups and religions are compromised. all belief systems, all economic systems, everything. it has been for thousands of years since before any of us were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no them and us. people have to be reborn as children with blank-slate minds to see the truth. that even their group is an equal portion of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       without that, there can be no them and us, only everyone in one big group being manipulated to hate each other.

       The Radical Left and Radical Right are much closer to one another than they are the centrist status quo. It is a divide and conquer tactic that keeps those of us who question the system from uniting in our efforts.

       Team politics is currently the most effective tool of division employed. This propaganda is
       <strong>
        <em>
         designed
        </em>
       </strong>
       to entrap people, so remember not to demonize those who fall into the trap - that is their intention. Some people here are shills, undoubtedly, but others have fallen victim to the divide and conquer techniques and nonshill vs 'supposed shill' is yet another form of division tptb would like to see. Partisanship is a trap and your fellow posters must be educated past that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The techniques employed are quite literally designed to take advantage of human nature and turn us against each other so as much as we'd like to write off every supposed shill or partisan we must remember that some are indeed real people still drinking the koolaid that was
       <strong>
        <em>
         designed
        </em>
       </strong>
       to be drunk.

       "The right and the left are the same" sounds like a cynical, smart thing to say.  It's something I used to say, like of course our corporate overlords don't care who wins, it feels like a really mature idea.  But the reality is that it is naive.  The right has sold America to corporations.  There's the conspiracy I am here for.

       I took a short break from conspiracies when I was dealing with personal issues,  and then I came back 6 months later.  Immediately it was apparent to me just how much of t_d had bled over into this sub.  To the extent that i get partisan it's just too push back at what I see to be a disturbing number of Trump cheerleaders shitting all over the place.
