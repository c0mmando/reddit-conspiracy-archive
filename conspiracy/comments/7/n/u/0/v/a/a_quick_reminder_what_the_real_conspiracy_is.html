        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Divide and keep the people separated and hating each other.</p>

<p>If we could just stop all the shenanigans and start working together instead of against each other, helping fellow beings instead of kicking while they are down, we would all be in a far better place.</p>

<p>We are, in essence, all the same, just different individuations of this essence and some of those individuations need more help than others to realize this.</p>

<p>Why do so many people fall for the campaign of hate all the time and don&#39;t just stop and think for a moment? </p>

<p>Property,  Religion,  Borders, all those tools are being used to give you a reason to hate. </p>

<p>If you truly feel superior over another being, then give that superiority a good use and help the other being achieve a similar state. For every service you do for another being is also a service for yourself, but in a positive way. </p>

<p>All this hate and anger have gotten way out of hand.</p>

<p>Edit: Thank you for all of your responses, I hope that all of you who haven&#39;t found the positivity will find it soon. </p>

<p>I feel like I have to explain a little bit more:</p>

<p>What I meant to say was don&#39;t get caught up too much in &quot;the system&quot; just live a positive life and be the beacon of light for others. You always get what you give, so if you do not only speak in a positive way, but honestly act positive without expecting anything in return, life will give it back to you in a positive way.</p>

<p>No one brought up hating wealthy people. The person you responded to was pointing out that division is due to action by the wealthy. We who are being divided up are the common people, the working class, and the wealthy are doing the dividing. Not every wealthy person is an evil monster, but everyone who is on top and is benefiting from this sick society is wealthy. Comparing material exploitation that ends lives to feeling hate toward an oppressor is ignorant. </p>

<p>Man are you as bad as everyone else with that limited thinking. Corrupt unions, welfare leeches, politicians, corporations, EVERYONE is fucking up the nation because there is no oversight, no system can function without massive oversight. </p>

<p>It is because YOU spend all your free time complaining and none of it providing oversight that the world is run by incompetents and thieves. </p>

<p>Detroit as an example is a hellhole because the people allow it to be, electing the greatest mayor in the world won&#39;t fix it, it is top to bottom fucked because millions of people helped in fucking it. </p>

<p>The only way to fix Detroit is for millions of people to choose to unfuck it, and it&#39;s unlikely that will happen, because most smart people would just move to a better place, leaving only a handful of motivated enterprising people to fight a losing battle against millions of lazy leeches waiting for someone else to fix their problems. </p>

<p>Sure they elect some corrupt officials, because they the citizens are largely corrupt, but there are also a lot of people there busting their fucking asses day in and day out to help make a difference, but a few hundred people can&#39;t fix hundreds of thousands that don&#39;t give a fuck. </p>

<p>Not until YOU hold your local officials and then your government officials accountable, will you get change.</p>

<p>Not until YOU pick up a garbage bag, will your parks be clean.</p>

<p>Not until YOU hold those accountable to the fire will children be fed nutritious meals instead of prison slop. </p>

<p>This sub has half a millions whiners and bitchers but very few doers. Imagine a world where all half a million subs spent their days looking at budgets, finding corruption and waste and fuck ups and working to fix them. </p>

<p>The world sucks because WE SUCK. If you want kids to be fed, posting here does DICK, and they will eat shit or not eat at all until we all storm the offices of those in charge and demand they stop blowing money on corruption, PR projects to put their name on, and back room deals and direct it to feeding all children healthy meals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the rich people boogeyman. Keeping millennials entitled since 2001. </p>

<p>Wealthy people sometimes conspire against everyone else, sure. Cartel like behavior is one way. But the most common way for wealthy individuals to conspire against common people is USING THE GOVERNMENT. They buy influence and there is no way to stop this even if you made it illegal that would not change a thing. </p>

<p>This is why the state is a failed concept. We need to figure out some kind of decentralized way to be accountable for agreements like pollution and then for everything else the NAP will suffice. </p>

<p>You want to know what else le ebil rich boogeymen do??!?!? They fund kickstarters, patreons, loan money for starting businesses, invest in start ups and so on. If you would just be willing to do something for yourself instead of expecting a job to fall in your lap you would realize that rich people are out there that would help you make your dreams come true.</p>

<p>Here is a video about how easy it is to get start up capital from le ebil rich boogeymen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcIRQuCXr0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcIRQuCXr0</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s the beliefs about ourselves that we place on top of this that are different and change are personalities and our priorities, but at the end of the day we are all the same and OP is correct, some need more guidance than others to realise this.

    <div class="md"><p>I like the sentiment but this is (no offense) without a doubt the most profoundly naiive thing I&#39;ve read in quite a long time.</p>

<p>Basically boils down to &quot;I think the world would be a better place if we could all stop hating each other and work together =&#39;]&quot; That&#39;s really cute and everything but if I wanted to read a fifth grade level assessment of the flaws inherent in the human condition I&#39;d go be a school teacher...again, no offense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Property, Religion, Borders, all those tools are being used to give you a reason to hate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What am I reading here!?? What do you suggest we do about &quot;Property, Religion, and Borders?&quot; if they&#39;re such a problem? Get rid of them? Because...you know...that sounds an <em>awful</em> lot like the kind of mentality that is actually <em>part of the problem</em> in the sense that - as far as I can tell - part of &quot;the real conspiracy&quot; is a small, insular group of internationalist financiers and bankers who want to erase national identity (religion and borders) and abolish private property for the masses so that they can rule the world with a pseudo-one world government with little or no opposition from the people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty hard to argue with &quot;all this hate and anger have gotten way out of hand.&quot; It&#39;s pretty hard to argue with &quot;the real conspiracy is divide and keep the people separated and hating each other.&quot; Both of those premises are undoubtably true. But uh...what exactly are you suggesting we do about it?? Seems like you have some very odd ideas on what are causing these problems when you talk about borders, religion, and private property being the root causes..what about usury and speculation being the foundation of the modern economy? What about international bankers controlling vast financial entities and living as supra-national entities? What about the deep state?? Or is the problem just that we need to get rid of our borders and religion??</p>

<p>Honestly want to know your opinion on this, OP.</p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>A visit is one thing; permanent dwelling is another. There is no motivation to permanently live in a foreign country unless your home country is trash or you do not identify with your countrymen.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sorry but a people allowing their enemies to enter into their nation and live there permanently amounts to nothing less than damage to the inhabitants. It is detrimental. If you think true liberty means being able to do whatever you want without restriction, that is just satanism.</p>

<p>Also, Ronald Regan, although his administration did some good things for the economy, was a Vatican internationalist traitor. Regan was the one to formally open diplomatic relations with the Vatican after those relations had been broken off in 1867 when it was shown the Vatican shielded John Suratt - one of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, from being brought to trial. Regan was honored by the internationalist Sovereign Military Order of Malta and was advised by other Knights such as Alexander Haig.</p>

<p>Do you consider a few decades to be &quot;recent&quot;? That&#39;s how old Germany is. Yugoslavia only broke up into smaller countries about 3 decades ago.

<p>Not even remotely. Ever heard of the Schengen area? It&#39;s a free-movement area in Europe. It is an expansion of and removal of borders, and it is beautiful. You don&#39;t need to go through some ultra-serious procedure just to visit another country, you can fucking walk there nowadays.</p>

<p>Not really. Borders have become much more free and open over time. They are no longer manned with armies, and most of them in Europe have been entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>Those nations all still have borders; they all still have territorial possessions, it is not the &quot;destruction of borders&quot; it is merely relaxing some laws about how they are regulating their borders, given that these are allied EU countries; if it were Israel and Palestine, it would be suicidal. These borders as concerning geographic boundaries which separate territories have not changed. All of those nations remain distinct as well. The French remain French, the Germans remain Germans.

<p>The state of alliances or loyalties are not mechanisms of civilisation. What we are talking about, or more specifically, what you are guilty of, is what has been termed an &quot;Ignoring Mechanisms of Civilization fallacy.&quot; The Southern Israelite who has coined this term states there are &quot;basic 
causal 
mechanisms 
inherent in all human civilizations given the 
nature  of 
man  and 
the  world 
he  lives  in.  If  your 
position
contradicts
or 
ignores
one  of  these 
mechanisms your
position is incompatible with human civilization itself. You would then be 
logically 
required 
to leave human civilization and become a 
Buddhist
or a hermit of some kind.&quot;</p>

<p>Without going into detail, the following are said mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Knowable objective value</p></li>
<li><p>The 
Fallen/Wicked Nature 
of Man</p></li>
<li><p>The Family</p></li>
<li><p>Collectivism</p></li>
<li><p>Discrimination</p></li>
<li><p>Hierarchy and caste</p></li>
<li><p>Human Property</p></li>
<li><p>Hereditary identity</p></li>
<li><p>Male Supremacy</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You have already rejected at least two of these.</p>

<p>Firs of all, man is not inherently evil or &quot;wicked&quot;, he is neutral, morally speaking. Secondly, value is measured in subjective ways, and is therefore subject to change, and therefore always subjective. Thirdly, Male supremacy is reducing recently, and the importance of equality is always being touted, and will continue to be so, until male supremacy is a thing of the past. Fourthly, same thing applies to caste and hierarchy, and discrimination. So that&#39;s about 4 &quot;objective&quot; mechanisms of man that are pretty much already being destroyed. I don&#39;t know who the fuck educated you on this, but I sure as hell hope you don&#39;t pass these ideas on to your children.</p>

<p>I think having them associate with our culture makes them overall less violent, because we have the capability to stop them and arrest them, along with convincing them through dialogue that their ways are wrong.

And if you think western culture is not even remotely degenerate, I have some strip clubs to take you to, some X-rated media and pornography to show you, some Blacks rapping about using women as objects and shooting people and doing drugs, I have legal weed shops to show you, I have the party culture to show you, the promiscuous sexual climate especially among young people, drunkenness, adultery, fornication, drug use, gluttony, greed, sloth, pride.

<p>You underestimate, and basically ignore what is called religious ideology. Remember that guy I said who means you harm? That is his religious ideology and you are not going to convince him otherwise. Letting him or anyone else into your domain is harmful. Conversion is futile.</p>

<p>The very fact that people can go through life and not rape someone shows that rationality can control emotions. We are not animals. I have very few words I can say to convince you here.

<p>In the same vein there are fundamentalist Christians who believe people should be stoned for being gay, killed for sex before marriage, etc. That is a religious ideology. The world is not so black-and-white, and people can change, no matter the religion.

<p>Yes they are. Arguably England has more in common historically with France than with the Northern Irish people, yet Britain exists whilst a French-English Union does not.

<p>They are arbitrary. They happen to have been born into a slightly different culture and language to other places. Those arbitrary separations can also be broken and moulded over time, just as the British Empire eventually got the Irish to speak English instead of Gaelic.

<blockquote>

<p>You realise many nations in the world are very young nations? Most of Africa, for example. Many middle-eastern countries too, and western asian, and south american.

<p>&quot;Scratchings&quot; means representation, rather than implementation of an idea, and not only that, but an <em>arbitrary</em> scratching would be the opposite of a specific scratching, and being that abstraction and specification are antonyms, this is indeed an abstraction.

<p>No. There is a natural human inclination to herd with others like ourselves, and that is again why we have nations as these structures are generationally, or hereditarily assumed.</p>

<p>That is called cultural assimilation, and does <em>not</em> guarantee what is called <em>social homophily</em>, which is what you are trying to argue. As wiki states: &quot;Homophily is from Ancient Greek ὁμοῦ (homou, “together”) and Greek φιλία (philia, &quot;friendship&quot;) is the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others.&quot; And to the point: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation">&quot;Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social homophily though as this article states, geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different.[1]&quot;</a></p>

As I also said said, the attitudes of members of a nation can change, but that does not change what a nation is. I said the <em>definition</em> of a nation is static, not the attitudes of its members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yep and the definition of &quot;nation&quot; is BROAD AS FUCK, which is my point. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ipse dixit. You are just repeating an assertion, and ignoring the argument again as well as the definition of a nation. The definition of a nation is specific. A common language is a requirement for a nation, which the United States does not possess which ipso facto means it is not a nation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can STILL argue Europe shares a common history, common descent, and in many ways, a common language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could even argue Northern English people have a DIFFERENT history to Southern English, yet they are combined as a nation. </p>

<p>They are combined as a country, not a nation. The Northern English see themselves as being so different from Southern English people in fact that there were talks of Northern England joining Scotland. Northern England is an example of what is called a cultural area which is very closely related to a nation. </p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;grows in size?&quot; </p>

<p>We&#39;ve gone from tribes, to cities, to city-states, to big sprawling nations. Our &quot;borders&quot; have grown larger over time, and you could argue that eventually they might disappear entirely, or rather than the earth as a planet, would simply be the border.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to give absolutely no rebuttal to my statement... Well done sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To change the attributes of what constitutes a nation is to change the dictionary, and at that point we are no longer talking about a nation.&quot; You then said: &quot;But this has happened quite a lot throughout history..&quot; Saying that various instances of nations&#39; borders have changed, is not an answer to this, and for that matter, borders only change as a result of wars, treaties, etc. As I also said, the attitudes of members of a nation can change, but that does not change what a nation is. I said the definition of a nation is static, not the attitudes of its members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait wait wait, so this whole time your argument has been &quot;the definition of a nation does not change&quot;? Alright, so here&#39;s my question, HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT DISAGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING INTERNATIONAL BORDERS? Which by the way, is the fucking core idea we are arguing here. We can remove borders and simply make nations bigger, based on increasingly close relations between countries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A common language is a requirement for a nation, which the United States does not possess which ipso facto means it is not a nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your definitions are so ridiculously stringent. So let&#39;s look at it from this angle, less Canadians speak English than Americans do, and yet you would agree Canada is considered a nation, correct? But you believe America is not? So if America simply declared English as their language, they would magically become a nation? By comparison, Luxembourg has THREE official languages, yet they consider themselves a nation. Do you disagree with their right to call themselves a nation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spain is completely different from Sweeden as a basic example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then proceeds to again provide absolutely no argument here. You can make the point that western spain is completely different to eastern spain (House Aragon and House Castile were at war with each other viciously for centuries), ergo, by your definitions, they should be 2 nations, and yet they aren&#39;t, showing that nations can grow and expand, and eventually, as the centuries go by, this might happen between Spain and Sweden too. In fact in many ways, it already has, there are no solid borders between those 2 countries, and there is an overarching government linking them both (The EU).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are combined as a country, not a nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are considered a nation, both by me (I am British), by my government, and by fucking international law and recognition, yet you stand against this for some, silly reason. Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Northern English see themselves as being so different from Southern English people in fact that there were talks of Northern England joining Scotland</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a whole host of reasons why they consider themselves to be different... The talks about joining scotland are not even anywhere near the top 10...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Northern England is an example of what is called a cultural area which is very closely related to a nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to me like you&#39;re just making up definitions for the fun of it. Nations change, people change, nations could potentially grow bigger in the future, which may result in all of Europe eventually being considered a &quot;nation&quot;. These are facts.</p>

<p>You already said you believed borders were abstract, so yes, you are saying they are imaginary. Now, provided you are talking about a lawless, barbary situation, and not one where property borders are a matter of law, if one wishes to have a border, then they can have a border; the enforcement of the border is what makes the border non-abstract. A fence is only one means of enforcement. If the fence were removed, the border would still exist. Suffice to say, it is clearl that borders are not arbitrary, nor abstract. Maybe a source of your confusion is what a personal whim means in the context of the word arbitrary. A whim is a spur of the moment, unusual or inexplicable desire. Myself, or a nation wanting to protect themselves, are not personal whims. In summation, you have just been ignoring definitions and arguments. You have already already admitted borders arise for a purpose. And your beliefs on erasing borders and everyone getting along with sunshine and rainbows is a wishful thinking fallacy. This conversation is over. </p>

<p>Yes they are.

<p>This has got to be the tenth time you have ignored an argument and definition. This is the last time I am responding to you. The border indeed exists in the real world, as an enforcement boundary: to experience the boundary, assuming it is a boundary between hostile factions, all one must do is cross it and be detected. The trespasser will be submitted. Just because you cannot necessarily see the border, does not mean it does not exist. By this logic, you must then be forced to say gravity and wind do not exist.  Just as those forces can be felt, the force of a border too can be physically felt, whether that is a fence or a line of machine gunners mowing you down the instant you cross it, like at the edges of the Korean DMZ. </p>

<p>If it is enforced. You put force an example where it IS NOT enforced physically, and therefore abstract.</p>

<p>But this doesn&#39;t happen in practise, in Europe for example. Ergo, before the point at which it IS enforced, it is abstract </p>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s the difference between a physical border and an abstract one you dumbass. Our example was Spain and Sweden, neither of which enforce borders with each other, so therefore they have no physical force or existence. </p>

<p>Implying an entire nation of people are something to be &quot;protected against&quot;, which is the very principle we are disagreeing with you on. People generally desire peace. Those who don&#39;t would be better dealt with if the peaceful people were to band together.</p>

It&#39;s cheaper for an American company to pay for an Indian man educated cheaply in India to fly to and live in the US to do IT, computer engineering, etc. than it is to hire an American educated at the cost of an American education to do the same. And you can say &quot;just fix education in America!&quot; Easier said than done and quite frankly that process is much harder than just moving back to globalized trade without globalized employment. And this is completely discounting the exportation of entire factories, call centers, etc. to Mexico, India, China etc that exploit and enslave.

I agree that not every has to be the same to work together. The problem with the current and system though is that there are too many different sub-groups that seek to be dominant. Having several large groups (that may be broken down further in a like manner) is the closest and most likely solution to the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you are saying as well, I was only proposing the best solution I could think of without major thought. I think that in order to keep current groups, political or not, there needs to be a free exchange of ideas. This means that people should be able to criticize other groups without backlash. (Let me mention as well that this doesn&#39;t mean condoning threats). In the current social climate (atleast here in the US and Canada) this ideal is almost unobtainable. The mainstream has it ingrained that critisizim is equivalent to demeaning or attacking. This narrative needs to disappear before any real change could be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with what you are saying here. The issue is that when people outside of these groups try to push for change (ie. Westerners criticising the hard parts of non-western religions) they are seen as bigoted or even racist by the mainstream. There needs to be critical thinking done by people in and out of each major group about how to help rethink or reform the ideals that they are trying to push. This has to happen without public backlash as well, otherwise you will have people afraid to discus their ideas for fear of ostracism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is definitely true, and to a significant degree. It&#39;s not possible, or at least very very unlikely, for an outside actor to change a group for the better - with respect to the other groups that coexist at the same time - unless they are able to learn the intricacies of that group. The best positive change comes from within. You&#39;re right to say that it&#39;s critical thinking which needs to be encouraged. People can be too easily critical of others, yet often not of themselves. </p>

<p>Even if that were true, meaning is something that is wholly subjective. Saying something &quot;doesn&#39;t have a meaning&quot; is itself a subjective assertion based on personal interpretations of reality. A Godless universe can still have meaning, because meaning is something that ultimately depends on the mind of the person who is assessing said meaning.</p>

<p>People can do that without religion. Do you really go by the bible&#39;s every code of ethics? Even the rules about clothes woven of 2 fibers? Even the one about the logistics of owning slaves?</p>

<p>Plenty of ethical conundrums are solved without a bible, it just means other people came up with better ethical ideas than are present in the bible, ergo, the bible is not the be-all and end-all of ethics, just as the law is not the be-all and end-all of ethics.</p>

<p>Do you really think no one has meaning in their life without a god? Family, friends, loved-ones, natural beauty, animals. You can find meaning in anything, a God is not necessary for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason we even buy things from China is because their borders allow them to produce certain products at an absolute advantage, making them cheaper than we could be producing ourselves. We relegate our resources to more profitable investments, which in turn somebody buys cheaper than we could produce ourselves. This is among many benefits of declaring your state independent than another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have to find a way to stop playing the Primate Dominance Game™ or we&#39;re going to exterminate ourselves.</p>

<p>Humans are social animals. We&#39;re driven to form social hierarchies. This is not a conscious process; bonobos in the wild aren&#39;t sitting down with a whiteboard and numbering everybody. Like all beautiful natural structures, it is the aggregate of many smaller, simpler interactions. They look a little bit like this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Encounter another primate who is not obviously foreign and not obviously superior to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Disrespect them in some way. A noise, a shove, bared teeth, stolen food, call his momma fat, whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>If they take it like a bitch and experience shame, congratulations; you outrank them. They may then go attack an even lower primate to make themselves feel better.</p></li>
<li><p>If they resist or respond in kind, generally a fight will ensue that ends either when one of you runs away, dies, or the fight is broken up by a bigger, stronger primate.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you think humans have evolved beyond this behavior simply because we&#39;ve mostly outlawed violence, then you don&#39;t remember high school. Not only do we still do things the old fashioned way, but we&#39;ve invented a whole panoply of innovative ways to dominate each other. Things like taste in music or art or which sports you watch or teams you follow, fitness and drug use (or lack thereof), moral superiority, the law, all these ways for people to assert that they&#39;re better than each other.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard somebody say, &quot;you think you&#39;re better than me?&quot; Did you in turn wonder, &quot;in what sense,&quot; and they didn&#39;t really have a clear answer? They&#39;re talking about this. They&#39;re asking do you think you&#39;re a superior primate to me. Are you of higher station, do you deserve more from the world than I do.</p>

<p>This is the impulse the rich exploit to &quot;keep us fighting with each other so that they can keep going to the bank.&quot; Convince a group they deserve more than another adjacent group and they will fight to claim it.</p>

<p>What do we do about it? We have to learn more about the Primate Dominance Game™ on a societal level so we can train ourselves to stop playing it. You don&#39;t need to be at the top of a social ladder to be a happy and functional human being. You don&#39;t need to be &#39;better than&#39; somebody. You can just be. But you can&#39;t force this view on anyone. They have to arrive at it themselves.</p>

<p>The thesis feels pretty solid, but I need more examples and a couple interviews with academics before I can fill a book.</p>

If anything removing borders brings us together collectively, makes us stronger, makes us undivided. Our identity does not disappear, it simply grows bigger.

    <div class="md"><p>Big picture stuff only.
It all starts at birth. Once you are born you are assigned a social security # which allows money to be created form your birth and put into circulation.</p>

<p>The thing to me is, based on what I&#39;ve learned. It all stems from the banks (using Bayesian Inference). The ones who got this new financial system going and are trying to entangle the planet into it. The more countries that are entangled into it, the more money that can be created, the more wealth can be distributed.. but more importantly for them, if a country under their control gets overthrown by the civilian population, other countries in their grasp can step in and allow corrupt people back into positions of power. Getting rid of slavery sounds like a nice idea, but is it really gone? The system that was in place was unwrapped and repackaged into a more beneficial system that allowed them to control more people, which also lets them create more money, and allow people to believe that they are free. When in reality, we are all slaves to the system now.<br/>
Think you are free? Do me a favor, quit your job, and do whatever you want, whenever you want. Once you run out of money, you will have to continue working again, to benefit the system.. which benefits the people who created the system.  </p>

<p>We might not have kings or queens and the illusion of democracy is here. But if Republicans and Democrats are the only parties whom can win the highest positions, nothing will change. Could it be because they are complicit in keeping the system that makes them rich in place?<br/>
Imagine us younger folks who want change, to come and say nope to all the corrupt old people currently in charge of our society. Change would happen, but how much? How much change would have to happen? and it would inevitably weaken the strength of the U.S. because we would be separating ourselves from the corrupt system that the national bankers have put most of the planet into (and using the U.S. as a military arm).<br/>
Now think about a hypothetical: We (the citizens) enact (somehow) a law that says once you reach X age you aren&#39;t allowed to stay in politics. So now we have a lot of fresh, non-corrupt people into politics, how exactly do we keep the country as a superpower and avoid the grasp of the tentacles that are reaching out throughout the world?<br/>
Do we remake the system to benefit everyone somehow?<br/>
I don&#39;t have the answers, but I think that the internet is one of the big tools that could help end  (intentional, for profit) global catastrophe and prevent wars. That&#39;s why they need control over it, to retain the status quo. We know capitalism, and democracy don&#39;t work. Just watch the wealth gap keep growing, and the homeless keep growing. Debt is literally built into the system. A time will come if something doesn&#39;t change, the rich, and the poor will be the only two classes.<br/>
Still think you have freedom?  </p>

<p>The elite who control our system are (playing the long game). All of the parties that exist to give us the illusion of freedom through voting, exist for that reason.<br/>
Any real change to the status quo won&#39;t happen (yet) regardless of the democrats or republicans who are in office.<br/>
Right now, it doesn&#39;t matter who wins the presidency as it&#39;s just a temporary title, and as long as they are within one of the two parties okayed by the elite (Republicans or Democrats; to maintain the status quo), it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
They will maintain the status quo, and that&#39;s why they are the main two parties and any natural, organic growth or movements created are demonized or ignored.<br/>
Imagine being rich in our current society and having a say in politics to ensure you stay rich, would you want to keep the republicans and democrats in office to ensure that the system that made you rich stays in place? Or, would you be fine with drastic change to the system which could mean abolishing the fed and making your money worthless in a new system?<br/>
However, as a tool, America has successfully been used to spread the current banking system around the planet. Which protects the system in a way, because if it fails here, the wealthy would just migrate to another country under the same umbrella of the world bank.<br/>
We are but cogs in a machine that is bigger than even our own status as a country. Our country is a military arm of a bigger beast.<br/>
When and how the system should change for the betterment of us all, I don&#39;t know personally, but a politician might tell you they have the correct answers, which would benefit them personally no doubt.</p>

<p>This is only half true.  </p>

<p>Yes, if you just do whatever you want whenever you want with zero regard for long term survivability, then yeah, you will end up in a destitute situation.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make us slaves to the system though for two reasons.  </p>

<p>1) You can conceivably choose to live outside the system (hunter-gatherer/nomad lifestyle; off-the-grid housing and commune lifestyles)</p>

<p>2) Regardless of whether you live in our outside the system, you&#39;re not a slave to the system, but a slave to scarcity.  Resources are scarce and labor isn&#39;t free.  Food, water, shelter, clothing, healthcare all require laborers and resources.  </p>

<p>At this point, our collective and individual survival requires hard work. 
 Until we solve the problem of scarcity, you will never be totally free from obligation (if you demand long-term survivability).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, almost any form of off grid living is illegal or behind huge paywalls in the form of permitting fees more expensive than buying a house and property in a city, in much of the USA. First of all, you have no chance of making a case for it on national park land or whatever anymore, you need your own huge chunk of property, so you already have to be part of the landed-class. Then the expensive permitting for everything, which can be denied without explanation. In all of Oregon, there are 24 properties with approved composting toilets, most of which are owned by very wealthy people that have excess time and money to get through the system. Anyone else trying to live off grid, even on their own property? Nope, get back in the rat-race!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like where your head is at, it all is true. But, nowadays we have plenty of technology that could free us from most of what back then would have been pretty time and labor intensive. We already know how to cultivate land, and use that to our advantage to farm. We know how to breed animals, and use that to our advantage for obtaining meats. Now add technology and modern day stuff into the equation.<br/>
Need food for eating?<br/>
Why don&#39;t we use a skyscraper and have different plants growing on each floor in it&#39;s own self-sustained system, monitored and controlled by computers through algorithms (of course with humans to keep it all under control)?<br/>
I understand labor technically will never vanish entirely, however, new technologies and programs could be used to benefit everyone, and minimalize the need for work. Heck, robots are already replacing a lot of peoples jobs right now as I write this.  </p>

<p>All I was trying to get at in my above post, is that the system that we are all currently under to rely on for survival is inherently flawed for the elites against the masses. At the end of the day we are working for them, so they don&#39;t have to.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) You can conceivably choose to live outside the system (hunter-gatherer/nomad lifestyle; off-the-grid housing and commune lifestyles)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, the system can&#39;t change if we decide to just leave it individually like this bullet point suggests. This system is already in place, and effects everyone globally whether you live in the system or outside of it. If you are outside the system or off the grid, you might seem to have some peace, because you are free from the restraints of bills and other stresses that life presents you from within it. However, humans are pack animals, and living outside of the system is not beneficial to the survival of humanity in the long run. Ever see cast-away? You need interaction to stay sane, well to be more specific your brain does. Yes you could feasibly go and buy your own island (brining along other people) and create your own version of the reality you would like, but you would be living alongside a gigantic beast that has no problems taking lives of it&#39;s own citizens. So at what point does living outside of the system &#39;save&#39; you from it? As time passes, you will be forced to deal with it regardless. Or you stay in society, and help change happen for the betterment of all humans.  </p>

<p>A new system, based on protecting humanity as a whole where everyone has a right to survive no matter where they are from could start a change, I mean we are all earthlings right?<br/>
Like I said in the original post, I do not know where humanity should head from here, but I think we&#39;ve fallen so far we&#39;ve pretty much hit rock bottom, and are dressing it up as paradise.<br/>
Think about the struggles you are going through within life, now imagine the wealth gap widening and wars spreading to maintain this system. Are all future children born from this point on just mere cattle to maintain this broken system (more cogs to replace us all, once we pass)?<br/>
We are all earthlings, and I wish no one pain no matter where you are born, or because of the color of your skin. It&#39;s just everyone no matter where you are born is subjected to propaganda from a very young age, and you are literally taught how to think about certain things you are presented with (race, gender, religion, etc..).  </p>

<p>It could be better is all i&#39;m saying. Sorry I went off on a rant there lol.</p>

<p>This right here seems to be part of the solution.  Self-sustaining systems that require minimal to zero human labor and produce the basic needs for survival.  Once society figures that out on a global scale, that’s the beginning of the end of the power of money and the system as we know it.  Don’t know if there’s a path to that, but in theory that seems like where we need to be headed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a world where we are ALL taught from birth that <em>The Best Thing</em> a human can Do is to <em>help another human who needs it and wants it</em> ... </p>

<p>and that &#39;asking for help&#39; is seen as a good thing to do as it gives others a chance to do so.</p>

<p>So kids would be keen to help each other however they could. Wow I could see great things come from such a belief system ... which is basically &quot;do unto others&quot; as we all would like to be helped achieving our dreams (of helping others! etc etc lol)</p>

<p>BUT &quot;greed breeds mean deeds&quot; so <em>we all must be</em> &#39;fair&#39; in our &#39;needs&#39;</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be long before robotic technology will be able to provide us with ALL the food, shelter and clothing we need -- but IF we don&#39;t change the way we interact with others nothing will change or improve.</p>

<p>After all, &quot;do what you did and you&#39;ll get what you got, if nothing changes, <em>nothing</em> changes&quot;</p>

<p>Great thoughts OP, thanks for bringing it up. When &#39;enough&#39; people join together with these ideas, they will happen, and amazingly it only takes the &#39;square root&#39; of the/a population to effect major changes .... and the square root of 7billion is only a few hundred thousand!</p>

<p>In fact I can see that changes beginning to happen as more people &quot;wake up to&quot; the Lies and Deception that&#39;s been foisted upon them by TPTB for far too long now. I truly believe DT is <em>doing</em> some amazing stuff &quot;behind the scenes&quot; BUT nonetheless the effects of these changes will be profound. Shit, what&#39;s just happened in KSA in mind blowing ... and the way the Chinese treated him shows he&#39;s <em>definitely</em> got a great deal of respect and support from them, and as for Russia, well that&#39;s a given with his hotels and Ukraine wife.</p>

<p>I had No idea what to think when he kept banging on about &quot;draining the (DC) swamp&quot; which is a formidable task taking on formidable enemies (the cabal) but imho he&#39;s got some solid advisors and he&#39;s a smart guy, regardless of what the haters say, you don&#39;t get to where he is by being a naive fool!</p>

<p>But fuck me! From what I can see he&#39;s <em>doing exactly</em> as he&#39;s promised. We won&#39;t see much of it reported on the MSM BUT we KNOW there are nearly 9,000 &#39;sealed  warrants&#39; which suggests a LOT of people are going down Big Time ... and combine the new EO&#39;s he&#39;s made regarding human trafficking and pedophilia and I get the feeling we&#39;re <em>finally going to see</em> a turnabout in the way these things are handles once the major players have been taken out, already I&#39;d say about 50 prominent people are no longer so!</p>

<p>And the Hollywood &quot;sex scandals&quot; is to &#39;prime&#39; the masses into believing the stories <em>that will be coming out</em> about the crazy Luciferian shit that goes down amongst the elite and their &#39;friends&#39;! Which no &quot;joe average&#39; would believe Unless they&#39;ve been &#39;led up to it&#39; slowly</p>

<p>just my 3c</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you have said. But I&#39;m skeptical about Trump being a good guy (although I&#39;d much prefer Trump to Hillary) and &quot;draining the swamp&quot; (personnally I think he used this to try to win the presidency). He is a part of the system we are trying to change for the better, after all. Only time will tell really, if he is just another president who keeps the status quo, or actually changes it. Let&#39;s say he does change it, how exactly does he do it to where it benefits most people? By creating more jobs? Well that&#39;s not helping much because that means more people stay in the current system, instead of embracing technological advancement and changing the system to go along with it. Do we really need everyone working 40 hours a week? Well in this system we are currently in, yes, you work, or your life falls apart. How can we change that? I don&#39;t know where to go from here, and the current people (whom actually matter) in government, no matter what side only have $$ on their minds.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO what&#39;s he&#39;s trying to do is a very difficult thing, he&#39;s taken on TPTB <em>except</em> I think he was asked to run by a group of Patriots, of which DT is a huge one! I think some people very high up realized that he was one of the few people who had zero connections to the Big Oil money which has financed the last several POTUSs</p>

<p>And being in the &#39;hotel and high end gold course/resort&#39; business at 70yo no doubt he&#39;s made numerous connections of all type BUT they&#39;re rarely the Big Oil dudes .. he only knows the Saudi&#39;s through his hotels and business investments which is how he got to know so many unique and <em>very</em> wealthy people who I think had a vested interest in seeing Hitlary fail ... and they&#39;re the worldwide nemesis of the Cabal, the cunts who have fucked things up for the past 3 decades. It&#39;s very much in their interests to get rid of such people</p>

<p>I&#39;m an optimist and I believe there are more &#39;good&#39; people in the world than &#39;bad&#39; .. by a great amount, BUT It&#39;s taken them a long time to &quot;catch up to&quot; the cunts/cabal/banksters who have been playing the long game for a few centuries, BUT Now, things have changed and there are some incredibly wealthy asians who <em>love</em> DT. The FACT he dined at the Forbidden City speaks volumes about his &#39;status&#39; over there, shit his grandkid sang a song a Chinese to them! </p>

<p>He&#39;s got Powerful allies across the globe and IMO it was a group of high level military who are sick and tired of being &#39;security&#39; for a bunch of rich cunts business interests and got together and approached DT and told him IF he got the job, they had his back like nobody can and they&#39;d take Great Care of him if he won</p>

<p>He did and &#39;they have&#39; becoz you can bet the house the kids and the car the D&#39;s have done <em>everything</em> they can think of to discredit DT and (surprisingly) he&#39;s a step or two ahead of them and NONE of their Bullshit has stuck! Me thinks becoz the NSA are part of who&#39;s behind him and they&#39;re feeding him A1 info on the actiivities of these &#39;enemies&#39;, who you might notice are &#39;falling&#39; one by one .. and there&#39;s 9000 sealed indictments to go!</p>

<p>No wonder DT appointed a bunch of supreme court judges so quickly, he needed to be sure they&#39;d support his moves which so far they are. The guys playing some <em>really smooth</em> moves BUT I doubt we&#39;ll hear about much of it until well after the events</p>

<p>e.g I believe he will give many of the &#39;bad actors&#39; the opportunity to &#39;bow out gracefully&#39; and &#39;retire&#39; Or face the repercussions of his inteligence <em>on them!</em>. iirc so far over 50 senators have either left or will not be continuing after this term. You can bet there&#39;s a lot more to follow</p>

<p>I honestly think we&#39;re seeing something Truly unprecedented, where this guy who wants for nothing, shit he&#39;s already got more fame and adoration from his tv shows than any of the last POTUSs have ever had! He&#39;s a popular guy who people have watched for 10+ years and they feel they know his style, he&#39;s rough and ready in a classy way, he&#39;s a fuckin billionaire and ALL americans idolize the super rich, as they&#39;ve been taught to</p>

<p>BUT from what I&#39;ve read, he&#39;s appalled by the behavior of the US govt and genuinely wants to change it BUT that&#39;s not going to happen overnight. By getting the Saudi King to arrest all those people and seize their funds he&#39;s been able to completely cut off mangy people&#39;s funds i.e the CF et al. Hillary&#39;s got no money coz she owes SO much from promises she made &quot;when she became POTUS&quot; BUT she didn&#39;t, and that&#39;s fucked her Big time.</p>

<p>Forget &quot;job creation&quot;, that&#39;s a stupid catchphrase dumb politicians use as a &#39;blanket accusation/claim&#39; BUT it&#39;s crap. Have you heard DT talking about &quot;creating jobs?&quot; No. Why not? Cos he&#39;s not into lying.  e.g his recent comments about US &quot;aid&quot; to other countries (which just get&#39;s spent back to the US for weapons, a SCAM that uses taxpeyers money to buy US wepons <em>for other countries</em> making the US MIC LOTS of Money - DT knows this! BUt it&#39;s NOT &quot;his game&quot;) He&#39;s Made his money without resorting to shit like this. Sure he&#39;s no choirboy BUT he&#39;s magnitudes &#39;kinder and more real&#39; than ANY of the last 5-6 presidents were!</p>

<p>He&#39;s lasted over a year and he&#39;s still going strong. If he doesn&#39;t get assainated and I doubt he will, I&#39;m confident he really will do <em>his best</em> with his team to MAGA to the best of their abilities</p>

<p>But first they must neutralize the financiers, Saudi&#39;s have been done and now it&#39;s the Rothschilds and Soros who must be  &#39;dealt with&#39; .. and they will be for sure. Even the secretive Lynne de Rothschild in a last attempt to discredit DT has taken to Twiiter to denounce Trump! lol</p>

<p>TPTB are running scare my internet friend. And I&#39;m an Aussie who has no dog in this fight, I&#39;m just an objective observer who was most doubtful at first when he got elected BUT NOW I&#39;ve had a change of heart and wish him all the very best with his mission</p>

<p>and you too internet friend, I hope you liked <em>my rave</em> and I hope it gives you food for thought</p>

<p>Happy New Year! </p>

<p>DT&#39;s even mentioned pardoning Assange!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for taking the time to write that out. I too have hope, but that is all it is. I am trying not to let my hope blind me to what has already happened in the past. Only time will tell.<br/>
Remember that the people who run things are masters at creating the stage (politics and the separation of everyone), and the play that the audience (citizens all over the world) see&#39;s. I just hope your faith that what is happening, isn&#39;t blinding you to the bigger picture. For example, I hope MAGA does happen, but I also hope it doesn&#39;t just stop there and actually continues and incorporates the planet into it somehow in the process. Baby steps i guess, as the current system has been put in place over a long period of time, and will take a while to chip away it it&#39;s armor that protects it, and exposes it&#39;s weakness to everyone.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to see a disruption of those resources as a threat to ourselves.  </p>

<p>Ok, do you have a list?</p>

<p>Look I understand the thrust of your idealism, I used to think very similar myself. </p>

<p>The real problem is that the true troublemakers rarely make any public appearance, most people don&#39;t know their names, and they are insanely insulated by vast wealth and resources. </p>

<p>Now while you may just happily start popping off world leaders that don&#39;t act according to your ethical code, you&#39;re not really addressing the root of it, the people who goad those world leaders into fomenting chaos and fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish people like you were my real life friends. It can get lonely seeing the world we do, but fortunately I’ve grown to enjoy my solitude profoundly. When I first started questioning my own identity and realized it wasn’t just flimsy but was actually an illusion (the ‘me’ is just a memory that consciousness mistakenly identifies as because that seems to be the ‘fallen’ psychological process each human endured before awakening to their true nature, aka heaven), I thought I was losing my mind. My family was concerned with the thoughts I was having and sharing with them with such energetic gusto. They told me I needed to see a psychiatrist and that my newfound peace didn’t make sense. Something just had to be wrong with me! Why was I saying that everything in existence <em>is</em> existence, thus all beings are the same being’ness? Why would I say such a thing? Madness! Haha...</p>

<p>Realizing the internal human conspiracy (that our entire reality is the manifestation of the pursuit of illusion <em>by</em> illusion, thus this is a world that literally feels fake and far from wholesome, compassionate, loving, and honest) is that drove me to question the world. If I didn’t exist as something separate from conscioussness, and it took me discovering that on my own, and what I discovered was the peace and inner fulfillment we all spend lifetimes chasing, I just knew something was up. Someone had to be in control of our society’s storyline. Someone had to be controlling our education system, because our science should have tapped into the studying and advancement of consciousness by now, and it should be public knowledge. Someone had to be aware of how our species is being so deeply and hopelessly programmed by these tech devices, marked with the Forbidden Fruit (apple logo), before we were handed these things.</p>

<p>It’s a fallen world. Nice to meet another wholesome reddit user!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love you. You get it. Others don&#39;t, because propaganda works. The people in control have spent a lot of time and resources dividing us, knowing it solidifies their power. Here&#39;s an excerpt from wiki on one of their gurus, Edward Bernays.</p>

<p>&quot;Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is also sometimes referred to as the father of PR and the profession&#39;s first theorist for his work in the 1920s.[56] He took the approach that audiences had to be carefully understood and persuaded to see things from the client&#39;s perspective.[50][57] He wrote the first textbook on PR and taught the first college course at New York University in 1923.[11] Bernays also first introduced the practice of using front groups in order to protect tobacco interests.[50][57] In the 1930s he started the first vocational course in PR.[58] Bernays was influenced by Freud&#39;s theories about the subconscious.[51] He authored several books, including Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923), Propaganda (1928), and The Engineering of Consent (1947).[11][59] He saw PR as an &quot;applied social science&quot; that uses insights from psychology, sociology, and other disciplines to scientifically manage and manipulate the thinking and behavior of an irrational and &quot;herdlike&quot; public.[56][60] &quot;</p>

<p>It is why they bought up all the media. 
This is explained well in this doc by Loose Change producer Dylan Avery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there are aliens, are we the same essence as they are?</p>

<p>Are our bodies our own property? Do we deserve personal space? Where does that end?</p>

<p>Is the concept of a family a part of this conspiracy theory? Why are certain traits inheritable and how does that play into the thoughts of a &quot;pool of individuations&quot;? Is a human different from a rock? Is a human more superior than a rock?</p>

<p>Is strife within the animal kingdom exempt from this conspiracy theory?  Are we not a part of the animal kingdom?</p>

<p>How is having a border or property to defend actually an offensive?</p>

<p>We in essence have similarities, not complete sameness. Our traits do belong to a single set of all possible traits. If that&#39;s how you&#39;re thinking to deduce that we are the same in some essence, then you are thinking mathematically with no rigor. It&#39;s cheap poetry and shitty magic.</p>

<p>Your ideology is anti-diversity because it is anti-divergence and it supports violent forces which are already exploiting this sentiment to capture the entire human race; what I view as the most powerful substance known- humanity itself.</p>

<p>Essentially, you are preaching spiritual communism which leads to economic communism downstream. You would see my conscious stance to oppose your spiritual envelopement as brain washing. I think you should take a look at how your cry for peace is just another call to war- that is if you truly aren&#39;t malevolent.</p>

<p>Evil can disguise itself as good. Never forget that. Also, don&#39;t always quantize reality into black and white.  We were certainly behaving these ways with property and borders before we were conscious enough to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pro borders but natural isn&#39;t the right word. Borders protect smaller segments of society from external forces that exist in other regions. If Oklahoma and Texas were forced to cohabitate under the same legal precedent, Oklahoma would get the short end of the stick.</p>

<p>To poke where it might sting, if Colorado was suddenly under Utah&#39;s control, cannabis would no longer be legal in CO and would have no say. This is why Sessions&#39; cannabis policy is so infuriating: It is an obvious infringement of federal and state borders. One could say DC is threatening CO from next door, in a hyperbolic sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, a worthlessly saccharine platitude about ignoring human nature is the top post on the /r/conspiracy sub. Surely if we just stop having strong beliefs and fighting for them the world will be a better place! Certainly no one in the world would take advantage of <em>that</em> attitude!</p>

<p>Besides this stunningly naive notion being upvoted so highly, I&#39;d just like to point out that this is by far one of the weakest examples of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; you could come up with. A divide and conquer post where the conspirators are... EVERYONE! Seriously, there&#39;s not even a &quot;they&quot; in the OP, everyone individually is just supposed to stop hating each other.

<p>It goes back to responsibility. It&#39;s the biggest problem of my generation and it really isn&#39;t even our fault. The powers that be actually want us to stay infantile because we&#39;re easier to control. They want us to be dependant to be weak, to be scared. It&#39;s pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, absolutely not. Sorry for the confusion. Listen to some of what Dr Jordan Peterson has to say about personal responsibility on Youtube.</p>

<p>I mean more along the lines of strengthening the individual and helping them bear the biggest burden they can. Taking action, and being useful in the face of fear. Becoming a fully developed human being capable of so much more than you&#39;ve been lead to believe by those who want to keep sedated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify, the OP was saying the conspiracy is to divide us, make us angry, full of hate, evil. I&#39;m saying they&#39;re the only ones who will ever be evil, but they&#39;re trying to weaken us, lie to us, take away our own potential, take away our wants or needs to even try to reach that potential, or perhaps even know that it&#39;s there to begin with. We need more people leading by example (responsibility) and less demanding rights, the only way to do that is through conversations, waking up.</p>

<p>&quot;I think that truth is the highest value, although it has to be embedded in love. What I mean by that is that truth should serve the highest good imaginable. For me, that is what is best for each individual, in the manner that is simultaneously best for the family, and the state, and nature itself. But you can only want that good if you love Being -Jordan Peterson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not fear of everyone being equal. But it&#39;s obvious that humans aren&#39;t all equal. Talent, health, responsibility, intelligence and virtue are not equally distributed among humanity. Private property enables individuals to take ownership and be responsible for their land and possessions. I certainly do not want my financially irresponsible uncle to have power over my bank account because &quot;equality.&quot;</p>

<p>Given that the powers that be tirelessly work to strip man of his wealth and property, I&#39;d wager that transforming everything to community property is a very real conspiracy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree on all front - Religion, ethnicity, etc. are being used as causes to resent and hate others and I strongly think that this is mainly distributed by the media. Watching/reading the news is becoming more and more the addition of an extra layer of &quot;yeah you really should not like people of group ABC&quot; to add on top of what they&#39;re already trying to brainwash you into.
Positivity really is the way to go. I did not believe in it until it somehow clicked in me. I&#39;d never go back. I tell my wife all the time &quot;Mind over matter&quot; and taps her (gently) three times on her forehead as a reminder of it. It works :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have to disagree. The real conspiracy isn&#39;t preventing people from being good to each other. The real conspiracy is anything that dehumanizes a person often enough that they don&#39;t have the chance to develop any identity, even a good one.  </p>

<p>Ontologically, you are addressing one of the sub-issues to the fight against ubiquitous free high-quality education. I know it seems that in a roundabout way if people loved one another education would improve, but we have to be honest that there is one area to address here that helps others more, and has a more clear plan.  </p>

<p>We need people to develop identities through education that help them choose, for themselves, to learn about how the world works so that they try to take care of it and their mirrored progress to it. The lack of a global push for an intellectual identity is the only real conspiracy, and you don&#39;t have to say anyone is in charge of it, even if people with nice lives benefit when there&#39;s less competition from less successful people and a lot of tragedy.</p>

<p>When in reality, we are all slaves to the system now.  Think you are free? Do me a favor, quit your job, and do whatever you want, whenever you want. Once you run out of money, you will have to continue working again, to benefit the system.. which benefits the people who created the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is only half true.  </p>

<p>Yes, if you just do whatever you want whenever you want with zero regard for long term survivability, then yeah, you will end up in a destitute situation.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make us slaves to the system though for two reasons.  </p>

<p>1) You can conceivably choose to live outside the system (hunter-gatherer/nomad lifestyle; off-the-grid housing and commune lifestyles)</p>

<p>2) Regardless of whether you live in our outside the system, you&#39;re not a slave to the system, but a slave to scarcity.  Resources are scarce and labor isn&#39;t free.  Food, water, shelter, clothing, healthcare all require laborers and resources.  </p>

<p>At this point, our collective and individual survival requires hard work. 
 Until we solve the problem of scarcity, you will never be totally free from obligation (if you demand long-term survivability).  </p>

<p>If you are to say a nation is &quot;a large aggregate of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory.&quot;, then one could argue Europe is a nation based on ethnicity, or Western Europe at least, or the English-speaking world is a nation, Asia could be a nation based on culture and ethnicity, Africa, Middle-east, South-america. </p>

<p>No, you can&#39;t. Western European Nations are not the same culturally or linguistically, nor are Asian nations, nor are Middle Eastern Nations, nor African nor South American.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is saying nations are arbitrary, and can be changed, adapted, unified, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nations are not arbitrary. That&#39;s like saying Hindus are arbitrary, or French people are arbitrary. This group dynamic is the <em>reason</em> why geographical bounds, which are <em>part</em> of nations, form. </p>

<p>The attitudes of peoples within a nation can change. That does not change the nation itself i.e. the  definition of a nation is static. A nation by definition has certain attributes. To change the attributes of what constitutes a nation is to change the dictionary, and at that point we are no longer talking about a nation.</p>

<p>A nation, by definition <em>is</em>, unified in the sense of comradery. The United States toady is a country, but does not meet the criteria to be a nation. </p>
