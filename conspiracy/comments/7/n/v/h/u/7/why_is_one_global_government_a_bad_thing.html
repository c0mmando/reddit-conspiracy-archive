       I guess what I'm asking for here is an eli5 on why this is such an issue. Wouldn't one set of laws and regulations be easier to work with people in different countries and regions?

       Because people have culture, and differences and it is up their own culture and people to decide how they want to be governed. One world government would make the world a homogenous, boring, and easily controlled hell on Earth.

       Aren't we all people though? Granted there are many different cultures with different ideologies, if those things were looked past and a system could be put in place that would work would it still be a bad thing?

       Yes. Different people, cultures, ideas and laws should exist. No governing body should determine what is what for the entire planet its asinine. And who would decide who leads? Its insane. We can cooperate as a planet but one world government is insanity

       Clearly someone who doesn't understand crypto.

       Until a solar flare comes and fries your USB stick and you lose everything. Crypto is 100x more dependant on a functional society than any other form. You are also dependant on peoples perceptions... Nobody cares miney is fiat... But if crypto loses its novelty and nobody will give you anything for it.

       Calling people "fucking idiots" over a hunch you have isn't very productive. Others can make good arguments that a decentralized currency is exactly what could hurt the NWO most.

       In concept, sure, not a bad thing or a good thing, just a thing. In practice, the question would be more like 'why is a global government set up in secret by megabillionaires who continually deny that that's what they're doing and use their pet media outlets to go after anyone who contests them a bad thing'. And you can answer that question without getting into the pros and cons of global government at all.

       Your question should be, why do we need any government at all? Every example of a private police force saw fewer crimes and a happy public. I'm under the suspicion Aaron Swartz designed this place as his idea of a pure democracy, something that has basically been unachievable until Al Gore created the internet.

       Very nearly, I suppose. We live under local governments operating within an international regime with global scope, one that could easily transform into an overt global government once the holdouts are taken care of (Russia being the obvious one, along with its allies/proxies).

       Personally all I think that would be different is transparency. I think we are completely under the control of a world government. I think the unflinching bipartisan support of Israel supports this.  I don't view Russia as a real hold out as much as media scapegoat.  If Russia was a hold out would the Uranium one deal have gone down?

       True enough. I suppose it's less about Russia not wanting to sign up, more about them wanting a bigger piece of the action, join as partners rather than associates. Still, they're a sticking point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Issue is transparency, as you say - but it cuts both ways. Even if the system is already fully in place, keeping it secret even partially means limiting its ability to act under its own legitimacy. Everything has to be done in backrooms and pushed out mob-style, with bribery and intimidation and the like - inefficient, and more than that impermanent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keeping it secret also means that anyone who is 'let in on it' is free to do all sorts of counterproductive self-serving things, safe in the knowledge that the 'real' authorities can't punish them, for fear of being revealed themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to make it legitimate, permanent etc. is to formalize it publically, or at least semi-publically. But they've tied themselves in such ridiculous knots these past few decades, trying to rush to the finish line before the OGs start croaking, it's hard to imagine how that would be possible, at least without large amounts of violence, which could just as easily fuck up the whole thing.

       Fair points. My personal belief is this. I believe the current system being used on citizens of the world is there to drive income equality.  Every year the middle class gets poorer and the top 1 percent get much more wealthy.  I believe the elites of the world benefit from the current system because they are bleeding the economy dry.  Once there is no more wealth to deplete from the masses they pull the pin toss the grenade and were in a martial law type of one world government.  That could take a hundred years or it could take 10 or it could 1000, but that's a personal theory I hold.

       I get where you're coming from. Tho when you say 'the middle class gets poorer', you're talking about the West - the middle classes in India, China etc. are getting richer at the same time, and for obvious directly-related reasons. Logical end result being a 'global middle class', equalized across all nations. Whether that's an explicit goal or just the natural result of globalisation (as a technological phenomenon as well as a socio-political project) - who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for pulling the pin, martial law and so on, I doubt it's a specific ambition, just the obvious fallback plan if/when all the gentler approaches fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only other thing to mention (relating to your 10 years or 1000 comment) - I think we're looking at a much shorter time-frame, at least for the next attempt. For one, a lot of the turbo-globalist true believers are reaching the ends of their lifespans, for them personally it's now-or-never.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for two, everything's falling apart, the sheer amount of lying required to keep the project chugging along is causing problems wherever you look. Trump and Brexit being the most obvious cases - both in globalist heartlands, both explicitly the anti-globalist option - and both shadowed on the other end of the political spectrum by anti-globalist lefties, Bernie and Corbyn. So long as the chosen tactic to actually promote globalism is to pretend it doesn't really exist and anyone who talks about it is a bad idiot, I can't see the scales tipping back in their direction any time soon.

       Excellent points especially about how a lot of Asian countries middle class is growing.  If I'm being cynical I would argue they are on a course just like we were when the industrial revolution took off and the American middle class was doing unusually well.  If my theory were true the one world government would want to take those asian countries on the same paths that they took us.  If the middle class is doing well they are collecting a lot of income tax from those countries for the International banking cartel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I will disagree with you is that you claim the system is falling apart.  I personally don't think we have ever been as controlled as we are today.  People slurp up whatever is FB trending, everyone not using a vpn is building a surveillance file on themselves, people are willing paying for spy devices to be placed into their homes, and microchips are a hotter conversation than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that I am a bit out there, but I truthfully think the internet was a wolf in sheeps clothing.  The people get it and it appears to allow is us all to connect and share ideas, but the NSA has access to this information and computer algorithm could spit out a list of a majority of dissenters and they could be promptly rounded up by Military police.  I think things like brexit and trump exist simply to give people the impression that they have choice.

       Hey thanks man, you too. I have enjoyed our chat. Not often I get to be the optimist ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I suppose I'm not really - imo Trump is a con-man clowncar, and Brexit is an insane kamikaze maneuver with a roughly zero chance of a positive outcome. The only hope to draw from them is that they show the old methods of information control don't work any more - or at least not as well as they used to, not well enough to win the day. And the new methods, the ones shitting up this sub on a daily basis, aren't working either - if anything they're making it worse, they let people see these arguments first hand, play around with them, contest them, see for themselves how hollow and synthetic they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to say the truth is winning out, mind you, nothing of the sort. Just that the age-old methods for propagating the 'noble lies' are steadily failing, so for the first time in decades if not centuries if not millennia the truth is in with a chance. A Great Awakening - still a long shot, but closer now than it's ever been in my lifetime, and ~80% of that movement has been in the last 3-4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of which makes the violent option more likely in the end, I suppose. So much for optimism.

       There should be a universal  set of rights as humans, but the functions of governments should move in the exact opposite way.  Governments are typically the systems that oppress people the most, and increasing the size to a

       </em>
       increases the power to oppress.

      <p>
       I would like communities to decide how they want to live.  I would like households to set their own standards.  The only condition is that the rights of others can never be trampled over.  Outside of that, give me true freedom and true liberty.

       One example is , your voice is dived by the number of people in a govement... Example let's say the USA has 139mill so your vote is worth 1/139mill if you have a one world Goverment then it's 1/7billion also the needs defer by region meaning the needs in Asia are different from the need of Europe or north America, but because Asia has the most people they would probably outvote any Western regions, if we are talking about a democracy. We would be better off been in a global republic but that's not going to happen when they talk about Global Goverment they are talking about a Dictatorship based on corporatations and Family blood. So yea if you are not a billionaire then globalism is not for you.

       Most authorities, however, agree on the following account. The whole of Egypt was once plagued by a wasting disease which caused bodily disfigurement. So pharaoh Bocchorisnote went to the oracle of Hammonnote to ask for a cure, and was told to purify his kingdom by expelling the victims to other lands, as they lay under a divine curse. Thus a multitude of sufferers was rounded up, herded together, and abandoned in the wilderness. Here the exiles tearfully resigned themselves to their fate. But one of them, who was called Moses, urged his companions not to wait passively for help from god or man, for both had deserted them: they should trust to their own initiative and to whatever guidance first helped them to extricate themselves from their present plight. They agreed, and started off at random into the unknown. But exhaustion set in, chiefly through lack of water, and the level plain was already strewn with the bodies of those who had collapsed and were at their last gasp when a herd of wild asses left their pasture and made for the spade of a wooded crag. Moses followed them and was able to bring to light a number of abundant channels of water whose presence he had deduced from a grassy patch of ground. This relieved their thirst. They traveled on for six days without a break, and on the seventh they expelled the previous inhabitants of Canaan, took over their lands and in them built a holy city and temple.

       Think of the splitting up of languages. Now, you have to realize that the jews are translators throughout history. They have learned how to cheat with words. The reason race mixing is bad is because it creates fake language, words within words, and you lose coherence. Burning bush was really meant to be bush of life, source of water, just like in the time of Aristotle virgin birth meant pure conception of spirit, one with Nature. Anyways, the lose of language allows for justification of sin to take place --&gt; Babel.

      <p>
       Back to egypt though, what was the disease? Genetic deformities from race mixing? Is that why they killed the first borns? If not was it inbreeding to the extreme? I would treat the above passage like a rosetta stone for reading the bible. The first known instance of the bible is 300AD, notice how the Christianity, the religion of the slaves is a lot like egyptian mythology... Wouldn't it be poetic to enslave the people you refuse to forgive with their myths? jews like to pretend to be ignorant... forgive them they know not what they do... They never realized their lie would lead to a bigger truth... and they have been doing damage control ever since.

       So what do you think the disease was? I know that Jews are susceptible to certain diseases, like Tay-Sachs and hemophilia, but not of deformities. I also haven't heard much about deformities being cause by race-mixing.

       I have no idea, yet. My hunch is that it was race mixing. Hemophillia and tay-sachs are more of inbreeding issue, but the origin of tay-sachs may be whatever this disease was. FYI tay-sachs is due to ashkanazi population being reduced to 350 or so, followed by heavy heavy inbreeding. While you can get high IQs from heavy inbreeding (Japan, China, etc.), there is a price (bi-modal distribution). Personally, I think jews mated with sub-Saharan africans (egyptian slaves). The extreme difference in genetic makeup would make their union very difficult. At the time, the egyptians may have tried to breed it out by killing hebrew men and mating with women. This is interesting for the context of the God asking abraham to kill his son... I intend to look into this aspect a lot more, and do not want to over reach my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for sources, look at race mixing stats, iq charts, all of it. This information is so taboo it is scattered. Anatomy of Violence by Adriane Raine, Steven Pinker books, Bell Curve good places to start. After that, you have to go to pre 1930s books. Sir Andrew Keane's works are top rated, explains the five origins of humans and that we likely did not all come out of Africa, he even has sections on the jews. Coon is also a good read, especially considering is brain size work has been validated by MRI. I forget the name, but there is also a human genetics book that talks about heredity of traits throughout society. Eugenics is also a good place to look. Medicine, Mind, and the Double Brain will shed light on physiological battle that reasonable people lost... Brocca was a die hard liberal, until he learned how the brain actually worked. Their "racism" was not a choice, but a fact.

       The only reason western civilization is what it is is due to the first inquisition. It was a selection process for kindness and faith. Was it all built on a lie, the jews trying to manipulate a perfect goyim? Maybe. But evil cannot hold itself together, God uses the Devil.

       Thanks for more links! I devour this info, I'm really thirsty for the truth and you seem to have a lot of knowledge on this subject. I knew nothing about conversos, for example, until you mentioned them. A few more pieces of the puzzle are coming together for me, especially regarding the East India Company.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a somewhat random question if you don't mind. This morning I was reading about Andriy Biletsky of Ukraine this morning, and either he or someone else in Azov claimed that Putin is a crypto Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never really considered this, and always sort of thought that Putin was probably looking out for the best interests of ethnic Russians. But maybe not? And maybe globalist opposition to him is manufactured in order to give him credibility? Or maybe there are more than one faction of Jews vying for power? Or maybe that's all disinfo? What's your take?

       Look up what he did to the russian oligarchs, and soros. I doubt they endorsed that (unless this was a war of jews), but that is the problem with building on deceit... Distinguishing between the effects of the hive mind and the individual gets difficult, especially when they constantly hedge their bets. It is easy to see gravity work, but tracking the actual atoms is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big help here is that Russia has a central bank, meaning their balls are and always will be in the jews' hands. There is a reason Putin says the jews did the bolshevik revolution and is investigating the murder of he Tsar by them. Given Putin was also picked just before the information age, it is possible they did not realize his true character. Yeltzin did collapse rather quickly, so maybe they panicked, or maybe they needed a way to regain confidence of russian people.

       ashkenazi vs. sephardic. Look at US election results for jews. 75% - 25% democrat and republican, precisely the religious split. ashkenazi behavioral issues draw too much attention to sephardic, the sephardic use them as a scape goat for their egos and vice versa. My hunch is that all of this shit we are currently seeing is that battle.

       jews jewing jews, jews jewing themselves... no one can tell who is jewing who anymore. That is honestly the biggest issue. That is also why they will fail.

       That all makes sense. What I wouldn't give to have a clear understanding of what has happened throughout history and what exactly is happening today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the world sure does make a whole lot more sense now than it did before I started learning about all of this.

       I hope the current control by the Jews is only temporary. I do worry that technology, especially AI, will allow them to further consolidate their control, though. But the fact that there seem to be rival factions fighting each other gives me some hope.

       yes if it's designed badly.  of course.  and that's the problem.  if it's designed badly there's no fallback to other forms of gov.  it's a monoculture design.  it's not a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are ways to implement global governance without global gov.  firstly you need agreement on language that everyone can read.  this will probably mean the creation of a global language that's also machine readable and human readable regardless of what language you actually speak.  i think this will manifest as a set of idioms that can be mapped to the language of their choice, and those idioms will act as functions that take arguments.  it will somewhat lisp-y, because this is the best way to grow a design phi-ly.  and they'll phi design in their implementation.  i'm expecting this language to show up by at min 2030 when people globally have realized that shit, they really need to work on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       secondly any concept of global governance but not global gov has to allow for a spectrum of different local implementations.  there's no getting around this requirement.

       Global one-world government is not the end goal.  The government portion is merely the control apparatus that will help bring about their true goal, which is a global one-world religion. The worship Isis, Horus, and Set, among various names, will be the mandatory state religion.

       thats a good question, and the answer is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       all government should be as close to the individual as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The farther removed sovereign individuals are in terms of layers of bureaucracy  the less that individual is represented, and the greater the chance of corruption and behind-the-scenes shadow control.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are in favor of a global leviathan 1984-style dominating and all-encompassing big brother, then yes, one world government is what you want. Central planning. Also called Socialism and  Communism.  Any pretense of individual liberties would be just that, and illusion and a pretense.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the EU works right now, in my opinion.  The elected member country parliament merely rubber stamps the proposed laws and regs from the
       <strong>
        APPOINTED
       </strong>
       "commission" from Brussells......IOW the average EU citizen is ruled over as a slave class from afar.  No accountability to the self-appointed rulers. They are kings with a different name.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA was FOUNDED on the principle of "no taxation without representation".  A one-world government is EXACTLY that and why globalism should be avoided at all costs.

       Because the people behind globalism have no intention of  living under one set of laws and regulations, and they've been very open about this. It's one set of laws and regulations for them and another for the rest of thus. They call it Paternal Libertarianism or Libertarian Paternalism, but it's in essence just neo-feudalism.

       So there are potential benefits if it is done well, but it significantly increases the risk profile of humans as a species. We all become susceptible to being hurled back to the stone ages by one devastating event that impacts a critical resource, one bad leader, one superbug, etc.

       Thanks for more links! I devour this info, I'm really thirsty for the truth and you seem to have a lot of knowledge on this subject. I knew nothing about conversos, for example, until you mentioned them. A few more pieces of the puzzle are coming together for me, especially regarding the East India Company.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a somewhat random question if you don't mind. This morning I was reading about Andriy Biletsky of Ukraine this morning, and either he or someone else in Azov claimed that Putin is a crypto Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never really considered this, and always sort of thought that Putin was probably looking out for the best interests of ethnic Russians. But maybe not? And maybe globalist opposition to him is manufactured in order to give him credibility? Or maybe there are more than one faction of Jews vying for power? Or maybe that's all disinfo? What's your take?
