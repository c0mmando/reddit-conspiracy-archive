       The new Dave Chappelle is 40 lbs heavier, his voice is ten times deeper, he is essentially expressionless, rarely changes his voice inflection, and is generally HACK. These new specials are simply not funny. Here is the old Dave Chappelle from 2010. Unrecognizable from this imposter. What happened?

       This is what I think it is. He has gone through a lot and his new specials seem to be more social commentary than comedy reflecting on those experiences.

       He took a break from comedy. Regained his appetite, out on some weight like people do as they get older. He kept smoking cigarettes like he always has and now he just performs to perform. He's living his life man

       His expressionless is part of his schtick. I find it as he's trying to look more reflective on issues in the country.

       I think it had more to do with timing. He mentioned that one of his first things back was that SNL. Trump was just elected and emotions were high everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was still a bit of a defense at the end. Mentioning the media is too hard on him for some things.

       Definitely picked from the low hanging fruit in his recent special. Remember the Black Bush skit from his show? Making fun of a president in a clever and comedic way. Half of his recent special turned into “I think Trump is a moron because a,b,c”. Cool, nobody cares who you voted for, make us laugh.

       There seems to be a whole generation of young idiots who think they can just add the words "rationally", "objectively", and "logically" to whatever they say and it becomes more compelling. This is exactly what happened to "literally."

       He's been living in a bubble for too long. He seems to think bashing Trump is the key to laughs, but that's where these bubble dwellers lose me. I am working hard for a living and these celebrities have no idea how good/bad the economy was/is for the rest of us. They don't have a clue.

       There's more to "being a liberal" than just wanting public services for yourself and legal weed. Wanting that stuff while still being a regressive shitlord just makes you a proto-fascist.

       Obamacare never promised to stop healthcare prices from rising, it promsied to slow down the rise, and it did. You've been brainwashed to think either it promised more or that it failed to do that, probably from the same people who brainwashed you into thinking you're a "liberal" even as you use choice insults ("libtard") that have only ever been the purview of the stupidest reaches of the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I looked at some of your recent posts about the ACA and...yeah...other people did a fine job of explaining your misconceptions but the GOP propaganda (probably delivered by a "centrist" idiot like Joe Rogan so you could comprehend it) has apparently taken root deeply within your brain.

       Liberal used to mean: let people have personal freedoms if it doesn't hurt others. The media has redefined liberal to mean: you have to accept our multinational corporate sponsor's narratives or you're a Nazi. Don't you realize that TRUMP has had the most successful 1st year of any President in American history? The silent majority knows.

       No. It's not about him not supporting Trump. I'm fine with that and wouldn't expect him to. It's just that his routine isn't funny because it's not congruent with reality. He said to give Trump a chance on SNL and used it as set-up for his new material where he paints a reality where after a year of Trump, he's a declared failure. Another perspective is that Trump has been wildly successful this year and your jokes are the real failure. It's not like Chappelle would even understand the politics of his fans. I don't want to hear Trump bashing anymore because it's become 95% of media. None of it is honest. None of it is funny.

       He summed it up perfectly in his first bit. A black entertainer can only get so rich until tptb put you in an awkward position. I am not defending eithe MJ or jello bill, i just don’t have any problem beleiving what he says.

       There's a difference.  I saw him live before he became famous and after he got back from Africa or whatever.  He's still funny, sure but the comedy is different.  Now that is huge on Netflix and they're pushing him, I'm just kinda meh.. not a great comic these days.. Kinda like Sarah Silverman.. Used to be very funny.  Sold out to the elite.  Now her comedy is just shit and I'm pretty sure she was using canned laughter in her last stand up special.  There's definitely something to be said for using entertainers to tell people what to think (stand up, family guy, SNL, etc)

       He's still funny, but it's pretty clear from 'The Bird Revelation' that he's not as concerned with being funny as he is with sounding the warning and red pilling people.

       A normal liberal would not be so effected by comedy. I'm saying you are even alt-right or alt-left (libtarded) one who automatically goes to extremes right off the bat.

       I've only seen one, but I thought it was refreshingly honest. I'd go so far as to say that it was the only worthwhile standup set I've seen in the past 5 years, as the current state of stand up comedy is at an all-time low. Unlike his contemporaries, Chappelle remains decisively anti-establishment, non-partisan, and anti-hypocrisy.

       What I was taken aback by this latest show was how much he backtracked on his offending the trans community and his explanation of how he was mis-characterized as a Trump supporter.   He used to never give a shit but somehow, his tone has changed since his last Netflix special.  I don't know the reason for the change but I guess he got a lot of shit from the liberal media and critics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only saw the first episode but the first half was genuinely funny.  The last half was just making sure people knew he voted for Hillary and that Trump is a dumb fuck.  And he ends with a story of how blacks overcame racism since the 50's and such.  Not exactly comedy.

       Something happened. That's obvious. You shouldn't get this much blowback on a conspiracy board about Dave Chapelle, that's how you know you're on the right track.

       I don't know about cloning and all that, but they don't allow you back in the mainstream after what he did and what he said when he came back (the Oprah interview, the Wesley Snipes comment on Letterman).
      </p>
      <p>
       He had to pay a price to come back. Maybe they gave him an offer he couldn't refuse? His life, or selling his soul?

       yuh. did we watch the same specials?  the newest ones is funny and almost ventures into the realm of story teller more than just a comedian.Daves seen some shyt and up and left the game for over a decade.  he even gives a glimpse into the why he truly left after telling a story of how a pimp keeps his girls working when they ready to quit through blackmail/corrosion.

       Dave got setup and he fled.
