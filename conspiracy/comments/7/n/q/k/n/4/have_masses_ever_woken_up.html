    <div class="md"><p>In the US, look at the Union movements of the 1870&#39;s, and the Progressive reforms of the 1890&#39;s in response to what Mark Twain termed the Gilded Age. We had the 17th Amendment, and men like William Jennings Bryan running on Populist platforms seeking debt relief and Trust busting. People woke up to the bullshit of the 20&#39;s after the crash in the 30&#39;s and set the foundations for the gains of the post-war economy to be shared equitably. These are just recent  examples from America. Every other generation or so the People get fed up with the corruption their parents and grandparents allowed to fester. We appear to be on the cusp of another such awakening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Progressive is simply a term, there&#39;s no need to bring the Jews into it. WJB wasn&#39;t a Jew...the men who worked and died in the Steel Mills and fought in bloody strikes where they were assaulted by the US Army and armed Scabs weren&#39;t Jews...they were hard working American men of every nationality. </p>

<p>What is wrong with direct election of our Senators, per the 17th Amendment? Before that they were elected by State Legislatures with no input from the People, allowing even more corruption to grow. What is wrong with Trust Busting, in order to ensure Markets stay Free by eliminating monopolies? What is wrong with strong Labor that ensure hard working men and women get their fair share of the profits from the economy at large?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>oh, you are gonna skip the income tax? interesting omission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not on omission, just not part of the time period I covered (late 19th century). But I&#39;ll gladly give my thoughts on it. I believe that a Progressive Income tax is a benefit to society- those who make more should pay more, those who make less should pay less. If operated properly, without centralized corruption, this system allows those who make more to keep a sizable portion while ensuring they pay their fair share back to society. It, along with things like inheritance and capital gains taxes, work to ensure that income disparity doesn&#39;t rise to massive levels that tilt the playing field against the common People.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the term for what you are doing is pilpul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, why do you assume I&#39;m Jewish? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they were white europeans. not kikes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>White Europeans from Ireland, England, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and so many more. Like I said- Americans of <em>every</em> nationality. This nation was built on immigrants. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the monopolies became more abstract, in the form of the fed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we need to Audit the Fed, and should never have given the Public control of money to a Private entity. The Brits started this whole trend in 1695 when the Crown Corporation was formed by the City of London.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You either haven&#39;t thought about it, don&#39;t want to, or you&#39;re in on it.</p>

<p>I was referring to that time, yes. The bulk of my comment was about the late 19th century, however.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t but based on your comment, and on your following statement, you do wrongly believe that I am lol.</p>

<p>Ok? lol. I don&#39;t really care honestly, my post and comment history speaks for itself. And I was, again, speaking of the immigration at the time of the late 19th century. I would be interested to hear more about Sudan and immigration changes in &#39;65, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been revolutions where the people mobilized themselves or were open to being mobilized at least,  against a status quo.</p>

<p>This happened in France,  Germany,  China,  Russia,  even to an extent in the US during brief periods.    Its exhausting,  it can&#39;t persist because society needs a certain amount of continuity to function or it collapses and no one benefits,   like it did in Cambodia with Pol Pot.</p>

<p>In other words,  mismanaged,  it is more self destructive than constructive.</p>

<p>We are leaving the industrial age behind and are now in an information age.   Waking up in an information age may not happen in the same way it happens in an age of the assembly line.</p>

<p>There is also the matter of despair.    Heroin.    Lost generations.    Hopelessness.</p>

<p>A country like the US that has been in so much denial for so long,  it possible it does not have what it takes to transform.   Expect change further from the center of empire.    Look at how Rome,  Spain and Britain fell.   Slow,  painful decay.   There was not a point at which they woke up.    That happened elsewhere.</p>

<p>No one is making any money from crypto!</p>

<p>It’s virtually impossible to cash the crypto into fiat! Most exchanges literally can not turn it into MONEY!!!!</p>

<p>Just go to any crypto forum and talk about cashing out 100,000 or even a million dollars- it’s impossible and exchanges often just steal the money </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no problem here in Norway. Also you can just fill prepaid Visa from several companies with cryptos and spend as you like. </p>

<p>Cryptos will change society in major ways going foreward, just like internet, transistors, planes, electricity and other once a generation inventions.</p>

<p>Better get your head out of your ass before you are left behind. First thing is to stop thinking of cryptos as currencies, even though thats all the media focuses on. Different cryptos are different technologies. Investing in one is investing in a technology you believe will change the world in major ways.</p>

<p>I hold a lot of Powr, full name Powerledger. It can decentralize the worlds power grid, making selling and buying power from private small scale solar panels, wind turbines, hydro generators and so on completely automatic and effortless. Your surplus electricity is sold to neighbours, and deficits are covered with other peoples surplus. All without you giving it a single thought.</p>

<p>Powr is a crypto currency, but also a revolutionary technology literally enabling people to &quot;go of the grid&quot;. There are hundreds of coins like Powr, aiming to decentralize society and empower peoples independence from central authority. All together, it can tear down the current control mechanisms of civilization, without leaving us in a anarchic wasteland as one often assumes would happin in such a situation.</p>

<p>Cryptos is exactly what the world needs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe revolution will happen in societies that are so addicted to mass corporate media 247.</p>

<p>It&#39;s become much easier for the govt to impose/phony up an army of &quot;patriotic dumbasses&quot;/&quot;intellectual moderates&quot; to muddy the actual numbers of real dissenters.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t move in powerful groups unless they start to see
real groups protesting in already large numbers. That is what gives the people confidence to join in.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I believe it&#39;s important for people to state their beliefs via bumper stickers, signs, tshirts etc. Let people to easily see where you stand &amp; they may make an attempt to do the same.</p>

<p>Online alliances again are too easy to muddy &amp; sway people causing doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All those abandoned cities in the Americas. Basically had some interesting civ stuff going on that was quite organized. Artifacts of codes, sacrifices, relatively large scale accounting and collecting of resources, basically stuff that paralleled the early Bronze Age in Europe. Temples (or the mounds they were upon), walled cities, not quite coinage yet there were artifacts depicting a lot of collection of various trade goods, some places dealt in copper tooling and metalware, and certain regions seemed to have their specialties. By the time Columbus and other Europeans make it over to the eastern seaboard, all that&#39;s left are &quot;primitive&quot; tribes that are mostly governed at a village level and often not using too much more than stone tools and pottery. Some aspects of that part of these people&#39;s history must have been purposely abandoned. Interesting in the sense that there&#39;s a lost history there. The grounds those previous cities were upon may have been hallowed by some of the later cultures, but the previous way of living in those places was given up.</p>
