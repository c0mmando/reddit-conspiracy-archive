    <div class="md"><p>&quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot; is the fifth single from Michael Jackson&#39;s album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, released on <strong>March 31, 1996</strong>. The song remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed. In the US, media scrutiny surrounding allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple apologies and re-recording the song with altered lyrics. The singer countered allegations of antisemitism, arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song, either unintentionally or deliberately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Sheriff&#39;s office:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Some of the documents appear to be copies of reports that were authored by Sheriff&#39;s Office personnel as well as evidentiary photographs taken by Sheriff&#39;s Office personnel interspersed with content that appears to be obtained off the internet or through unknown sources,&quot; a representative of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff&#39;s Department said in an email to Billboard. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Statement from Jackson family:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seven years ago this coming Saturday, the world lost an amazing artist and humanitarian devoted to helping children in need in all corners of the world. Michael Jackson&#39;s fans, including the Executors of his estate, prefer to remember the wonderful gifts Michael left behind instead of having to once again see his good name dragged through the mud by tabloid trash.</p>

<p>Everything in these reports, including what the County of Santa Barbara calls &quot;content that appears to be obtained off the Internet or through unknown sources&quot; is false, no doubt timed to the anniversary of Michael&#39;s passing. Those who continue to shamelessly exploit Michael via sleazy internet &quot;click bait&quot; ignore that he was acquitted by a jury in 2005 on every one of the 14 salacious charges brought against him in a failed witch hunt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually a pretty well known hoax. Its amazing to see how these false allegations are still circling in the public sphere with little to no research.</p>

<p>The &quot;child porn&quot; images are not Sheriff&#39;s office report images, they&#39;re intermixed with official images that were just normal/legal porn. Someone got the leaked report, mixed in some child porn type stuff, and then leaked the report with the mixed in images and started putting out stories about how the Sheriff found child porn.</p>

<p>Why was he never charged if they found child porn and its even in official reports? It never happened, the Sheriff&#39;s office says it never happened, its a well known hoax of exactly the type this thread is about. Scandal and webs of lies, leaks, etc to drag someone&#39;s name through the mud.</p>

I was a boy and MJ was a huge deal to me so me and my parents watched it together.  This part was overtly sexual and violent, which was...scary to me and presumably other youth as well who did not know what to make of it all.  Great dancing though. If it ever was censored in further airings, like on MTV, it was probably because it was, like i said sexual, violent, and confusing and ate up another 5 mins of air time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i&#39;ve been thinking about the label side of it ever since I heard about how there&#39;s a saying that they&#39;re sometimes worth more dead than alive, expecially if they threaten to quit, which is messy. I remembered the stories about Jimi Hendrix too.</p>

<p>No one considers the label. I wonder if Courtney ever sued the guy who made that early movie about how she &quot;killed him&quot;. </p>

<p>By the way, if you have the &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; box set, go take a look at the book inside of it. The cover of this book has a collage of &quot;headlines&quot;. Notice anything strange? Nobody talks about this either, and i&#39;ve suggested it a few times here and there. If you take a closer look, there are only two &quot;headlines&quot; which are upside down, and they also happen to be the smallest in lettering. They also contrast quite a bit from the rest of them in subject matter, and clearly aren&#39;t headlines from the time Kurt was alive.</p>

<p>Whoever was in charge of that cover either did this of their own will or did it for someone else who requested. I wonder who it was.</p>

<p>Evan Chandler, Jordan Chandler&#39;s Father:</p>

<p>&quot;If I go through with this, I win big-time. There&#39;s no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever ... Michael&#39;s career will be over</p>

<p>How this will affect my Son is irrelevant to me ... It will be a massacre if I don&#39;t get what I want. It&#39;s going to be bigger than all us put together ... This man [Jackson] is going to be humiliated beyond belief ... He will not sell one more record</p>

<p>It was Evan Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, Jordan firmly denied all allegations that Jackson Abused him in anyway until his father Evan administered him with a memory altering drug called Sodium Amytal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I don&#39;t see any &quot;Deep State&quot; social or political issues that MJ could ever have influenced one way or the other. </p>

<p>For most of his career he was a fabulously wealthy and bizarrely eccentric glitter and glitz song and dance boy/man or man/boy whose performances, recordings, and on stage <em>persona</em> were all that any of his mainly young and youthful fans ever really cared about. </p>

<p>Entertainment pure and simple that always involved all kinds of dancers, musicians, and lavish stage productions besides MJ himself in person and very sophisticated orchestrations behind all of his various recordings that no one ever had any problems dancing to.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing new about artists getting ripped-off by unscrupulous agents, promoters, or accountants or blowing their fortunes making self-indulgent fantasies real for themselves, in fact there&#39;s fewer that haven&#39;t experienced it to some extent than have actually managed to avoid it. </p>

<p>The only real difference with MJ was the size and amount of money that was involved. Obviously where there&#39;s that much more money involved there&#39;s simply bound to be just that much more room for unscrupulously diverting vast sums of it or the artists themselves squandering vast sums of it like there&#39;s no tomorrow.</p>
