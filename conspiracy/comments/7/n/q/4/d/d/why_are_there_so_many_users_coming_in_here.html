        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The great irony of this is that by them getting massively upvoted they are literally admitting that there is a brigade from somewhere coming in trying to discredit us.</p>

<p>They literally come in and say things like, &quot;this sub would accept it if it were from 4 chan&quot; or &quot;this sub is t_d 2.0&quot; and proceed to get 50 upvotes in a 70 upvoted post. </p>

<p>Logically either </p>

<p>a) They are completely incorrect in there statement as them getting upvoted ironically proves them wrong.</p>

<p>Or b) there is an influx of users from other places &quot;brigade&quot; attempt to come in and turn all discourse on this sub to the way they want it? Now why would they want that?</p>

<p>First of all they are claiming to be separate from the sub despite commenting regularly which is interesting enough since you know normal people wouldn&#39;t spend so much time going into places they have no interest being apart of and making incorrect generalization about them to make themselves appear superior. Let alone on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Second of all if they were truly confident in there beliefs then they wouldn&#39;t have to go to one of the few subs that dares to question the status quo.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the solution? They seem to repeat the same phrases over and over again. Thus having the first paragraph over every text post and submission statement be dedicated to pointing out possible talking points, logical fallacies such as deflection, ad hominem, and strawmans would easily show users who is here to participate in moving the discussion of this sub forward and who is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of his post is to show you that there is a massive artificial push on reddit to discredit anything Trump.  Most of those are the spontaneous new subreddits which all managed to hit the front page as soon as they were created, which was totally &quot;organic&quot;, btw. This also seems to include the infiltrated subs.  Shit, i saw r_/politics flipped from pro-Bernie and hating Hillary to the polar opposite in about a day.  Sure reddit had a natural left lean anyways, but there was absolutely a coordinated effort to smear Trump and stir up rebellion.  It also forced any Trump supporters into a tiny handful of subreddits, of which they ended up getting banned from r/all.  </p>

<p>The only brigading I see here is the brigading that T_D did over the last year+. Conspiracy has always been an &quot;almost mainstream&quot; sub and it&#39;s normal for non-subcribers to come in here when a post gets a lot of traction. No one cared when non-subscribers came in here and debated with us... we want healthy debate. But after T_D we get constant complaints that their safe space has been violated. Like this one.</p>

<p>So with your 6 month old account you have seen the people of this sub not have the perspective you wanted them to have.. That is why you are here to set the false T_D take over narrative, because you want to change this sub into what you want (a carbon copy of r/politics).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is a six month old account and it&#39;s probably my fourth or fifth. I delete my account every year or two so that I don&#39;t become a slave to internet points. If I was trying to spread a false narrative wouldn&#39;t I go buy an older reddit account for like $4? Yeah, I would. It&#39;s easy.</p>

<p>Also, It&#39;s not constructive to ignore what people are saying and instead construct a bad guy to argue against. Calling me an <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> shill is the same as the far right wingers calling everyone that isn&#39;t a far right winger a communist (or for far left wingers calling everyone that isn&#39;t a far left winger a fascist). You&#39;re not going to convince anyone with weak logic like that, all you&#39;re doing is playing into divisive party politics and reaffirming what I said: T_D right wingers need safe spaces and view <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as one of their safe spaces.</p>
