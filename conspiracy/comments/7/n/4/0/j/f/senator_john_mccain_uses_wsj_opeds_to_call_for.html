       True to his warhawk nature, wheelchair bound-McCain can think of nothing better to do during the holidays than call for more death and destruction in Syria and Iran.
      </p>

       The WSJ article literally calls for the US military to engage Syrian and Russian forces by pointing out actions that haven't been taken by the Trump administration -
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Trump Administration hasn’t challenged Assad or Russian and Iranian-backed forces directly in offensive operations."
      </p>
      <p>
       In another tweet McCain points to the unrest in Iran and uses another WSJ Op-Ed to encourage the overthrow of a sovereign nation.

       The man has proven himself to be one of the countries most violent narcissistic psychopaths ever to hold a seat in the Senate.

       What kind of monster chooses to use the Christmas and New Years holidays as a time to call for more war?

       AZ resident here Senator...saying its time for you to shut the fuck up and retire. Tell all your buddies in the military industrial complex you gave it your best shot...and failed.

       Submission statement: John McCain epitomizes the portrait of a psychopath who managed to make his way to the highest levels of our government.

      <p>
       People like Senator McCain are capable of unimaginable atrocities to further their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       That agenda is never-ending war, regardless of how many lives it costs.

       Absolutely..the comments in his tweet about Russia in Syria give me hope..American citizens for the most part are seeing what kind of evil men like McCain are capable of.
      </p>

       It's interesting..most of the people applauding him are also encouraging him to find a way to impeach Trump.

       yeah it is interesting.  the thing about Trump is that he could go both ways.  he's a Trump card.  and i'm concerned that the way in which he seems to pursue change is thru outwardly forcing issues rather than finding consensus (ie. letting people come together on their own).  like dropping a rock in a pond it will ripple outwards in maybe unpredictable ways.  if rather he's like a steady rock the ripples will coalesce around him but he won't change.

       My biggest concern is that at some point in the near future we are going to be reminded of something he said during his campaign -
      </p>
      <p>
       “I was saying this constantly and consistently to whoever would listen. I said: Keep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil,” Trump recalled. “Don’t let someone else get it.”

       there are a lot of things he's said that are sketchy like kill the families of the "terrorists".  killing innocent people is never the answer and a great way to perpetuate the cycle of violence.  also, what's up with yemen?

       Iran most definitely doesn't keep to themselves nor do they want peace. They want to be the mid east power but we support Saudi Arabia so they're salty af at us. They back Hezbollah. They literally provided militants in Iraq with training on how to build explosively formed penetrators. To say they want peace and mind their own business is laughable and shows a fundamental lack of knowledge of the region. The only ones that legitimately have been minding their own business are the syrians. Iran is ran by religious extremists. They absolutely should not ever be allowed to have a nuke

       comparing the scale of human rights abuses between the US actions and Iran's it's clear that one of these things is not like the other.  this is not to excuse abuses but to point out the lesser of evils.

       Iran is lead by a theocratic dictatorship (which came to power mostly as a response to Western meddling in Iranian affairs, I am aware) that has been known to treat its people brutally. Those people are now protesting in the streets, as they have sometimes done in the past before a crackdown, in favor of liberalization and democratization. If the people of Iran manage to replace their current regime with something that better serves their interests, then good for them. When you say "overthrow a sovereign nation" you are evoking (intentionally or otherwise) the idea of aggression by outsiders to impose their will on Iran. The
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       are the sovereign nation of Iran. If their government does not represent the will of the people, then it should be reformed or overthrown
       <em>
        by the people of Iran
       </em>
       in favor of a government that works for them.

       Here is what I have to say about that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

       The US Declaration of Independence isn't the governing charter of anything. Its authors believed it described universal "self-evident" truths about the nature of governments. If you don't agree with these points, then there's no chance we'll end up agreeing in this thread.

       Yah. You should.  especially when you've never been there.  Never talked to the people. Never saw how their society is.  I'm sure it's a lot different than what you've heard or seen in the news. There is so much propaganda nowadays, without seeing things with your own eyes how do you know what's true or not?

       Ok. I get your reasoning however it is flawed. The people of Iran aren't protesting. It's a small few.  Just like our protests here. Most likely hoodlums or dare I say paid actors.  These protests are nothing compared to the protests when trump was elected. Nothing compared to occupy.  Were those protests the will of the people?  Do you believe everything you read?  Did you not see that the US and Israel just publicly announced covert actions to undermine the Iranian govt?  Did you think they ever stopped using covert actions against the Iranian govt. Are you advocating interfering in another country because the media and these warmongers say so you delusional fool.
