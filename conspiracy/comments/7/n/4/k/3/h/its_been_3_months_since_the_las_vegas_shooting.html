    <div class="md"><p>No worries. It&#39;s a very interesting perspective. I&#39;m actually super relieved for you that you didn&#39;t extend your trip. I think one of the witnesses said he did end up staying because he was enjoying his time. I&#39;m sure he wished he would&#39;ve kept his original plans. </p>

<p>I can certainly understand how that would freak you out. You never know, you could&#39;ve stood in the elevator with this dude and his &quot;suitcase&quot; and never known it (sorry, not to add to your stress!). </p>

<p>Quick question... were you staying in a similar suite? It kind of looks like all the 135, 235, 335 rooms were all at the end of &quot;arms&quot; of the hotel. If you had an adjoining room door (even if you didn&#39;t have both rooms), could you tell us about it? Was it like an adjoining door many of us are used to with two doors. For instance, if you opened yours, would there be another door right there that the other room would have to open? Or was it just one door that locked from both sides... if that makes any sense. </p>

<p>What would video footage prove of people, say, entering a building? I agree it&#39;s suss that there&#39;s no footage for a lot of these, but it&#39;s not likely that people are rushing to the scene of shooting until after the gunshots have stopped for a long time, and if they are, it makes sense that they&#39;d do it with intend to aid the wounded, not record evidence.</p>

<p>And what would footage of them entering prove? Are you trying to say that there&#39;s multiple people, or they left from a vehicle that dropped them off, or they were stumbling around as if on drugs, or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or possibly a police mis hap similar to the Daniel shaver incident occured, they killed an innocent dude who brought his guns to go target shooting at one of the Vegas target ranges (hence the tannerite in his car), the cop/security guard having killed an innocent man in an open carry state knows he would be going to prison so busts a window out and starts shooting randomly. Instead of going to prison for life now he/they look like a hero. Everything since (all the fuck ups with the timeline, who was actually on scene and when, etc)has occurred bc the lvpd are trying to cover up for their brother and lying to feds but a few people mussed up the story while recounting to the feds..  That would account for the 2 single shots before the barrage of bullets started and all the fuckery between lvpd and the feds since. </p>

They can plant any kind of incriminating evidence via dirty cops or internet crimes. CIA loves harassing people until they commit suicide. </p>

<p>The difference between the common man and the military is staggering now. Even a normal joe realizes an unorganized revolution isn&#39;t enough to change the power structure. The system is now rigged and it&#39;s going to be tough to change it from within. But crashing the system has cataclysmic consequences as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are learning from 9/11&#39;s mistakes. 
They are getting better post the set ups but getting worse actually setting them up in the first place. This is because only a small handful of people are in on it and there are multiple false narratives that need to be managed. When one goes astray, it&#39;s too hard to cover up. So you just hope it goes away, then try to start making it hard for things like r/conspiracy to keep existing.</p>
