       I'm sure we've all noticed the huge push for trading Crypto currency stocks recently. One thing I don't think is obvious is that there is a significant difference between trading Crypto currency and owning it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crypto Currency is intended as a method of decentralized payment therefore removing banks out of the financial equation. In a fully crypto network the banker becomes an unnecessary middle man.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind it doesn't, at first, seem to add up that cryptos are being pushed so hard by the very people that stand to lose, unless of course they have a hand in it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easiest (and most seemingly agreeable to TPTB) way to get involved with crypto currency is by buying stock in it. This is important because it means that you do not receive any actual coins meaning the only way to spend it is trade the stocks for a centralised currency. This means that original financial institutions stay in the loop and anonymity is removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reminds me of the legend of Nathan Mayer Rothschild shorting the English pound by creating panic that England had lost the battle of Waterloo and then selling all of his 'consols' (bank annuities). Then before the real news broke he bought them all back for a fraction of the original investment.
      </p>
      <p>

       If it is being pushed it is safe to assume that it is also profitable to the ones pushing it. In terms of scale as an actual form of currency Bitcoin is in it's early adoption phase, however the price is massively inflated because it is being invested in heavily by regular people via stocks. According to CNBC cryptos are already worth more than JP Morgan.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/the-cryptocurrency-market-is-now-worth-more-than-jpmorgan.html">
        https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/the-cryptocurrency-market-is-now-worth-more-than-jpmorgan.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       By buying huge sums of Bitcoin stocks over time in the early stages of trading it would artificially cause a huge price hike encouraging others to follow causing a yet higher climb. After a while there would be no need for that first investor to keep buying. More and more people will pour money into the train to the end of the rainbow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once interest has piqued and all have invested, the price will stabilize. At this point in time cryptocurrencies would be common knowledge but not particularly used as a currency. If this initial investor could create a cryptocurrency that out-competes Bitcoin in usability as an actual currency they could then create a panic by selling all their stocks in Bitcoin and other clones and trade it for coins of their own design. People would panic buy this new currency as they see their entire livelihood disappear down the drain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ripple is being hailed as the future of cryptocurrency as a true currency due to its speed of transfer. Unlike Bitcoin that can take hours to trade, ripple takes no more than 4 seconds. The creators of this currency are gaining huge success already with integrating this system into traditional banking networks. Interestingly this crypto has been designed with central control in mind.

       In an ideal world we'd eventually move to all manufacturing and other laborious jobs becoming automated and adopting a universal income model. After some time though the concept of money would feel irrelevant as all the things required for life would be produced automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an automated world a person's worth would be measured by their achievements not by an imaginary number. We'd be free to create and invent. To explore the depths of consciousness and wander upon existence. This is prevented by any monetary system because it by nature creates pits of greed that blocks innovation.

       My guess is a crypto like ripple will push to make small transactions with their coins fast and easy by making it pliable to the current financial network.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first step would be making transactions into your current account seamless which is what they're doing atm with various banks. Next they will probably push for businesses to use it for all transactions, then finally those businesses will start to pay their employees with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually other currencies will fade out. The price of a coin would increase with adoption and whoever was in it first will become the new 1% richest. Of course, that's if the current 1% aren't the first, however the banks are at the front end of this scenario.

       Elon Musk is working toward a direct computer brain interface (Neuralink) now. I reckon this will be commonplace before 2025 and it goes so much further than just cryptocurrency. You would be directly linked to the internet at all times and this chip would constantly send metadata back and forth. The price for telepathy will be freedom.

       Bitcoin development has been taken over by a developer team (Blockstream) supported by corps who pushed centralized off chain scaling solutions called segwit and lightning. Bitcoin community forked into Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to save the true vision of peer to peer decentralized money.

       I wondered what Bitcoin cash was about, thanks. I read earlier that BTC and BCH are doing a sort of merger where Bitcoin cash is trading all BCH for Bitcoin. It puts that into context I didn't see.

       The idea that Bitcoin Cash is the "true bitcoin" is simply not correct.  You can even use zipperit's own source by reading the FAQ on r/btc and its reference to BCH.  In short, BCH was simply a hard fork of the original BTC chain that added some upgrades -- mainly larger blocks for faster transactions and lower fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the fact that the bulk of BCash's mining power was controlled by two people -- Roger Ver and Jihan -- the idea that is is truly decentralized -- came into question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, Ver went on a massive propaganda campaign specifically designed to confuse newbies into thinking that BCash is Bitcoin.  As an example, if you download the bitcoin.com wallet (owned by Ver's company)  it will default to a BCash wallet rather a bitcoin wallet.  Hence, Ver's painful and often childlike insistence that people refer to the coin as Bitcoin Cash rather than BCash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ver also hired an army of people to deploy this misinformation here, there and everywhere.  Not difficult to discern as soon as you understand the talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is developed by Bitcoin Core -- but change in the code requires unanimous support, which is why it moves so slowly.  The result has been no bigger blocks (for the moment) and high fees --- with the primary concern being to remain decentralized.  Segwit and Lightening are experiments that may or may not be deployed by bitcoin.  Litecoin (bitcoin based) often serves as a testnet for these upgrades and they are far from nefarious.  They are designed to speed the process of confirming transactions and they have absolutely nothing to do with centralizing bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't take my word for it.  Do some digging.  Read up on Ver and Jihan.  The truth will be fairly obvious.  If you're new to crypto, you have to read up and make your own decisions. Check out @whalepanda and @satoshilite (creator of litecoin) on twitter and follow the discussion there amongst the heavy hitters working in the space.

       not a fan of currency as a model.  it's the kind of thing that is easily levered into abuse.  rather, i'd suggest gaining self-sufficiency by growing your own food, getting your own power, water, shelter, and producing goods you can trade.  this is something you can truly build upon and leave as a legacy for your family.

       This is my plan exactly. Should have my mortgage paid off in 3 years then I'm gonna spend the next 5-10 years working toward self sufficiency before retiring. If all goes well I'll be completely untethered from the money trap before I'm 35.

       I do think the Rothchilds and other powerful banking families care about crypto and are beginning to try and sway the prices. But I think its being done more by the rich people who want to be equally elite. Rothchilds laid out the plan and proved what works and now the new rich are trying.

       This only works if they actually manage to create the "panic" but the people who are in bitcoin , for crypto, and not for profits, will not care what the price is , they will use it anyway.

       It isn't the ones that are actually converting cash to bitcoins that I see losing out. It's a smart move in my opinion in terms of security. The ones that stand to lose are those buying into Bitcoin and other crypto stocks. These people are gambling with fate.

       They're pushing the lighting network to speed up bitcoin transfers but guess what, it doesn't actual transfer through bitcoins between accounts. It's a separate network which stores an IOU for the transfer of the bitcoins.

       Crypto is 100% a pandora's box and a lot of the hype (decentralization, peer to peer, fast, cheap) has turned into smoke &amp; mirrors.  You really have to admire how genius the bait and switch was executed.  Alt coins are an interesting litmus test since some are quite open about being aligned with corporate power systems while others really appear to enable a leveling of the playing field.  Which will people choose to support?  Will goodness &amp; decency finally overcome greed and avarice?  There is still a chance, but it's fading fast.
