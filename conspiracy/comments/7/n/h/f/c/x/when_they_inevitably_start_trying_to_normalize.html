       You won't be able to do shit without it is how it will be implemented.  But it will be over the span of another 10-30+ years.  Its a matter of getting people used to the technology and understanding it will be the only way to keep them  and their money safe.  Walk into the grocery store and walk out, no checkers, it just scans your chip and deducts from your account and sends you an email of your receipt.  The world will run much more efficiently, but there will be no privacy.  Johnny won't be able to mow your lawn for under the table cash and little Suzie will have to close up the lemonade stand because the taxes will be too high.

       How will it be seen as the mark of the beast? If I remember Revelation correctly, the mark of the beast is an exterior mark. Not a chip inside.

       It is interesting that the King James version says " a mark in the forehead" and the niv says "on the forehead." I wonder why the placement changed through the versions.

       Yale prof. Dr. Jose Delgado was a mind control doctor who committed great atrocities. MKultra was said to be a limited hangout to distract from the more nefarious Project Bluebird. Delgado did a lot of work with brain implants he developed called "stimoceivers."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg">
        https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Later in his life, he conceded that microchip impants are now passe.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Do you remember how we thought of Franco?" says his wife. "Imagine being able to turn off the Generalisimo." Delgado responds "But who could have put the electrodes into the dictator? With electromagnetic radiation we could have controlled the dictator from a distance. We did some experiments at Yale where we influenced the brain from up to 30 meters away."
       </p>
       <p>
        We take up Delgado's research on electromagnetic fields and their effect on people. "I could later do with electro-magnetic radiation what I did with the stimoceiver. It's much better because there's no need for surgery," he explains.

       At least two hundred thousand women were injured with many of them being left permanently sterile as a result of having the Dalcon Shield implanted in their uterus to prevent them from getting pregnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did that due primarily to completely false and misleading claims that it was safer than birth control pills and the suggestion that the hormone that made those pills so effective and reliable
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       possibly give them cancer later on in life.

       They really don't need to implant the chip into you when most people on the planet already carry one around with them willingly ( cell phones ).
      </p>
      <p>
       It has already happened.
      </p>

       I can't wait for the implantable cell phone/computer, then we will truly have entered the future.

       They have started. There have been chipping parties already.

      <p>
       They don't have to "justify" it, they simply advertise it. There'll be news about celebrities and other influencers getting chipped, interviews with them celebrating the convenience, news sections devoted to "30% of all Californians don't carry ID or cash with them anymore", in-clubs, airports and train stations simply won't admit you without chip; sooner or later, your social circles will look at you with wide eyes when you sheepishly admit you aren't
