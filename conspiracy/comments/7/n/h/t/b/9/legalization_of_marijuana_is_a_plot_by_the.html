    <div class="md"><p>After decriminalization, social stigma goes decreases as well. With more research the effects of the old propaganda fades.  Smoke it a few times and fear of the unfamiliar experience subsides. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see some science based evidence that proves a biological increase in paranoia response as a result of smoking weed. I&#39;ll have to search that later. Not saying it doesn&#39;t, but the stories of making users paranoid are typically come from old propaganda, new users, or users that take way to much and enter into a mental state unfamiliar too themselves. There are also many stories of it relaxing the mind and helping achieve a sleep state and that doesn&#39;t really jive with being paranoid either, but one could argue that those effects occur during the downside arc or tail-end of a high, while paranoia may still occur during the beginning or upside of a high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed definitely leads to increased paranoia in a large percentage of users. Maybe <em>some</em> people don&#39;t experience any heightened paranoia while on weed, I am happy to accept that. But who is honestly suggesting that none of themselves, their friends, or any people they&#39;ve smoked with has been more paranoid when on the herbs?</p>

<p>Anecdotally I have experienced it for myself and spoken with several others whose experiences are similar: weed can and does lead to heightened paranoia.</p>

<p>Maybe not all strains, maybe not all people. But enough for it to be more than mere &#39;propaganda&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with you or your experiences. I&#39;m just arguing there is a spectrum of reasons for experiencing paranoia and I have not seen any science based evidence that shows a biological trigger of the human paranoia response due to smoking weed, which is what all the old propaganda suggests without taking into account the social constructs that add to that paranoia.  There&#39;s also a fine line between heightened awareness of certain aspects of ones environment and paranoia. Sometimes the former can cause the latter. You also mention different strains, which I think is key. The difference between smoking sativa and smoking indica can be almost night and day, at least that&#39;s what my dog tells me. Ymmv.</p>

<p>also, the way it&#39;s being legalized, state by state, pretty much shows the legal weed industry is completely independent, and it&#39;s the government/ corporate interests that are trying to stop it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes me laugh. Thanks I needed that. People will still grow their own weed from their own seeds. They have been doing it for years and it won&#39;t stop now. The gov would have to stamp out every grower and if they couldn&#39;t do that during prohibition what are their chances now it&#39;s legal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all like dominoes...</p>

<p>Start them off with an influx of addicts from Opiates. Its going around in phases... State to state. 
Addicts turn to Weed as an alternative.
Tax the weed.
Guess what? Government never told you about the fact that weed helps with cancer... its so great, weed helps with Pain, and I also read its supposed to slow some types of cancer cells...like, they are REALLY emphasizing on it lately... Like the plot is thickening... More stories to make weed look good.</p>

<p>Now, the government is involved with weed.... Making a killing off it. But, it doesn&#39;t stop there. What if the weed the government is manufacturing (taxed) is infused with new chemicals like carcinogens which cause cancer and other problems? A lot of people are starting to dabble into edibles lately. Easy to slip some untraceable chemicals to make more cancer patients....</p>

<p>Make more money off the drugs to relieve those cancer patients. </p>

<p>Dont you love where we are going? Mark my words....</p>

<p>By the way, you know how people in Hawaii with a medicinal card now cant have a gun. Yeah... watch, that shit is coming to California next. Mark my words. Then will follow other states in the same fashion. </p>

<p>I am so paranoid of the government and dont trust anyone. Im worried to even grow my own weed because probably whatever chemicals they sprayed earlier in 2017 (all those chem trails) may have created a type of atmosphere with this &quot;agent&quot; that would basically rot out or make any growing plant a poison. </p>

<p>They want to control it all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your input. Once people become addicted they will do whatever and pay whatever is required to get it. Cigarettes have increased at least 600% since the 80&#39;s.
