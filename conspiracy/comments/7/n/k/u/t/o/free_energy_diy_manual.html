<p>YES YOU THERE.</p>

<p>On your digital device!</p>

<p>Reading the text!</p>

<p>How would YOU like to power that device - forever - without plugging it in to that seemingly abundant government supply of humming buzzing 120 volts at 50-60 hertz of alternating current flowing through your walls or buying expensive poison tubes that have slogans like &quot;keeps going and going&quot; but die in a day?</p>

<p>Why bother doing so, you ask?</p>

<p>Because I dont like the idea that Im not in control of my life.</p>

<p>And one day that government supply might stop.</p>

<p>And those battery factories might close.</p>

<p>Then what?</p>

<p><em>Then these words wont be read when your device sits all dead.</em></p>

<h1>THE FREE ENERGY MANUAL</h1>

<p>Atmospheric energy harvesting, simple saltwater batteries and variously applied over unity circuits are excellent paths to energy freedom.</p>

<p>Here is just one method to create a power source that, paired with some knowledge about alchemy and electricity, can be used to power anything for years.</p>

<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

<p><em>In this instruction manual you will be heating a copper pipe cap filled with ground salts that will liquify around a dissimilar metal core.</em></p>

<p><em>They should each have an output of .8 to 1.5 volts and between 30-150 milliamps</em></p>

<p><strong>Ensure that you have a heat source and grinding apparatus prepared with which you may either easily clean or not use for edible food as some ingredients (Borax) should not be consumed.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>Step 1</li>
</ul>

<p>Buy a 1/2 inch copper pipe cap (preferably with a flat bottom that can stand on its own) and about a 3/4 inch long hex bolt or any other clean bolt with a flat head that will fit inside the copper cap. </p>

<ul>
<li>Step 2 </li>
</ul>

<p>Find a piece of engine gasket material or wood or leather. Anything that is semi heat resistant and can be cut down to size in order to fit in to the 1/2 inch copper pipe cap. Place the material inside the copper cap at the bottom. </p>

<ul>
<li>Step 3</li>
</ul>

<p>Gather some Borax, Alum, Epsom Salt, and Potassium Chloride - the latter of these is commonly found in salt subsitute seasonings. Make sure the epsom salt does not say +H20. If thats all you can find then place the epsom salt in a thin layer on a sheet of aluminum foil over heat and boil off the water. The white chunks leftover will need to be ground in to a powder.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 4</li>
</ul>

<p>Measure out and grind each ingredient to the proportions you are using. An equal mix of each ingredient is a good ratio to start with. So for a small copper cap, only a 1/2 tablespoon of each ingredient is enough. Make sure to keep all the ingredients as dry as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all the ingredients together. Grinding again is helpful, the finer the grind the better.
Now, pour the powder in to the copper pipe cap. Fill it about half way. Have more ready, for when it liquifies, it condenses quite a lot.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 6</li>
</ul>

<p>Find a small piece of wire or something that you can stir with. Turn on your heat source to a low setting. Place your copper cap over the heat. Stir while it is heating and the salts will liquify. Add more salts and continue stirring until it is almost full. Place the metal core in the middle, while the copper is still on the heat, then carefully remove it from the heat and let it cool for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>If the salts will not liquify. Increase the heat slightly. If they still do not, either the salts were not ground well enough or too much moisture is present.</p>

<ul>
<li>Completion</li>
</ul>

<p>You have completed your very own crystal power cell.</p>

<p>Test it with a multimeter and see the fruits of your labour.</p>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

<hr/>

<p>This is a rough version.</p>

<p>These cells are not magic.</p>

<p>They have limits.</p>

<p>If you draw more energy than they can create they will slowly dim and cease to have any output.</p>

<p>But if you disconnect what was drawing power, it will regain its previous charge over time.</p>

<p>The key to seemingly perpetual energy is to balance what they create and what you draw.</p>

<p>These cells actually begin to have a higher output the longer they are connected to a load. Sometimes as much as 5-15% or more. And inversely they seem to work less efficiently the longer they are not connected to something. Although initially the cells drop in voltage slightly in the first few days after creation, this is likely due to heat energy being worn off, the voltage does settle, and the voltage rise can then be seen after that.</p>

<p>These crystal cells are widely unknown and apparently taboo devices.</p>

<p>I wish to see that changed.</p>

<p>Also Earth is not a globe. Weve been totally fed like.. Lies yo....</p>

<p>The copper cap and machine bolt may also be subsituted for other materials such as magnesium. Try different plated bolts like zinc or nickel. Also possibly carbon or graphene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as the bolt sticks of the cap or cube enough, theyll stack in series just fine.</p>

<p>Actually you can join 3 or 4 together in parallel, just place them in a little group with the copper bases all touching, e tape them tightly, then wire the bolts together, and stack them in series.</p>

<p>Again, they would have much more output with a small piece of solid magnesium but that is a difficult thing to find. I hear the magnesiun tape does not work very well, but I dont know for sure. Other highly conductive materials may work as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is corrosion there. It’s what’s causing the rods to get forced out and the pipes to burst. The corroded material takes up more volume than the metal. That’s where the pressure is coming from. Plus, you can see the dark corroded material outlining the rod. Corrosion happens on the surface, not the inside of the rod.</p>

<p>These are chemical batteries, nothing more. The reason they last such a long time is because there is just a lot of anode material available. They are very cheap to build and last a long long time. The downside is they are heavy, large, and produce very little power.</p>

<p>This is simple redox electrochemistry and we understand how these things work. When kids make electrochemical cells out of lemons or potatoes they are applying the same concepts.</p>

<p>These are very simple devices to understand. If you want to prove that some kind of exotic crystal energy is occurring here you need to find a different way to prove it because the electrochemistry is going to serve as a confounding factor. These are magnesium-copper batteries by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is merit to this you should be able to defend it by explaining how these experiments prove your claims. Try to do that without mentioning government indoctrination and conspiracy. Not only is it insulting but it does not help your cause in the slightest. Let the evidence speak for itself. As it stands, all of this says these are electrochemical cells by design. </p>

<p>Now let’s discuss how the charge cycles prove it’s not. Please explain why these would not function as electrochemical cells based on the oscilloscope observations. It seems to me that these would still produce voltage as long as there is unoxidized anode left. The charge/discharge cycles are an interesting observation but I don’t see how these prove crystal power on their own. Can you elaborate?</p>

<p>He is convinced that because it doesn&#39;t look like an average homemade wet cell and that he didn&#39;t add any water in the process it can&#39;t be a battery, thats the level of understanding of electrochemistry he&#39;s operating at.  Looking at some of the videos he&#39;s linked it seems like this is a decently common phenomenon of people creating battery cells they don&#39;t understand and assuming they must be free energy machines, and anybody who tries to explain reality to them has to be an oil shill</p>

<p>These crystal cells are different.</p>

Now why would connecting two electrodes of different metals aid in the flow if the crystal is what’s generating the voltage?

Why doesn’t this work in practice? What is it about using copper and zinc electrodes that enhances the flow?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it really doesn’t. It doesn’t explain why the potential being generated by the crystal is enhanced by using different metals. The conductivity in one is lower, which would increase resistance and lower the overall potential, not increase it. This is all assuming the cell is being powered by the crystal, as in the crystal is generating an electrical potential (i.e. a voltage). The cell is enhanced by using two different metals with different conductivities but impeded by using the only the metal with the better conductivity. So conductivity is not the key variable here. So then what else might be going on that explains this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In normal electrochemical cells, the energy comes from the corrosion. If the electrodes don’t corrode, then where is the energy coming from? The crystals?</p>

<p>Okay, let’s assume it comes from the crystals. In order to prevent the anode from corroding, it would need to produce a voltage. Otherwise you’re violating the laws of thermodynamics by creating free energy. </p>

<p>But now, if the crystals are producing a voltage, they can generate current all on their own and the electrodes are unnecessary. So why then so these batteries require electrodes at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, listen, I did more research into this and you need to realize that this is a simple galvanic cell. Even the people who give tutorials on how to make these explain as much and even cite galvanic tables and principles to explain concepts and predict the kinds of voltages one can expect. </p>

<p>The reason they “recharge” is not because they’re recharging at all. They go flat due to a build up of charged ions around the electrodes and it takes time for the pazeioelectric material to dissipate these charges. So the cell becomes inhibited when you draw too much current, not depleted. </p>

<p>The reason they last so long is the same reason galvanized roofs and such can last ten years: the protective galvanic anode simply hasn’t been depleted. </p>

<p>I know you don’t actually understand how galvanic cells work. It’s really easy to tell and not being honest with yourself about this only stunts your own intellectual development. Electrochemical principles really are not difficult to understand and you should take some time to learn about them. Regardless of what conspiracy theories you subscribe to, you can play with and test the relevant concepts yourself, completely on your own, by making your own simple batteries with easily accessible materials and equipment. You basically have already started doing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because normal batteries are designed to be <em>useful.</em> These batteries last a long time because they produce such little power. Let us use the numbers reported in the Reid experiments you linked. From 1999 to 2006 the battery produced a whopping 60 watt-hours. Let me put that in perspective; </p>

<p>60 watt-hours is enough energy to light one 60 watt light bulb for 1 hour. So if you stored all the energy this battery produced over the course of <em>7 years,</em> you would only be able to keep 1 incandescent light bulb lit for <em>1 hour.</em> </p>

<p>In other terms, if this battery had the capacity to powre a 60 watt bulb (it doesn&#39;t) it would burn through all the energy it provided during that entire 7 year period in <em>1 hour.</em></p>

<p>The amount of energy that went into refining the materials you used to make this, not even considering the energy used to heat the salt, far surpasses the energy produced by this battery in <em>7 years.</em></p>

<p>This poster does not provide expected lifespans for these specific cells but he does say the amperage will drop down by an order of magnitude because these cells are &quot;fresh.&quot; The batteries in the Reid experiments <em>you cited</em> produced 60 watt hours over 7 years, around the energy density of a nickle hydride battery, <em>as mentioned in the source you cited.</em> I&#39;m taking everything you have given me at face value and even ignored the things which aren&#39;t accurate.</p>

<p>After watching more videos on this guys youtube channel, he would probably tell you the same shit I&#39;m telling you right now. He demonstrates a strong understanding of how these cells work and seems to understand that corrosion is occurring and the internal pressure produced by the &quot;crystal&quot; growth caused by the corrosion improves the longevity. He plays with them because they are a cool little oddities and they last a long time, not because they&#39;re some revolutionary technology.
