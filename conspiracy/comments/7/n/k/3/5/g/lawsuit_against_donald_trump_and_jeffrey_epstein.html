<p>does anyone else remember how the Trump lawsuit magically dropped right when we started looking at Epstein and his Israeli Mossad brownstone ops too close?</p>

<p>I imagine, this is the same tactics being played out over the last two years.</p>

<p>Blame trump for colluding with Russia, wait. . .that was Clinton selling uranium and being exposed for breaking laws.</p>

<p>Blame trump for pissing on a hooker, wait.. . that was Clinton on Epstein&#39;s stolen flight records. That was Clinton left-handlers fucking children and having pedo-art. </p>

<p>Blame trump for &#39;trivializing truth&#39;, wait . . .It was Clinton that is shown to have been guiding the MSM, and the DNC - to snuff out competition and air certain stories.</p>

<p>I think you just confirmed Bill Clinton is a pedo. If patterns persist among propagandists. </p>

<p>no, actually this lawsuit got dropped 4 days before the 2016 election. </p>

<p>the lawsuit was an obvious smear job against Trump, a desperate hail-mary play</p>

<p>but in retrospect, its good to revisit what was said, to see just how heinous the allegations were. </p>

<p>we have had over a year to put other pieces of the pg story together, but this Trump-Epstein connection is weird and needs re-visitation. </p>

<p>i think thats why the lawsuit was filed and also why it was dropped. </p>

<p>it was filed to smear trump</p>

<p>but dropped because pursuing it was not worth it?</p>

<p>if it was a legit case, how did she have the courage to file it but not to follow thru? </p>

<p>i sometimes make post-worthy comments that are not necessary turned into new OPs</p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a bot, but i have been accused of being a bot on numerous occasions, probably because i am somewhat methodical and predictable </p>

<p>like if we have conversation about Boston, I&#39;ve already got every point and counter-point memorized, so it seems amazing to people that i can offer up these rebuttals. but I&#39;ve had the conversations before, and thats why i know where they are heading...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are probably right</p>

<p>thats disturbing</p>

<p>remember Jon Benet Ramsey? </p>

<p>if you consider the fact that many so-called &quot;porn actors&quot; go to Hollywood to try and work as movie stars, but instead find themselves doing porn</p>

<p>now, how many young girls are lured into a image of being a model, and instead find themselves being a prostitute or sex slave</p>

<p>if you have Netflix, check out Dave Chappelle Netflix specials (at least 2 shows), he basically uses a book entitled &quot;pimp&quot; to use as a metaphor of how show business treated him </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cases like this get dropped all the time because it&#39;s their word against someone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>The allegations against Trump come after his admission to sexual assault, walking into dressing rooms, and his friendship with Epstein.</p>

<p>OP you twisted the words around a bit. I never said Trump wasn&#39;t given a free pass. He&#39;s just never mentioned in pedogate. He obviously had his own accusers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is never mentioned in pedogate, because as far as i know Trump and Epstein were once friends, and Trump made a comment about how Epstein was a great guy who liked young girls</p>

<p>later, Epstein had allegedly propositioned a young girl at Trump&#39;s resort, and this girls father complained to Trump and Trump banned Epstein from his resort. </p>

<p>another time, Trump was allegedly invited onto Epstein&#39;s private jet, and when he saw scantily clad young people, Trump left the jet</p>

<p>However, just tonight i was exposed to a new theory, that Trump and Epstein were actually workmen together to entrap important people. </p>

<p>so maybe the rift between Trump and Epstein is a smoke screen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timeline is fucked for that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein had allegedly propositioned a young girl at Trump&#39;s resort</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly that happened in 1999 and Trump gave a quote about Epstein in 2003 to NYMAG.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t seem like the kinda guy who would want to ride on someone else&#39;s plane no matter who it is.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So if that were true why did Epstein go to jail?</p>

<p>There definitely could be an Epstein to Mossad connection. Doesn&#39;t give any reason why Trump would be apart of the blackmailing and not the blackmailee</p>

<p>yes he went to &quot;jail&quot;, but it was a remarkably lenient sentence, 13 months on a resort, basically</p>

<p>and now that you&#39;ve reminded me...</p>

<p>Trump picked Alexander Acosta as his Secretary of Labor</p>

<p>AA was the low-level prosecutor who got JE his light sentence. </p>

<p>AA claims that when he was prosecuting JE, he came under enormous outside pressure to go light on him</p>

<p>seems AA is an odd pick for Sec of Labor given his background </p>
