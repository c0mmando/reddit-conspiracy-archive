       does anyone else remember how the Trump lawsuit magically dropped right when we started looking at Epstein and his Israeli Mossad brownstone ops too close?

       Blame trump for colluding with Russia, wait. . .that was Clinton selling uranium and being exposed for breaking laws.

       Blame trump for pissing on a hooker, wait.. . that was Clinton on Epstein's stolen flight records. That was Clinton left-handlers fucking children and having pedo-art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blame trump for 'trivializing truth', wait . . .It was Clinton that is shown to have been guiding the MSM, and the DNC - to snuff out competition and air certain stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you just confirmed Bill Clinton is a pedo. If patterns persist among propagandists.

       no, actually this lawsuit got dropped 4 days before the 2016 election.

      <p>
       the lawsuit was an obvious smear job against Trump, a desperate hail-mary play

       but in retrospect, its good to revisit what was said, to see just how heinous the allegations were.

       we have had over a year to put other pieces of the pg story together, but this Trump-Epstein connection is weird and needs re-visitation.

       i think we should revisit the allegations to see just how disgusting these people are in their attempts to smear people

       surprised they didn't add a few more juicy details like drinking baby blood etc

       what if this lawsuit was against you? it ruins your reputation whether its true or not

       i think thats why the lawsuit was filed and also why it was dropped.

       it was filed to smear trump

       but dropped because pursuing it was not worth it?

       Ghislaine and her father always gets overlooked in these articles. Robert Maxwell links the Kosher Nostra to the former USSR along with fellow Czech Ivana Trump. It's no coincidence that Ghislaine and Ivanka are half Czech daughters of Billionaires that fuck monsters like Epstein and Kushner for Israel.

       Im not triggered I just think your potentially a bot. I said your comment was post worthy, I think both Clinton and Trump are both snakes. I just think the way your ready made reply was either made by a programmed bot, a paid human or a triggered human. Then your replies to me and how you resorted to calling me exactly what I called you, have made me think you have to be a poltitabot with herpes. Good reply though, do you have templates or premade replies that you use when you see a fitting post?

       that doesn't mean I'm a bot, but i have been accused of being a bot on numerous occasions, probably because i am somewhat methodical and predictable

       like if we have conversation about Boston, I've already got every point and counter-point memorized, so it seems amazing to people that i can offer up these rebuttals. but I've had the conversations before, and thats why i know where they are heading...

       now, how many young girls are lured into a image of being a model, and instead find themselves being a prostitute or sex slave

       Cases like this get dropped all the time because it's their word against someone else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The allegations against Trump come after his admission to sexual assault, walking into dressing rooms, and his friendship with Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP you twisted the words around a bit. I never said Trump wasn't given a free pass. He's just never mentioned in pedogate. He obviously had his own accusers.

       Trump is never mentioned in pedogate, because as far as i know Trump and Epstein were once friends, and Trump made a comment about how Epstein was a great guy who liked young girls
      </p>
      <p>
       later, Epstein had allegedly propositioned a young girl at Trump's resort, and this girls father complained to Trump and Trump banned Epstein from his resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       another time, Trump was allegedly invited onto Epstein's private jet, and when he saw scantily clad young people, Trump left the jet
      </p>
      <p>
       However, just tonight i was exposed to a new theory, that Trump and Epstein were actually workmen together to entrap important people.
      </p>
      <p>
       so maybe the rift between Trump and Epstein is a smoke screen?

       Supposedly that happened in 1999 and Trump gave a quote about Epstein in 2003 to NYMAG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't seem like the kinda guy who would want to ride on someone else's plane no matter who it is.

        However, just tonight i was exposed to a new theory, that Trump and Epstein were actually working together to entrap important people.

      <p>
       So if that were true why did Epstein go to jail?
      </p>
      <p>
       There definitely could be an Epstein to Mossad connection. Doesn't give any reason why Trump would be apart of the blackmailing and not the blackmailee

       yes he went to "jail", but it was a remarkably lenient sentence, 13 months on a resort, basically

      <p>
       and now that you've reminded me...

       Trump picked Alexander Acosta as his Secretary of Labor
      </p>
      <p>
       AA was the low-level prosecutor who got JE his light sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       AA claims that when he was prosecuting JE, he came under enormous outside pressure to go light on him
      </p>
      <p>
       seems AA is an odd pick for Sec of Labor given his background

       Trump and Ivana had model agencies and connections to the Ukraine/ Czech Republic to traffic young girls and mob connections to help. Ghislaines father (Czech) was a very famous mossad agent. Trump allowed Ghislaine to recruit Virginia Roberts.
