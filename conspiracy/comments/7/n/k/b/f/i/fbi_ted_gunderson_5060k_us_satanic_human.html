<p>Sometimes I&#39;ve really appreciated his efforts. He accompanied a mind control researcher to meet with senators regarding ongoing mind control torture programs. I think he was spot-on with that one. I don&#39;t agree with the assesment he had of chemtrails on youtube. Just my opinion, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t wonder if maybe the common consensus that it was all just a made up &#39;panic&#39; or hysteria was what these evil people wanted us to believe? Plato wrote thousands of years ago of our innate desire to disbelieve hard to swallow facts. The notion that child sacrifice is happening in modern America is something very easy to disbelieve for, in my opinion, this very reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear what you&#39;re saying about Plato, but I think it&#39;s worth looking the facts that came to light during this period when it comes to those investigations.</p>

<p>They were almost all overturned because they were prosecuted on extremely shaky grounds - suggestive questioning of 5 year olds and repressed memory therapies. Accused accomplices being kept naked in solitary confinement until they agreed to testify. Countless accusations of physical abuse despite no actual physical evidence of abuse. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, people will have a tough time swallowing hard truths, but they can also follow false truths just as, if not more easily when whipped into a frenzy by unfounded accusations that prey on their insecurities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes a bit deeper than just day care hysteria being debunked; those cases, in the end, were mostly attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory_syndrome">False Memory Syndrome</a> which up until then wasn&#39;t a recognized disorder, and it basically just said that the memories the children had of being taken places and abused weren&#39;t real and and it was all made up, nothing to see here.</p>

<p>The problem is who originated the idea that led to the &quot;debunking&quot;; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Memory_Syndrome_Foundation">the False Memory Syndrome Foundation</a> is the group that popularized this non-DSM recognized mental disorder and used it as proof that multiple crimes didn&#39;t take place using questionable evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite claiming to offer scientific evidence for the existence of FMS, the FMSF has no criteria for one of the primary features of the proposed syndrome – how to determine whether the accusation is true or false. Most of the reports by the FMSF are anecdotal, and the studies cited to support the contention that false memories can be easily created are often based on experiments that bear little resemblance to memories of actual sexual abuse. In addition, though the FMSF claims false memories are due to dubious therapeutic practices, the organization presents no data to demonstrate these practices are widespread or form an organized treatment modality.[23][24] Within the anecdotes used by the FMSF to support their contention that faulty therapy causes false memories, some include examples of people who recovered their memories outside of therapy.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To take it down another level you want to look into who the people that started this group were, who the members were, and anything relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992[1] by Pamela and Peter Freyd, after their adult daughter Professor Jennifer Freyd accused Peter Freyd of sexual abuse when she was a child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Freyd&#39;s brother added that, in his view, &quot;The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is designed to deny a reality that Peter and Pam have spent most of their lives trying to escape,&quot; and that he was certain abuse happened to his niece.&quot;</p>

<p>Thx for sharing. Will have to look what &quot;False Memory Syndrom&quot; even entails but I can imagine already, it&#39;s in the name after all. </p>

<p>It all just looks a bit convenient.. yeah  (in a: &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything to her so here&#39;s this new medical alignment/syndrom to explain why it&#39;s all fantasy&quot;, kind of way.) </p>

<p>I saw his name earlier (probably somewhere on this topic) and searched it.  He seems to tie into a lot of other subjects I&#39;ve been reading about.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Program. The Johnny Goch case, Temple of Set etc.</p>

<p>Dang. Funny how these subjects come up through his career summary and past reading material just connect.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot to this. Will look up additional names, ty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He founded the Temple of Set after becoming disillusioned with LaVey&#39;s Church of Satan. He was also heavily implicated in the Presidio Army Base&#39;s day care scandal where 60 children between 4-7 were raped. The Army actually closed that day care <em>and then demolished it</em> presumably to destroy any evidence, but the kids actually described the inside of his house. The authorities weren&#39;t able to find any physical evidence so he was let off, later they audited all the bases daycares nationwide and found similar issues in 10% of them, and he was connected to those ones too. He&#39;s why those MK Ultra guys were in the FMSF.</p>

<p>He was also involved in the Iran Contra scandal run by Ollie North and overseen by Bush Sr so those contacts may have protected him somewhat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, calling it &quot;Satanism&quot; is just a catch-all term to get you on the right sorta page. It can be described as Satanic not because it has anything to do with Lucifer of the Christian Bible, but that beliefs, philosophies and practices present in Satanism are also present in these rituals. It&#39;s very black magick/occult-based, and I think occult symbology has a much more fundamental basing in this universal reality than religion which, under this assumption, would be an emergent phenomena.<br/>
I don&#39;t doubt though that there are people who practice literal Satanism, but to generalise then saying &quot;Satanism&quot; gets the message across better than something like &quot;Babylonian Talmudism&quot;, which most people might never have even heard of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, there is a running debate as to whether &quot;Satan&quot; so to speak was inserted in the Bible in later revisions. Both Satan and Lucifer actually have very few direct references.</p>

<p>There is also an open debate in even the highest levels of the Catholic Church as to whether God/Lucifer/Satan are all one God, because the Bible directly refers to Satan as a God at least once, and there are parts where Satan impersonates god, etc etc.</p>

<p>As a former Christian turned Agnostic, and an armchair Anthropologist/Historian, I have a distinct feeling the majority of &quot;Satan&quot; worship is derived from the worship of Saturn, one of the most prevalent Roman Gods during Constantine&#39;s time. I believe his &#39;conversion&#39; was done on the pretext that Saturn would be included in the Christian holy text as Satan. At some point, over hundreds of years, the &quot;Saturn/Satan&quot; cult has become the de facto operator of the Catholic Church, and over the last several decades has been attempting to do the same within other religious institutions.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Catholic Church plans in Millennia, that realization and perspective on their actions really made it seem far more plausible to me personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an argument I&#39;ve heard entertained by people of the faith, that &#39;Satan&#39; was a name God used to trick Jesus, and iirc there is literally one story that is exactly that, God pretending to be Satan and proud of Jesus for not falling to temptation.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Catholics I know have discussed this and I&#39;ve watched a lot of debates regarding Christianity and have seen this subject come up and be entertained seriously by Catholic scholars etc. It&#39;s an interpretation that&#39;s not belittled, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Lucifer just means falling star and I throw it around because people assume it&#39;s the devil and a lot of faiths have different interpretations of the name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. The reason for these dark rituals is self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Evil is simply self-serving behavior <em>even</em> at the expense of others. If it&#39;s not at the expense of others, it&#39;s not evil. Self-interest is not evil. Choosing to screw others to serve your own self-interest is.</p>

<p>The dark rituals are supposed to give power and/or pleasure, by stealing a mind energy from other consciousness, radiated in fear and pain. Unscrupulous self-serving humans and ETs do this to increase their satisfaction and yield greater ability to affect reality with their minds.</p>

<p>I get so frustrated that Christianity steals all the light of awareness of this phenomenon, pasting it over with dogmatic wallpaper that conceals not reveals. This phenomenon is real, but it says more about Christianity is a fraud than that it is the way. No, from what I have learned of this type of being, it&#39;s very likely Christianity is corrupted to serve them. It keeps people in fear and submission to authority. That&#39;s precisely the way this type of being wants their slaves to &quot;think.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>from what ive seen of mormonism, you basically have a group of ppl who will believe whatever u say provided it comez from church of mormon. </p>

<p>got a grandparent who did bad things? give some money to the church to make sure he gets to heaven.</p>

<p>worried about your physical safety? wear secret u derwear called &#39;garments&#39; and it will protect from physical harm.</p>

<p>want many wives? just say you are a mormon prophet, build a compound and kick out all young boys from the community. </p>

<p>Just look at mormon run prisons and you will see that mormons are capable of very violent treatment of others. </p>

<p>not using drugs, alcohol, and tobacco does not make some one moral.</p>

<p>mormons are at best ignorant trolls and at worst evil pawns used by other more evil groups to push their agenda.</p>

<p>what do you expect when you isolate a bunch of white people in the woods and tell them everyone else is immoral or needs to be converted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What gives you the credence to say such outlandish things?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mormons are at best ignorant trolls and at worst evil pawns used by other more evil groups to push their agenda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you even talked to a Mormon?</p>

<p>Have you ever talked to the people who run the church? </p>

<p>Personally, I have spoke with half of the twelve apostles, and many more who hold high positions. </p>

<p>What you are saying is totally, 100% opinion. Not only that, but it is an opinion that is drawn from the outside and through propaganda. </p>

<p>I can safely say that personally, I know more about the goings on of the LDS church and the genuine nature of the leadership, &quot;agenda&quot; and it&#39;s congregations better than any of you reading this. </p>

<p>This guy is talking about these &#39;white people in the woods&#39; and generalizing them like only an enemy would attempt to do. Do not listen to trolls like that. </p>

<p>You can think what you want about Mormons, Joseph Smith, Utah, or even Jesus for that matter. But to question the strong moral backbone of Mormons is a foolish game. They are among the smartest and toughest people on the planet. Like any group there are bad apples, but that dunt spoil the whole bunch. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take the words of this unintelligent troll at face value. He doesn&#39;t know what the fuck he is talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>facts:</p>

<p>-mormons are mostly white ppl
- mormons can pay to help get your relatives into heaven
-garments are real and ppl believe they protect them from physical harm
- mormons prosyletize trying ro convert others using kindness
- there have been many examples of mormons practicing polygamy in cult compounds
- mormon missionaries are banned from several countries including China</p>

<p>i have spent a lot of time with mormons and have had several mormon friends who are good ppl. My biggest beef with mormonism is it peddles false ideologies, trying to get others to believe them too. Mormon missionaries pray on the weak and downtrodden, providing them with kindness and food or whatever to get them to convert.</p>

<p>Its no coincidence that mormon strongholds are most oftwn in the poorest and most exploited countries. Something about exploiting the weak to grow membership has always irked me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The god of the old testament, Yah-weh, could very well be a bastardized version of &quot;Jove&quot; (Y to J consonant shift; W to V shift), i.e. Jupiter/Zeus. Jupiter is the son of Saturn from which &quot;Satan&quot; originally was derived. Thus, the god of the Old Testament potentially could have originally been a proto Greco-Roman cult (there is evidence of the relation between early Jews and Hypsistarians [&quot;God-fearers&quot;]) that worshiped the son of Satan. The old testament would therefore be the pact between the antichrist and the people of Israel, making all Abrahamic faiths in essence offshoot branches of Satanism. </p>

<p>The US has officially about 17,000 murders a year - by far the highest murder rate per capita in the first world -  but this guy claims there are three or four times as many hidden murders by Satanists a year and yet there is no hard evidence of any of them.</p>

<p>Note that only 2% are nonfamily abductions and most of those are by people known to the child and/or caretaker.</p>

<p>The number of cases of missing children that are categorized as a stereotypical kidnapping is about 100 per year.</p>

<p>Sources: <a href="https://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/249249.pdf">https://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/249249.pdf</a> and <a href="https://www.ojjdp.gov/publications/PubAbstract.asp?pubi=196467">https://www.ojjdp.gov/publications/PubAbstract.asp?pubi=196467</a></p>

<p>Stereotypical kidnappings (excluding family custody cases) were defined as episodes lasting overnight or there was a homicide or ransom demand or an intent to keep the child or transport the child 50 miles or more.</p>

<p>They analyzed 2 different years, 1997 and 2011. These numbers are based on a survey of law enforcement agencies, so includes only those cases known to law enforcement and there is a small uncertaintly in the numbers.</p>

<p>In 1997, there were 115 cases, with 65 children recovered, 46 murdered, and 4 never recovered.</p>

<p>In 2011, there were a total of 105 cases of stereotypical kidnapping of a child known to law enforcement. 97 of the children were recovered and 8 were murdered. None remain missing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so a little math to show why that stat is complete and utter bullshit.</p>

<p>Assuming the disappearances are reasonably distributed, we&#39;re at 16,000 missing children per state per year, or 44 kids disappearing every day in every state.  44 kids, every single day, every single state.  Think you would have heard of some of them?</p>

<p>OK, so take out the 631K that were &quot;cleared or canceled&quot;, and you&#39;re at 169K.  That still works out to 9 kids every single day in every state.</p>

<p>I know Molly Bish&#39;s name.  That&#39;s the proof that that statistic is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still pisses me off how the hampstead cover up got covered up so quickly. There is also a group of shills paid by the farther Ricky to discredit the topic on all social media sites. They also have a website dedicated to it. Ricky also had a CP website where he was distributing CP for bitcoin. The children were telling the truth. What really got me is one of the kids said the head teacher of the school had a goat tattoo above her vagina. If you&#39;ve done some research like me then you know the goat resembles the satanic devil Baphomet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He founded the Temple of Set after becoming disillusioned with LaVey&#39;s Church of Satan. He was also heavily implicated in the Presidio Army Base&#39;s day care scandal where 60 children between 4-7 were raped. The Army actually closed that day care <em>and then demolished it</em> presumably to destroy any evidence, but the kids actually described the inside of his house. The authorities weren&#39;t able to find any physical evidence so he was let off, later they audited all the bases daycares nationwide and found similar issues in 10% of them, and he was connected to those ones too. He&#39;s why those MK Ultra guys were in the FMSF.</p>

<p>He was also involved in the Iran Contra scandal run by Ollie North and overseen by Bush Sr so those contacts may have protected him somewhat.</p>
