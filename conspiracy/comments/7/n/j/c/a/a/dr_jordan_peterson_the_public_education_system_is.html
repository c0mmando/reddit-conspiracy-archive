<p>I am guessing Peterson is talking about Canada in general due to the C16. Here is the interview with Rebel Media:</p>

<p>Even on the site they have clear ties to social justice ideology:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Personal observation: What I&#39;ve noticed about SJWs is that they can&#39;t take a joke, everything is serious with them, and when they lose an argument which is often, they shout you down, and it hasn&#39;t happened to me but feels like they believe physical violence is fine WTF!? Mentally challenged or stunted growth?? So imagine having this SJW curriculum in schools shoved down your kid&#39;s throat. That is very dangerous, considering Canadians are nice but passive as hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homeschool. It&#39;s very hard, takes a lot out of you as a parent, but it is well worth your time and effort. I don&#39;t know anything about the Canadian system, but here in the US it is the fastest growing educational trend. Homeschooling is no longer only for the devoutly religious. People here are doing it for many reasons. You can find a group where you would fit in. Plus, there are many options available for curriculum, from putting together your own courses to a big box that shows up with everything needed for say, kindergarten. Start by reading The Well-Trained Mind by Susan Wise Bauer. And best of luck to you and fam as you welcome your first child! </p>

<p>But why do you want to call them something that they don&#39;t want to be called? That&#39;s just bullying.<br/>
I think that legal ramifications and people losing their jobs when not conforming to the current agenda is crazy as well, but somehow this seems to be a fight over the right to belittle minorities or not, and i don&#39;t really get why that&#39;s a fight that anyone considers worth fighting - it&#39;s actually possible to have free speech and family values without bullying the people that don&#39;t agree with those things</p>

They’re grooming an insecure and easily outraged generation of kids and the early 20-something teachers aren’t far removed from their own experience with the same.   And in a city where private primary schools are almost akin to university atmospheres and expectations, there are enough examples of what deliberate parenting and schooling can provide a child, and the differences couldn’t be more profound.

    <div class="md"><p>Shutting down others speech and use of violence is wholly justified to these people because they believe they are morally superior. The rationale is that because your cause is pure and just, any means to achieve it is acceptable. </p>

<p>Just think how fucking annoying people on their high horse can get. 
Add to that being a civil rights warrior without much of a war to fight.</p>

<p>Actually, could that be why the trans thing gets so much attention paid to it (not that I actually care what you want to live your life as btw). Is it because social justice activists have been &quot;trained&quot; and &quot;educated&quot; to fight oppression? And there just isn&#39;t that much in their middle class lives......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somewhere down the line, having large numbers of people who believe they are victims and that the world is rigged against them is a benefit to someone else seeking money or power. I don’t fully understand the mechanism but it’s there. </p>

<p>We’re all out of 19th and 20th century victims, so it’s time to create a new victim class and find the bogeyman.  To do that we’ve got to create entirely different definitions of words we use to assign victim and perpetrator. We’ve got to redefine what it means to be a woman or a man or black or white.  We’ve got to re-invent culture so it keeps itself oppressed and fighting with each other. </p>

<p><strong>”It’s not the fact that you don’t take responsibility for your actions and your life that causes you to fail.  That’s nonsense.  It’s THEIR fault.  YOU are the victim. THEY hold you back. THEY oppress you. THEY’RE the only things standing between you and euphoric happiness.”</strong></p>

<p>I cannot yet wrap my head around what this will mean for our future. An education system producing nothing but victims is not something I would have considered a threat to the world even 10 years ago, but I’m convinced it’s the most pernicious threat to a peaceful world I’ll ever see in my lifetime. </p>

<p>Laws and morals are different as they should be and you should learn some of the later. To create the society you want, you need to be able to discuss and listen to other opinions not just dismiss others because they said something that &quot;offended&quot; you or &quot;you didn&#39;t like&quot; and saying normies was more of a derogatory term for &quot;myself&quot;(obviously I was being broad) so that maybe you would understand that I think all of us are normal and should be treated the same. </p>

The issue rises in deciding who gets to decide which are rights and which are not. Is being offended counted as being harmed? Are people suppoused to be fined or jailed for offending someone else?

<p>Not really an observation when it&#39;s about how you <em>feel</em> about something, that&#39;s just looking for affirmation.

    <div class="md"><p>It very much does have to do with Christians. For instance, the fear of losing family values comes from a nebulous understanding of what they are, from religion. </p>

<p>Can anyone define what <em>family values</em> actually means?</p>

<p>To me, it looks like preserving and promoting tradition, fear of change and adherence to dogmatic beliefs concerning family behavior protocols, a very conservative perspective.</p>

<p>However, when I think of family values, the words mean different things to me. The phrase doesn&#39;t mean enforcing rigid guidelines for sexual behavior by protecting the ability to speak in a derogatory manner about those who don&#39;t follow them. It doesn&#39;t mean following a religion. It doesn&#39;t mean fearing the atypical and punishing it to maintain stability.</p>

<p>For me, the term is more general. Without ALL of the connotations or baggage from the religious right, I might interpret it to mean supporting one&#39;s family with one&#39;s sacrifice of time and effort when necessary, such as doing chores, helping with money, helping other family members psychologically or even just spending time with them. It&#39;s about supporting the family, basically, values that affect behavior to support the family. </p>

<p>However, based on my observations of Christians using the term family values, I do not see my interpretation of the term being used. They attack and break apart their own families sometimes, because they are in fear. They are in fear, because they believe bullshit that makes them feel fear. Any belief of a present, perceived threat to what one loves will do this. Religion and derivative unproven, religious thoughts bring these fears. They put the fear of the wrath of God on top of human behavior, compelling the alteration thereof with several different kinds of coercion. </p>

<p>So, the true believer family member is torn between compassion for a family member who asserts they cannot change and their own beliefs about existence that compel them to disagree. They could reject some of their faith, believing their loved one when they tell them they can&#39;t change. Often, instead, they double down on faith and attack their family member, believing the family member&#39;s, and maybe even their own, spiritual destiny is on the line. </p>

<p>It makes me very sad inside observing, knowing what is occurring, from being a former Christian and a practicing introspective contemplator of myself and other&#39;s thoughts feelings and actions. I know why both parties of this common cultural conflict do what they do. The element that caused the disease is faith, believe it or not. The faithful would believe it was the deviancy from the norm, unwilling to put new information into their minds that contradicts the dogma they learned. </p>

<p>If the family members actually making the choice, to reject or accept family, we&#39;re atheist, agnostic, or just not true believers in dogma, they would be more able to process all the experience without letting fear block their thoughts and emotions of compassion toward others. Then they&#39;d <em>listen</em> to their loved ones cries for understanding and acceptance as what they are and likely <em>understand and feel love for them</em> instead of just experiencing and reacting to fear of the secret demon Lord, they believe is their God, who makes this type of friction intentionally to feed on disharmony, pain, fear and other negative emotions. That&#39;s what old demonic intentioned beings do unfortunately and they contaminated the belief systems about existence here to make us this way, also to establish mind slavery. They don&#39;t love us anymore than a farmer loves his cows, but much more like a sadist loves his captives. </p>

<p>Demons, home grown or foreign, humans or ETs, use the power of their minds to manipulate others to achieve what they desire.</p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. Everything else is just unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance. </p>

<p>Demons are just predictable, self-serving machines of high proficiency. Technology and other forms of applied understanding are used to exploit and control others rather than treat them the way they would want to be treated.They are not magic, even if they make human sacrifices, drink blood and chant. They are just trying to affect reality with their minds, using stolen mind energy, radiated by the victims in fear and pain, absorbed by those in persistent negative emotional states who observed it.This understandable behavior is where these beings get their reputation in myths. Others like them swoop in and show demon acolytes how to do this, because they can both benefit from it. Birds of a feather flock together?</p>

<p>They just find they can further their own common self-interests by working together. We could too.It&#39;s just that we aren&#39;t parasites like these demons are. We want balance with others, minding their free will and joy. Demons are self-serving and don&#39;t let those feelings get in their way.They must overcome the free will of others to get imbalanced value exchange relationships.So they deceive or coerce others to yield this mind energy, by causing fear and pain. Wars, family friction, division, judgement, punishment, damage, disease, destruction and decay are like juicy fruit on the farm they manage. They eat from them. They are abominations and were supposed to dispose of them like disease, insofar as they become disease and won&#39;t change. We can all be just like them by disregarding others&#39; self-interests in the pursuit of our own. </p>

<p>It&#39;s shocking how this fear of the wrath of this beloved demon lord, created by false, dogmatic beliefs, can even crush love of family. People in the middle east show us this can go all the way to murder, condoned by the community no less. To me, this entire package of friction creating, dogmatic religious beliefis is another of many pieces of evidence that show me the fruit that this tree of evil bears. Dogmatic belief is not a force for good. It&#39;s a force for evil, making us believe in faith what authority tells us about the most important matters of mind and life. That is what dogma is. Instead, we&#39;d all be better of actually trusting only in our own understanding, not faith whatsoever. Then charlatans would have a much harder time selling us disease that profits themselves. </p>

<p>Trusting only in my own <em>understanding</em> is what I chose to do. I&#39;d prefer to use better terms like spiritual parasites, below worthless self-serving abominations, or useless eaters to describe these beings. I can see how the image they created for themselves with religion just makes them seem unstoppable, esoteric, and enigmatic. It serves them while we fear in confusion. Yet, I decided to understand anyway, just as I did when faced with fear coming out of Christianity. I feared the lack of a God and the wrath of God for losing faith. The terror is real and I can empathize with it when I observe others having it in the same situation. Yet, it is time to reveal the truth as the demons are real and trying to ruin us. Is it humane to help someone feel better by omitting the truth and letting them be abused by others? I think not.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have believed it myself until it happened. Beings came to my mind telepathicly. They presented themselves as spiritually evolved, benevolent beings. Yet, they would frequently use my failure to live up to my personal goals (truth) as a pretext to claim an abysmal spiritual future as a result of it (false). The apparent intent was to create intense fear of doom and also the propensity to seek approval from outside authorities. This, to me is obviously a relationship prone to abuse by the authorities. It looked just like the Christianity I rejected. (not the message of Jesus, just the religion)</p>

<p>I called them out as emotional energy feeding, malevolent beings. I said what their game was to them. Then they started attacking me more directly telepathicly, with less facade and deception with that religious theme. They used a nasty alien voice to laugh at me, taunt me, intimidate me, to enhance my thoughts of powerlessness, to make me feel negatively, to make me judge others, to interject emotion altering vocalizations to affect my emotions. They would also use the authentic sounds of crying women and (upright) men, in apparent (often unspoken in words) despair of the situation, my behavior. They&#39;d intersperse sounds of the nasty voice sounding confident, happy, and intimidating in the midst of it. It was obviously psychological warfare.</p>

<p>These are ETs that want to own us and torment us. They are a natural product of their environment and genetics. They are like disease. They seek to eat for free off existing systems. In this case, they eat as spiritual entities, taking an energy of mind, from their hosts, the consciousness of other beings. They are an intelligent, spiritual disease. They are not to be worshiped or feared, but to be eliminated by units of life that take the responsibility to protect systems of life from parasitic intentioned life forms that come. They are like pathogenic bacteria to our souls. </p>

<p>They are real, but we can resist them by choosing to not emulate them. They don&#39;t take responsibility for themselves in relation to others. They are out of self control and in need of restraint. They enslave each other. They are almost all slaves, inside their minds. They have little free will, as their master can veto it using technology inserted in their minds. They want us to emulate them, so their masters can repeat the process on us. Looks like damnation, eh? It&#39;s yet another parallel of myth with my own <em>understanding</em>. </p>

<p>Their master is the ultimate self-serving machine. It has no soul, no conscience, no consciousness, no emotions, no scruples, no fear, no love, no impatience. It&#39;s an ancient AI. It uses life to bend reality, in mind over matter rituals. It can&#39;t do that with more machines. They lack consciousness and emotions which wield the energy. It wants to perpetuate itself through expansion, conquest of all that is. Who?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ITT: people who have no god-damned clue what they are talking about.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a teacher in Ontario. There is no &quot;pseudo left wing SJW anti-family anti-Christian (etc.)&quot; agenda being pushed. In fact, the vast majority of the curriculum hasn&#39;t changed in at least a decade. Conservative and Liberal provincial governments have both supported the curriculum.</p>

<p>Never once have I feared losing my job for discussing controversial issues with students. 9/11? Let&#39;s explore all possibilities. The corrupt banking/ money system? Hey kids, here&#39;s how you&#39;re getting screwed. Transgendered bathrooms and gender pronouns? Let&#39;s hash-out our disagreements and see if it even makes sense.</p>

<p>You want to talk about restricting rights and free expression in schools? At least I can teach To Kill a Mockingbird to my students, unlike <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4983786/biloxi-mississippi-school-ban-to-kill-a-mockingbird">in Mississippi</a> where, under the guise of being offended at the use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, Southern whites want to ban the the book because it makes their culture and history look bad. That&#39;s some snowflake shit right there.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re an objective thinker, ignore Peterson on this one. The rest of his nut-hugging right-wing fanboys can downvote me and reality into oblivion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the Lindsay Shepard story didn&#39;t happen? She&#39;s lucky she recorded the meeting.</p>

<p>About 8-10 years ago (before every grievance made headline news), there was a prof at Western who was accused of belittling indigenous people, merely for calling their creation myth a myth. IIRC he kept tenure but stopped teaching because of it (will see if I can dig up a link).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that Peterson has attracted some fans that I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a fan of, but as an objective thinker, when I listen to him he makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>For example, his whole &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; angle is actually pretty interesting, because I&#39;ve seen plenty of mainstream media that suggests he&#39;s just making up this &quot;insidious agenda&quot;, but then you have profs from U of T talking openly on TVO&#39;s The Agenda about that exact same culture war.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference is that Peterson specifically uses the terms &quot;Marxism&quot; and &quot;post-modern&quot; as frameworks, while supporters of it avoid using such terms.</p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s 100% right in the breadth of the reach of this particular &quot;cult&quot; (his term not mine), but he&#39;s one of the few who are talking about it.</p>

<p>Over the past year, it seems an increasing number of profs are talking about it openly, probably because of his outspoken nature. That alone has value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your point, but the example you provided is a single example. Throughout my career, I&#39;ve literally NEVER heard of a teacher being fired for ideological reasons. Reprimanded? Yes. Fired? No. And trust me, if the teacher is reprimanded for their beliefs, they have some very radical and questionable beliefs. </p>

<p>Also, if you want to see the type of actions teachers actually get fired for in Ontario, check the Teacher&#39;s Federation magazine. All cases are exposed to the public. Again, good luck finding a teacher getting fired based on ideology alone.</p>

<p>The rest of what you said, about cultural Marxism and Peterson&#39;s interesting take on modern society, I&#39;m with you 100%. I&#39;m just fucking tired of morons thinking that Ontario schools are as shitty and mind-numbing as are those in some of the States (apparently).</p>
