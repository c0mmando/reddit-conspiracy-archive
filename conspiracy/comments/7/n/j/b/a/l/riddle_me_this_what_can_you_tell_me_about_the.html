       Let's say I want to illegally purchase some cocaine or some child sex slaves or a dingo or a bunch of blood diamonds? I have absolutelt no idea how I would go about doing that. Maybe the darkweb I guess, but I have heard of The Black Market my entire life, which began long before the internet took power.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did people buy dingos or ivory or plutonium in the 60's or 70's or 80's?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is/was the black market ever a reality? How could anybody know about it? Or is it a vague thought experiment meaning any criminal purchasing? Or is it a conspiracy where only if you have the proper huge sums of money &amp; connections that you then get an invite to this little flea market?

       But that's all so impersonal from me, the potential dingo purchaser. How can a market thrive if it is only usable by those few in the know? I mean I always assumed Ivory was purchased by tge very rich, but I never thought they consumed the heroin for example.. But maybe thats how it is.. Resale?

       And I ask because I'm watching Roadgames starring Stacy MOTHERFUCKING Keach on tv right now &amp; he has a dingo &amp; some childish part of me thought "AW MAN! THAT'S SO COOL! I WANT A DINGO!" and then I realized that even if I coukd AFFORD a dingo I would have no idea what to do next.

       Maybe the fact that you saw somebody with a dingo and reacted in such a manner is why you never got your Hogwarts letter.. the black market is just word of mouth things, if you want drugs just ask around and somebody will tell you where to find it. For the crazy shit, online forums are out there for about everything if you look hard enough. Where I live I can just openly own tigers and lions and shit so if I wanted one I'd just buy it online

       That's it, and it's all who you know. For instance, if you want cocaine, it's who you know who knows people who can get it. There's also known street corners in major urban settings where various drugs can be scored.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want guns....well in America, that's a lot easier bc of gun shows, but kids in the cities can get guns from firearms dealers in rough neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted plutonium or something, you'd have to have a lot of money and deeper connections to people in, maybe, Russian Organized Crime as an exampe.

       That's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've bought guns at gun shows. There's people just walking around with guns for sale. Person to person interactions do not involve background checks, they're all cash and carry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought a pistol at a Missouri "gun show" out in the woods when I was blacked-out drunk. No questions asked. No ID shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your position, honestly, that I could also purchase a pistol and walk away with it in a drunken black out, without showing ID, at a legitimate firearms dealer?

       You bought from a private sale. Not the gunshow. You did not buy it from a legitimate dealer. My position is that Gun shows make it harder. No dealer here will sell you a gun without a background check or valid CCW, and they still will want paperwork. With security and law enforcement around getting a private sale would be HARDER at a gunshow. Especially here where we have a show monthly.

       The gunshow location has very little to do with it. Dealers at gun shows require FFL's and run background checks.

       I can go out and buy a gun within an hour from a private party. I do not need to go to a gun show to find these people. It's not more convenient.

       Hmm...Can you think of another location where there's hundreds of people milling around with guns willing to sell them to anyone with no ID who are in a drunken stupor?

       I've had a toe (or two) in various "black market" operations over the years.  I'm sure, if I asked around, I could get you that fuckin' dingo.  Its just the 7° of Kevin Bacon writ large.  I ask a guy, who asks a guy, &amp;c. until, with sometimes surprising quickness, I'm now meeting someone who has the illicit item(s) you/I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all about who you know, and there are people who's business it is to know the people you/I don't: the Procurer.  This word was once synonymous (esp. in English Law) with "pimp" (prostitutes where "Procureuse") -- but, like the current Latin American "Chingon", had other subtleties outside of a mere street pimp's narrow purview -- and thus entered into the lexicon of the Mafia Underworld; although, depending on whom you're speaking with's age or degree of nostalgia, sometimes can be interchangeable with "Bagman".

       Go to a major city or port, and ask around.  Prove yourself to someone and earn their respect, don’t be a rat, show that you have money, and ask around again.   Get denied, and then wait.     Most likely you will be checked out and then someone will approach you.   Not everything you listed will be possible to acquire .. child sex slaves and shit is more mob related or done but extremely secretive sickos.  There are parts of this country that are so scary and dark that you would have to be already a serious freak to even know what door to open to get there
      </p>
      <p>
       Open the right door in any major city and you can find anything
      </p>
      <p>
       Drugs or guns you can follow my approach above.  Dingos? Lmao idk
Children?? Not even funny to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality you just need to know someone who acquires things for a living.  Look for people who deal with hard drugs in weight, or firearms.  And you will find mostly anything if you are persistent, have money, and don’t come off nervous or rat on anyone.

       But that's all so impersonal from me, the potential dingo purchaser. How can a market thrive if it is only usable by those few in the know? I mean I always assumed Ivory was purchased by tge very rich, but I never thought they consumed the heroin for example.. But maybe thats how it is.. Resale?

       Haha more so I meant that anybody who knew you well enough to sell you a dingo illegally would probably realize your going to tell somebody you have a dingo if you react like that.

       You bought from a private sale. Not the gunshow. You did not buy it from a legitimate dealer. My position is that Gun shows make it harder. No dealer here will sell you a gun without a background check or valid CCW, and they still will want paperwork. With security and law enforcement around getting a private sale would be HARDER at a gunshow. Especially here where we have a show monthly.
