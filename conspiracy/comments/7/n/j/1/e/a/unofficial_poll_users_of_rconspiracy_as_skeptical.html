       I'm curious, because I think the shills and social engineers are aware of the voting psychology here. It's pretty simple, and unfortunately, I'd be willing to bet a lot of people fall prey to this closed minded way of thinking;
      </p>
      <p>
       -Id venture to guess many redditors think downvoted comment in the negatives automatically means it's a shit comment
      </p>
      <p>
       -many people look at the vote tally first before reading the comment. If it's low, then they don't even bother reading
      </p>
      <p>
       -inversely, anything upvoted must be a good submission that everyone agrees with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us I hope are able to understand that this is a extremely naive and stupid way of navigating reddit.
       <strong>
        astroturfing and paid dissent is not only present in this sub, it has become a part of it
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be made aware of the irregular voting patterns/forum sliding tricks that the paid infiltrators use here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line, read each comment before making a decision on how you feel about it. Don't just look at the vote tally and think,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Shucks! Everyone already did my thinkin' for me! Downvoted!"

       The only problem with that is that voting has a HUGE affect on what actually gets seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you constantly read/watch for content that is brand new, you're only getting to see what is allegedly popular. If it's been manipulated, they're making you think that you're seeing what is popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, in comments, if a comment scores negative, you can't even read it without going to a little extra effort.

       Yes.  They're manipulated. I don't care about them, and no one else should either. Change your preferences so votes under a certain threshold aren't hidden anymore, and if you agree with a comment, make sure to upvote it to combat comments being hidden by brigading.

       I agree. They want to silence the independent thought. It’s important to speak up, our silence has been our demise for way too long.

       90% of you have no filters or practical judgment.  You lack critical thinking skills and acquiesce to consensus at the drop of a hat hence the little arrows you people use as currency.  Most of you don't even realize you've been conditioned with marxist anti-capitalist falsehoods.

       I see an unnatural amount of upvotes and I automatically assume it is a bunch of shills. It’s usually the garbafenspewed by msm or politicians too so it is easy to spot. No one is hiring shills to question chem trails, but there are a whole bunch of redditors that make it their personal mission to insult and misinform anyone  questioning chemtrails. Vaccines too that seems a hot button for unnatural upvotes and down votes. All these weirdos come out of the wood work spewing insults and trust your doctor propaganda for no reason except fear of measles.

       It's all pretty easy to see through by now if you've been lurking this sub for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the various shill groups start to glow in the dark, and you recognize the (more or less) organic regulars.  At a certain point the shilling does nothing but alert you to what topics trigger which interest groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who or how many they're even fooling any more, but I'd like to thank them for making me even more convinced that my thinking is on the right track wrt certain topics.

       The voting systems at Reddit and many other places are obsolete, especially for those who understand the World Regime's MO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit would be more valuable if there was no voting system at all that could be rigged. the best forums I've been on in the past never had any voting systems in place. All those forums have been killed off, unfortunately.

       many upvotes = usually Group think ;

       I become increasingly curious if a comment is downvoted into not being shown, or seemingly overreacted to. I may or may not agree one way or another, but I'm going to pay close attention if something gets slammed for seemingly no reason like that.
