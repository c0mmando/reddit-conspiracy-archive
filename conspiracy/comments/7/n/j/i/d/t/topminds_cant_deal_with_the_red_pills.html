        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I noticed when Topmindsofreddit quoted me they linked to an archive of my comment. Why? Because last time they directly linked, I edited the post to include redpills about Israel doing 911.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve basically admitted they don&#39;t like their userbase getting redpilled on 911!</p>

<p>We&#39;re winning guys keep up the good fight. Btw here&#39;s the info on 911 which Topminds <em>hate</em>.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick using CG, explosives and missiles. Don&#39;t believe me? Here&#39;s the proof:</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes you are red-pilling them, but maybe not in the way you think</p>

<p>lets say you see yourself red-pilling them by telling them truths about 9/11</p>

<p>whereas the real red pill, from their perspective, is that you are still on 9/11, in spite of their best efforts to control the 9/11 narrative </p>

<p>i mean, its gotta be scary af to watch the world wake up to your crimes, to keep talking about them until everyone knows, and you can&#39;t really go anywhere without someone who knows, seeing you...</p>

<p>one of my favorite things to do is to figure out what kind of shill you are dealing with, and then red-pill them with something that they aren&#39;t familiar with</p>

<p>for example, there are shills who specialize is vaccines. so you can &quot;red pill&quot; them all day with facts about vaccines and they are impervious to it, because they are entrenched and specialized and compartmentalized. </p>

<p>the compartmentalization is the key to their weakness</p>

<p>the leadership tries to keep the pions in a need-to-know compartment, where they can&#39;t put it together how their small actions fit together into a bigger picture</p>

<p>so, if you encounter a vaccine shill, hit him with some moon landing stuff</p>

<p>if you encounter a 9/11 shill, hit him with some vaccine stuff </p>

<p>you get them off their base, and off balance. </p>

<p>oftentimes if you keep pinging their brains with these little truths, they will eventually have a meltdown, often resulting in them being a short-term shill, and being replaced by a new recruit  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you look at pic 1 again, you will see a piece of wreckage up against the wall in the background, almost as if it was staged there, ready to be planted out in the yard. the FBI guy grabs one piece of wreckage but leaves the other one?</p>

<p>where is he going with that piece of wreckage, anyway? are they assembling pieces out in the yard, away from the building?</p>

<p>that one particular piece of wreckage is almost comical in how its photographed from 100 different angles, and cropped 100 different ways, almost becoming a meme unto itself</p>

<p>but there hardly any pics of any other wreckage, so thats why they spam this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;insanely fast&quot; doesn&#39;t sound scientific. Different missiles go at different speeds at different times. For example ICMBs will slow down to 0 at some point before they head back down to earth.</p>

<p>You can see whatever impacted the WTC here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a plane, since in the fake footage they show huge wings. It make be a drone. Or a Granit missile, which at low altitude is about 4 times as fast as the speed the alleged aircraft were alleged to have travelled at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is one of those &quot;technically correct&quot; reasons that is actually totally wrong. Unlike most missiles, ICBMs do not use utilize kinetic energy transfer, and its just a totally misleading example.

<blockquote>
<p>Long-range Cruise missile
Submarine-launched cruise missile
Built by Chelomei/NPO Mashinostroenia, the bulging 10 m missile has swept-back wings and tail, weighs around 7,000 kilograms and can be fitted with either a 750 kg HE warhead, a FAE warhead, or a 500 kt nuclear warhead
Maximum speed is believed to be between Mach 1.6 and more than Mach 2.5</p>

<p>Is that 7000 mph at high altitude though? Altitude plays a big factor in air friction and max speed.</p>
