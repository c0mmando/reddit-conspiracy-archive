        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So (obviously) there are posts going around saying how Comet Ping Pong was hosting CP, some people said they were, some people said they weren&#39;t. I haven&#39;t looked much into it to personally say whether they were or not, HOWEVER, I found something that rubs me the wrong way.</p>

<p>I used a simple URL fuzzer to find hidden dictionary&#39;s for cometpingpong.com and for a <strong>pizza</strong> website, there are some really weird dictionary. For starters,
 for a small pizza business that they look like, they sure have a large amount of dictionary on their server. In fact, a whopping <strong>967</strong> of them. If you want to personally see some of them, I copied and pasted them into pastebin <a href="https://pastebin.com/aXAZU5rK">here</a>. If you want to confirm them yourself, just look uo &quot;url fuzzer&quot; in Google and go from there, not rocket science. But there are some folders on there that really have me worried.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>/girl/</strong></li>
<li><strong>/anal/</strong> &lt;-- What &quot;pizza&quot; website has a folder called anal???<br/></li>
<li> /body/<br/></li>
<li>/small/<br/></li>
<li>/front/<br/></li>
<li>/kids/<br/></li>
<li>/viewforum/ AND /forum/ &lt;-- pizza website with a forum?<br/></li>
<li>/dating/<br/></li>
<li>/government/ (hmm)<br/></li>
<li>/hacking/<br/></li>
<li>/spyware/ &lt;--- My question again. Why would a pizza website have a folder called that?<br/></li>
<li>/privates/<br/></li>
<li><strong>/asia/</strong> - WHAT?</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all of those folders give you a &quot;429&quot; error (too many requests) and if you view them live it just shows a &#39;page not found&#39; page. I&#39;m not that technicall so I can&#39;t say whats going on with that, but again as I have said many times, for a pizza company the dictionary&#39;s on that website are VERY alerting.. I&#39;ll let someone else take over now and maybe shed some light on what the fuck is on their server. Thoughts? </p>

<p>edit; words </p>

<p>edit 2: So I&#39;ll make this more clear-er: I&#39;m <strong>not</strong> a technical person. I posted this here so <strong>hopefully</strong> somebody who knows more about this stuff can look into it. No need to go into my PM&#39;s and start trashing me or being a giant dick. I found something, now I&#39;m passing it on to someone who can continue looking into this. </p>

<p>Edit 3: it&#39;s been debunked so you computer nerds (shills) can chill out. </p>

Now I wonder how &quot;persons&quot; are going to try to defend or debunk this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any kind of business that would have this kind of shit hosted on their website. Unless or course the business was a front for &quot;something&quot;</p>

<p>I guess back in the day when the mafia would run restaurants as fronts and in the back they are dealing drugs etc. Who&#39;s to say that couldn&#39;t happen now except instead of drugs it&#39;s something alot more disgusting like cp or child trafficking.</p>

<p>Who knows maybe Obama gets his pizza and hotdogs from the same wholesaler as cpp </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The directories that OP falsely believes were returning as valid were not actually valid. He was getting a 429 error because the server was denying his requests since he was essentially spamming it. If you send requests to a server thousands of times per second then it&#39;s pretty quickly going to tell you to fuck off in the form of a 429 error.</p>

<p>OP has admitted that he was wrong - though of course not without also accusing the people who pointed out his failed methodology of being shills. </p>

<p>ICANN <a href="https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=cometpingpong.com">lookup</a> says its hosted with Tucows. The domain is registered by Contact Privacy Inc., which means that it was privately registered with Tucows&#39;s partner (or divison?). This isn&#39;t suspicious really, I have a number of domains and some of them are registered through my host&#39;s private registration partner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, the 429 error doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s something there - the assumption was that because you&#39;re not getting a 404 error, it means there <em>is</em> something there - it just means the server is getting overloaded with too many requests to be able to tell if something is there or not. </p>

<p>The equivalent of asking someone a bunch of rapid-fire questions in a row, and finally instead of saying &quot;no&quot; they just say &quot;ARGH&quot;. And then you say, &quot;Well... they didn&#39;t say no!&quot;</p>

<p>I do want to be fair and say this isn&#39;t something I knew either, but after reading OP&#39;s post I went and googled a 429 error. :P </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so if this is the issue, why aren’t people replicating OP’s test on other websites? If the comet website is the only one returning the 429 errors on these particular directories, then wouldn’t that be a pretty good indication that he’s getting 429 rather than 404 errors on these specific words on the comet site for a reason? Everyone in the comments keeps saying the 429s are ‘probably’ nothing or ‘likely’ just due to overloaded server. That is not definitive or conclusive at all. I don’t think OP’s hypothesis has been proven false yet by any means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No &quot;429&quot; is a well documented code based on the literal core HTTP protocol that runs every website you&#39;ve ever used. It means that something between you and the server is saying &quot;Whoooooaaah now, buddy! Easy...&quot;</p>

<p>I have a background in both website development as well as a degree in computer networking, and I will say that the conclusion OP is drawing is incorrect.</p>

<p>When you request a document from a server, it checks if it has a file to send back. If it does, you get the file contents + status 200. If it can&#39;t find a resource, you get an HTTP 404. There are two dozen other relevant status codes that can be returned.</p>

<p>All OP did was take a list of pedo words, and requested <a href="http://cometpingpong.com/%7Bword%7D">http://cometpingpong.com/{word}</a>, which would return a 200 if there was a directory there, it would return a 404 if one didn&#39;t exist, and would return one of the other two dozen relevant status codes if deemed necessary.</p>

<p>OP took 1000 words and requested them in rapid fire succession. After three, instead of getting 404, OP started getting 429s and said &quot;eureka!&quot;, concluding that those were &quot;matches&quot;, when in reality the server just started ignoring him because it was mildly annoyed.</p>

<p>OPs conclusion is that there is content on the CPP webserver at these urls. You can disprove ops claims by simply going to any one of the URLs - you will get a 404 when OP got a 429.</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely a DOS protection mechanism to keep script kiddies from hammering the site with requests and taking the server down. After a few totally invalid requests the server just starts saying &quot;heck you!&quot;.</p>

<p>Does that thoroughly explain and debunk?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, thank you for teaching me. I’m not a CS person, as you could probably tell. That makes sense and after reading what you wrote I realized part of my confusion was because I thought the OP got 967 errors on just the 13 words he listed. I hadn’t looked at the pastebin to see it was 967 errors on 967 different words. So basically of the 1,000 words tested, almost all of them returned the 429 errors, making the errors on the particular words listed in the post pretty meaningless. I get it now. 
Thanks again for taking the time to write that explanation. I am still a pizzagate believer and there is a lot of other evidence out there that can’t be disputed. It doesn’t take any technical background to see how disgusting Alefantis’s instagram pictures of and comments about children were. But as far as the specific info in this post goes, yes, I agree this is debunked/irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The program OP used has a long list of common directory names. For example, a lot of websites have folders named &quot;faq&quot;. When the program is run, it tries out literally every potential URL on the website to see if it exists.</p>

<p>When you do that to a website, the server is constantly returning results, usually a 404 error. This means you&#39;re bombarding the server with traffic. When you do that too many times per second, you start getting 429 errors instead.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like typing in <a href="http://www.disney.com/mickeymouse">www.disney.com/mickeymouse</a> to see if it exists, only hundreds of times a second and with every possible Disney character.</p>

<p>Apparently enough websites have folders with names like &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;anal&quot; that the URL fuzzer includes them in the attempts. What you&#39;re seeing are names of folders the program <em>tried</em> and got traffic errors on, not the names of folders it discovered.</p>

<p>This is art <em>Tony</em> Podesta has in his house, But since the guy you replied to said Podesta(S) you did this manipulative little bullshit and said <em>John</em> didn&#39;t have it.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I also posted in a retarded thread about <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, but you guys are conveniently ignoring that. There isn&#39;t much else making it to the front page of the sub worth arguing against, certainly not much I know enough about to bother.</p>

<p>If you think the fact that I use an alt to post here and occasionally nuke my post history is proof of anything, go ahead and break the sub rules by calling me a shill.

<p>If you were looking for truth, the object wouldn&#39;t be to &quot;dismantle literally every single argument made for it&quot;, it would be to find the truth. There are new theories and arguments for it that pop up daily over on voat, if you really wanna test your skill, why not practice at the source?

<p>That just goes to show how silly this &quot;investigation&quot; is. If Pizzagaters want to be considered a serious investigation they would be trying to find new leads and developing a theory based on where those leads take them. Instead they just repost the same stuff over and over again and then come up with a House of Cards fanfiction for a theory, and then come up with something else a few hours later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people that are trying to “win” the argument are coming from a place of ego.  They will have a hard time finding truth, because the ego doesn’t allow a person to look at things objectively.  The ego needs to maintain a cohesive worldview.  It assumes that all things that contrasts with this worldview must be false and it uses assumptions to strengthen the things it believes.  In an era of misinformation, you have to start with the assumption that much of what you believe is false.  The goal is not to confirm your own assumptions, but rather to weed out all the false assumptions and let the truth stand as it is.</p>

<p>There’s this false idea that there’s two sides to this issue as if you have to align with “those crazy conspiracy theorists” or those “shills”.  I don’t believe this is a good belief to accept.  Instead, I believe that almost all of us want the truth and the other, much smaller group is people trying to actively spread misinformation.  We want resolution.  They want us to stay in a perpetual state of confusion and uncertainty.  Therein lies the difference in truth-seeking and trying to disprove the “other”.</p>

Someone needs to run this test again with the same or similar list in a different sort order and compare the results!  </p>

<p>404 means page not found, I do not know what you are talking about.<br/>
409 means I know what you want, but you&#39;re not getting it.<br/>
The question is, which has priority, and this is why someone needs to retest.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After going through a vpn I looked at this, it&#39;s squarespace and 429 means you exceeded requests per second and got denied. The few of the urls it tried manually give a 404 not found.</p>

<p>I am curious why so many here assumed it was WordPress? That is the strangest part of this thread to me.</p>

<p>Good thought OP. You must have gotten pretty excited for a few minutes there. I think that after the &quot;gunman&quot; miraculously smoked the hardrive with his errant shot that everything has been cleaned up and hidden if it was what we thought it was to begin with. The only way you could get info on jimmy is if you could get a rootkit onto his personal devices and watch him from afar or to set up rogue access points around his home/work/museum. Or possibly do this to his network of &quot;friends&quot;.</p>

<p>If he is doing this shit at a blackmail level or if he is a Rothschild getting caught doing anything like this could get nightmare on elmstreet scary real fast.</p>

<p>Did bigfish say it was WordPress? Perhaps they moved to Squarespece after their selfhosted wordpress was fatally gunned down?</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna go listen to that titus interview..</p>

<p>The odds of an errant bullet hitting <em>something</em> in the closet that it was fired into are 100%. Odds don&#39;t enter into it; things that go completely against the odds happen every single day.</p>

<p>Wrong. It was a day and a half.</p>

<p>And this is supposed to be evidence for what, exactly? There&#39;s no proof that the camera was ever pointed towards something important. You can even see it now:</p>

<p>The camera was never pointed at Comet to begin with. You wouldn&#39;t have seen the event on it in the position it was in before.</p>

<p>Seems to me that traffic cameras inexplicably change views on any given day. The current view from that camera isn&#39;t the same as any of the photos above.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it changed so dramatically towards negativity, that I can only explain it with infiltration. </p>

<p>In fact, I got a PM attack from a user whose account was only a few weeks old. Recently, I got a very detailed rebuttal about Podesta&#39;s reasons for his peculiar &#39;art taste&#39; and the &#39;kiddie pool&#39; email. Then I checked the user who&#39;d replied, and the account was a few weeks old as well.</p>

<p>Rule 10 prevents me from even using the word &quot;shills&quot;... but I just got the overall impression that this sub has been infiltrated/brigaded by info agents/army. It&#39;s just an impression, I&#39;m not accusing anyone or anything. It&#39;s just a vague feeling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to have positivity, I just feel like accusations of shilling - or even insinuations of shilling - are death to any helpful discussion. Even if someone&#39;s a shill, <em>saying</em> that they are isn&#39;t going to make people who are on the fence believe your point more. No matter whether you&#39;re right or wrong, it just feels like you&#39;re trying to avoid having to answer the other person&#39;s points. </p>

<p>I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talking about &quot;paid Russian trolls&quot;, even if there might be some, and I roll my eyes when I see people talking about ShareBlue shills here, even if there might be some. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got nothing against people who believe in pizzagate - I don&#39;t think they&#39;re right, but that doesn&#39;t mean I think they&#39;re bad people or anything - I just hate when I come in a thread like this, and there&#39;s a lot of people saying &quot;Hey, that&#39;s not what a 429 error means&quot;, and the main rebuttal from people in the pro-pizzagate camp is &quot;SHILL!&quot;</p>

<p>You are a huge part of the cancer. People who can never stop themselves from screaming shill at literally everybody are a huge part of the cancer. You are the cancer. </p>
