       So (obviously) there are posts going around saying how Comet Ping Pong was hosting CP, some people said they were, some people said they weren't. I haven't looked much into it to personally say whether they were or not, HOWEVER, I found something that rubs me the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used a simple URL fuzzer to find hidden dictionary's for cometpingpong.com and for a
       <strong>
        pizza
       </strong>
       website, there are some really weird dictionary. For starters,
 for a small pizza business that they look like, they sure have a large amount of dictionary on their server. In fact, a whopping
       <strong>
        967
       </strong>
       of them. If you want to personally see some of them, I copied and pasted them into pastebin
       <a href="https://pastebin.com/aXAZU5rK">
        here
       </a>
       . If you want to confirm them yourself, just look uo "url fuzzer" in Google and go from there, not rocket science. But there are some folders on there that really have me worried.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         /girl/
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         /anal/
        </strong>
        &lt;-- What "pizza" website has a folder called anal???
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /body/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /small/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /front/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /kids/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /viewforum/ AND /forum/ &lt;-- pizza website with a forum?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /dating/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /government/ (hmm)
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /hacking/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /spyware/ &lt;--- My question again. Why would a pizza website have a folder called that?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        /privates/
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         /asia/
        </strong>
        - WHAT?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now, all of those folders give you a "429" error (too many requests) and if you view them live it just shows a 'page not found' page. I'm not that technicall so I can't say whats going on with that, but again as I have said many times, for a pizza company the dictionary's on that website are VERY alerting.. I'll let someone else take over now and maybe shed some light on what the fuck is on their server. Thoughts?
      </p>

       edit; words
      </p>
      <p>
       edit 2: So I'll make this more clear-er: I'm
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a technical person. I posted this here so
       <strong>
        hopefully
       </strong>
       somebody who knows more about this stuff can look into it. No need to go into my PM's and start trashing me or being a giant dick. I found something, now I'm passing it on to someone who can continue looking into this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3: it's been debunked so you computer nerds (shills) can chill out.

       First I've heard about this, rather interesting.
Now I wonder how "persons" are going to try to defend or debunk this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's any kind of business that would have this kind of shit hosted on their website. Unless or course the business was a front for "something"
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess back in the day when the mafia would run restaurants as fronts and in the back they are dealing drugs etc. Who's to say that couldn't happen now except instead of drugs it's something alot more disgusting like cp or child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows maybe Obama gets his pizza and hotdogs from the same wholesaler as cpp

       Yeah. It doesn't make why they would have it that open (unless they're actually stupid), but it still isn't right that those files are on the server for a pizza place, you know?

       The pastbin shows the server rejected his http requests with error 429 "to many connections". This means the tool could never check if the directory is present because the connection was rejected outright.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is based on a misunderstanding of the http error notions.

       Enter the url yourself and you'll get error 404's for most of the entries.

       But why just ‘most’ of the entries? Why would you be getting 429s EVER if you’re just entering the url yourself? I get why you would possibly get a 429 when you use a tool like OP used that overloads the server but it doesn’t make sense to me that people are also seeing a 429 when they try manually.. unless the 429 means what it’s supposed to mean.

       You get 404's on the directories that are invalid and web pages on those that are valid. That's what I meant by "404 on most entries". Some entries might be valid directories.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't get 429 if you enter the url by hand.

       The directories that OP falsely believes were returning as valid were not actually valid. He was getting a 429 error because the server was denying his requests since he was essentially spamming it. If you send requests to a server thousands of times per second then it's pretty quickly going to tell you to fuck off in the form of a 429 error.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP has admitted that he was wrong - though of course not without also accusing the people who pointed out his failed methodology of being shills.

       I understand what you're saying, they weren't valid requestes, so what was it that he found? Or should I say what was it that the program he was using find? Did those directories ever exist or was what ever he using think they were real but actually weren't

       He found nothing. OP didn't understand the results he got. He mistakenly believed that because he got an error message for 967 directories they must exist. That is not true. He got an error message because the server reacted appropriately to somebody spamming it with url requests.

       yeah it's human trafficking.  that's what these people do.  they've been doing it for centuries.  if someone were to want to setup the kind of hoax required for it to be a hoax, they'd have had to have many, many actors self-identify over the course of years - and this is almost inconceivable.

       Not trying to debunk this but the from the directories listed the site appears to be using Wordpress, and speaking from experience as a web developer, some of these paths could be spam Wordpress categories if a plugin or theme they were using was hacked. Just an idea.

       You’re right. Wtf. Isn’t Akamai mainly known for video streaming and peer to peer sharing and shit? What do you mean it’s Israeli, it’s supposedly based in Cambridge? U/justpassingby this might be important

       No idea, could be that the platform they're hosting on has a deal with akamai (i.e. if it is squarespace). But, it seemed to me they were self hosting the site previously (i.e. the wordpress claims).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have to watch the supposed hacker's interview, to see what the original hosting set up was like.

       Yeah, seeing as it's hosted by SquareSpace, which is huge, it makes sense. The CDN isn't for Comet, it's for everything SquareSpace is hosting.

       There are other comments saying why this guy's methodology is wrong. Upon reading these comments he can then research what a "429" error is and see how directories work and see that it matches up with what people are saying here.

       Basically, the 429 error doesn't mean there's something there - the assumption was that because you're not getting a 404 error, it means there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       something there - it just means the server is getting overloaded with too many requests to be able to tell if something is there or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The equivalent of asking someone a bunch of rapid-fire questions in a row, and finally instead of saying "no" they just say "ARGH". And then you say, "Well... they didn't say no!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to be fair and say this isn't something I knew either, but after reading OP's post I went and googled a 429 error. :P

       Just because your fuzz tester gets a 429 error doesn't mean the directory is valid!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I take it you're implying that there is something special about cometpingpong.com/anal/ because your tester got a 429 response instead of a 404. In reality, you probably got a 429 because, as the message implies, you or someone else was overloading the server handling the requests.

       Okay so if this is the issue, why aren’t people replicating OP’s test on other websites? If the comet website is the only one returning the 429 errors on these particular directories, then wouldn’t that be a pretty good indication that he’s getting 429 rather than 404 errors on these specific words on the comet site for a reason? Everyone in the comments keeps saying the 429s are ‘probably’ nothing or ‘likely’ just due to overloaded server. That is not definitive or conclusive at all. I don’t think OP’s hypothesis has been proven false yet by any means.

       No "429" is a well documented code based on the literal core HTTP protocol that runs every website you've ever used. It means that something between you and the server is saying "Whoooooaaah now, buddy! Easy..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a background in both website development as well as a degree in computer networking, and I will say that the conclusion OP is drawing is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you request a document from a server, it checks if it has a file to send back. If it does, you get the file contents + status 200. If it can't find a resource, you get an HTTP 404. There are two dozen other relevant status codes that can be returned.
      </p>
      <p>
       All OP did was take a list of pedo words, and requested
       <a href="http://cometpingpong.com/%7Bword%7D">
        http://cometpingpong.com/{word}
       </a>
       , which would return a 200 if there was a directory there, it would return a 404 if one didn't exist, and would return one of the other two dozen relevant status codes if deemed necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP took 1000 words and requested them in rapid fire succession. After three, instead of getting 404, OP started getting 429s and said "eureka!", concluding that those were "matches", when in reality the server just started ignoring him because it was mildly annoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       OPs conclusion is that there is content on the CPP webserver at these urls. You can disprove ops claims by simply going to any one of the URLs - you will get a 404 when OP got a 429.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's likely a DOS protection mechanism to keep script kiddies from hammering the site with requests and taking the server down. After a few totally invalid requests the server just starts saying "heck you!".

      <p>
       Does that thoroughly explain and debunk?

       Yes, thank you for teaching me. I’m not a CS person, as you could probably tell. That makes sense and after reading what you wrote I realized part of my confusion was because I thought the OP got 967 errors on just the 13 words he listed. I hadn’t looked at the pastebin to see it was 967 errors on 967 different words. So basically of the 1,000 words tested, almost all of them returned the 429 errors, making the errors on the particular words listed in the post pretty meaningless. I get it now. 
Thanks again for taking the time to write that explanation. I am still a pizzagate believer and there is a lot of other evidence out there that can’t be disputed. It doesn’t take any technical background to see how disgusting Alefantis’s instagram pictures of and comments about children were. But as far as the specific info in this post goes, yes, I agree this is debunked/irrelevant.

       This is the definition of script kiddie that doesn't know what he's doing. Why do you think a "429" error (too many requests) means the directory is there? It literally is the server denying you from all the requests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you run it again and see if you got the same results? Were you at all suspicious by getting 967 results from this? How many did you try?

       That is because you triggered the spam protection of the server.

       429 means the server received to many requests and denied the http connection entirely before any directories could be checked.

       Nope. Because of how much it's upsetting people I'm actually going to keep it. Maybe if people wouldn't try and dox me via pms I would of, but since people obviously care so much I'm keeping it.

       Why don't you edit your OP with the new information about your claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       That would leave the information for interested people but would clear up your misunderstanding of the server responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you have a narrative to push even though you've been explained how your claim is wrong?

       This is nothing.  I'm sure someone has looked at some kind of porn on the business computer there.  It doesn't mean they're crazy enough to use their website for it.  Do you really think it would be that easy to bust them?  With a free URL fuzzer?  Come on.

       This is literally less than doing nothing to expose actual pedophiles. It's accusing people of a horrible crime with no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't understand the tools you used to generate these results, why wasn't your first step to
       <em>
        learn
       </em>
       rather than tossing out garbage accusations? And when people who do understand those tools point out that you just submitted too many requests and got the "too many requests" error from the server, why isn't your response to acknowledge that instead of pretending you actually found something?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Pizzagate is such garbage. It's about making the self-declared "investigators" feel like clever dicks, not actually helping anyone.

       FUCK YOU, YOU SICK FUCK. You’re literally arguing that damaging someone’s reputation is a worse crime than raping &amp; murdering kids. Like, oh yeah, we’d better not even investigate whether these people are pedophiles because the potential we may be spreading a “rumor” about an innocent person outweighs the potential that kids are being exploited/abused/murdered by these people. Again, FUCK YOU. Go back to the hell hole from whence you came, you perverted pedophile shill.

       Do I sound like the type of person who gives a shit about what anyone else says is “debunked?” Do you not realize you’re on a fucking conspiracy sub where practically everything posted here has been ‘debunked’ by one source or another? I can think for myself. And what I think is that the OP’s findings are not baseless.

       Wrong. ALL I care about is whether it’s true or not. You are the one telling OP that the truth doesn’t matter and that no one should look into this any further because of what it could do to people’s reputations. 
We are trying to expose the truth. You are trying to conceal it.

       I'm saying that the OP that he jumped the gun by assuming that an HTTP 429 error meant that the URL he was trying to access was valid. He seems to have realized this was true. You don't seem to care what the facts of the allegations are, as long as you get to scream invective at someone. Pretty classic Pizzagate "investigator" MO.

       Sure, maybe he jumped the gun. But that means we need to investigate further, not pull back. No one has proven yet that, without a doubt, the 429 errors were due to server overload. People have also said they got 429s when trying the directories manually. That does not make sense if the 429s are truly ‘invalid.’ We need to look into it more, not less. What are you so afraid of?

I used the website and thats what it showed me so I came here to post what I found and to have people who know what they are doing look into it to see if its something interesting.

       What you've done here is like walking up to someone and asking them a different question every second. Then when they stop answering your questions (because they physically can't) you keep asking questions and then go around telling everyone that their refusal to answer your questions shows that they're lying and every answer is actually yes.

       The program OP used has a long list of common directory names. For example, a lot of websites have folders named "faq". When the program is run, it tries out literally every potential URL on the website to see if it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you do that to a website, the server is constantly returning results, usually a 404 error. This means you're bombarding the server with traffic. When you do that too many times per second, you start getting 429 errors instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like typing in
       <a href="http://www.disney.com/mickeymouse">
        www.disney.com/mickeymouse
       </a>
       to see if it exists, only hundreds of times a second and with every possible Disney character.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently enough websites have folders with names like "kids" and "anal" that the URL fuzzer includes them in the attempts. What you're seeing are names of folders the program
       <em>
        tried
       </em>
       and got traffic errors on, not the names of folders it discovered.

       OP used a dictionary tool that throws a lot of requests with random dictionary words at a server. The server is configured with a rate limiter to prevent such services from abusing the server and grinding it to a halt. After a couple of requests the server stopped serving any response other than the 429 response which basically means stop spamming my server with requests please. It doesn't mean these directories exist, any request sent with any directory would have been met with the same 429 response by the server.

       Http 429 says the server rejects his request because he launched to many queries in a to short timeframe. It's a part of ddos protection for example.

       If you can prove any of the arguments I've made are poor or dishonest, I'll eat my shorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it matters, you're clearly trolling. One of the primary tactics of the Pizzagaters is to accuse anyone who argues against it of "defending pedophiles", which is patently asinine. You jerks have yet to prove that
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       targeted by Pizzagate is one.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like me aren't defending pedophiles; we're calling you out for handing out accusations of pedophilia like free tickets to a Funny Bone comedy show.

       Every time you guys post this
       <em>

       it gets explained to you why it's false. And then you ignore that and post it again a few weeks later.

       Comet ping pong was a hipster venue that had some shitty bands, that doesn't mean John Podesta is a satanic paedophile.

       Your arguments are embarrassing, and backfiring on you. The harder you belabor, the more obvious is becomes you're fighting for an agenda that everyone can see right though.

       That's because I know enough about Pizzagate to dismantle literally every single argument made for it. You don't need to be a shill to do that, you just have to be able to think
       <em>
        critically
       </em>
       and recognize fallacies when you see them. Pizzagate is demonstrably false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also posted in a retarded thread about
       <em>
        Eyes Wide Shut
       </em>
       , but you guys are conveniently ignoring that. There isn't much else making it to the front page of the sub worth arguing against, certainly not much I know enough about to bother.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the fact that I use an alt to post here and occasionally nuke my post history is proof of anything, go ahead and break the sub rules by calling me a shill. But if you think I'm spreading
       <em>
        disinformation
       </em>
       , then the onus is on you to prove that anything I've said is false.

       If you were looking for truth, the object wouldn't be to "dismantle literally every single argument made for it", it would be to find the truth. There are new theories and arguments for it that pop up daily over on voat, if you really wanna test your skill, why not practice at the source? New arguments to dismantle by the hour there, daily.

       But if virtually every argument against Pizzagate is based on misinformation, then arguing against it would be promoting truth.

      <p>
       That just goes to show how silly this "investigation" is. If Pizzagaters want to be considered a serious investigation they would be trying to find new leads and developing a theory based on where those leads take them. Instead they just repost the same stuff over and over again and then come up with a House of Cards fanfiction for a theory, and then come up with something else a few hours later.

       The people that are trying to “win” the argument are coming from a place of ego.  They will have a hard time finding truth, because the ego doesn’t allow a person to look at things objectively.  The ego needs to maintain a cohesive worldview.  It assumes that all things that contrasts with this worldview must be false and it uses assumptions to strengthen the things it believes.  In an era of misinformation, you have to start with the assumption that much of what you believe is false.  The goal is not to confirm your own assumptions, but rather to weed out all the false assumptions and let the truth stand as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s this false idea that there’s two sides to this issue as if you have to align with “those crazy conspiracy theorists” or those “shills”.  I don’t believe this is a good belief to accept.  Instead, I believe that almost all of us want the truth and the other, much smaller group is people trying to actively spread misinformation.  We want resolution.  They want us to stay in a perpetual state of confusion and uncertainty.  Therein lies the difference in truth-seeking and trying to disprove the “other”.

       Did you read different things to me during your 'research'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I have also read every little thing and have to say, the more I read the more suspicious I got. If you don't, then you have some strange morals and standards of what is acceptable and what is not for a family restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't start off believing in it. But there is so much circumstantial evidence that it makes a case all in itself. You are very suspicious to me too with downplaying everything without even acknowledging that there is some really unsavoury stuff going on which in itself should be cause for concern.

       When jailbait and all the other CP subs were banned they flocked to voat. I don't support sites that support child exploitation. The fact that pizzagate has no problem being on a site for exploiting children tells you all you need to know about how much PG actually cares about kids.

       Voat finally did ban their various jailbait subs, but I think it took one of their service providers threatening to drop them in order to do it.

       However, I do agree with your point. Their jailbait subs used to be the top results when you google searched for voat.

       Voat still has a lot of threads up about it, many with active links. They also link to another Trudeau organization called...the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation:

       And your links seem to be to other topics. I'm asking about the specific org you mentioned earlier. Simply having a triangle logo in a pamphlet isn't particularly convincing for me.

       The difference is 404 vs 409 error.
       <br/>
       Someone needs to run this test again with the same or similar list in a different sort order and compare the results!
      </p>
      <p>
       404 means page not found, I do not know what you are talking about.
       <br/>
       409 means I know what you want, but you're not getting it.
       <br/>
       The question is, which has priority, and this is why someone needs to retest.

       The hidden directories someone discovered last year were all long hash looking strings, so I find it indeed implausible. But hey, people have made stupider mistakes before...

       429 will have priority. Once you exceed the rate limit the server will return 429 errors until you slow down regardless of whether or not the directory you're requesting exists. It's basically saying that it won't comply with your requests until you fuck off for a bit. It's a measure to prevent abuse.

       After going through a vpn I looked at this, it's squarespace and 429 means you exceeded requests per second and got denied. The few of the urls it tried manually give a 404 not found.

       I am curious why so many here assumed it was WordPress? That is the strangest part of this thread to me.

       Good thought OP. You must have gotten pretty excited for a few minutes there. I think that after the "gunman" miraculously smoked the hardrive with his errant shot that everything has been cleaned up and hidden if it was what we thought it was to begin with. The only way you could get info on jimmy is if you could get a rootkit onto his personal devices and watch him from afar or to set up rogue access points around his home/work/museum. Or possibly do this to his network of "friends".
      </p>
      <p>
       If he is doing this shit at a blackmail level or if he is a Rothschild getting caught doing anything like this could get nightmare on elmstreet scary real fast.

       Did bigfish say it was WordPress? Perhaps they moved to Squarespece after their selfhosted wordpress was fatally gunned down?

       Shill hunting: shoot first and ask questions later. Always err on the side of assuming the person you're arguing with is a shill. A sure-fire way to bring any debate to a grinding halt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it matter why I occasionally choose to distract myself by arguing against Pizzagate? The only thing that matters is whether or not my arguments are intellectually honest and sound. Most arguments
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       Pizzagate are exactly the opposite.

       The camera was never pointed at Comet to begin with. You wouldn't have seen the event on it in the position it was in before.

      <p>
       Seems to me that traffic cameras inexplicably change views on any given day. The current view from that camera isn't the same as any of the photos above.

       Makes me nostalgic for Early 2017.... when pgate was the hot topic here and every comment got upvoted :(
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays, it changed so dramatically towards negativity, that I can only explain it with infiltration.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I got a PM attack from a user whose account was only a few weeks old. Recently, I got a very detailed rebuttal about Podesta's reasons for his peculiar 'art taste' and the 'kiddie pool' email. Then I checked the user who'd replied, and the account was a few weeks old as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule 10 prevents me from even using the word "shills"... but I just got the overall impression that this sub has been infiltrated/brigaded by info agents/army. It's just an impression, I'm not accusing anyone or anything. It's just a vague feeling.
      </p>
      <p>

       I try to have positivity, I just feel like accusations of shilling - or even insinuations of shilling - are death to any helpful discussion. Even if someone's a shill,
       <em>
        saying
       </em>
       that they are isn't going to make people who are on the fence believe your point more. No matter whether you're right or wrong, it just feels like you're trying to avoid having to answer the other person's points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talking about "paid Russian trolls", even if there might be some, and I roll my eyes when I see people talking about ShareBlue shills here, even if there might be some.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got nothing against people who believe in pizzagate - I don't think they're right, but that doesn't mean I think they're bad people or anything - I just hate when I come in a thread like this, and there's a lot of people saying "Hey, that's not what a 429 error means", and the main rebuttal from people in the pro-pizzagate camp is "SHILL!"

       Why has there been such a pizzagate push lately in here with posts that just mention pizzagate or podesta or comet in the title yet fall apart within 5 seconds of looking at it? I guess hoping just keep bringing it up might fuck with people's heads and make some of them believe it

       I'm not dismissing anyone who proved me wrong - if you clearly can read I originally said in my post "I'm posting this here so someone who knows what they're doing can look into it". I'm dismissing those who instead of contributing anything, instead started personally attacking me and tried threating me with a poorly done dox in my messages.
