       Next time you take a cab or bus, talk to the driver about conspiracy theories. Try to gauge how receptive they are to them. And work out stats as to what percentage of people believe in conspiracy theories. You've got nothing to lose by talking to them about (whereas if u did it with work colleagues you might lose social standing).

       Everyone I know believes in at least once conspiracy theory... it's very rare for them to belive in all of them, but I find almost everyone has their own pet conspiracy theory.
      </p>

       I was even reading the 9/11 Commission Report in a coffee shop this summer and a girl came up and told me that when I'm done reading it I need to go watch Zeitgeist on YouTube.

       Nah... I didn't have my tinfoil hat on out in the public so I just just gave her a sarcastic line about how Terrorists are very very bad and how the US government are always always always the good guys and never do anything wrong... In retrospect I should have handled it differently cause she was kinda cute.

       I wasn't prepared for a big flirtation... That book is a really long and slow read and no one ever commented before. If I knew some cute girl was gonna come along and use it for an icebreaker I would have had some zingers all lined up... plus I had a really bad experience with a girl I picked up from that coffeehouse in the past... I think she was raised in a cult... but that is a whole other story like 10 times longer than this one.

       Seems like the kinda zinger you should work out... I once was introduced to a guy at a party, a mutual friend was like “hey come here this is Bill, he’s a crazy conspiracy person too...” and Bill asked me what conspiracy I was really into and so I mumbled something about the Boston marathon, and I asked Bill what conspiracy he was into and he very seriously said “ALL OF THEM” and I pretty much instantly fell in love.

       It just takes a small question, all innocent like to see whats up.  Some will get into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know for a fact that most people actually are conspiracy theorists.  You can make statements as clear and obvious as anything and they know they have to agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are zero criminals in Washington."  People will laugh, because of course it cannot be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       "People never kill to stay in power." Same thing, it is a given.  It has been done and there is no reason to stop now.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Those same people would never manipulate you or the public in order to keep the status quo."
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime your target, show them with concrete evidence there is no need to give them credibility and show them people need to be more skeptical and hope them accountable.  If they can't or think that is impossible, ask them how you can ignore those actions and live in that world without being the watchdog of some kind?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get that far and say that's the way it is, they are the one's who have been beaten.  Apathy has taken them.  They're surviving, so......I call them unsavable.

       I would definitely say that they ("conspiracy theorists" in the pejorative sense) definitely are and that this isn't remotely a good thing.

       There's a vast difference between an appreciation of the fact that there are secret doings behind the scenes between various power-players, and a (culture wide) knee-jerk assumption that
       <strong>
        every and all societal evils
       </strong>
       derive from some malevolent outer (preferably minority) actor: with the facts filled in haphazardly after the fact, depending on the speaker's level of interest.

       Take a gander at some of the stuff that floats around these parts and apply that on a true social scale. As things flow here - on the internet - it's effectively a safe space where debunking is only grudgingly tolerated. Crazy stuff is OK. It gets downvoted or ignored and we move one.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a culture where conspiracy theories dominate, the admission of a problem can never occur because the discussion of what that problem is will be so split between individuals/factions or so thoroughly off-base on a society wide scale ("Dumping trash in the lake isn't what has taken our drinking water from us, it's the &lt;insert minority&gt; who are poisoning it!") that when you're in the mindset you can barely grasp the concepts behind the true cause.

       Facts. You know ex- Mossad helped Weinstein cover up his rapes for 20 years. You can see Jews complain about 50% of their children being molested by the Jewish elders, and that the parents are 'zombies' (ie. brainwashed) and ignore that their children are coming home with bleeding anuses.

       That's not what he is saying at all. If you are taking the opposite side to him you are saying that crime should be fought by saying everybody is a criminal.

       I took a cab circa 2004 and started talking to the cabbie, starting by just asking where he was from. He was Saudi, and came to the states after being in jail for a year, starting January 2002. He was in jail because he was close friends with Mohammed Atta and had been at university with him. He said, "The man they show on the news? That's not him. Looks very much like him, but not the same." I asked if that's why he was in jail, and he affirmed that they didn't want him blabbing off that his friend was still alive and not a terrorist.

       A year later another cabbie turned me on to Immortal Technique.

       Bro, Star Wars prequels came out before 911. The CG we saw on 911 was so low tech.

      <p>
       Do some research before concern trolling people who understand how it was really done.

       911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?

       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>

       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">
        /r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       okay so there was no CG at the pentagon because there wasnt even a fucking image released from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       pentagon was a cruise missile, full stop, no need for CG there at all because no images were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the towers, saying there was no CGI doesnt mean there were no bombs, planes hit the structure and broke shit, i dont think the planes that did hit, actually brought the building down at all though.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can hit the building with a plane and still bring it down with bombs. again zero reason for CGI, in fact because of the hole in the building there had to be something striking it. again the plane imho did not bring the building down, it was there for the appearance it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       you seem to think CGI is a nessecity for what played out, im saying that the CG side theory is bunk because it is not required for any of the rest of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       they ran a real plane in to the towers, but those planes were not responsible for the collapses. this CG theory is needlessly complicated and stupid. its easier to run a plane in to a building than it is to setup a fake hologram and rig charges to blow a plane shaped hole out of a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       like i said this CG angle makes the rest look stupid.

       you're right there was no CG for the Pentagon, because the Israelis didn't have access to the security camera footage (the WTC HD security camera footage they just went up to the rooftops on the nearby buildings and stole it. Hence why they were seen celebrating on rooftops).

       again real planes would not have been shot down due to the confusion, fighters were not even in the air when the planes hit the towers. oddly enough if you bothered to read my link you would see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       93 wasnt an aircraft either, it wasnt shot down (they claimed the passengers brought that one down remember) and again its "crash site" had no engines present or any of the debris associated with plane crashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       no matter how hard/fast an aircraft slams in to anything the engine blocks survive. no engines were found at the 93 site or the pentagon, and they claimed they vaporized...
      </p>
      <p>
       you say CG, well the reality is the planes were seen from a bunch of angles at the same time and by people with their own fucking eyes. so the only way to fake a plane that way is a hologram.
      </p>
      <p>
       you seem to be stuck on this CG thing like its a make-or-break part of the theory. its not, they stand on their own, and the inclusion of this CG stuff as essential makes it looks silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are going to bring down the largest building in the city, its massively easier to use a real plane flown remotely as opposed to secretly editing all of the potential footage that would be easily discredited by a luck cellphone video.
      </p>
      <p>
       there was zero possibility of the planes that hit the towers of being shot down due to the cluster fuck at NORAD. you seem more attached to the CG angle being a necessity than any other part of the story.

       In my experience it’s about 5-10% of people who are open to of aware of theories, with only about 10% of them fully believing or understanding them, and only about 10% of
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       really getting it and making a positive impact.

       There are many conspiracies.  A conspiracy is in function as long as 2 or 3 gather together to do soemthing that is against a system, and organization,  group of people or individual. With all the proven corruptions that the United States government has done to its own citizens it would be foolish to think they havent done more or are still doing it. 
As a Christian who reads his Bible Daily, its also a duty of Christians to be skeptical on almost everything.  To desern from the good and bad. For if you just type tge words , conspire, conspiracy and conspired, into the Strong Concordance,  you will see how many times conspiracies have rose up to go against Gods people and or just good men and women. We has humans have a low tolerance of patience and self esteem. If we feel threatened we try to find people who think like us to surround us and make us more comfortable. We all have conspired in something at one part of our lives whether it was small or big , good or bad. That is why again anyone who doesnt believe in conspiracies ever is trully the dumb shit for brains who is blind and deaf to reality in general.
