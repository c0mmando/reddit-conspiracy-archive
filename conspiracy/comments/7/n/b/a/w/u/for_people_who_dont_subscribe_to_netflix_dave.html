    <div class="md"><p>Netflix has some excellent content without commercials.  The fact that they aren&#39;t beholden to corporate advertising interests yanking funding if they don&#39;t like something affords them much more freedom.  This is reflected in their library, original content, and resonates with many people here.  How you could label that propaganda, I am really not sure.</p>

<p>On topic, thanks for the info MomChomsky, will check this out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... his story at the end...</p>

<p>Clearly he was the &quot;bottom bitch&quot;, and in the story of the &quot;bottom bitch&quot;, she is made to believe she committed a heinous crime.</p>

<p>Is this a sort of &#39;confession&#39; and &#39;alibi&#39; at the same time? He <em>thought</em> he&#39;d done something, but it was all fake, designed to keep him under control?</p>

<p>He says that the story explains why he quit his show and left the US, but is he imply he left because he figured out their game, or because he <em>hadn&#39;t</em> figured it out, and he&#39;s back because he finally figured it out?</p>

<p>As he said, what would make a man turn down 50 million dollars and throw away his career?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He’s saying they made him feel like a bad person for making a personal choice (to leave the show), so they had to find a way to trick him to stay even when he was about to die from exhaustion. They needed their bottom bitch. </p>

<p>But it didn’t work. So, he left $50m on the table. And they needed to get revenge. They made him look crazy. They spread rumors he smoked crack. They made sure he couldn’t work in the town again. </p>

<p>In every special he drops a bit of his belief that capitalism pushes people to madness. This is his most direct version. </p>

<p>If interested in the full story, check out his Inside the Actors Studio interview. It goes into this in full detail. </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/KiwiBattlerNZ.html">KiwiBattlerNZ</a> 2017-12-31</p>
    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He’s saying they made him feel like a bad person for making a personal choice (to leave the show)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see what you&#39;re saying, but I wonder. In this special he mentions that he&#39;s going to tell us <em>why</em> he made that personal choice, not the ramifications of having done so.</p>

<p>Earlier on he&#39;s talking about sexual assault in Hollywood and at one point says &quot;what if that isn&#39;t even the worst that happens&quot; (or words to that effect). He then says something along the lines of &quot;what would make a man leave $50 million on the table and flee to Africa&quot;, then goes on to say he would explain at the end.</p>

<p>So it seems he&#39;s <em>not</em> talking about what happened <em>after</em> he made his choice, he&#39;s talking about why he made his choice in the first place, and implying it was something much worse than sexual assault (and definitely worse than simple exhaustion).</p>

<p>While what you say makes sense, it doesn&#39;t quite fit what Chapelle is saying here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At one point during the heights of success of the Chappelle show, Dave at one point was starting to question the true influence his comedy was having on on the masses. He wondered if his  sketches were influencing racism instead of actually shedding light on certain issues. This could of been a ploy made by the *pimp * to get Dave to change the actual message in his comedy and make it less thought prevoking </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that was definitely part of the point he was making. Dave was the bottom bitch - but then who were the other bitches he had to keep in line? The most obvious interpretation to me is his audience. His audience was the other hoes, who the pimp controlled with help from his bottom bitch. </p>

<p>Dave didn’t want to help TV executives put out material to the masses that was harmful to him or his audience anymore. He stopped turning tricks AND falling for their tricks that kept him in line, and he paid a price for doing the right thing. </p>

<p>So he warns us that this is the same type of game we are all playing with people at the top, and quitting this “cold” game rarely leads to better circumstances for you and/or your family. Just like how pimps will hunt down and badly assault, or sometimes kidnap, drag back - or even kill - hoes who try to get away. The people at the top will make life hard for bottom bitches and hoes who get away from the game. Which is why he says we should donate money and pile-on support for the few people out there now who are stepping out of line. If less people feel threatened and scared by the idea of doing the right thing, if they feel like there is a better way to play the game, more of them will call out injustice.</p>
