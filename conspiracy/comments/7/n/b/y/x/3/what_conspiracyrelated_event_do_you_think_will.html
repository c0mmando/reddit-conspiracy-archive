    <div class="md"><p>Why though? It would serve no purpose, at least if it was US spearheaded.</p>

<p>Morality sure, but that not what US covert foreign policy is concerned with. </p>

<p>The only reason would be to depose the Kim family and get rid of their nukes.</p>

<p>Which would be dumb, they would just launch immediately in that case. </p>

<p>The only other logical reason would be to get base closer to China, which really isn&#39;t a real incentive given the repercussions. They are already surrounded by US client states and allies, getting just 300 miles closer doesn&#39;t serve much purpose given our current military tech. </p>

<p>They do have some rare earth elements, but that&#39;s about it, and not rich enough in them to do something like this, and they can be more easily sourced else where rather then causing a global conflict. </p>

<p>If you justify the theory with Trumps instability, c&#39;mon, although he is the a Commander in Chief, no one is going to let him do it. </p>

<p>This is just a larp hype people want to see happen because it would be super interesting to see unfold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Non-rational actors are everywhere. Since they are non-rational, they do not follow a narrative, such as DPRK tensions heating up.</p>

<p>The likelihood of it happening tonight in Time Square in a few moments as the ball drops is the same as if it was to happen in ROK during the Olympics.  The significance of their actions during such events are what are amplified.</p>

<p>I would love to leave this country but I&#39;m poor in a system designed to keep me that way so it&#39;s not happening. (For the record, I don&#39;t hate America, just the government&#39;s and the corporate and upper class leeches that control every aspect of it for their gain at our expense).
 As with any country, the problem isn&#39;t the people for the most part, it&#39;s the fucking parasites at the top who stole literally everything they own from all of us and control/destroy us with laws that don&#39;t apply to them. They keep us JUST comfortable enough that we don&#39;t look up and realize that we would all be better off rid of them completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao the fact you think you need College ahows me you are too far gone. I was in a situation way worse than that. I made sacrifices to get where i am and re programmed the &#39;poor mindset&#39; i grew up with. </p>

<p>Im not going to give you advice because like most poor people, youre only going to bitch and moan then victimise yourself. </p>

<p>It takes will power to re-educate yourself and break boundaries to get out of that hole. </p>

<p>I wont give you anything else. For some reason people downvote someone that worked themselves out of emotional and physical trauma to become successful. </p>

<p>I sincerely hope you help yourself instead of victimising yourself and making 100 excuses as to why you &#39;cant&#39; rather than why you CAN. </p>

<p>Good luck to no longer being pathetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not victimizing myself, I made some stupid mistakes when I was younger and now I&#39;m a felon. So where&#39;s your fucking sage advice on getting rich fucks to overlook that? THATS what I mean when I say the system keeps me that way. I bust my fucking ass 14 hours a day and stay out of trouble, but it doesn&#39;t change what happened when I was younger. Or, is it not the systems fault that getting a possession charge or two fucks up the rest of your life? I&#39;m not making excuses for that, but I&#39;m not the one who made it a life sentence either. No one cares if you&#39;re clean now, or been out of jail for years without so much as a speeding ticket.</p>

<p>And yea, I realize that college is a huge waste of money, but a lot of jobs require a degree, which I have neither the time nor money to get. So those are out. Even more require a clean record, with or without a degree, so those are out too. What exactly would be your suggestion, because I would LOVE to improve my situation. It&#39;s a shitty fucking home that I dug myself into, and even though I put the shovel down years ago, I didn&#39;t bring a ladder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a lot more felonies than you if that is the case for a lot worse shit. GBO x2 and 3x Possession. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about creating your own opportunities. It takes a lot of head work to. All i can say is that it can be done. It just takes a very headstrong approach. If you are in fact working 14 hours every day, thats something i would change ASAP. So that you can spend those other hours figuring something out. Hell dude, my best friend made 90k in 2k17 flipping shit from stores like Wallmart and OP shops on Amazon and ebay. It takes creativity and will power to get out of that hole. </p>

<p>Im sorry for your situation. Any of us can end up there. Im also sorry that you have to care for your wife. That sucks. You can and will figure it out though. The first step is to stop telling yourself and others that you cant though man. </p>

<p>Also Im Aussie, so I do have one advantage over you in that case that I dont live in a shithole of a country. But you can figure it out, remember, &quot;land of the free&quot; n all. </p>

<p>Good luck mate, i really do mean it. &lt;3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mueller no doubt knows someone could take him out. He might be wearing kevlar. Of course a slug to his head from a sniper would do it. But I tend to think that a vet like him would be carrying and didn&#39;t I read the protection detail is secret service? Besides, his findings will still exist. I&#39;m sure copies were made that nobody could touch. And if Mueller were killed there would be an outcry all over this country. Trump is an idiot for attacking Mueller and the FBI. Trump thinks everyone loves him. All narcissists do. He thinks investigating him is bad for the country. Riggggghhhhhhtttt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if he <em>is</em> wearing a vest... shit. I don’t at all doubt he carries a handgun, at least.</p>

<p>Reality is, though, that arming yourself won’t make much of a difference. It’s all about the team around you. His security would be FBI, I think, and it would have to be 24/7. I read an insider article about his investigation’s workings... DC is pretty secure. He doesn’t drive himself. Working inside a building full of FBI and Capitol Police. Certainly has a car outside his home in his private security protected gated community at all times. Wife and kids, too. I just worry, still.</p>

<p>If he gets fired or, god forbid, the other thing, his investigation doesn’t cease. Somebody else just get appointed. He would have already drafted a recommendation. He’s sharing info with state AGs, and every other intel agency, courtesy of Obama’s policies. Nothing he does or finds out can be destroyed. I just worry.</p>
