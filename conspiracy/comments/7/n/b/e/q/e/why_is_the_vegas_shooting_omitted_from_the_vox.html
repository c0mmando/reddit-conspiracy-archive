    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because the concert bombings were politically and religiously motivated and were acts committed by a tangible &#39;enemy&#39;, whereas the Vegas shootings is still a huge dark question mark without answers or clear motive.  Makes it a lot harder to understand and rationalize.  i agree it should be included, for better or worse, it happened and we shouldn&#39;t ignore that.

<p>but...it did the opposite.  it made the majority of americans MORE concerned.  almost everyone i talk to about this is scared as hell of what it resulted in.  it showed the true colors of the media and the intelligence agencies.  </p>

<p>suddenly realizing that your own country has you in a net of propaganda is really uncomfortable.</p>

<p>So zero impacts can be found the next day? Not a single spark caught on video? How many rounds? 1000?</p>

<p>Watch the following. For those that haven&#39;t seen it yet. Some videos that bring clarity:</p>

<p>How Billions were * FOOLED * by the Vegas shooting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cndOsUE8yi4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cndOsUE8yi4</a>&amp;</p>

<p>I was wondering where all the videos of the wounds were and I found it. Video footage of the only one supposedly shot turns out to be bogus! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YALTo5pJY-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YALTo5pJY-4</a></p>

<p>New birds eye view of the concert floor. These guys in the Foundation Room should have been able to see or easily hear someone shooting but nothing, Just more confusion caused by SOUND. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shDNkLTIW-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shDNkLTIW-Q</a></p>

<p>No sparks from any bullet impacts, zero. Look at ANY video you will not find one spark. Only sound. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg</a>&amp;</p>

<p>More evidence of not a single shot fired. No damage from alleged bullets. Some of those structures should look like a country road stop sign. No bullet forensics being done. They are just covering up any fake blood and other artifacts from the crisis actors. They also seem to be deep cleaning (scrubbing) up any fragments or debris from the water bottles with firecrackers in them.</p>
