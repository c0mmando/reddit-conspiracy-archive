        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found this email to be one of the most curious ones regarding the Pedogate/Pizzagate findings. </p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/p4elddpsd/">https://postimg.org/image/p4elddpsd/</a></p>

<p>There is clearly no coded language being used here, rather a more blatant approach to communicating.</p>

<p>The reference to the children as &quot;entertainment&quot;, the possibility of an adult swimming with the children, and the emphasis on their ages in particular struck me as odd. </p>

<p>Turns out the Luzzatos are some interesting characters themselves..</p>

<p>Anne Luzzato, the grandmother, is also a member of the CFR (council on foreign relations). The CFR boosts many of the wealthy elites into positions of power.</p>

<p>Other members include Epstein, Soros, Anthony Luzzato. </p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/p4elddpsd/">https://postimg.org/image/p4elddpsd/</a></p>

<p>Tamera Luzzatto, former chief of staff for Hilary Clinton, is the person who sent the email about the ‚ÄúFarmer L Update‚Äù (above) to Podesta. She also is a member of the Pew Institute. She is evidently well acquainted with the Podestas.</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/fwmcwp5vh/">https://postimg.org/image/fwmcwp5vh/</a></p>

<p>Anne is not only a member of the CFR but are also a member of the National Security Council, another highly influential group in Washington DC</p>

<p>The NSC also has a group called Child.org</p>

<p>Regarding Tamera Luzzato, she is the writer of the linked podesta email in the title. She made a blog page for the newborn 4th and youngest, called ‚ÄòEvie‚Äôs Crib‚Äô in which she extended an open invite to readers to, <strong>&#39;for a limited time only‚Äô, ‚Äòspend some time with her online, raw and uncut.‚Äô</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some strange stuff once you put this all together, that I personally think deserves a second look. And keep in mind, this is one small facet of the greater picture of the Pedogate/Pizzagate investigation. Feel free to add anything I may have missed in the comments. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean its because of pizzagate. You are connecting 2 entirely unrelated things. I accuse you of kidnapping them. I have the same amount of proof as you do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony Podesta&#39;s art collection?</p>

<p>Rich people buy weird art. Where have you been the last 2 decades of the modern art movement? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whose heavy breathing and why do they incorporate the boy/girl lover symbols in their videos? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A local DC band established in 2010 that is decently popular. the boy love logo might be a spiral triangle but not all spiral triangles are the boy love symbol. To assume that in any way shape or form is being intellectually dishonest. For fucks sake ive had a windchime thats a spiral triangle long before Pizzagate was thing. Does that make me a pedophile? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp; Besta Pizza&#39;s logo?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again  the boy love logo might be a spiral triangle but not all spiral triangles are the boy love symbol. To assume that in any way shape or form is being extremely intellectually dishonest to push an agenda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did they change it, but only online? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they were the subject of an extreme baseless <strong>internet</strong> witchhunt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where does Heavy Breathing perform? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A ton of local DC areas because they are a DC based local band. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whats spirit cooking? When is it done with what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something rich people do for entertainment. </p>

<p>Now if you are done with your ridiculous 20 questions how about you for the first time in pizzagates entire history post a single piece of proof to back up your accusations. because all I&#39;ve seen so far is just feelings and how bad yall REALLY want democrats to be pedophiles.</p>

<p>Pedophilia by the elites is a huge problem. Pizzagate has nothing to do with that and hurts the cause of finding pedos. Remember Pizzagaters are the ones who are full in behind Roy Moore and Doanld Trump. Pizzagate is about DEFENDING pedophiles nothing more. Pizzagate doesn&#39;t give a fuck about children. Shit its encouraged as long as the pedophile has the (R) next to their name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way to perfectly leave out irrefutable parts like anything related to Heavy Breathing like their event posters and how they mainly perform at Comet Ping Pong. What about the footage of them &quot;performing&quot; there? What do they say?</p>

<p>Your explanation for the symbols is pathetic when its on a long list of other corroborating evidence. Note that any and all attention to those symbols are thanks to a declassified FBI document on what symbols pedophiles use to highlight themselves to each other</p>

<p>&amp; No being rich doesn&#39;t exclude you from the necessary analysis anyone connected to or having power should go through. Being rich doesn&#39;t mean you can buy loads of art picturing child abuse and not be questioned for it. Why are they wiping blood, semen, breast milk, etc on walls only on earthquake nights?</p>

<p>The dollar amount in my bank account should never tell the amount of faith society should give me.</p>

<p>Generalizing anyone who sees &amp; speaks up about this evidence as an immediate Trump supporter is so arrogantly stupid and obnoxious. I am a fucking progressive and am done with your attempts at covering up and distracting from the evidence from John Podesta&#39;s emails and surrounding circumstances. If you&#39;re sad enough to succeed on the fact that powerful pedophilia is an epidemic then you should be more than alright with a clear and independent investigation of Pizzagate, the Podesta Bros, and anything it leads to. </p>

<p>What exactly is wrong with questioning the safety of our children? I am not sharpening pitchforks, and my efforts are on a lot more topics and ppl than just this. John &amp; James are fine living their wealthy and power connected lives while over half the country lives paycheck to paycheck</p>

<p>The blog is weird. I could probably justify it by saying it was just an awkward joke. The power over life piece is clearly a joke.

<p>What are you talking about? The CFR is a <em>huge</em> organization, with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/membership/membership-roster-a-f">over 4,000 members.</a> It&#39;s not that hard to get into. It&#39;s for people interested in <em>foreign affairs</em>, like the Deputy Press Secretary for Foreign Affairs, which was one of Anne Luzzatto&#39;s positions in the Clinton administration.</p>

<p>She was also press secretary for the NSC, not a member of it. It is not just &quot;another highly influential group in Washington DC&quot;, it is part of the government, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council">one of the highest level groups in the Executive Branch</a>. It is chaired by the President of the United States.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t what link you think the NSC has to child.org, but you&#39;re almost certainly wrong.</p>

Literally no adult I know has ever described kids as entertainment.

<p>I&#39;ve seen people &quot;mistakenly&quot; refer to it as a &quot;hot tub party&quot; so many times that I have to believe it&#39;s intentional in order to make it seem sexual.</p>

<p>Like, if you heard someone say &quot;So and so is going to taxi all the kids over the the party,&quot; why would you assume that means they&#39;re literally going to hire a taxi driver to pick them up?

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Mary, age 6, and Sam, age 4, will definitely be there for further entertainment!&quot; . It doesn&#39;t seem like much of a difference, but as a parent, it definitely is.</p>

<p>Also, none of the parents consider the kids entertainment, they just spend pool parties trying to get the other parents to watch the kids so they can drink or relax. Usually one or two people get stuck watching all the kids.</p>

<p>I disagree there. It&#39;s probably the most ambiguous part of the message. It could be meant jokingly, but when I was researching Luzatto last fall, I discovered a lot of links between her inner circle and stem cell/cloning research. There&#39;s something strange going on, but what it exactly it is, is not yet fully apparent.</p>

<p>I have not. It was a weird rabbit hole to go down. I found connections to the affordable care act (as a means of funding and subsidizing), Henry Kissinger, and Fishery and wildlife preservation (an active ingredient used in the process of cloning was being put into an anti-algae chemical solution and special US government districts were being created to allow certain lakes to be flooded with the stuff; one of Kissinger&#39;s agents was declared &quot;Mayor&quot; of one of these districts).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but i&#39;ve seen it used many times in a film, not pornographic sense, so it doesn&#39;t stand out any extra because its of an infant. And I don&#39;t just mean something like south park saying &quot;bigger longer and uncut&quot; which isnt pornographic, but the joke is a play on sounding like pornography. In this case going a long with the rest of the description, its like in film or music referring to unedited, unproducted footaged. So the joke is that this is like the REAL shit, the RAW stuff...of a baby rolling over or farting or something super mundane.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen crap like &quot;the bible, raw and uncut&quot; though maybe its because a preacher wouldn&#39;t have their first thought of pornography either lol.</p>

<p>yea thats some news to me friendo. do go on. lay it out for me real slow like. oh when your done tap dance your way around this sentence of the very same email. </p>

<p>&quot;I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place.&quot;</p>

<p>picture me with my chin in my hands while you tell me why anyone would even need to establish &quot;strategies&quot; much less &quot;stategies which have long been in place&quot; if these guys are just sending some mac and cheese to each other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were sending Christmas gifts, you obtuse cuck. He sent an assortment of cheeses that year instead of his signature Walnut Pasta dish (literally, hes very well known for cooking, and for that specific dish). This was a surprise to the recipient, who responded in the email.</p>

<p>Then she went on to reference their past vacation at Martha&#39;s Vineyard, where Podesta taught them to play dominos. And finished out with &quot;do you think we will be better at (that thing you taught us) after eating (last year&#39;s present) or (this year&#39;s present)&quot;.</p>

<p>Explaining this kind of benign email to you rabid pizzagaters is exhausting... I wish there was a single thread for this shit, it&#39;s been &quot;debunked&quot; reasonably 100 times.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>But this year Podesta sent a box of cheeses, instead</strong>‚Äîperhaps he&#39;s too busy getting ready for the primaries in January to make presents himself.</p>

<p>Herb Sandler writes a humorous thank you note in an email.. It&#39;s occurred to me that millenials may understand it better if I add in a few &quot;lol&quot;s.</p>

<p>Mary and John</p>

<p><strong>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place lol</strong>. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box lol. Lo and behold, <strong>instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses</strong>, Yummy.

<p>(also just for the sake of full disclosure on this particular batch of emails: im entirely willing to concede herb and marie sandler really do just like playing dominos on stomachs full of pastas and cheeses, however given their involvement in not only the housing market collapse of 08 but being in the same rolodex of some real sketchy people (hastert, epstein), if they get a public colonoscopy from all this and it turns up nothing, i guess good for them that theyre only run of the mill scumbags and not blood curdling monsters. same for luzzato and her future cfr brood.)</p>

<p>Look up the pictures of kids being borderline tortured on cometpingpongs instagram.</p>

<p>Ever notice that when people talk about the &quot;disgusting pictures&quot; on CPP&#39;s Instagram, they never actually link to any of them? I think the reason is that they want people to imagine them, because if they actually saw them it would take a little bit of wind out of their sails.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of the photos of the &quot;tortured children&quot;, see for yourself. It&#39;s a little girl with masking tape on her hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait so liking weird art makes you, without question, a pedophile? Do you undstand at all how mind bogglingly absurd that is? That&#39;s not proof it&#39;s wishful thinking and feelings on your part. Yes those sculptures are weird as fuck and creepy but that&#39;s the entire point. The artist wants you to feel uneasy. Art is about eliciting a guy response. One of the best way to make someone uneasy is to put something corrupt by something pure and good. A la why monsters and children are so common of a theme together. Also it would be dumb to deny that these are made by an insanely talented sculptor. </p>

<p>Not all art is paintings of sunsets and nor should it be.</p>

<p>&quot;everything I don&#39;t understand is pedophilia&quot; is not a reasonable position to take. </p>

<p>Once again. A spiral triangle is not always a pedo sign. To assume that is intellectually dishonest and done soly to push an agenda without thought of critical thinking. </p>

I never assumed  anything of the symbols, I purely have asked questions and cried out for an investigation independent from any bias. You&#39;re the one immediately assuming there is nothing to the use of the symbology, which by your definition is intellectually dishonest and highlights your own agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not art depicting child abuse. And like I said children in art are a very effective tool to creating discomfort. Which that art is blatantly trying to do. </p>

<p>A spiral triangle is not automatically a pedo symbol. Assuming that a spiral triangle has nothing to do with pedophilia until proven otherwise is the intellectually honest way of looking at it. The absurd claim that a spiral logo at a pizza place represents pedophilia requires proof not feelings. </p>

<p>you are crying for an investigation that has literal no proof of any sort that a crime was committed. Just because you make something up doesn&#39;t mean the PD should investigate it., </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing was made up, everything questioned came from Podesta&#39;s emails and surrounding circumstances. Again, I didn&#39;t assume a thing about the use of that symbol. What I did was show FBI&#39;s findings on how pedophiles use them to highlight themselves to each other, and questioned why they would be everywhere surrounding Pizzagate whilst other curious things pop up painting a picture. You&#39;re the one immediately assuming there can&#39;t possibly be anything sinister from the use of the symbols. Which again, is intellectually dishonest. Making connections and understanding a situation does not equate to making anything up. Asking questions and wanting answers from the people who protect us is what I&#39;m doing here. You can try to spin or vilify that all you want but I think if you are tired of armchair detectives, maybe step aside and let the real ones do their job. If you&#39;re so confident this topic is utter bullshit then step aside and let the authorities have a bias free look into whats going on here.</p>

<p>Oh wait, she lost. Have they already done that? Has there ever been 10k sealed indictments in less than 3 months?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I‚Äôm a bit concerned that the way that pizzagate is speculated about could come back to bit people in the future in that if someone looks through anybody‚Äôs emails you could potentially say x,y,z words really are coded messages and relate to something illegal.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve no doubt some shady stuff is going on but are there any other confirmation about code words that people would use beyond the 4chan post. Definitely appreciate that the symbols of those places were in the FBI doc, but I haven‚Äôt seen the code words confirmed anywhere else.</p>

<p>I remember hearing the phone call where Alefantis threatened the guy from vote and while he‚Äôs obviously not going to admit to anything he did say it wasn‚Äôt related to kids which makes me wonder if it‚Äôs to do with money laundering or something like that. The emails do read weird like the ‚Äúwill I do better playing dominos on pizza or pasta‚Äù and the ‚Äúfound a map is it pizza related‚Äù, the language is definitely odd, but it isn‚Äôt enough to say that it‚Äôs one thing or another. Hopefully I don‚Äôt come across as trying to dismiss it totally, but I think most people will be reluctant to accuse anybody without more info. If there‚Äôs anything you think I‚Äôve overlooked then would appreciate a link to more evidence </p>

<p>What are you talking about? The CFR is a <em>huge</em> organization, with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/membership/membership-roster-a-f">over 4,000 members.</a> It&#39;s not that hard to get into. It&#39;s for people interested in <em>foreign affairs</em>, like the Deputy Press Secretary for Foreign Affairs, which was one of Anne Luzzatto&#39;s positions in the Clinton administration.</p>

<p>She was also press secretary for the NSC, not a member of it. It is not just &quot;another highly influential group in Washington DC&quot;, it is part of the government, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council">one of the highest level groups in the Executive Branch</a>. It is chaired by the President of the United States.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t what link you think the NSC has to child.org, but you&#39;re almost certainly wrong.</p>

<p>But have you read the whole blog? other than the description about her being future ruler of the world(so obviously tongue in cheek) its all totally normal stuff, theres a reason people just quote the &quot;jacks owner&quot; one and the title, because none of the other posts have anything weird in them. All those other posts come off as someone who is a proud parent. &quot;here&#39;s us taking her to her first baseball game&quot; etc etc</p>
