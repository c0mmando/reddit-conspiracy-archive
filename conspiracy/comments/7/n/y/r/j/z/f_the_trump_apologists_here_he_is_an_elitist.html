<p>How many other Presidents have literally adopted conspiracy terms like &quot;globalists&quot; and &quot;deep state&quot; to explain issues? How many other Presidents made enemies of both the Bushes and Clinton&#39;s and aired their dirty laundry on prime time tv? How many other Presidents have gone to war against mainstream media? Have many other Presidents went on Infowars? How many other Presidents have years of pushing conspiracies on twitter? How many other Presidents have had the prior president (and the deep state) start a conspiracy against him to spy on him using the NSA? </p>

<p>Is the answer none? Wow it&#39;s like you&#39;re being obtuse on purpose ignoring context, but I would never call you a shill or anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta hand it to you on all of the above.</p>

<p>I didn’t vote for him. I got run out of the Democrat party when they bailed out the DNC and then rigged the election. The kicker was when disenfranchised Bernie supporters were told to shut up and stop being ridiculous.</p>

<p>I fully expected Clinton to win and when it was clear she wasn’t going to, I was loving the shock and tears of the so-called unbiased media.</p>

<p>And then on his first day in office, the TPP was thrown out! Remember when everyone was freaking out about the TPP? It was good for all Americans that he did that.</p>

<p>Steadily over the year, with all of the corruption in the DOJ and FBI getting exposed. With all of the MSM except for Fox talking shit about everything he does every single day, I’ve grown to respect him.</p>

<p>I don’t love him but I respect him.</p>

<p>The troll tweets are the best.</p>

<p>The dude literally called for Huma to be locked up. Everyday that passes, I am more confident than ever in my vote for Trump. To count all the reasons would take hours. Everyone reading this got a 5% raise in the last month; moreso than employers have offered in over a decade. He gave you money. I mean...??? Got a 401(k)?</p>

<p>peak was 14k during bush years but realistically with the bubble it was 10 (where it was in 06). so since say 06 INCLUDING A MAJOR RECESSION we&#39;ve had a 5% growth rate...</p>

That combined with the significant lower tax rate on corporations makes me worried that my future as someone under 30 is going to be without the entitlements I currently pay into such as Medicare and SS and my 401k will also be capped. Essentially this tax bill is great short term, as you say, but the long-term ramifications are obvious and significant.</p>

<p>The impact of your inbred stupidity has cost this country several thousand times more in corporate handouts than every fucking illegal immigrant has cost the entire country, even before their peripheral economic stimulation. </p>

<p>Your justifications are based off if irrational bigotry, a weak grasp of economics, and a steady diet of russian fucking propaganda. </p>

<p>And you have the GALL, THE FUCKING GALL to talk to <em>ME</em> about TAXES!?</p>

<p>You ignorant streak of vulture vomit, what you know about the real world would fit in a children&#39;s book that was mostly pictures and  some stupid novelty toy that is an inherent part of the story tied to the spine. </p>

<p>I cannot even find words to describe exactly how loathsome and disgusting your entire diseased worldview is to me, and being a logophile I know words like &#39;repugnant&#39;, &#39;nauseated&#39; and &#39;effluvium&#39;. </p>

<p>All of these fall short of the visceral disgust I feel when viewing a pro-trump bumper sticker or a MAGA hat. </p>

<p>And I want you to understand there is very little anger here. </p>

<p>My disgust comes from the fact that you are a symptom of the entire American way of life rotting and slipping away into a putrescent runoff of crushed hope and a bleak future for our children. </p>

<p>You are as disturbing as finding a week old maggoty corpse that has been kept damp and warm by rotting organs and decaying cabbage. </p>

<p>I literally have zero understanding how someone with your worldview framework hasn&#39;t accidentally died from massive judgmental error at some point by now in your life. </p>
