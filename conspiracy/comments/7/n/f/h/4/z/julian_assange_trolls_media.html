       Pretty convincing.
I think I got trolled by a tech magician trick I didn't consider.

       I could think of a scenario that would involve a switcharoo.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: plausible deniability, but this is such a big leap that it can no longer be defended.

       Truly a master strategist. They've confirmed dems suspicions that WikiLeaks is a partisan group, but they did it while cleverly hiding another wink and a nod to Seth Rich in a buried link inside images on twitter.

       Of course it’s partisan, look at the content of their leaks. How often have they hurt conservatives? That said, partisan support doesn’t delegitimization the information exposed. Seth Rich was murdered in cold blood for leaking DNC emails to Wikileaks. He was a patriot. He was one of Us.

       There's a pretty clear trend of leaks being weaponized in favor of a certain type of politician after Macron's emails were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish I could peek into an alternate universe where it was Trump and Le Pen's emails leaked. I imagine almost all of the people currently saying "who cares about the motives or actors behind these leaks" would see the issue.

       Yeah I get that. Which begs the question, why haven’t they been given dirt on both sides of the two party system? Is there none? Have they and chosen not to publish? Again, I support Wikileaks 100% percent but I see clear partisanship on their part. I’m not saying that’s bad or good. I’m just saying.

       The juiciest part of Podesta's emails were his risotto recipe. So literally anything they had on Trump had to be at least as damning. But as we now know Assange was colluding with Trump, it's no surprise he decided to be a massive hypocrite and not release the information.

       I don't know. Why do you think conservatives use sock puppet accounts to constantly say "I'm a progressive but.." and then do nothing but defend Trump and attempt to sow discord among the left? Personally, that seems like a much more pervasive problem than the "Shareblue" bogeyman.

       That's an interesting opinion. New to Reddit? You must not have known Reddit before it hit taken over by shills. Believe it or not, Reddit, especially subs like r/politics, used to be far more progressive and grassroots.

       I've been on Reddit for years actually, and have seen how these astroturf bogeymen are much less prevalent than people claim, all because they need an excuse to discount the opinions of others or shut down an argument they know they're losing.

       And I don't need to have an ideological discussion with someone who's not even honest about their own beliefs.

       I'm very honest about my own beliefs. I don't make believe like I'm a progressive, and then do nothing but defend Trump and attack the left. I think being unable to argue your points from a place of honesty shows an inherent weakness in one's own positions. If you need to pretend to be something you're not in order to lend weight to your arguments, then they're not actually worth that much at all, are they?

       No wonder you feel that way. You think people are using shills as a "boogeyman" when really people just don't like corporations anonymously manipulating Reddit. Here's more info on astroturfing:

       You're really not very good at this. The "I'm rubber and you're glue" defense doesn't work very well everyone can see who you claim to be versus what you actually support. There's a reason you get called out on it so often in this sub. People generally aren't dumb enough to fall for sock puppet accounts.

       No. I don't believe something because one guy said so with no documentation or evidence in a highly politicized environment where there's motive to do so. Just because you suck it up and then drop it as a talking point all over this sub, doesn't mean anyone is going to believe it. You're transparent as freshly polished glass, bud.

       I think you're lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Papadopulous lied about 'having contact with Russia' because they 'had emails damaging to Clinton'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which emails are these? DNC emails? Podesta Emails? The Clinton Cables from the previous year? Her 33,000 emails she deleted? Any of the other Classified emails she kept on her server? There's not just 1 set of emails damaging to her...
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to point out, your basis for 'Russia hacked the DNC' is because of some Russian characters in Meta data. What was also in the metadata is that the DNC files were downloaded at a rate that exceeds US Internet speeds, but is standard for something like... a USB file transfer. Which means that the files were stolen locally. Possibly by a staffer (like Seth Rich). Keep clinging to that 'we were hacked!' lie though. Which by the way, if they were hacked, why won't the DNC turn over their servers to be investigated? It might help them catch whoever 'hacked' them.

       The Clinton Cables are from 2010 so that's not even relevant to this. I guess your theory is both Seth and Russia hacked the democrats then. Seth got the DNC emails somehow and Russia hacked Podesta. That's your theory then?

       No... you claimed that Seth Rich wasn't a leaker and was now irreverent because Papa knew Russians had 'damaging emails'. I'm saying how do you know which emails they were? And how do you know Seth Rich didn't take and leak the DNCs emails?

       This is pointless dude if you want to believe some random kid who was about to work for Hillary before he died is the source that's fine. I can't prove your dad or your cousins roommate didn't hack the DNC because you can't prove something like that. Just like I can't prove big door doesn't exist. But we know that Russia had those emails and gave them to wikileaks. We also know that Wikileaks adamantly denied Russia gave them anything. Which means they are liars. So if you want believe them then fine. I guess Seth Rich and Russia teamed up to work for Trump.

       It doesn't matter. You guys just keep changing the theory every 10 minutes so you can keep the original narrative. Let's just pretend Seth Rich and Russia teamed up to work for Trump. That's the theory you can go with.

      <p>
       You're the one making the claim. The burden of evidence is on you. And since you "cant 100% prove Seth Rich didn't hack the DNC", your point is moot. Seth Rich leaking the DNC emails is still in the realm of possibilities, Papas testimony does not rule him out.

       &lt;The documents suggest that foreign nationals with ties to the Russian government were seeking to establish a relationship with at least one campaign official, offering "dirt" on Hillary Clinton. And the documents outline how Papadopoulos, when questioned about those associations, lied.&gt;
Would you please admit that the russian could hand over any kind of dirt?

       I didn't read any email from Link.
And also I was just reading that he lied about meeting.

       I also think his position is not the best.

      <p>
       There is also the possibility that he exaggerates.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Muller has something tangible against 
Trum, let him close the investigation and 
hand over the case to Parliament.
It's that simple

       He lied about having contact w Russia. That's a huge step away from knowing Russia stole DNC emails.

       How do you even know that the "emails damaging to Clinton" we're the DNC emails? How do you know they weren't the Podesta emails? They could have even been the old Clinton cables that were released the year prior

       That's from the NY Times lame attempt to retcon timelines. Papadapolous wasn't even on the FBI radar until Jan of 2017, after the dossier dropped.

       Just because Papa wasn't mentioned in the joint analysis report doesn't mean he wasn't on their radar. Why the hell would they mention him before handing out an indictment? It was,and still is, an ongoing investigation. If they were hoping they could use Papa to take down others in the campaign, they aren't going to out him right when the investigation takes off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this right wing website is desperately hoping that the FBI wants aware of Papa and started the investigation for other reasons. It definitely doesn't prove that though.

       It doesn't make an anon sourced report by the NY Times about the rumors of some unnamed and confirmed Australian diplomat legit either. How many of these bullshit stories have been walked back? This one will be too, because it is full of fucking holes in terms of the already established timeline.

       Gotta love the irony. Four people in Trumps campaign have gone down on federal charges. Two have plead guilty. More keeps coming out with every passing month. But of course, the people who have been right about all this shit for a year are the true dummies. The stuoid ads liberals falling for fake news. How many more people on Trumps staff have to lie to the FBI and go down on federal charges before you guys believe there might be something to all this?

       They are either going down for crimes not related to Trump or process crimes. It's obvious from the deals made that Mueller doesn't have anything from Flynn or Papadapolous to touch Trump in any meaningful way.

The indictment may or may not prove that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government, but it has already proved how flawed the foreign lobbying rules have always been and how easily they are flouted.

       People it's not always all partisan, I was impressed by the execution of this troll,.
Of course, the press even thought that Aasange wanted to become an ambassador, which is incredibly funny in my eyes.

       Instead of 4D chess, he could really troll the media by coming out and officially stating "Seth Rich was the leaker".
      </p>
      <p>
       The supposed "rule against naming sources" wasn't handed down to Moses. It's Assange's rule, there's no reason he needs to follow the letter of the law while ignoring the spirit of it. It's obvious that he wants people to think it was Rich, so he ain't protecting the identity of the source. He's just refusing to go on record while hiding behind a rule he created and could violate without consequence.

       I don't think I'm following your meaning. That sounds like you're suggesting that maybe Rich wasn't the leaker, but Assange is hinting towards him to conceal the true source. That's my view, but based on this post I'm guessing you mean something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       By what mechanism would an additional person be endangered by him saying "the leaker was Seth Rich" as opposed to the current situation where it's obvious to everyone that he's encouraging the belief that it's Rich? His friends and family don't become any more of a target than they already are in that situation.

       For example: 
He stole the data and passed it on through a trusted intermediary.
Kim Dotcom comes to mind

       Or a second person was involved in this

I don't know but the possibility exists.

       There would be consequences though. If someone who was thinking about leaking thought, "Hm. He released one name.... If I give him something so good that it makes news is he going to release my name? Maybe people won't believe my leak if my name isn't released."  etc.

       I'm not gonna claim I know who the source is. It's possible Assange received the information anonymously and doesn't even know. I've just always thought his behavior on this makes a lot more sense if he has no evidence of Rich being the source, but wants to encourage the belief for other reasons.

       I agree. Given the circumstance that Rich is dead and possibly gave his life to ensure that there was a fair and democratic process, Assange should reassess his rule. Especially now that we have the MSM trying to impeach an elected president with the Russia collusion story.

       Yeah takes about an IQ of 80 to work out that how stupid it would be for future sources if JA named Rich as the leaker.
