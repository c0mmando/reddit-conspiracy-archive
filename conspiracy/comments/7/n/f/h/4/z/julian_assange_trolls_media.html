<p>Pretty convincing.
I think I got trolled by a tech magician trick I didn&#39;t consider.</p>

<p>I could think of a scenario that would involve a switcharoo.</p>

<p>For example: plausible deniability, but this is such a big leap that it can no longer be defended.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware that the reality to which that happens is significantly less than the efforts of people that use it as a boogeyman, to discount the thoughts and ideas of those they disagree with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very honest about my own beliefs. I don&#39;t make believe like I&#39;m a progressive, and then do nothing but defend Trump and attack the left.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re lying.</p>

<p>Papadopulous lied about &#39;having contact with Russia&#39; because they &#39;had emails damaging to Clinton&#39;.</p>

<p>Which emails are these? DNC emails? Podesta Emails? The Clinton Cables from the previous year? Her 33,000 emails she deleted? Any of the other Classified emails she kept on her server? There&#39;s not just 1 set of emails damaging to her...</p>

<p>I also want to point out, your basis for &#39;Russia hacked the DNC&#39; is because of some Russian characters in Meta data. What was also in the metadata is that the DNC files were downloaded at a rate that exceeds US Internet speeds, but is standard for something like... a USB file transfer. Which means that the files were stolen locally. Possibly by a staffer (like Seth Rich). Keep clinging to that &#39;we were hacked!&#39; lie though. Which by the way, if they were hacked, why won&#39;t the DNC turn over their servers to be investigated? It might help them catch whoever &#39;hacked&#39; them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one making the claim. The burden of evidence is on you. And since you &quot;cant 100% prove Seth Rich didn&#39;t hack the DNC&quot;, your point is moot. Seth Rich leaking the DNC emails is still in the realm of possibilities, Papas testimony does not rule him out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&lt;The documents suggest that foreign nationals with ties to the Russian government were seeking to establish a relationship with at least one campaign official, offering &quot;dirt&quot; on Hillary Clinton.

Would you please admit that the russian could hand over any kind of dirt?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t read any email from Link.
And also I was just reading that he lied about meeting.</p>

<p>I also think his position is not the best.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility that he exaggerates.</p>

<p>If Muller has something tangible against 
Trum, let him close the investigation and 
hand over the case to Parliament.

<p>Next time use a source that doesn&#39;t rely on anonymous intelligence and high-ranking official sources for the core of the story. That&#39;s how you &quot;mistakenly&quot; invade Iraq, fyi, among other side effects.</p>

<p>No one, really, has mentioned this fact.

<p>People it&#39;s not always all partisan, I was impressed by the execution of this troll,.
Of course, the press even thought that Aasange wanted to become an ambassador, which is incredibly funny in my eyes.</p>

<p>The supposed &quot;rule against naming sources&quot; wasn&#39;t handed down to Moses. It&#39;s Assange&#39;s rule, there&#39;s no reason he needs to follow the letter of the law while ignoring the spirit of it. It&#39;s obvious that he wants people to think it was Rich, so he ain&#39;t protecting the identity of the source. He&#39;s just refusing to go on record while hiding behind a rule he created and could violate without consequence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m following your meaning. That sounds like you&#39;re suggesting that maybe Rich wasn&#39;t the leaker, but Assange is hinting towards him to conceal the true source. That&#39;s my view, but based on this post I&#39;m guessing you mean something else.</p>

<p>By what mechanism would an additional person be endangered by him saying &quot;the leaker was Seth Rich&quot; as opposed to the current situation where it&#39;s obvious to everyone that he&#39;s encouraging the belief that it&#39;s Rich? His friends and family don&#39;t become any more of a target than they already are in that situation.</p>

<p>There would be consequences though. If someone who was thinking about leaking thought, &quot;Hm. He released one name.... If I give him something so good that it makes news is he going to release my name? Maybe people won&#39;t believe my leak if my name isn&#39;t released.&quot;  etc.</p>
