       I was really hoping that questions for the Sandy Hook narrative would be re-opened upon the ousting of Obama's DOJ.  Unfortunately, as I think many of us suspected, both sides are in bed with the same financiers.  We'll never get the true story of Sandy Hook.  Not in our lifetime anyways, and I think it's reasonable to assume any evidence is long gone.

And by “better”, I do not mean less obvious, I just mean more smoke-screens and misdirecting layers of deception. They now make us chase our tails into the dirt.

       Take Las Vegas for example. There are many theories that floated around about arms deals gone wrong, Saudi involvement, multiple shooters, etc., and so many of the "victims" have long stories about them with a lot of detail, but it's all fabricated to distract from the fact that the shooting was not a shooting at all but a mass media staged event.

       So in other words, no matter what happens, no matter who does the shooting, no matter how incriminating it is showing that someone just went ape shit, it's all just "smoke screens and misdirecting layers of deception they're getting better at"

       Two different shirts in those pics. Almost like little kids can dress and look kinda the same. And that’s literally the only instance of supporting evidence I see,  no other kids are dressed similar. Not saying SH is a hoax or that isnt, just your point in particular is weak bullshit and you should never use it as evidence of anything again.

       Your entire conspiracy relies on you completely ignoring the fact she was shot with the same gun he took with him to the school, and drove there in her car, and shot them with the mother's guns.

       The bullet found inside the mother's body came from the same gun that was found in the school. The same school Adam drove to in her car. The same school Adam shot up with more of her guns. The same guns Adam used to shoot himself in the head.

       Again, besides Adam killing his mother with her own gun, taking the rest of her guns and driving her car to the school, shoots kids with her guns and then shoots himself in the head. Nope. No evidence

       Her car drove itself to that exact same school where her son just happened to shoot himself in the head with her gun while at the same time a school shooting happened. Oh and a bunch of kids were randomly shot with her guns. No proof

       These questions made me laugh. You really thought they were cleverly asked questions and totally the same thing. Haha. At least put
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       thought into the questions you ask.

        oh i get it. he's not entitled to a fair trial because he has autism, and that alone is proof of guilt.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pipe down kid. You're getting way ahead of yourself. No one was talking about autism, nothing was suggested, implied or insinuated that autism had to do with anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do note how you brought it up on your own and then immediately declared
       <em>
        that's the proof
       </em>
       of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       His dead mother? Nah. Her car being driven to the school filled with guns? Nah. The dead mother's guns being found on the body of her son? Nah. Her son shooting himself in the head at the school with her gun? Nah. All the kids being shot with bullets fired from the dead mother's guns? Nah. It's all just because he has autism obviously!
      </p>
      <p>
       You asking the What Ifs thinking it makes sense and "just cuz a crime happened doesn't mean the defendant did it" just showed me you're one of those people who form talking points around phrases you think sound "smart". That's what I get from you, sorry. Just being real kid.

       I'm sorry but that simply isn't true. Lanza's mother was shot with a .22 caliber rifle. That gun was not taken to, or found at, the school.

      <p>
       Furthermore the released search warrants explicitly state that while Mrs. Lanza was allegedly shot 4 times they found one spent .22 shell casing and 3 live rounds in the rifle.

       Yes. It was left at home. You're correct. He left all the bolt action rifles at the home while her other weapons, semi automatics, where found at the school.

      <p>
       Cool. Progress. Next is the weapons that were found at the school, notably the Bushmaster, and the Saiga left in the car.

       So kinda like you leaving out the part they found all the spent shell casings? I understand this is an emotional topic, unless you've actually read through the report, which says they found all the spent casings that you left out, or have read commentary from someone who has, you really don't know what the official truth is.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to bet you're just regurgitating whatever commentary you watched about the shooting. That explains why you left out the spent shell casings trying to push the conspiracy they were never found, suggesting the "ridiculous and contradictory" of only having 1 spent shell casing when she was "allegedly" shot 4 times and having 3 live rounds.

       I specifically stated that in the released WARRANTS they note finding 1 spent shell casing and 3 live rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alleged finding of the other 3 spent shell casings comes later in the report. It is NOT noted in the warrants.

       You can be as condescending as you like but it doesn't make you right.

       Furthermore…if you have such an astute working knowledge of the report how didn't you know the .22 didn't go to the school?

       Watching the people there milling about and walking in a circle into and out of the firehouse always struck me as weird as hell. Also, the mold all over the school and the broken boiler. Kids are going to school in winter at a school with no heating? Yeeeeah right.

       I don't think it had anything to do with guns. I think it was about money laundering for various off-the-books defense contracting projects. I read a post elsewhere basically stating that Newtown is a company town for GE higher ups. So it goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to pay execs, r&amp;d people, etc., for various off-the-books projects. You can't do it openly because you are the government. You can't reveal the secret projects. You stage an event. Suddenly, "donations" pour in from all over. Bam, money laundered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the hell did a well-to-do CT town need millions of dollars in donations? Funeral costs?

       I doubt any if the sandy hook deniers would have the balls to say it to the face of parents of an murdered child. Not shocked that trump supporters tend to believe this shit given that they've been proven time and time again to be the dumbest group of people possible.
