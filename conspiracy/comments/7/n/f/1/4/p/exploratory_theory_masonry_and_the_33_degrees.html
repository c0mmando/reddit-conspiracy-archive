        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>so full disclosure, the though just occured to me after a 12 hour night shift and a glass of whiskey (happy new year!) </p>

<p>i was watching this (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztninkgZ0ws">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztninkgZ0ws</a>) and when he was talking about the procession of the equinoxes and the axial tilt it just sort of leapt out at me.</p>

<p>what if the 33 degrees, is a reference to the axial tilt?</p>

<p>a 33 degree shift would be absolutely crazy in terms of its effects on the planet and i think there could be something to it. what if this &quot;ancient knowledge&quot; is a &quot;prophecy&quot; of sorts, knowing the math to know that something like that was coming?</p>

<p>again this just dawned on me, and i plan to float it to a few freemasons i know and guage their reactions to it, but i thought id throw it to the wolves and see what peoples thoughts on the idea were.</p>

<p>i haven&#39;t taken to deep a look in to the feasibility, past studies or anything else as of yet. i expect ill be up for a few more hours doing exactly that.</p>

<p>it just struck me as something that given my knowledge of them and other secret societies it seemed like the sort of plain sight kind of thing they would be in to.</p>

<p>thoughts? theories? debunking? things i should look further in to?</p>

<p>i think my first stop after i finish the video is the book of enoch. this would be the sort of knowledge a visiting diety/alien visitor would impart that would carry the significance to survive this long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So honestly I only seen a few sites that have give an idea of earths atmosphere at around 35°. </p>

<ol>
<li>I’m unsure why they chose 35° but they do bring up that it takes around 40,000 years &amp; our earths planetary axial changes are between 22.1°-24.5°. Currently we are at 23.5°. </li>
<li>Most of these sites can only hypothesize that the seasons could be altered, with a sprinkle of extreme climate temperatures that we’ve yet to physically record on an immense scale.</li>
<li>My counter idea is that if you believe the idea that earth was altered/created for human life to exist on it by an higher intelligence ie aliens or something like that. Then the axial rotation could have been adjusted to sustain our life forms, FROM 33°. Or something from that variant. Also opposition from that idea is that if some group or alien life form wanted to exterminate us they could change the axis to 33°. </li>
</ol>

<p>Honestly I can’t poke holes in the theory &amp; I hate when people don’t give it a good thought into, what I think you did was spark my interest in finding out if the 33rd degree masons has a more nefarious meaning. Lots of these symbols &amp; sketchy things with these secrets societies tend to just “hide in plain sight”. Definitely something I want to research more. From here this is all I have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so i spoke to him, and he confirmed i am on to something. he wasnt sure if it was a reference to the past, or a warning for the future.</p>

<p>more tilt would mean more variance, and with how much &quot;cold&quot; land their is in the north versus the &quot;warm+&quot; water of the south it would likely lead to glaciers creeping south and a potential ice age.</p>

<p>hes not a sciencey guy terminology wise but he mentioned the sun and magnetic fields possibly causing a shift or weakening of fields.</p>

<p>he put me on to a few crumbs, and its hard to tell when he is feeding me b.s or being truthful sometimes. </p>

<p>he pointed to the two headed eagle, and said it wasnt an eagle, it was a two headed phoenix and that was very significant where ever it was shown and &quot;might just possibly be linked in a bunch of ways&quot;</p>

<p>for the last few years we&#39;ve talked extensively about how this is not the first trip around the block so to speak and that we (as in humans or at least humanoids) are a whole lot older than is considered by the mainstream.</p>

<p>the idea of the precursor races of man seems to be a pretty integral part of their mythos and it all seems to link back to their core purpose of keeping that information alive in some form.</p>

<p>now as for the god, aliens, etc involvement i mean its possible. personally i think its a fragment of knowledge from the far distant past of something that did happen, naturally or otherwise.</p>

<p>in the span of the universe anything is possible, a billion years from now, what ever we are by then, we would create planets and try to create life. that is something we can all probably agree with, who is to say something out there isn&#39;t 4-6 billion years ahead of us on that journey.</p>

<p>Im a proud pastafarian minister myself.</p>

<p>the problem i have with the religious researchers isnt their facts, it always comes down to how they interpret them. i&#39;ve dubbed it the &quot;ancient aliens&quot; dilemma. i love that show because it does expose you to some facts, and some really interesting sites, but the &quot;it must be aliens&quot;  conclusions are a little irritating.</p>

<p>i find the same sort of issue with these guys, i feel those sort of cemented beliefs lead to viewing the whole world through a distorted lens which makes some of the assumptions they leap to fall apart under scrutiny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting i hadnt made that connection, and it does make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>the focus with the freemasons on math, geometry and the solar/lunar cycles is what got the gears turning. sadly i actually let the mason i know borrow my copy of the book of enoch.</p>

<p>im going to test his reaction to the question next week when i see him. hes pretty deep in to it, and we talk about this sort of stuff a lot. he wont outright tell me when ive hit on something but i usually get some raised eyebrows and hints</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard from Mark Passio that 33degrees symbolizes the change from &quot;un-enlightened&quot; to &quot;enlightened&quot; by comparing it to the transition of frozen water to flowing water. Ice represents the confounds and rigidity of a mind ignorant of truth and possibility, stuck in its box. At 33 degrees the mind has attained truth and is not imprisoned by its structure any longer.</p>

<p>He explains it better than I do- you can prob search his name and the term 33 in YT and find it pretty easy. Although I don&#39;t doubt the freemasons would have many symbolic angles and meanings to its terms and rituals, this is possibly only one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i can&#39;t say i agree with you. i see the angle but the freemasons that i know are all super anti-israeli and would nope the fuck out if there was even a hint of it at any level they were aware of (which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it doesn&#39;t exist)</p>

<p>from my observance there isnt really so much of a direct hierarchy outside of a lodge, which would at least in my understanding make that sort of control very difficult to actually wield in any meaningful or effective way.</p>

<p>also iirc the 6 sided star actually predated Judaism coming from Hinduism. </p>

<p>a link to Hinduism directly makes a lot more sense given a lot of the other symbolism that ties in to masonry as well.</p>

im interested in how deep in to the esoteric side of things you&#39;ve personally gone, i know a lot of guys are just there for the friend group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very interested in the Esoteric side and its very similar to life as far as some people can come their for the militaristic side of it (we practice rituals where hand placement, number of steps, correct posture, what side the staff is on), is extremely important.  Or you can be interested in the philosophy of it all and have endless resources depending on where you are located.  I happen to live in a state where they do not allow black people to join, therefore i associate with other lodges but not the one i was raised in.  I am proud of my work in Masonry though, and ill answer any question i can to that effect.  I would encourage you to ask a Mason about joining to see for yourself, its not as hard as it seems from the internet.  Although i hear places like D.C. and New York it is harder..  The nefarious things you read on the internet have to do with people in lodges, not Masonry itself.  It is serious business though, not light hearted amusement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is exactly what made me consider the 33 degrees potentially being linked to the tilt in some way.</p>

<p>either it was 33 degrees at some time in the past, or the possible foreknowledge of an event that might shift it to 33 in the future.</p>

<p>im grasping so far but if say something like a nibiru-like event or the 7 burning stars myths happened in the past, why such a dire need to keep that knowledge and for it to generally be considered esoteric. what if knowledge of that past event also points to a future one (ie some orbit, be it a comet, asteroid, planet etc.) and that 33 might be some how linked to that future event.</p>

<p>i dont know, i feel like i might be going full eddie bravo, but it seemed like an interesting thought that just jumped out at me.</p>

<p>theres a lot of stuff to go through that people have already thrown at me so far which is awesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are hundreds, maybe thousands of degrees in Freemasonry. Many are jurisdictional variations (like the Northern and Southern US jurisdictions of the Scottish Rite in the US which each have 29 degrees, but they are not the same). Many more are obsolete or rarely conferred. But even just in the generally available degrees in my jurisdiction, I&#39;ve been through over 40 degrees, personally.</p>

<p>The idea that there are 33 degrees comes from a misunderstanding of one side-group and its numbering of its own degrees, and the fact that they have an honorary degree called the 33rd.</p>
