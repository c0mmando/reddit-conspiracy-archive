    <div class="md"><p>This article argues that America’s Deep State (the military industrial complex) fomented the Cold War because of its desire for conquest...it wasn&#39;t about ideology. </p>

<p>America&#39;s embrace of &quot;ex&quot;-Nazis in Operation Paperclip is an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After World War II, the top level of the US power-structure became increasingly taken over by the military-industrial complex, America’s Deep State, so that increasingly the US Government is in a condition of “perpetual war for perpetual peace” — a warfare state and economy: fascism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a recent data dump (on December 10th): </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...the biggest swindle that occurred in the 20th Century (or perhaps ever) is now proven as a historical fact; and this swindle was done by the US Government, against the Government and people of Russia, and it continues today and keeps getting worse under every US President.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the author doesn&#39;t mention is perhaps one of the most important aspects of the 9/11 conspiracy, and one that is seldom, if ever, discussed in the 9/11 research community:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The attacks were intended to cover-up the clearing of $240 billion dollars in securities covertly created in September 1991 to fund a covert economic war against the Soviet Union, during which &#39;unknown&#39; western investors bought up much of the Soviet industry, with a focus on oil and gas.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more information, I can&#39;t recommend enough the following meticulous research by E.P. Heidner:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/911/black_eagle_trust_fund">Collateral Damage: U.S. Covert Operations and the Terrorist Attacks on 9/11</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, the US Deep State has been waging economic war against Russia, and 9/11 was an integral event in obfuscating this history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was because of our Council of Foreign Relations that communism had even a chance to take hold. They helped Mao rise to power in China, funded Stalin with weapons, tanks, munitions, and the like in addition to allowing him access to Korea. </p>

<p>It was our Council on Foreign Relations that led to the Vietnam War and its <em>deliberate</em> mismanagement. Communism was the global boogeyman that they manufactured to push America and Europe into a binding alliance, a step forward towards their New World Order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who ever thought it was about ideology and not rich capitalists being scared shirtless about citizens organizing and taking their power away is a fucking maroon who has bought into sixty some odd years of American propaganda hook line and sinker.  Communism was just one more turf war between the rich and greedy versus the poor and weak.</p>
