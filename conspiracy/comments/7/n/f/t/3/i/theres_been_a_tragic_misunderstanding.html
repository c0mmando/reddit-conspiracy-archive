        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many of you, and many people in the postmodern movement, seem to believe fervently in the lack of an objective morality. You say “believing in good and evil will stop you from evolving” “believing in good and evil is what caused all the suffering”</p>

<p>You are tragically mistaken. </p>

<p>Most things are grey. Some things aren’t. Handing a cigarette to lonely homeless man and could be seen as a kindness, but then again you’re hurting him. </p>

<p>There is objective good. It has to do with your <em>intention</em></p>

<p>Why why would you be here trying to fight against conspiracies? If conspiracies are not wicked then why bother? </p>

<p>Because your heart knows that there is great wrongs being committed against your fellow man so you take action, only you have been misled into thinking that you’re doing it for some selfish reason, or perhaps you are just selfish. </p>

<p>I’m not going to sit here and pass out edicts, as if I know for sure <em>what is good and what is evil</em> but I can with certainty say that killing a child is wrong. </p>

<p>Show me a culture in history where murder was legal. Just murdering and innocent child in the street. That culture died out! Not because they killed all the children but because the people in that culture who would have lived saw how disgusting and vile it must have been and destroyed it from the inside out!</p>

<p>So God would <em>know</em> the actual intention for every deed that is carried out; indeed you would be judged on your actual intentions (rather than claimed ones).</p>

<p>As in, people who do evil things tend to <em>claim</em> good intentions (or even delude themselves into believing that’s why they’re acting). They may fool humans (and thus the problem you cite only exists in the terrestrial realm), but can’t fool God (by definition).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that saying is meant to be taken literally.</p>

<p>Does anyone know who wrote it originally and what the context was? I never took &quot;hell&quot; literally when hearing it. I always assumed it meant something like &quot;hell on earth&quot; or &quot;hard times, not literal hell fire with the devil and all that. For example, someone steps into traffic to save a baby and gets run over. If that person lives, they might be paralyzed and now there life sucks, that could be called &quot;Hell on Earth.&quot; If rather than just being paralyzed they die though, they actually go to heaven. Doesnt matter either way if the person claims their intent first and I don&#39;t think the saying works at all if you take it literally.</p>

<p>Moral relativism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly enough, if you really dig into the esotericism of a lot of religions, and study NDE&#39;s (Near Death Experiences) they say the Soul/Light/Heart has universal Morals such as Love, truth, equality, sharing, humanity, helping others, etc, but that the West became to Logic Heavy and Brain based, and is hence disconnected from the heart.</p>

<p>On the other hand, societies too Heart based, lacked the logical growth/ability that has kept them as 3rd world disconnected/backwards(in some aspects) societies.</p>

<p>I think there needs to be an important balance </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good and evil are arbitrary concepts conceived out of social self-interest and exist only within the confines of our subjective human experience. Whether or not an action benefits society is irrelevant to that point. In fact, it could be argued that since humanity is detrimental to nature, its destruction would be morally good. Remember that the natural state of the universe is chaos, and there no true choices, only the illusion of choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My contribution is perhaps a bit pedantic and irrelevant, but from a scientifical point of view, it could in fact be argued that the universe&#39;s natural state is that of maximum entropy, which would imply the opposite of chaos.</p>
