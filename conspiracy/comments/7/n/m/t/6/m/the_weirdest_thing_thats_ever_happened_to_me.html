      <p>
       Last year something unbelievable happened. I [20M] was in the passenger seat of a car being driven by a girl [19F] who I was talking to at the time. My best friend [18M] was in the back seat, right behind me. We were driving around the local blunt roads, but little did we know that a very sketchy incident was to come our way. As we're driving through an intersection, me and my best friend look to our right to see a large 2017 Chevy Silverado flying towards us. In this moment, everything felt slow motion. Me and my friend look at each other with fear (and acceptance), and basically just braced for impact. The weird thing is, the truck driver seemed to speed up as he got closer to us. It would have been a perfect T-bone, but luckily, the girl driving us floored it at the last second. Me and my friend would have both been dead.  The truck was going about 40-50 mph, and slammed into the back-passenger side of the car where the rear wheel was. We spun out a few times and ended up about 25 meters up the road. The impact was unreal. But this is where the story starts to get sketchy. As soon as I got out of the car to go check on the truck driver, there was already a crowd of people standing around the truck. At least 10-15 people. Where these people came from.. I don't know. There were no cars around, and only a couple houses close by. I hid all the weed, and as soon as I was about to make my way towards the truck, a man from the crowd runs up to me. He said something along the lines of "he's hurt,he's hurt!". This made absolutely no sense to me, considering the truck hit US, and appeared to have no damage. Mind you, we were driving a tiny little Hyundai, so why wasn't there a bunch of people checking up on us? When I get to the crowd, I start to ask people if he's okay. But no one will even look at me. Weird, huh? I raised my voice since no one would answer, and finally, a man says to me very rudely "NO, HE'S NOT OKAY!" Another woman said "He hit his head really hard". This frightened me, but then I looked in the truck to see a middle aged man putting on the worst act I have ever seen. Worse than any reality TV show. He was bobbing his head around trying to look dizzy, and he was pretending he could barely breathe.  It was comical to me and I didn't understand how people were even taking him seriously. I was so confused. At this point, my girl and my friend were still at the Hyundai, trying to relax and get their blood pressure back to where it should be. I went up to them and told them that nothing was making sense. A few minutes later, some cops and an ambulance showed up. As the cops were getting information from us, I look down the road to see the ambulance drive away.... without the "injured" man. The motherfucker then drives off like nothing even happened, and all the people vanished (I have no clue where they went). The cops left soon after and we were alone once again, confused and angered about the situation.  We had so many questions, but no one could answer them. Was someone trying to kill us? Where the hell did the people come from? Why did no one check on us? Why did they let the guy who apparently couldn't see or breathe drive away? To this day, me and my friend still wonder. We've weighed out all the possibilities, but it remains a mystery.

       That's extremely odd.  Was there no accident report from the cops?  no names or insurance information provided to you?  Was the man charged with anything?  Who was at fault?
       <br/>
       So many questions, is there any answers?  As for all of the people that just showed up and disappeared, they are probable witnesses.  If there's no accident report etc and you have visible damage you should definitely contact a lawyer if this guy wasn't charged.   Maybe you suffered a concussion and some of your memory isn't accurate.   I really don't know.

       There was an accident report. No names or insurance since it wasn't my car. However, the girl driving never even talked to the guy in the truck. He was at fault I guess.

       Sounds like you might have been a little disoriented and concussed and that’s where the confusion could have been? Still weird no one thought to help you out for sure though.

       Just as anther reader, weed doesn't make people actually hallucinate. You get stoned and sort of tired and/or everything seems less boring and more interesting but it is a great misunderstanding that you see stuff that's not there when you are stoned.

       Nobody laces weed. Weed is the cheapest drug, by far. No drug dealer ever has thought “im going to put 60$ worth of cocaine on this bag of weed that this kid is paying 10$ for” it just doesn’t make any sense.

       Hey man no need to be disrespectful. That’s just a common myth that some people still believe. Weed DOES NOT GET LACED ON ACCIDENT/SECRETLY. i just like to clear that up when i can. its a very popular misconception.

       We need to direct our frustration into energy to be productive in fighting the wrongs in our society. 
i hope you have a happy new year.

       Satanist do rituals that include car "accidents", it's like a sacrifice or initiation, or somesuch shit. Would explain why a group of people would be near by, and as for the cop...if there is no report, than he was in on it in some way.

       I take back the Satanist nametag, let's face it there are a blend of bizarre reasons and Entities that a ritual seeking group would pull.
Could be a plain old hit job, too...but the attention on the driver and overly emotional response: "He's Hurt", suggests attachment to 
"Him". 
There is also a technique known as a School Play scenarios, which is exactly as it sounds
(poor acting) that covers hits as well.
When Sociopaths release their Psychos onto people, they often must accompany there feral human...to keep it "listening" and fixating.
Don't Panic
Psychotics aren't ever as killy as Sociopaths would like!

       Are you telling me no police report or insurance claim was made? How did your friend get a new car?
      </p>
      <p>
       My first instinct is to say your memory of the event is wrong since you were just in a car crash and would be very disoriented and confused, but the car was wrecked right? So what happened to it and the insurance claim?

       that's what I was thinking..perhaps the man recruited his friends to be there so he could wreck his truck for an insurance claim and have witnesses.

       This belongs to r/nosleep and you gotta decide if your friend was behind you in the car, or you two looked at each other at the moment of impact. 'Cause it can't be both.

       Maybe he realized the accident was his own fault and divided not to escalate the situation. The people though, not really sure.  Maybe there was a car full of people and they just pulled up to the closest car involved in the accident.
