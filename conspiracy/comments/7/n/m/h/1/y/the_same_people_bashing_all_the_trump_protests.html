<p>While you&#39;re at it you could look at what happened during the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-24/why-obama-let-iran-s-green-revolution-fail">&#39;09 Green Revolution</a>, the last time the Iranian people tried this; Obama completely ignored it, ignored them asking for help, and let it fail so he could do his shitty nuclear deal with Iran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you understand how oppressive that government is? I don&#39;t want a war with them, BUT, out of all the ones we&#39;ve been in for the past 20 years I would be ok if our hand was forced. For one thing, it&#39;s our fault that country is like that in the first place, we owe those people; another thing is that I feel of all the Middle Eastern countries, I feel Iranians would be the most capable of taking over the operations of their country and not have it turn into a power vacuum. You have to remember, just 39 years ago their country was extremely similar to ours. They&#39;re Shia Muslim, and Persian rather than Arab, so with a longer, richer, and more civilized history than say, the Saudis, who started out as basically Bedouins; their terrorists (Hezbollah) are mainly for attacking Sunnis rather than Western targets. In fact, grab a random person in Iran and tell them you&#39;re American and they&#39;ll lose their shit, they love us and everything USA.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;d like to help them because it&#39;s the right thing to do, we&#39;re kind of obligated especially after what we did last time. I also think they could be our best or 2nd best ally in the region with the Ayatollah out of power, after Israel, way better than the KSA.</p>

<p>If it needs to be a war, I&#39;d prefer to avoid it but it wouldn&#39;t be a very big deal; we could probably just throw Israel and KSA at them and stay out of it ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the major Trump protests have organizations funding and organizing them where you can trace the origins and backers. It realy isnt a conspiracy when there is receipts. The Iranian protests are what many have been waiting to see, the young generation pushing back against the government that has been stifling them. Now I am not sure how organic the protests are but that is the general consensus on why they support it. </p>

USA has every right to restrict travelers from that country. </p>

<p>USA also has every right to encourage the Iranian people to free themselves from their brutal ruling regime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck anyone who doesn’t support the protests in Iran. If you seriously believe the people of Iran don’t want change, don’t want any international attention and don’t want help, you have been manipulated. </p>

<p>They would never ask for help, but if they are given some as well as solidarity they will never refuse. Support the people. I don’t know what OP’s motivation is for trying to get people to undermine these protests or ignore them, but it isn’t in line with what the people of Iran themselves want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible to both A) support the Iranian people and their right to political protest against their oppressive government and B) to oppose imperialist interventionism and be suspicious of CIA-related fuckery like they&#39;ve used to enact regime change in Iran in the past. The US government has been telegraphing intent to act against Iran for quite some time. You&#39;d have to be pretty naive to believe they have no hand in what&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a pretty nuanced view on this. Hopeful for the people of Iran, but suspicious of US neocons, especially since I know they don&#39;t actually give two shits about the people of Iran.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside forces are attempting to manufacture a fake civil war like they did in Libya and Syria. You can be in favor of free association and democracy without supporting foreign influences attempting to undermine a local population&#39;s democracy. Imagine if a foreign influence was funding a similar artificial &quot;movement&quot; in the USA. Would you support that bullshit? Because that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking us to do. Support outside influences who are attempting to undermine local democracy. That&#39;s bullshit. </p>
