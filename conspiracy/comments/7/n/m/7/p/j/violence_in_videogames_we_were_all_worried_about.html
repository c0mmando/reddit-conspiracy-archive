The bombarding of violent and disturbing imagery to frankly, lots of children who are way too young <em>lets say millions in the US alone</em>, might not make them grow up to be killers...

<p>I suppose we&#39;re all good here. We&#39;re both right.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about #1 though. Lack of feeling or emotion set on by emotional desensitizing towards death and injury through repeated and physically unalarming (no danger to the exposed) exposure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been wondering recently if these first person shooters i grew up with, where Russia is the antagonist, are part of desensitizing empathy to Russia. The last game I can think of where Russia wasnt the bad guy was Call of Duty World at War
Edit: and I guess Battlefield 1</p>

<p>Video games have to be a tool to the government. There&#39;s no way it isnt. It&#39;s too good of an opportunity to get into a younger person&#39;s head. </p>

<p>I have sunk hundreds of hours into battlefield though and it&#39;s easily argued that those hours could have been better spent someplace else.. who knows haha video games are fairly new they may cause brain cancer for all I know.  Battlefield awesome though I definitely agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make an interesting point. In all of the years we&#39;ve been bombarded by &quot;x will make you y&quot;, I&#39;ve never considered a possible ulterior motive for the apathy. I&#39;ve always had the knee jerk reaction that it doesn&#39;t make you violent. </p>

<p>Do I think there is a possibility? Sure. I don&#39;t know if it can be proven, but the potential for manipulation would be there, and I wouldn&#39;t limit to just video games. News agencies blast out graphic, violent, images all of the time. TV is inundated with it every day in movies and shows. You can brutally murder a guy and it&#39;s fine, as long as you don&#39;t say, &quot;Fuck&quot;. </p>

<p>From personal experience as a Gen Xer, I&#39;ve been around violent images most of my life. I grew up during the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s slasher films. I was old enough to comprehend the realities of Daddy Bush&#39;s war, and the first gen violent video games, like Mortal Kombat. By the time I had hit my 30&#39;s, apathy had set in. I&#39;ve seen people cut open and die IRL, and it&#39;s almost a clinical mindset, with no emotions. Very few things trigger a response to violence anymore, except innocent people (mostly women and kids), so I do have some humanity left.</p>

<p>If there is an agenda of a mass media push to desensatize people to become passive to horrific acts by tptb, it&#39;s working. Very few even bat an eye over drone strikes blowing up hospitals and schools, or sanctions that starve populations. By becoming comfortably numb, even warfare in general has become passe. People are more upset over the costs, the taxes, and the fact that we&#39;re meddling, than the loss of life and mutilations. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Playing Devil&#39;s Advocate, using the concept as a means to nudge populations in certain directions, does make sense to me. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there is a CIA &#39;study&#39; of it buried somewhere. I&#39;d dig around, but I&#39;ve become too apathetic to bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im a huge gamer, love ripping a newone to folk who casually say &quot;russia haxed the election bru, its basically WWIII, have you NOT being paying attention?&quot;</p>

<p>I think the apathy comes from,well, look, I enjoy videogames, prefer it over going to the theatres and fancy dinners. I think the apathy comes from the fact is thats all people really can do these days. The most bang for your buck. Thats not a videogame problem, thats a problem of the states soma not being potent enough, either economic justice or up the soma. 
(i hate soma pacification but you gonna let the horses stampede past the gate?Fuk w my gaming boi u goof&#39;d up)</p>

<p>Gamers are the recipient of physical violence not the perpetrators, i think our society is one sided, gamers are just citizens like everyone else, citizens are the recipient of one sided violence by the state. A cop can beat you limp and pull out his pistol and brandish it on your face and if you cover your face the cop is now justified in pulling the trigger if he should please.</p>

<p>Your automatic self-defense response makes you a higher threat you as you are now passively resisting! Living in that kind of world..., when i pull the trigger its to laugh my ass off with buddies from every nation..every faith. Make of it what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a really interesting take OP. I have noticed a huge apathetic swing in people as of the last few years. I hear self depreciating and suicide jokes almost every day, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s all comedic relief, or if people really have lost all empathy for other people and, worst of all, themselves. </p>

<p>I grew up playing games like GTA 3 and GTA vice city. Personally, it may just be me, but those sort of video games have not made me violent or apathetic at all. </p>

<p>I care very much about people and animals alike, and I absolutely in no way condone violence. I’m in my mid 20s now, and I still play violent shooter games/fighting games but it’s just for fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno man, for me personally, the act of holding a mouse and playing a few matches of Counter Strike and respawning constantly is inherently different from holding a gun to another human being and blowing through their brains. </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying though and I&#39;ve often wondered the same thing, but mainly about horror movies and slasher films. Some of the stuff thats been produced since the 70s has been absolute filth and children watched it growing up like it was nothing. </p>

<p>I guess it all has to do with the fact that a healthy, mentally-stable individual can separate reality from fiction. The problem is when kids get abused or already have a latent mental condition and they start using shooters or whatever as a kind of release or payback against humanity, then they might start fantasizing about hurting people in real life. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the angle of procuring more trigger-happy, apathetic kids to shoot brown people for the Empire. </p>

I played A LOT of Infinite Warfare and there was never a time when playing PvP where I had time to think about any type of motive or pay attention if there was I was oblivious only to stay alive and score kills not giving a hoot how I got them or their level of gore, it didn&#39;t matter and I didn&#39;t hang around to stop and stare lest I get killed myself.</p>

<p>I could see a problem if people played a campaign over and over because there is a narrative, agenda and storyline, but in PvP, nah.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gore in GTA?  Maybe we are thinking differently.  Yeah you can hit people with a car and they fly around funny but I&#39;m not seeing disemboweled people or decapitations.  Sex?  Maybe if you want to spend your whole online experience at a strip club with Trevor other than that sex doesn&#39;t play a part in online mode.  </p>

<p>I think people have a very old misconception about GTA, it&#39;s not ladies running naked from would be predators carrying a Bullpup.  The game just doesn&#39;t work that way.  Most of your time is chasing people in various vehicles, grinding jobs, fun jackassery, etc... </p>

<p>I would say the majority of people who play these games are neither apathetic or empathetic they are simply playing a game.   That said with any population of players there are those that do not view the game as most people and could take the game too literally.  It&#39;s simple math.

Every society has had a scapegoat whether it be music, comic books, regular books, comedians, etc..

I can&#39;t be the only one who remembers when Dungeons and Dragons got dragged through the mud because a couple of middle America dipshits thought that it was an indoctrination into the dark arts. Or when Lenny Bruce was sending thousands of children to Hell because of his filthy language... Or horror pulp comics being blamed for inspiring children to commit murder... On and on and on... I&#39;m sure if you go back to ancient Rome even they had something to blame for the way their children turn out.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it. Video games wouldn&#39;t be an effective way to make people apathetic. People have to make video games with stories intriguing enough to get people interested, and with that people get emotionally attached to the characters and even the animations of the game. People also build communities and make fan art from video games. This is far from apathy.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say they do make you apathetic though, in case I&#39;m wrong. Not everyone has access to violent video games. To get people to buy a game, you have to market it, and the general price for a triple A title game is around $60, and sufficient play time to get any effects on the brain would have to be a long while. Propaganda would probably have to be in the story, and video game stories are pretty long. One game wouldn&#39;t be enough to do serious damage. You&#39;d need several. A PS4 has only 500Gb of space (I think), and a triple A title game usually is about 60 or so Gb. This means about 10 games at a time, each reasonably costing from about $20 - $60, and at least 7 hours of play time on each, and then continuing it regularly for about an hour or so every day or most of the week. A TV set and headphones are expensive too and may need to be replaced. This isnt a single payment, and that&#39;s a lot of time and money that people don&#39;t have, least of all working people. </p>

<p>If you wanted to make people apathetic with the amount of money made from video games, puppet masters would be much better off using old fashioned techniques, like popularizing bad parenting techniques to deprive the next generation of their childhoods, or drugging the population with highly addictive but weak self medicating over the counter drugs available in lots of nearby markets, or making deliberately depressing architecture to make the living spaces look like a factory rather than a place where people live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I played violent video games when I wad young especially Call of Duty. In my experience  video games that involve shooting actually make people the least combat ready in real life. Not only are the physics unrealistic to real life because all the bullets shoot straight and are not affected by gravity or wind, most of the people sitting on their ass all day wouldn&#39;t last in a real combat situation they would not only get tired from running and trying to hold their gun straight but wouldn&#39;t be able to hit anything. The only scary thing I&#39;ve seen about games like Call of Duty is that some people actually <a href="https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/995751-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/59264373">join the army because of this game.</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/HU1y1G6uzAI">Here&#39;s a commercial for the US Army targeting gamers.</a> Here&#39;s another kid on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/12/648817377416120485/">steam thinking about joining the army</a>. Here&#39;s one on <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130515202612AA9mIlW">yahoo answers</a></p>

<p>The truth is the army are just the elites dogs or their pawns, tools, whatever you want to call them instead of protecting the constitution they send them to war when they want to make money off some countries resources Why do you think they call it dog tags. Why do you think more than half the US budget goes to military. Atleast oil is cheap though right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t work that way.  You get a dopamine (positive) response (reward) from completing tasks in the game.  The theory that you become desensitized and thus associate violence with reward is behind the idea that violence begets violence.  If you were given negative reinforcement or positive enforcement of negative stimulus instead of the dopamine response, you could argue an aversion to violence could be achieved.<br/>
These are the basic psychological mechanics used in the plot of A Clockwork Orange. </p>

<p>i could see how these violent games could instill the mindset that fucked up shit is just a thing we have to deal with...weather it&#39;s police corruption,mass shootings,war,genocide torture, ect... but again, i think every aspect of modern life is basically making people apathetic towards everything, so this will naturally include violence and other fucked up shit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been finding that I don&#39;t react how I think I should to the atrocities you can experience in video games.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of disgust and contempt, but not enough. I&#39;m actually looking to dial back on my violent gaming. As much as I love Battlefield and Ghost Recon, it&#39;s NOTHING but death. There&#39;s zero you can do about it, too.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley has been my escape from the &quot;kill kill kill&quot;.</p>

<p>How much are we willing to tolerate? When we have games where you hide in a mass grave of fellow countrymen, deciding which of the sobbing people you have at gunpoint lives and dies, and are constantly being told that being the rebel is the right cause so long as you just accept what you&#39;re doing is right, just how much are you being manipulated?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason game companies are becoming so influential. They&#39;re now the media, not facilitating a hobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact of the matter is that it&#39;s basically boys and young men who are attracted to and in many cases literally &quot;addicted&quot; to playing those violent video games. Some might be surprised to know that many of the companies that initially produced them were actually given the specifications and paid by the DOD to make them. It may even be that the DOD and Pentagon were actually behind the entire phenomenon from the very outset.</p>

<p>At this point we can most easily see the direct connection and similarity that playing some of those games has with the drone warfare operators and soon to be remote robot and killing machine operators sitting at their consoles and being completely removed and perfectly safe from the reality of what they&#39;re actually engaged in... barely any different at all from the countless games that they&#39;ve played for years now, or even still play on their own time. </p>

<p>I would say the majority of people who play these games are neither apathetic or empathetic they are simply playing a game.   That said with any population of players there are those that do not view the game as most people and could take the game too literally.  It&#39;s simple math.  Throw in thousands of people and you&#39;re bound to get a nutter here and there.  </p>
