    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t, but thanks for the link. There&#39;s a couple of passages in this review I find quite poignant and, all things considering, quite obvious:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...the persecution of witches was not just some error of ignorant peasants, but in fact the deliberate policy of Church and State, the very ruling class of society. To put this in perspective, today witchcraft would be a far-fetched cause for alarm, but the fear of hidden terrorists who could strike at any moment because they “hate our freedom” is widespread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spot on.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp:</p>

<p>...The book argues that these gruesome executions not only punished “witches” but graphically demonstrated the repercussions for any kind of disobedience to the clergy or nobility. In particular, the witch burnings were meant to terrify women into accepting “a new patriarchal order where women’s bodies, their labor, their sexual and reproductive powers were placed under the control of the state and transformed into economic resources”</p>

<p>Now - despite me not quite agreeing with the author&#39;s gender take on the whole matter, it is certainly true that these methods of population control have been there since the dawn of times. The only things that have changed are the masters who benefitted from them: yesterday, it was the church. today it&#39;s the bankers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly right.  Hell, in Spain, Franco made King Ferdinand his successor.  You can&#39;t get more conservative than that, from a European perspective.  There&#39;s a reason why Trotsky defined fascism as socialism by the bourgeoisie.  </p>

<p>That is also why placing fascism on the extreme right is not appropriate for American politics.  </p>

<p>American conservatives don&#39;t draw from a monarchic past.  We don&#39;t have any history of rule by strongmen, or the church.  For the most part (our peculiar institution of slavery being the exception to this rule), America grew through independent farmers forging their way West, and always governing themselves through democratic means.</p>

<p>For America (and perhaps only for America) fascism is extremely leftist.  Our extreme Right would be some sort of weak federacy, with the states wielding the majority of power.  It&#39;s completely unlike European conservatism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Individual Liberty sounds pretty Liberal to me. Typically in American discourse &quot;Liberal&quot; is synonymous with the Left, and certainly contrary to Conservatism which by definition conserves the existing order -- which has meant through most history deference to a monarch and religious authority.

    <div class="md"><p>Well certainly not if you are trying to redefine liberal to describe fascism. But the way most people use it --- increased personal liberties, increased social liberties then, yes, it does match its historical meaning. The only place things get confused is in tax policy, where liberals favor more redistribution and there conservatives claim that is restricting personal liberty to accumulate wealth. </p>

<p>Nobody said that, although Obama&#39;s policies were pretty corporatist and the DNC leadership sure is pretty corrupt and corporatist. Actually the establishment left sure wants to dismantle american liberties pretty bad. Freedom of speech, the second amendment, the 4th amendment. And they just play on the emotions of the poor, minority and illegal to gain support for those goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dinesh D&#39;souza is not a credible person to talk about this and PragerU is a right wing propaganda.</p>

<p>He actually used the &quot;National Socialist&quot; meme. </p>

<p>So much &quot;conservatism is actually the real anarchy!&quot; when they have another video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuymzkaPagM">Everyone should stay for the national anthem</a> using the black chick who wore the flag dress.</p>

<p>This was a good definition by dictionary.com</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A system of government that flourished in Europe from the 1920s to the end of World War II. Germany under Adolf Hitler, Italy under Mussolini, and Spain under Franco were all fascist states. As a rule, fascist governments are dominated by a dictator, who usually possesses a magnetic personality, wears a showy uniform, and rallies his followers by mass parades; appeals to strident nationalism; and promotes suspicion or hatred of both foreigners and “impure” people within his own nation, such as the Jews in Germany. Although both communism and fascism are forms of totalitarianism, fascism does not demand state ownership of the means of production, nor is fascism committed to the achievement of economic equality. In theory, communism opposes the identification of government with a single charismatic leader (the “ cult of personality”), which is the cornerstone of fascism. Whereas communists are considered left-wing, fascists are usually described as right-wing.</p>

<p>Note : Today, the term fascist is used loosely to refer to military dictatorships, as well as governments or individuals that profess racism and that act in an arbitrary, high-handed manner.</p>

<p>The difference is economic theory Dinesh. Wouldn&#39;t expect a political hack to understand the nuance when you make so much money spreading propaganda as a token conservative Indian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some interesting writing by george orwell on the subject:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_saw">http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_saw</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism, at any rate the German version, is a form of capitalism that borrows from Socialism just such features as will make it efficient for war purposes. Internally, Germany has a good deal in common with a Socialist state. Ownership has never been abolished, there are still capitalists and workers, and – this is the important point, and the real reason why rich men all over the world tend to sympathize with Fascism – generally speaking the same people are capitalists and the same people workers as before the Nazi revolution. But at the same time the State, which is simply the Nazi Party, is in control of everything. It controls investment, raw materials, rates of interest, working hours, wages. The factory owner still owns his factory, but he is for practical purposes reduced to the status of a manager. Everyone is in effect a State employee, though the salaries vary very greatly. The mere efficiency of such a system, the elimination of waste and obstruction, is obvious. In seven years it has built up the most powerful war machine the world has ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the idea underlying Fascism is irreconcilably different from that which underlies Socialism. Socialism aims, ultimately, at a world-state of free and equal human beings. It takes the equality of human rights for granted. Nazism assumes just the opposite. The driving force behind the Nazi movement is the belief in human inequality, the superiority of Germans to all other races, the right of Germany to rule the world. Outside the German Reich it does not recognize any obligations. Eminent Nazi professors have ‘proved’ over and over again that only nordic man is fully human, have even mooted the idea that non-nordic peoples (such as ourselves) can interbreed with gorillas! Therefore, while a species of war-Socialism exists within the German state, its attitude towards conquered nations is frankly that of an exploiter. The function of the Czechs, Poles, French, etc. is simply to produce such goods as Germany may need, and get in return just as little as will keep them from open rebellion. If we are conquered, our job will probably be to manufacture weapons for Hitler&#39;s forthcoming wars with Russia and America. The Nazis aim, in effect, at setting up a kind of caste system, with four main castes corresponding rather closely to those of the Hindu religion. At the top comes the Nazi party, second come the mass of the German people, third come the conquered European populations. Fourth and last are to come the coloured peoples, the ‘semi-apes’ as Hitler calls them, who are to be reduced quite openly to slavery.</p>

<p>Reading the sourced essay in its entirety, he almost completely ignores Spain and Italy.  I&#39;m reluctant to accuse a writer of his caliber of sloppy writing, but those were fascist states, too, and they wreck his attempt to distinguish socialism and fascism with Nazi Germany&#39;s caste system.</p>
