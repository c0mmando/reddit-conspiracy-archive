       Anyone catch this?

      <p>
       I found this episode to be an amazing explanation of an infinite holographic universe/simulation with parallel and higher/lower dimensions - with a very Gnostic narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a terrible threat of infinite psychological torture among the aware and conscious illustrated very well. It transcends sentiments that I know many feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I coincidently happened to watch
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_CyMqQBO8w">
        this Rick and Morty
       </a>
       episode earlier. It similarly illustrates the notion for me.

       I think Tron Legacy is another great example of a holographic universe that also incorporates Christian dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Father Flynn - The god that spends his time meditating and not directly confronting his evil creation
      </p>
      <p>
       CLU- A program created in god's image that falls from grace and changes the world to suit his beliefs/actively demonizes his creator
      </p>
      <p>
       Quorra- The miracle that god inadvertently created that's perfect and complex.. needs to be saved
      </p>
      <p>
       Tron- The warrior creation with a mission to protect his creator
      </p>
      <p>
       Sam Flynn- The son  of the creator who ascends to heaven in order to save god's perfect creation
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's better summaries on the web somewhere.

       Brilliant assessment.  I felt similarly but never put it into words like you have.  I have spent some time trying to see things from Satan's perspective - why he would choose to betray his post and why so many other angels would follow him.  Your comparison to CLU is astute, as CLU was just following his primary directive in creating a perfect grid.  But it comes down to definition or maybe corruption of a creator's intent.

       LOL! He watches them on his laptop. I knew he was watching something, but I didn't think I would be interested. He is retired, so he is home all day. I like when he watches on his laptop, because that gives me time to do things around the house. So no conspiracy. (Other wives with husbands who are retired will understand this perfectly!) 🙂

       That sounds like the perfect marriage, maybe I won't get married again until I'm retired and can find me someone who likes when I dont pay attention to them haha.

       Well, I'm home all day and now he (husband) is home all day (because retired). So it is nice to have a little "me time" each day while he watches shows on Netflix.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I did watch an episode of Black Mirror today with him (because of this post). I watched Season 4, episode 5 or 6 (can't remember which it was). It was really freaky! Like Twilight Zone-ish, but taking it way up several notches! A little too freaky for me.

       Check out USS Callister of this season and San Junipero if last year. If you watched the black and white one with the attacking robot dog and it wasn't for you def try the ones I listed.

       I saw the very end (last 5 minutes) of the robot dogs. It was the next episode I saw. Where the man had an implant. Someone put on a cap/hat, and he could feel what they were feeling. It got creepy in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm on Conspiracy and I am definitely a seeker of the truth. But I admit that Downton Abbey, Seinfeld and Friends are more my kind of t.v. shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I will give USS Callister and San Junipero a try (just for you!). I'll watch them tomorrow. 🙂

       I'll watch it after work, WestWorld recently really surprised me with its narrative.
      </p>

       If you haven't looked into what the plot is for that tv show, I'd recommend it, I'd say it's a bit out of the ordinary.

       Every Chris Nolan/Nolan Brothers movie/show has had some form of hidden truth in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Westworld of humanities creation with Ford being Yahweh, the park being the Earth and the "dream world" being other dimensions with "other parks" where the puppet masters live and more especially with the symbolism (there's a scene where ford is with a younger version of himself and a rattlesnake appears).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Batman Series has a ton of hidden truths from the "league of shadows", the Taoist idea of balance between two polarities very similar to the force with Joker as the dark, Harvey Dent as the light and Batman somewhere in the middle and the necessity of both poles, to the idea of "rising into the light out of a prison".

       The Prestige, where the entire movie is a actually a trick to redirect your attention "from the real magic" behind the scenes (Nicola Tesla reference was not a coincidence) much like much of popular culture is exactly that. It raises the question is it worth it to know the trick or is it better just to appreciate the mysticism as "magic"?

       Interstellar with the amazing scene where Matthew McConaughey guides himself throughout his life from a different dimension outside of time. Do we have a "higher self" doing something similar?

       Oh and don't forget my favorite of all Inception. Being able to create worlds in dreams. The very idea that this post is sharing. Are we all parts of the subconscious one larger concioussness "dreaming"? How many layers are there?

       It also made me think of the ethics of creating sentient AI within computer systems. Kind of like the movie "Her" with Joaquin Pheonix. If these things are self aware, how are they going to feel about being stuck in an artificial construct for our benefit?

       I thought about that but the DNA might be to render their body and perhaps since they all work there and have logged into the system their memories have been uploaded that way. Wouldn't explain the 6 year old boy though.

       A pretty large one.  I liked the episode, but reflecting on that bit made me wonder if I missed something.  I'm waaaaaay more interested in a story about technology that can copy your entire life history, including social media passwords, using just a tiny sample of DNA.  I still don't even know what the DNA was for in the first place, unless they had a level of technology that allowed them to also fully read and understand the entire strand of DNA.

       I mean, you could say the same thing about Christians and any other religious text that's been around longer than the bible. The idea can be good, even if the execution isn't.

       I thought that was the weakest episode of them all. It was obvious they were trying to appeal to a younger audience to hook them into the rest of the show.

       same. seems...different? were these episodes produced by a different crew i wonder? I know the original episodes were made in the UK before netflix co-opted it.
