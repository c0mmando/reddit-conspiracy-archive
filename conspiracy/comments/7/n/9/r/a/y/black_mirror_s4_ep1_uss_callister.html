<p>I found this episode to be an amazing explanation of an infinite holographic universe/simulation with parallel and higher/lower dimensions - with a very Gnostic narrative.  </p>

<p>There was a terrible threat of infinite psychological torture among the aware and conscious illustrated very well. It transcends sentiments that I know many feel.</p>

<p>I coincidently happened to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_CyMqQBO8w">this Rick and Morty</a> episode earlier. It similarly illustrates the notion for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Tron Legacy is another great example of a holographic universe that also incorporates Christian dogma.</p>

<p>Father Flynn - The god that spends his time meditating and not directly confronting his evil creation</p>

<p>CLU- A program created in god&#39;s image that falls from grace and changes the world to suit his beliefs/actively demonizes his creator</p>

<p>Quorra- The miracle that god inadvertently created that&#39;s perfect and complex.. needs to be saved</p>

<p>Tron- The warrior creation with a mission to protect his creator</p>

<p>Sam Flynn- The son  of the creator who ascends to heaven in order to save god&#39;s perfect creation</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s better summaries on the web somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant assessment.  I felt similarly but never put it into words like you have.  I have spent some time trying to see things from Satan&#39;s perspective - why he would choose to betray his post and why so many other angels would follow him.  Your comparison to CLU is astute, as CLU was just following his primary directive in creating a perfect grid.  But it comes down to definition or maybe corruption of a creator&#39;s intent.</p>

<p>Great post, thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m home all day and now he (husband) is home all day (because retired). So it is nice to have a little &quot;me time&quot; each day while he watches shows on Netflix.</p>

<p>But I did watch an episode of Black Mirror today with him (because of this post). I watched Season 4, episode 5 or 6 (can&#39;t remember which it was). It was really freaky! Like Twilight Zone-ish, but taking it way up several notches! A little too freaky for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the very end (last 5 minutes) of the robot dogs. It was the next episode I saw. Where the man had an implant. Someone put on a cap/hat, and he could feel what they were feeling. It got creepy in the end.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on Conspiracy and I am definitely a seeker of the truth. But I admit that Downton Abbey, Seinfeld and Friends are more my kind of t.v. shows.</p>

<p>But I will give USS Callister and San Junipero a try (just for you!). I&#39;ll watch them tomorrow. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t looked into what the plot is for that tv show, I&#39;d recommend it, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a bit out of the ordinary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every Chris Nolan/Nolan Brothers movie/show has had some form of hidden truth in it. </p>

<p>Westworld of humanities creation with Ford being Yahweh, the park being the Earth and the &quot;dream world&quot; being other dimensions with &quot;other parks&quot; where the puppet masters live and more especially with the symbolism (there&#39;s a scene where ford is with a younger version of himself and a rattlesnake appears).</p>

<p>The Batman Series has a ton of hidden truths from the &quot;league of shadows&quot;, the Taoist idea of balance between two polarities very similar to the force with Joker as the dark, Harvey Dent as the light and Batman somewhere in the middle and the necessity of both poles, to the idea of &quot;rising into the light out of a prison&quot;.</p>

<p>The Prestige, where the entire movie is a actually a trick to redirect your attention &quot;from the real magic&quot; behind the scenes (Nicola Tesla reference was not a coincidence) much like much of popular culture is exactly that. It raises the question is it worth it to know the trick or is it better just to appreciate the mysticism as &quot;magic&quot;?</p>

<p>Interstellar with the amazing scene where Matthew McConaughey guides himself throughout his life from a different dimension outside of time. Do we have a &quot;higher self&quot; doing something similar? </p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t forget my favorite of all Inception. Being able to create worlds in dreams. The very idea that this post is sharing. Are we all parts of the subconscious one larger concioussness &quot;dreaming&quot;? How many layers are there?</p>

I still don&#39;t even know what the DNA was for in the first place, unless they had a level of technology that allowed them to also fully read and understand the entire strand of DNA.</p>
