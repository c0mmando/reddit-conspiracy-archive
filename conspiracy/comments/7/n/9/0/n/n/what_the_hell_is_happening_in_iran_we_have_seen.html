<p>The latest protests in Iran have all the hallmarks of an engineered &quot;Arab Spring&quot;-like program, and support from the MSM and the neo-cons should raise all manners of red flags:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it is to be expected from a virulently anti-Iran administration and mainstream press in the United States, it is interesting how the U.S. President immediately has latched on the protests, encouraging Americans to stand with the protesters and their demands. This is coming from a man who rarely sees a protest that isn’t directed at him. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Neo-Con organs like FOX News are also repeating calls for Americans to support the brave “freedom fighters” in Iran. It is seldom, if ever, true that evil does good in the world so when Neo-Cons call for support to protests, eyebrows should be raised in skepticism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As recently as 2009, a similar attempt was made with the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/05/201351661225981675.html">&quot;Green Revolution&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The author notes that the Western oligarchy has had their sites on Iran for a long time, quoting from a 2009 report from the Brookings Institute that spells out plans to &quot;foment destabilization inside Iran via the color revolution apparatus, violent unrest, proxy terrorism, and “limited airstrikes” conducted by the US, Israel or both.&quot;</p>

<p>The author concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While many of the demands are legitimate, all signs are pointing toward Western treachery in an attempt to break Iran in the final domino to fall in the Middle East before an even bigger confrontation is ignited. </p>

<p>However, if the protests taking place in Iran today are indeed a color revolution and if the West is committed, the Path to Persia will likely see an escalation in activity, violence, and ultimately directly military confrontation by proxy and even by the U.S. military itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so. And you&#39;re right it&#39;s a 180 from Obama&#39;s policy. Though Obama&#39;s actions with Iran always confused me since he was a typical neocon, and not attacking Iran seemed inconsistent. So Trump and his MSM lackeys are ramping up the anti-Iran propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are currently 3 major factions fighting over control of the Earth right now and this is just gearing up to be another Proxy war: </p>

<p>Faction 1 (The Zionists and Neo-Cons) control:
Israel
US
The EU
Australia 
Japan
South Korea
Taiwan 
Saudi Arabia
A few South American countries</p>

<p>Faction 2 Putin alliance control: 
Russian
Some Eastern European countries 
Iran
Syria
Palestine
Some Middle Eastern Proxies </p>

<p>Faction 3 Chinese Nationalists control:
China
North Korea
South East Asian countries</p>

<p>So if you hadn&#39;t figured it out yet, the world is pretty much divided in the same way it was written like in 1984. This is just another move from faction 1 against faction 2 trying to implement puppet regimes against their capitol (Israel). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The us stopped fighting the cold war when the Soviet Union collapsed. And we have been focused on counterinsurgency tactics in our military for 16 years. Even so far as to redesignate brigades to brigade combat teams as most of the missions taken on are managed at a brigade level. </p>

<p>We haven&#39;t done divisional maneuvers since around 2005. We are going to be sucking in a fight against Russia. </p>

<p>The only ones that were still fighting the war were the intelligence folks and even that was scaled back to devote more resources to the mid east. </p>

<p>Russia on the other hand has been playing the long game. </p>

The MSM is definitely bias towards Iran because of the whole notion that they’re somehow an extremely violent country with nuclear capabilities and a willingness to use them.</p>

<p>I think their internet is off so that the Iranian people are silenced to post their opinions of the fishy things going on down there atm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s actually not true, if you scrolled through r/the_donald you’d have seen plenty of posts about Venezuela. The msm didn’t touch it because in the last year the left went so far left it turned into socialism, and showing the finish line of socialism is not a good idea when you’re trying to jump start your own socialist race.</p>

<p>This is why mass migration is a bad idea, humans have to learn and grow through their own experiences. The west has already gone through their feminist movement, the gay rights movement, and other minorities or ethnicities. Unfortunately much of the Middle East has not. So when you bring a bunch of people who are already mad at the West for the many oil wars and toppling of democratically elected governments (which is why Iran went from a democratic and free society to one run by sharia law, was because Us armed revels back in the 60s) this is why we need to support them and encourage them to go through their own movements. Give women the RIGHT to choose if they want to cover their head up or not, DON’T execute gays, don’t run Dogs over with your cars in the streets (our shelters are filled with handicapped dogs from Iran because sharia law calls them unpure and people literally try to run them over with their cars) can you imagine if those same people started trying to do that here, well they won’t until there’s enough of them in a neighborhood to take over, like in parts of France, Sweden and Germany is getting really close to that as well.
No I don’t have anything against those people, I am against all violent and controlling cults and religions. I can say Fuck Christianity and I’m cool, I say fuck Islam and I’m called a racist. Islam is not a race, it’s an ideology, one not suited for the western world, we have put our barbaric ways behind us, we should support them on their part to growth.</p>

<p>No doubt there is Western influence in these protests but the current Iranian government isn&#39;t blameless either. In fact, &quot;regime change&quot; wouldn&#39;t work if the governments treated all of their citizens fairly as it would be that much more difficult to stir up dissent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol either you&#39;re lying or he&#39;s lying. We aren&#39;t deploying anyone to Iran. Maybe Iraq but not Iran.</p>

<p>And if he was by some strange weird fucking reason being deployed there he wouldn&#39;t know about it.
When we invaded Iraq and people went to Kuwait a few weeks in advance they didn&#39;t even know they were going to Kuwait let alone jumping off into Iraq. </p>

<p>Some of us were around the military during the invasion because we grew up military brats. A lot of us were around afterwards and deployed to Iraq with people that were part of the invasion. </p>

<p>Hell when the us military recalled everyone that was on leave on 911 no one knew what was going on beyond planes hitting towers. </p>

<p>They specifically don&#39;t tell people where they&#39;re going when it is something like that specifically bc people run their mouths.</p>

<p>So yeah, based on reality I&#39;d say either you&#39;re lying or he was. </p>
