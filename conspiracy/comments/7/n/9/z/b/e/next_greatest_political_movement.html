    <div class="md"><p>Political movements are all equally dead. When you&#39;ve got useds and consumer hooked up to the system and the wealth it provides to them, you don&#39;t need no parties. This is why mass organisations went the way of the dodo as soon as my country of birth (Italy) reached decent living standards.</p>

<p>I would predict that &quot;temporary&quot; and above all fixable issues such as unrestricted immigration will very well bring the hard right to power. The left self-destroyed itself by selling out to tycoons and pandering to every minority imaginable instead of caring for whatever it was supposed to care for - workers and their families.</p>

<p>well that&#39;s just it isn&#39;t it.  some models are inherently broken linguistically and can&#39;t ever reflect the underlying intention.  the golden rule is a pretty good, terse summary of the intention of my comment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its curious you cite the golden rule, but in observable history it has very limited practicality at the state level. War becomes very problematic because now you&#39;ve agreed (logically) that all wars are justifiable against your nation state so long as its engaged in war.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much better applied to individuals. Individuals can respect each others diversity without legislating it into an authoritative system, by which <em>de facto</em> eliminates the ability to express said diversity.</p>
