       I heard someone mention the holocaust conspiracy theory the other day when we were talking about WW2 and I kinda just brushed it off since I'm not knowledgeable on the conspiracy itself and have just never really doubted something of that magnitude would be a conspiracy. So today I was looking up the conspiracy theory itself and honestly im having a very hard time finding any factual evidence to convince myself. Especially with films like "night will fall" where they documented the camps and show the mountains of bodies of people that are horribly malnourished. Im just trying to gain a better insight into the conspiracy itself so I can better understand my friends pov without belittling his idea because of my preconceived notions. So im just looking for some input on the subject and key points of the conspiracy itself. Thanks in advance

       Shaving heads is pretty useless against body lice or fleas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And concerning Zyklon B revisionism: Let’s see what Evonik Industries AG has to say about Zyklon B in their company history about the predecessor company Degussa AG:
       <a href="http://history.evonik.com/sites/geschichte/en/predecessor-companies/degussa-ns/pages/default.aspx#faq_1_7">
        Degussa in the NS Era: Degesch and Zyklon B
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The pesticide Zyklon B was used between 1939 and 1945 primarily for gassing military accommodation and supplies, uniforms, vehicles and ships, or for pest control in forced laborers’ barracks. At the same time, however, the SS misused 1 percent of the manufactured quantities of this substance to kill approximately one million people. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Besides Degussa, there were initially many other firms involved in this company, which by 1922 had sold their stakes to Degussa. In the same year, Degesch acquired a process developed by its Managing Director, Walter Heerdt, by which the highly poisonous gas Cyclon (an acronym for the main ingredients cyanogen and chlorine compounds) was enclosed in tiny cotton wool-like balls. As soon as these came into contact with air, the end product Zyklon B was created. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Degesch tended to be of secondary importance for Degussa. Profits from distributing Zyklon B until 1938 came mainly from abroad. After the start of the war, the Armed Forces and the SS grew to become major clients of Testa – not just soldiers’ accommodation but also the concentration camps barracks had to be disinfected. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Degesch Managing Director Dr. Gerhard Peters had been closely associated with the Zyklon B product since the beginning of his career. He was not only a party member, but also stood up publicly in favor of the objectives of National Socialism. When in 1943 the SS Obersturmführer Kurt Gerstein reported that human beings were to be the victims of the pest control agent, Peters nevertheless continued with the deliveries – directly to Auschwitz. “He just went along with it”, as its states succinctly in the minutes of the court proceedings. None of the members of the Management Board of Degussa ever stated that Dr Peters had informed them of the murders committed using Zyklon B, and none of the documents obtained can refute this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, yes, delousing was the main use of Zyklon B, but there is no big leap to make about the use of Zyklon B against people, namely prisoners of concentration camps, as well.

       It's a conspiracy by Neo-Nazis to conceal or obfuscate the death toll of their ideology. Their usual approach is to "prove" mathematically that you can't kill 6 million people with the number of gas chambers in Germany &amp; Polland in the given period of time. This is a red herring, since gas chambers only made up a portion of the deaths, with many more being due to starvation, medical experimentation, working to death at labor camps, disease, or summary executions anywhere and everywhere (both in camps and in the streets).
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't buy into it, it's pure propaganda and the point is to make the Nazis (and Hitler) into misunderstood tragic heroes that we've been lied to about. The whole point of it is to recruit you into white nationalist causes.

       its actually that you couldn't possibly cremate that many people, and hide their ashes. even with modern crematoriums the sheer volume of corpses would be impossible to have disposed of. then lets also point out that they have done scan around the camps looking for the supposed mass graves and found there were no areas remotely large enough that had disturbed top soil.

       People didn't just die in the camps, they also died in the trains and trucks (bodies thrown out to ditches), in the streets (bodies left to be taken care of by locals), and in the fields (just let them rot).

       So a bunch of people, probably already deniers, and looked around and said, "Eh, I doubt they coulda buried that many." Real scientific!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, in all cases, deniers rely on this string of illogic:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I imagine they'd have to do things exactly in
         <em>
          this
         </em>
         way. I've made this story up based on lightly reading official accounts and then filling in a bunch of details with my own intuitions and assumptions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As you can see, based on the evidence, they cannot have been done in
         <em>
          this
         </em>
         way
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Thus, they weren't done at all. It's not that I'm a fucking idiot with shitty assumptions/intuition, or that I deliberately set out to make it impossible in my reasoning in the first place

       oh so 6 million people died in trains ditches etc and it took them till the end of the war to notice?

       as for the ground scans, that is literally ignoring fucking scientific proof.

       frankly it is because you are a fucking idiot (your words not mine) making assumptions and intuition to prove what you assume you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       fuck heads like you always seem to take this dumb approach and assume anyone who questions things was setting out to disprove the haulocaust, personally my questions all came from reading the eye witness accounts of the camps and laughing at how ridiculous they mostly are. lets add a dose of a bunch of high profile "victims" making death bed confessions about lying about the whole thing and yeah, im going to start questioning the narrative we built using those confessed lies.

       you didn refute a single thing here, you just parroted the same shit every one has for the last 30 years. if you had an argument post something to back it up, if you want to refute something i said back it the fuck up.

       More than 50 million people died in WW2. Also, how would news of it spread if it was being actively suppressed by the Nazis? It's not like the internet existed.

       yeah, on the front lines mostly... i wasn't aware that a person could notice dead people in france all the way from germany. 5,000, hell even 500 people rotting in the ditches and fields of germany (where there was no fighting) wouldn't go un noticed ffs.

       IHR, or the "Institute for Historical Review" is a well known Holocaust Denial website, one of the first as well, and probably the most influential. If a person uses it, it's always from a denier.

       What, do you think that the Nazis were secretly planning a surprise party for all the Jews of Europe? All that talk about exterminating the Jews was just for show so they wouldn't catch on?

      <p>
       There were 9.5 million Jews in Europe in 1939. There were 3.8 million in 1945. Where do you think that they went and what evidence do you have for that?

       your own source brings up many of the issues i raise and should make people question this even more. the reality is most of what gets trotted out as fact is based on bad records, assumptions or witness claims (which had shown to be pretty damn unreliable)

       The basics: Conflated numbers. The false numbers were then all attributed to Jewish statistics (false as proven by documents) ergo the (#6,000,000) Six Million Jews were gas, burned, starved and tortured is all propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers do not add up. The time, energy and facilities to pull this off have been written, recorded and verified. The false narrative prevails, as designed.

       I just read that they executed the guy that supplied the de lousing agent to the nazis. Imagine your just business owner who sells a product to fight the spread of disease and you end up in a room interrogated by Sigmund Freud's son and then executed for doing your job.

       It’s kind of a two part question that requires you to learn about Bolshevism as well. First I would tell you to look up who created communism. What happened in Russia before ww2 what kind of country they had and what kind of government they had before communism. Then you need to learn how 10 percent of the Russian population comprised over 60 percent of the Bolshevik government. Hitler saw what happened and wrote about it in his book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after you have looked into Bolshevik Russia look at who was leading the polls in Germany during the time the Nazi party ran for office you should notice the communist party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next step requires you to lookup all the concentration camps locations and which are labor camps and which are death camps. You should notice how the Russian side had all the death camps while the allied show only work camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answers
1: a Jew created communism off the Talmud.
2: Talmud states every person who isn’t a Jew is a slave to a Jew
3: Russian government was a monarchy with a Christian king and family
4: Bolshevism killed 16 million Russians through death camps call gulags and starvation.
5: communism was leading the polls in Germany which is basically the same thing as Bolshevism.
6:Jews comprised over 60 percent of the Bolshevik positions in Russia “some may refute this number but Jews are over represented in numbers of Bolshevik party positions compared to their population in Russian”
7: death camps for Germany had all been inspected by the Russian side big surprise there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other reasons not discussed 
8: an American who designed gas chambers and built them for American prisons inspected a few German death camps and found it impossible for the “gas chambers” to work.
9: the time it takes to cremate a body makes the number of 6 million impossible.
10: the fake accounts by Jewish survivors stating they had been put in a cage with a bear and eagle at the same time, the rollercoaster into a pit of fire, how they had been gassed multiple times or got out of being gassed to death because they got sick so the Germans put them in a hospital, the lampshade made from Jews skin and how a bunch of survivors said they made up their stories.
11: it’s illegal to question the holocaust in some countries
12: holocaust means burnt offerings and its described in the Bible as an act where Jewish parents sacrifice their children to moloch by throwing their children in a iron bull which stomach is a fire pit.
13: Israel is magically created and given to Jews after ww2
14: rothchilds financed both sides in the war but also created Israel.
15: how hitler is actually related to a Rothschild look it up.

       Wouldn't it be as simple as tracing the hydrogen cyanide supply chain to justify either side of the argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       Prove its mass production, exclusively to make hydrogen cyanide, and you have your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it would get murky is the production of each chemical component. It was war time and the ingredients to make hydrogen cyanide were already in high production for other uses in different combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       How, or if, you can separate that out to explain the differences in war time efforts vs exclusively hydrogen cyanide production to be equal to the amounts needed will be the Goliath task.

       The hydrogen cyanide based pesticide Zyklon-B
       <em>
        was

       mass produced and used in the camps. The lie was that it was used to kill people. It was used for its original design purpose, as a fumigant to kill lice, which were the primary vector by which typhus bacteria spread.

       The bear and eagle story is one a holocaust survivor told about the death camps. Obviously it was a made up story about a cage and a bear and eagle in the cage and the Nazi would feed the Jews to the bear and eagle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next I suggest you look up the word holocaust and it’s meaning which Jews have changed to shoa or something like that. Holocaust is the a sacrifice to the ancient Canaanite god moloch where Jews would throw their children into an iron bull that was hollow and had a pit of fire in the bottom. Basically they burned their children alive in the iron bull. The act of holocaust was considered a sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The roller coaster of death was another wild holocaust survivor story about  a cart being built to hold Jews which slid down a track and at the end of the track was a pit of fire. The cart was made to dump alive people into the pit of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now just because a few crazy people told some wild stories doesn’t make the shoa or holocaust untrue but in addition to the stories the 6 million has dropped from 6 to 4 to 2.4 million over the 60 years after the war.  The fact that all the death camps investigated occurred only by the Russians and a chimney had been installed after the war leave me to believe a few things happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       A: the Germans didn’t have death camps and most likely Americans and the Russians bombed the supply lines which caused the camps to stave to death. Then told lies about it to cover the fact they created the mess
      </p>
      <p>
       B: death camps existed but not until the end of the war 
“Unlikely” but still a probability and only accounted for less then a million people’s deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       C: the Germans killed 6 million Jews and cremated them “impossible” considering the tech and the man power required to achieve that feat with no evidence except for witness testimony provided by unreliable witnesses and stories like the ones provided above.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is the Germans did some f-up stuff but not on the scale people think and not how the history books tell it. I honestly don’t want to hurt anyone’s feeling about the subject I just want honesty about the war. The question of why hitler killed the Jews was a question that seemed to push me to looking into the subject. I mean why kill millions of people there had to be a reason right? All people will tell you who believe the bs history version is he didn’t like Jews. The reality is he wrote a book and he explains why he feared Jews and it had to do with Bolshevism and what happened in Russia.

       You don’t have to be a chemistry expert. First off an American who created the first gas chambers for prisons did an investigation on a couple of these death camps and found no residue from the gas in these makeshift gas chambers. What they did find is a ton of residue in in the places where the Nazi deloused the clothing of prisoners which is what zyklon b was intended for. The original story states the the Nazi used zyklon b which is a cyanide-based pesticide.

       Here is the name of the investigator and a link to what he did.

       Different investigation into gas chambers finds the same thing

       A recent investigation by a Polish government agency has authoritatively corroborated the findings of Fred Leuchter from his detailed 1988 on-site forensic examination of supposed German wartime extermination gas chambers. The American execution expert concluded that the "gas chambers" in the former concentration camps of Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek were never used to kill people. (On Leuchter's findings and the resulting international controversy, see his detailed Report, as well as The Journal of Historical Review, Summer 1989 and Winter 1990-91, and the IHR Newsletter, October 1990 and January 1991.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerned at the impact of Leuchter's widely-circulated Report, the Auschwitz State Museum, a Polish government agency, commissioned the Institute of Forensic Research (Instytut Ekspertyz Sadowych) of Krakow to carry out its own investigation. The result: In a carefully worded six-page internal forensic report, the Institute's experts essentially replicated Leuchter's findings and implicitly corroborated his conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with Leuchter's investigation, the Institute's specialists detected absolutely no traces of cyanide (or ferro-ferri-cyanide compound) in most of the plaster and brick samples taken from the alleged extermination gas chambers. Traces of cyanides were detected in eight samples, seven of which were rooms in Block 3 of Auschwitz main camp where -as the Institute's experts acknowledge - inmate clothing was disinfected by "gassing" with Zyklon.
      </p>
      <p>
       A barely detectable trace of cyanide compound was found in the eighth remaining "positive" sample, which was sample No. 15 from the alleged homicidal "gas chamber" in Krema building II in Birkenau. Significantly, this is the only sample taken from any of the supposed extermination gas chambers that showed any trace of cyanide. The presence of an almost indetectable trace in this sample is entirely in keeping with Leuchter's conclusion that the room from which it was taken must have been deloused with Zyklon at one time or another.

       There were no gas chambers, same as there were no bars of soap, lampshades, shrunken heads, electrified conveyor belts, abruptly stopping train cars that flung Jews into ovens or any of the other atrocity propaganda that was used to support the war effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gas chambers and "burnt offerings" are all a rich mans trick to convince European Jews to move to Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you give me one scientific report that shows the existence of gas chambers anywhere in Nazi-occupied territory?

       Read the book The Bad War by M.S King. That book explains the entire first and second war but not from the Allied side or the German side. You will also find several interviews with the author on Youtube. I can not recommend this book enough, especially to anyone that is willing to listen to different views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly I will suggest that you read the book Hellstorm by Thomas Goodrich. In brutal detail he outlines how the Germans were effectively genocide by the Allied. This is a very biased look at the war from the German perspective, a view not often told in the west and some might say a view that has certainly been hidden from the population of the allied countries. Also watch the documentary of the same name Hellstorm, available on youtube in english.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have read those two books, then you can now start to investigate the holocaust. To start with no holocaust revisionists will accept the term holocaust denier or denial. This is just a simplification of the issue and a strategy to demonize people that investigate the truth of the second world war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth as unbelievable as it might be. The Jews were actually responsible for the second world war in more ways than one. They were responsible for genocide 100 million white russians, including the monarchy and responsible for communist uprising in Spain and other countries. Jews had control over many aspects of preww2 germany and Hitler saw what the jews had done in Russia and feared the same would be done in Germany if the communists were to take power. This was the catalyst that caused Hitler to enter politics and speak out against what he called the international jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Hitler and Germany turned against the jews and pushed them out of positions of power within germany, they all fled to other countries. Jews were pissed off that they lost their power in one of the strongest countries in the world and as a result set out a propaganda campaign against the germans within the British and USA newspapers and media that they owned. They also had control over the politics within the USA and UK, even though even to this day that will be denied. The jews basically manipulated the English and the Americans in to the war. The jews were able to use the conflict to manipulate the British to ensure that the Jews received israel as a part of the reconciliation of the ww2. Although technically this will be denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the jews were actually responsible for the conflict they had to create the narrative that they were the main victims of the second world war. After the war was ending the jews invented the holocaust stories to create this narrative. They also used it as a way to receive billions in reparations, that they are still receiving to this day. That is why when you were taught about ww2 at school, most of the history was about jewish victimhood and holocaust stories. These stories were largely made up out of thin air and/or exaggerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we accept that the 6 million jews died in the second world war. 123 million people died so 117 million non-jewish people died during the second world war. Some in absolutely the most worst imaginable ways possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to go on about jewish victimhood so intensively is offensive to the other victims of the second world war.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day the jews still won't allow anyone forget the jews holocaust and a $ million industry has been created around the lie and even jews have created entire fake hollywood movies about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some good books and documentaries that prove that the holocaust is a complete fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend the documentary One Third of the Holocaust or Treblinka, it is long but it goes over all the preposterous claims and proves through sheer common sense analysis the total fabrication of the jewish lies.

        its actually that you couldn't possibly cremate that many people, and hide their ashes. even with modern crematoriums the sheer volume of corpses would be impossible to have disposed of
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       People didn't just die in the camps, they also died in the trains and trucks (bodies thrown out to ditches), in the streets (bodies left to be taken care of by locals), and in the fields (just let them rot).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        then lets also point out that they have done scan around the camps looking for the supposed mass graves and found there were no areas remotely large enough that had disturbed top soil.

       So a bunch of people, probably already deniers, and looked around and said, "Eh, I doubt they coulda buried that many." Real scientific!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, in all cases, deniers rely on this string of illogic:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I imagine they'd have to do things exactly in
         <em>
          this
         </em>
         way. I've made this story up based on lightly reading official accounts and then filling in a bunch of details with my own intuitions and assumptions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As you can see, based on the evidence, they cannot have been done in
         <em>
          this
         </em>
         way
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Thus, they weren't done at all. It's not that I'm a fucking idiot with shitty assumptions/intuition, or that I deliberately set out to make it impossible in my reasoning in the first place
         <em>
          because I was always trying to prove it was a hoax from the get-go
         </em>
         .
