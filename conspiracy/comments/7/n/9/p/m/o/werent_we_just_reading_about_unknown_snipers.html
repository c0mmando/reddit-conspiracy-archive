       Interesting article from Al-Jazeera includes this small statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/protests-iran-171231083620343.html">
        http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/protests-iran-171231083620343.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Meanwhile, Habibollah Khojastepour, security deputy of the governor of Lorestan province, said on Sunday that the presence of "agitators" prevented a peaceful end to the protest, according to Mehr news agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also blamed "foreign agents" for the deaths of the two protesters, saying that security forces did not fire on the crowd."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it's impossible to know with any certainty who fired the shots at this time. We may end up seeing footage on social media proving that Iranian security forces did in fact fire on the protestors. (Once social media is possible again...in Iran...definitely a check mark in the "against" column concerning Iran's government)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just pointing out the "possibility" that snipers from another country who have a huge interest in seeing the government of Iran overthrown could be playing a part in the chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone could link the stories about "unknown snipers" I would appreciate it.
      </p>

       Adding this comment from u/KiwiBattleNZ to post..the man in the crowd firing does so at the 25 second mark...I believe it's the 3rd video in the article.

       I see that the article has more references, but it opens with a huge red flag:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Italy’s 11th largest newspaper – Il Giornale
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Eleventh largest isn't at all reassuring and it's a Berlusconi one. He's tight with Putin, even said the Crimea vote was democratic and visited him there.

       Yes "muh Russia," I'm sorry if that upsets you but it seemed relevant to the topic at hand. ZeroHedge does agitprop and peddles a load of Russian propaganda, this post is about the Iranian regime being totally honest, and I remembered that post about Russia supporting the regime there.

      <p>
       In the video you see a man carrying a pistol raise the weapon in the air and fire two shots while standing in the middle of a crowd of apparently unarmed protesters.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is another way they get police/security forces to fire on crowds. This definitely happened in Ukraine, with plenty of footage showing armed men mingling with unarmed protesters firing shots at police.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may very well be that the police fired on the protesters, but that still doesn't mean that it was unjustified and unprovoked.

       This is a common tactic. Not only did it happen in
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jdCujnPDHtQ">
        Ukraine
       </a>
       , but also in the largely manufactured

       against Hugo Chavez.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though it's not stated in the video clip, I remember seeing a documentary saying unknown snipers shot at both the police and protestors at the same time, escalating violence.

       I believe there was also "sniper incident" tactics used during protests in Ukraine a few years ago as well, I believe was also exposed eventually to be a false flag style operation.
