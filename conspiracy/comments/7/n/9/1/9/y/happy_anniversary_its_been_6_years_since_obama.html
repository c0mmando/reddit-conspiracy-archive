<p>An enemy combatant that no longer poses a threat and is captured becomes a prisoner of war. Even if they have switched sides they are always entitled to due process... well at least in the civilized world. To advocate anything else only signals you dont have faith in your legal apparatus to dispence justice appropriately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the outbreak of the United States Civil War in April 1861, Washington, D.C., was largely undefended, rioters in Baltimore, Maryland threatened to disrupt the reinforcement of the capital by rail, and Congress was not in session. The military situation made it dangerous to call Congress into session.[5] Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, therefore authorized his military commanders to suspend the writ of habeas corpus between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia (and later up through New York City).[6][7] Numerous individuals were arrested, including John Merryman and a number of Baltimore police commissioners; the administration of justice in Baltimore was carried out through military officials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, nothing I said even insinuated I though Obama has been the only president to violate Habious Corpus and you yourself made this post a partisan issue.  I was noting the fact that Obama literally signed it on NYE (dec 31st 2011), hence why I posted it was the anniversary.  Also, a couple things, you forgot Roosevelt and the Japanese internment camps and the fact sec 1021 was only in the 2012 NDAA, so Trump didn&#39;t sign that section.  But, it should make everyone scared as shit he has that power, some even were wondering if he was going to use it against the New York City terorrist attacker a couple months ago.  Lastly, if you followed the Hedges v. Obama lawsuit, than you&#39;re probably aware the courts have turned it into a catch 22 by ruling Hedges didn&#39;t have any legal ground to challenge it since it wasn&#39;t used against him.  So you need to have your right to trial removed in order to challenge it in court, which you don&#39;t have a right too.  </p>
