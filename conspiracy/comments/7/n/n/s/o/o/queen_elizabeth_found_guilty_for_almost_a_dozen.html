    <div class="md"><p>what exactly is a &quot;real court&quot;?  </p>

<p>Annett has done yeoman&#39;s work and had his life destroyed for it.  he&#39;s presented evidence from many sources that is independently corroborative of locations and names and dates - all of which has been ignored by the systems of gov and police.  he&#39;s been a TI for years.  and all he&#39;s doing is going thru the same process that real courts do - and they know it and are trying to dismiss it.  but they know he&#39;s legit.  and they know his conclusions are legit.  is what it is.  </p>

<p>to know how deep it is, just watch how he&#39;s treated and by whom.  it&#39;s not a red pill most people want to take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes that&#39;s true, courts put a process in place.  they use a narrative design.  it&#39;s not that bad of a design - it&#39;s just been fucking corrupted.  there is that difference in design between a regular forum and a forum that collects testimony and draws conclusions by comparing them to a book of rules.  still, he wasn&#39;t that far off from that.  and if nobody&#39;s going to go thru that effort (certainly the actual courts run away from this), someone has to. </p>

<p>The difference between a &quot;real court&quot; and this guy&#39;s blog is partly that he has even less than that to validate his results: he gave himself the piece of paper, subject to no oversight whatsoever. </p>

<p>Another way his blog is less legitimate than a real court is that real courts follow established, written procedures designed to protect the accused and permit parties to defend themselves according to predictable and (ideally) fair rules. He ran his kangaroo court according to &quot;natural law,&quot; which is a fancy way of saying he made it up as he went along. </p>

<p>So for example, real courts rarely permit <em>ex parte</em> proceedings where the defendants can&#39;t defend themselves. There are many, and obvious, reasons for that. Kangaroo courts don&#39;t mind <em>ex parte</em> proceedings, because the results are predetermined anyway. Guess which side of the line this guy&#39;s blog fell on?</p>
