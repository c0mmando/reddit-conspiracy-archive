       what exactly is a "real court"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Annett has done yeoman's work and had his life destroyed for it.  he's presented evidence from many sources that is independently corroborative of locations and names and dates - all of which has been ignored by the systems of gov and police.  he's been a TI for years.  and all he's doing is going thru the same process that real courts do - and they know it and are trying to dismiss it.  but they know he's legit.  and they know his conclusions are legit.  is what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       to know how deep it is, just watch how he's treated and by whom.  it's not a red pill most people want to take.

       i guess we're gonna have to disagree on that.  that type of classification argument always shifts up to some other authority.  climbing the endless authority ladder.  to what top?  Saturn?

       courts are just a process that people can get behind or not.  Annett did the legwork on the process, it's up to us to carry it out.

       It's a subjective distinction, since there's no formal definition of "real court." But Annett's blog--and it's a blog, not a court--doesn't include any serious due process protections or accountability. Trying to enforce one of his bogus "arrest warrants" would be what real courts call "attempted kidnapping."

       well at a very basic level a court is where people come together to share their stories.  he's done that.  he's been attacked for it.  speaks for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       the people have to stand up for themselves because the heroes they've ceded their power to are not standing up for them.  and to be clear i'm not advocating bad acts.  i'm advocating self defense and self reliance.  the rest will take care of itself.

       At a basic level, so is 4Chan. That's why courts have to be a whole hell of a lot more than just a place for storytelling and conclusion-drawing.

       yes that's true, courts put a process in place.  they use a narrative design.  it's not that bad of a design - it's just been fucking corrupted.  there is that difference in design between a regular forum and a forum that collects testimony and draws conclusions by comparing them to a book of rules.  still, he wasn't that far off from that.  and if nobody's going to go thru that effort (certainly the actual courts run away from this), someone has to.

       It's not "some other" authority. Thats just disingenuous. You seemingly imply the authority of the court is nonexistant through use of some vague collection of words that initself define nothing. The government of the jurisdiction the court resides in authorizes the court.

       it's authority all the way up/down.  like that thing with the turtles.  who grants this authority?  someone has to give the authority.  and yes it is fucking nonexistent.  it doesn't exist.  it's a mental construct.  anyway if you really want to have this discussion put your diapers on.  i'm game.  should be fun.

       What a surprise you'd be in that camp of people. The "it is true for it has been written" types, the people who look to authority for definition.

       The difference between a "real court" and this guy's blog is partly that he has even less than that to validate his results: he gave himself the piece of paper, subject to no oversight whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way his blog is less legitimate than a real court is that real courts follow established, written procedures designed to protect the accused and permit parties to defend themselves according to predictable and (ideally) fair rules. He ran his kangaroo court according to "natural law," which is a fancy way of saying he made it up as he went along.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example, real courts rarely permit
       <em>
        ex parte
       </em>
       proceedings where the defendants can't defend themselves. There are many, and obvious, reasons for that. Kangaroo courts don't mind
       <em>
        ex parte
       </em>
       proceedings, because the results are predetermined anyway. Guess which side of the line this guy's blog fell on?

       Pretty good description. And this "ICLCJ" is none of those. It's a "tribunal of conscience". I would also point out courts by definition do not perform the investigations of the cases they hear.

       Not to be a pedant, but I'm a pedant. I think some courts do. I was taught that German courts are "inquisitorial," for example, and that the judges are actively involved in investigations. But I don't know any more than that.

       pedantry is good in my books, bruv. I'm not aware of that, but it reminds me of some things about France too, but that may have been in the past. I will do some research into this.

       I think you know more about German law than I do! I'd imagine that the German courts are definitely dependent on the legislative and executive branches, whatever Germany calls those, but we're way beyond my actual knowledge.

       I refer to that independance in the same manner as this:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That it is not subject to improper influence from the executive or LE. I'm not 100% sure it is the case in Germany, just don't have any info to suggest it is not independant.
