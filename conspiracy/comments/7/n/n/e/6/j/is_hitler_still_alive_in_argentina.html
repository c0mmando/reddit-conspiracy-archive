    <div class="md"><p>Basically every dictator throughout history that understands that he is going to lose, will flee his capital if not abandon the country altogether. Hitler was fanatical enough to stay in Berlin to the very bitter end. What happened to him or his body is lost to history I think. I personally don&#39;t buy into any theories that he escaped, just doesn&#39;t fit for me. He would rather die with his vision for his version of a perfect nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but character consistency is factoring into plausibility.  </p>

<p>Hitler wasn&#39;t power hungry for powers sake, he wasn&#39;t in it for the fame or the money.<br/>
He was a fanatic with a vision.  </p>

<p>And him staying that fanatic to the very end is consistent and plausible.<br/>
Him fleeing cowardly to a foreign nation as a beggar for asylum, a leader in exile? And then to never hear a word from him again? Isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>You have to be on stage when the curtains fall.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why let it the vision die when it can merely go underground and get stronger in the dark?</p>

<p>Nazism was not monolithic or exclusive to Germany, the sentiment that drove the fanaticism of the <em>public</em> had roots in a more universal ignorance. Just like high ranking Nazi officials found safe harbor amidst a group of countries that would in short order become seeming experiments in fascism, just like their most eminent scientists found new homes in cutting edge the academic and military research environments of former &quot;enemies&quot;, the zeal of behind the movement stayed aflame in the hearts of authoritarian assholes the world over. The overt attempt to assert control was defeated, all the more reason for the action to move underground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is logical that he would commit suicide. Hitler saw himself as the central figure in a real life grand Wagnerian opera. He believed that his &amp; Germany&#39;s fates were inextricably bound, he WAS Germany and vice versa. Both would either emerge from the war in glorious triumph or go down together in a grand blazing spectacle of ashes, ruin, and death. All or nothing, he wouldn&#39;t live without Germany and he believed that Germany should not exist without him. Like the possessive psycho ex-husband/boyfriend who doesn&#39;t want to live without his wife/girlfriend and doesn&#39;t want her to live without him.</p>

The story does fit with his character a lot better than fleeing cowardly to somewhere, <em>especially</em> if never heard of after! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMDB: <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0363163/">Der Untergang</a>  </p>

<p>German Bernd Eichinger movie, after a biography of Traudl Jungle, Hitler&#39;s secretary.<br/>
Historically accurate depiction of the chaos and absurdity and fatalism of the last days in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;.  </p>

<p>Without any obvious dramatization or embellishments (as far as I can tell). Highly regarded by critics, should be shown in schools.  </p>

<p>Completely safe to google, it was shown on TV and im theaters, IIRC.</p>

There are eyewitnesses ALL over South America that have no reason to lie and have been scared to speak out, even 70 years after WWII ended.  The de-classified documents of the CIA and Russia both state that they believe Hitler escaped and was in South America.  Add to that that many of the highest ranking members of the nazi party escaped to SA, and you have fairly good evidence that Hitler did indeed escape and lived out his days in South America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it isn&#39;t. A skull fragment (no skeleton) was discovered in the burial pit a year after the end of the war. This was subjected to testing in 2009 by Dr. Nicholas Bellantoni who found female DNA on it. The fragment was not attached to a body, nobody involved in the recovery ever claimed it was his. But the dental remains are a separate piece of evidence and have ben confirmed as his beyond a reasonable doubt.

    <div class="md"><p>First, Gerald Williams alleged in &quot;Grey Wolf&quot; that the plane taking Hitler from Berlin made a stopover in Magdeburg. But by that time Magdeburg and all of Lower Saxony was in Allied hands. There was no safe place there for a plane carrying Hitler to land. </p>

<p>Second, the book claims that Hitler was transported to South America aboard the U-518. The U-boat was attacked, supposedly unsuccessfully with no positive ID on it and no wreckage. But U-518 was positively ID&#39;d by the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park when the captain surfaced the boat to send a weather report to Berlin. US Navy records of the engagement state that the vessel was attacked and destroyed by the destroyer escorts USS Carter &amp; USS Neal A. Scott and destroyed. The book claims that depth charges were used which failed to significantly damage the boat. But the Navy records state that the attack was conducted with hedgehogs, not depth charges. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with WW II antisubmarine munitions, but there is a significant difference between the two. Depth charges are set to detonate at a predetermined depth whether or not something is there. Hedgehogs are a projectile fired by a mortar and were equipped with contact detonators. They didn&#39;t explode unless they HIT something. Per the Navy records there were several small explosions followed by one big one, which brought wreckage to the surface. The debris aided in positively identifying the boat.</p>

<p>Third, the book alleges that Hitler was cared for until his death by a Heinrich Bethe, a former crewman of pocket battleship Adm. Graf Spee whose crew were interned in Argentina after the ship was scuttled by her captain in 1939. But archived Kriegsmarine records show that Bethe escaped from internment in 1940 and made his way back to Germany. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship Bismarck and was one of the crewmen who died when the ship sank. Bethe couldn&#39;t have cared for Hitler or anyone else after the war because he was DEAD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And of course none of them would exaggerate or fabricate or misremember their story, nor were they encouraged to do so. They tell everything with complete clarity, no embellishment or fabrication for the sake of drama. And FYI the dental evidence is more that just the word of one dentist. There were two separate independent reconstructions of Hitler&#39;s dental history. One came from Dr. Hugo Blaschke who was captured by the Americans. the other came from dental techs Kathe Heusemann and Fritz Echtmann who were captured by the Russians. Neither side shared what they had with the other, yet they matched. This would be all but impossible if there were any error or fabrication in either. These were combined with the details of the dental features of the corpse outlined in the autopsy report which was published in the West in 1968 by Lev Bezyminski. All of this was compared against verified X-rays of Hitler&#39;s skull taken in 1944 by Hitler&#39;s physician Dr. Theodor Morell which were recovered from US government archives in 1972. It&#39;s the totality of the evidence and how it all fits together in a way which would be all but impossible if any of it were falsified or in error. And in 2003 a forensic biologist named Mark Benecke went to Moscow to examine the remnants.
