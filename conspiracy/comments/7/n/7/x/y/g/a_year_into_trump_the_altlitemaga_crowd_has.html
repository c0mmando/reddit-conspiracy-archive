       Very frustrating.

      <p>
       It previously felt like the alt-lite was, well, a "light" version of the alt-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somehow, a year later, that's been lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Name one substantial policy difference between Bush-era neocons and the generic MAGA base. I'm struggling to come up with any.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alt-lite are un-ideological Trump sycophants. They'd shill for him fullheartedly regardless of how neocon or how nationalist his policies are.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are only after money and clicks to their websites. They're so blatant about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MAGApede crowd, on the other hand, are just dumb. They worship everything Trump does and will fall for any scam by people who, ostensibly, support him.

       Does bringing down the peoppe responsible for 911 include selling them 100.bloom dollars worth of weapons? How about bombing Syria? I don't remember Obama starting that war. Trump actually deported fewer illegal immigrants in 2017 than Obama did (dame span of time.)

       The Saudis were traded those weapons on the grounds that they clean their shit up, and it looks like it's working.

       The air strike in Syria killed no one and was not precursor to a larger ground war.

       Trump was
       <em>
        never

       about mass deportations (though many of his supporters wouldn't mind [not me]), so it looks like you've been reading a bit too much fake news. Border crossings are down significantly, as planned.

       Yemenese rebels are also firing missiles directly at the Saudi Royal Palace, so perhaps things are more complicated out there than fake news would have you believe.

       Why don't you point me in the direction of all this real news then bud. Last time I checked, Trump was bitching at Saudi Arabia for some of the really fucked up stuff they are doing in Yemen right now. Was that fake news too? Is there such thing as real news that isn't great for Trump? Just curious.

       Trump is a Jesuit a puppet in a Jesuit vs Illuminati war. He's taking down some pretty big cabals and that's why people think he's for real, including me for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he's just a fancy trick. It's good he's going to bring down Clinton/Bush/Rothschilds and that gang but he's going to leave Israel and the Vatican/Black Nobility.

       The people haven't realized it yet. But they will eventually, that I believe. There's no need for your anger though. That helps nobody. We need to work together, not fight. They win when we fight. They lose when we work together. Never forget that.

       so that trump statistic is misleading. sure, he did deport less, but, it was due to less illegals or something. he was definitely trying his damnedest to deport them.

       That's just what we need, more putting down of people.Trump was elected because people wanted someone who hadn't been playing the government game for years. They just wanted change.Someone who promised to shake things up. Just like the Bernie supporters. Are Bernie supporters racist, ignorant, bigots too? No. Of course not. Stop shilling man.

       Just out of curiosity, what exactly was he promising to change? The "bomb the shit out of them and their families" or the "shut down the internet to stop ISIS" part? Maybe the tax-cuts for the rich and dismantling the EPA? Is that what's so radically different about Trump? Or maybe its when he stood infront of AIPAC and told them he was proud his daughter was having a jewish baby and that he was going to be the best American president Israel has ever seen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't get it. The media blasted his reality show styled twitter drama day and night through out the election, he was put on a pedestal as an alternative candidate, a "non-politician", and people just ate it up.

       Is Trump a Nazi still? I’m confused with the Left.. you should start with them loons. Maybe that’s why Trump brought up his daughter was married to Jewish man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump did bomb the shyt out of ISIS and probably killed their families too. What’s one thing terrorists would worry about while commuting their acts? Their families. So it’s probably not the dumbest negotiating tactic to say that their families are on the table now too if you go and blow yourself up in the name of Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Shut down the internet to stop ISIS”
Not sure if you just made that up.. Or if you’re taking a Trump quote out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Tax cuts for the rich”
90% of middle class families will be getting a tax cut.
Will the top 20% get more of the share from the 1.5 trillion tax cut (keep your own money)?
Sure, they also pay 90% of all the taxes so it makes sense they would see the most of the money.

       Yeah you seem pretty angry. I think his main campaign points were about bringing jobs back to the country and immigration reform. I could very well be wrong about that, I didn't vote for him or follow his campaign, but I highly doubt what you posted above were included in his campaign promises. Again, we've all gotta stop and recognize that we're all in this together. And that just because I may have different views than you on things doesn't mean that either one of us are bigots or uneducated. Do you get what I'm saying? Here's to 2018!

       Which massive foreign wars are being supported, exactly? 
Are you for the oppressive regime in Iran and the Ayatollah?
Avoiding issues of identity?
There has been a huge decline in illegal immigration, as well as a decrease in deportations.

       Not really.  The missile attack on Syria was a ploy.  The missiles were outdated and reports after the strike indicated the base was barely damaged.  ISIS has lost a ton of land and that's good.  The decision on Ukraine was dumb but I have a feeling that was to direct attention away from Russia.  Now with the Iran stuff it really comes down to what you want.  I personally think Trump isn't going to do anything and is just tweeting out hints and small threats to move the situation in the direction he wants.  More time needs to pass before making a conclusion on Iran.

      <p>
       It's really hard to take action with a sluggish and unreliable Senate.  The House is probably fine but the Senate sucks.  I really think Trump wants to do more on immigration but he gets stopped at every turn.  The travel bans faced legal challenges, and his attempted moves on DACA were unsuccessful.  Hopefully he is able to get the wall funded and chain immigration out in a deal with Democrats but idk if it'll happen.  As much as anyone hates to say it, including myself, Trump needs the establishment to get anything done.  Of course, the establishment needs Trump to stay in office and get re-elected.  Look at McConnell.  He was opposed to Trump at the beginning of the year and now he's a huge ally.  Why?  Because he knew if he went against Trump that he wouldn't stand a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's admin hasn't been perfect, and it's had rough times and he's made mistakes.  But I don't think any of the issues you brought up are really things that Trump himself is doing wrong.
