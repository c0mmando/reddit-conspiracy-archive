        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a kind of wildcard post. It just some relevance to this sub, since often I see medical conspiracies discussed here particularly with regards to engineered viruses and hidden cures. </p>

<p>So, genital herpes sufferer since this year. It has broken me - and I was already broken and at rock bottom before this happened. I had an alt on the herpes subreddit but the mods are so vicious and spiteful that I find it intolerable to go back there, even just to ask an innocuous question or plea for support. </p>

<p>Back to the conspiracy side of things. There are many fad-like YouTube vids claiming that the herpes virus can be cured with a raw food diet, combining consumption (orally and topically) of oregano oil. Much of this stems from a Caribbean witch doctor called Dr Sebi late last century, who apparently was able to cure sicknesses. Maybe he did or maybe he didn&#39;t. He&#39;s dead now. </p>

<p>This oregano oil &#39;cure&#39; seems like another nonsense fad, and the actors in the videos promoting it look insincere and like they&#39;re doing it for the money (they sell their own oregano oils that are the &#39;most pure&#39;). </p>

<p>If anyone does have some further insight on herpes or experience, please speak up. I want 2018 to be the year I cure my PPD, depression and herpes and start living life again on my own terms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice is to ease into it. I’ve been vegan for almost two years, began for health reasons, morphed into spiritual / ethical. I tried raw for a couple weeks about a year in, found it pretty challenging. Now I’ve been listening to my body and eliminating things that cause irritation / inflammation, like gluten and beans. I eat about 50% raw and have not been sick now for 6 months. This feels like a miracle because for several years I was sick pretty much a week a month. </p>

<p>There are tons of people who’ve cured cancer, reversed diabetes and heart disease, and stopped other severe chronic illnesses through a well-planned Plant-based diet. Glad you aren’t listening to other commenter who wrote about Joe Rogan ep. Not only can it be very healthy for your body, it is liberating for your mind.</p>

Having said that, in my experience I wouldn&#39;t jump into being a raw vegan, otherwise it will be a shock to your lifestyle which will cause you to cheat and then you will beat yourself up for cheating which will cause you to give up entirely. If you are a meat eater now, I would just transition to vegetarian, vegan then raw vegan. Best of luck to you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cure</p>

<p>How to reverse the positive test result. </p>

<p>First, the fine work of Dr. Arnold Ehret predates Dr. Sebi’s. Dr Ehret’s books on fasting and diet are well worth reading before attempting any protocol.</p>

<p>The emphasis of diet and healing techniques of the 2 Dr.’s is similar. Except that Dr. Sebi didn’t really emphasize the Raw diet from what I recall and Sebi’s work is vague. Ehrets work is dated but more detailed and Sebi is not a real doctor. </p>

<p>Originally I tested positive for hsv-2 twice consecutively(significant?) then after some therapy I tested equivocal twice consecutively. However I couldn’t get the negative result that I wanted and I think I know why. The heavy metal were present. </p>

<p>The Sebi protocol is vague and needs to be interpreted. (Ehrets answers many of the unanswered fasting &amp; diet questions in his book.) </p>

<p>Sebi says:</p>

<p>The 1st step:
 is to detoxify the body by fasting. This would involve removing:
A) metals &amp; toxins
B)bacteria
C)fungus 
D)viruses </p>

<p>Dealing with one ailment at a time.</p>

<p>How long do we fast for? It depends on the state of toxicity. First before fasting chelation therapy might be needed. Fasting won’t pass metals. Dr. Ehrets says and I agree that when detoxing metals you need the help of a doctor. I 100% agree for safety reasons (kidney health) and I’m not a fan of most doctors. </p>

<p>The 2nd step:
Practice fasting or a series of fasts:
Ehrets goes into great detail about fasting in his books. </p>

<p>3rd step
Fungus remover.
I found a sodium thiosulphate detox and dr. Jennifer Gardner’s Candida cleaner protocol by using medical grade turpentine to be effective. </p>

<p>4th step:
Long fast &amp; anti-virals 
Drink tea 5 times a day or order the Sebi products. I don’t think all of them are necessary and I suspect are a bit of a ploy but the Iron plus makes sense. </p>

<p>5th step
Raw food Mucous-less diet 
Sebi says to avoid: 
Avocado (fats?)
Chic peas (legumes/beans?)
Quinoa (grains?)
Sugars (fruit?)</p>

<p>So I interpret it this way. Avoid fatty foods (nuts &amp; seeds &amp; oils), grains, legumes, fruits and obviosly protein rich foods lol.</p>

<p>So this leaves us with mostly specific raw greens. He says eat lots of salads like chips, Mushrooms, and squash. But eating raw squash sounds weird or cooking it might slow the healing process. </p>

<p>Right now I’ve been on a health seeking mission for sometime dealing with a very high amounts of metal toxins. When it’s gone I will move on to step 2 and onward until I get the test result that I want. Really I don’t want to rely on too many other people for answers and I like to figure out things by trying out different methods. 
So I’m sure that I will be attacked for having a less mainstream point of view. We all have different beliefs and I try to respect this. </p>

<p>*** a few last things. Before you decide to try a curing protocol I would suggest checking your IODINE LEVELS first. A simple skin test. Get your levels up by MEGA DOSING if need be. This will help the body detox process. Not only that it removes THALLIUM from the body. So it’s necessary. Switching to a RAW FOOD DIET from the start is tough but will speed up the detox process and provide additional nutritional benefit. For safety reasons if you do a long fast be sure to research how to break the fast properly. I hope this info might be useful****</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a herpes sufferer here, but i can offer a little insight about the mechanism.</p>

<p>Im sure you know that once you have it it lives on inside of you forever. </p>

<p>The reason outbreaks occur is when the body is run down it panics “oh no this body is going to die, i better get to the surface so i can be passed on to another host”.</p>

<p>So really your best defence is staying as fit and healthy as you can. This includes trying to stay positive because depression can really effect your immunity. I know way easier said than done.</p>

<p>I cant comment on the oregano oil but a raw diet sounds like a really good start.
I hope that helps, good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand the nature of a virus, bacterium and a fungus.</p>

<p>In the killing microbes game, you use fungus to kill bacteria, bacteria to kill bacteria, and viruses to kill bacteria. You use dead virus to create resistance to viral loads, and immune-support to create a hyper responsive immune system. </p>

<p>For fungus, you take deprive them of nutriants (candida), take a steroidal application, and apply a cream that disrupts  reproductive cycles or is &#39;anti-fungal&#39; (oregano).  </p>

<p>So, where are you?</p>

<p>You have been exposed to a sub-dermal virus that can not currently be &#39;cured&#39;, but can be in remission enough to not be infectious; although, anti-body markers will show you have HSV(I/II).</p>

<p>In that, you have the only necessary option of never compromising your immune system. Second, there exists a complete lack of options for HSV &#39;cures&#39;, but treatments options are pharmaceutical, and theoretically, they&#39;ll use sound and phage to kill HSV infections. </p>

<p>Here is a bit of relevancy: The HSV infection is very common, even among developed nations. In the time of 16-18th century (16-18,000 H.E), It was as common as most chlamydia infections would be now.</p>

<p>In-fact, a bacterial infection like Chlamydia or syphilitic infection, would be disastrous. As opposed to an itch everyone got from fucking betwixt a whore&#39;s legs. HSV is stigmatized because of its inability to be cured - yet, it is no more dangerous than HPV (which can be deadly in some cases).</p>

<p>The only case in which HSV can be deadly is if the bacterium travels to the brain. This can cause severe memory issues, but the chances of this type of infection are VERY slim. People write psychological case-studies on the double-dissociation results. </p>

<p>IN other words, friend.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t spread your infection. Yet, consider the condition not of the same as a mass looking from a position within the box. Look at the condition from the position of a being in time, with a particular place to think from. This position elucidates how harmless your infection can be, and how easy you have it, compared to the guy who got syphilis in 1784 C.E. (17,84 H.E.)</p>

<p>Antibitotics are fungus, mostly.</p>

<p>phage are bacteria killing virus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister has had good results limiting her intake of arginine (amino acid) by avoiding foods that contain it like nuts and seeds, and using oral l-lysine preemptively. She tried the oil of oregano thing and said it had no effect.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mentioning because if you&#39;re loading up on nuts and seeds going the vegan route, you may be inadvertently exacerbating the problem. </p>

<p>Hope you find some physical and mental peace.</p>
