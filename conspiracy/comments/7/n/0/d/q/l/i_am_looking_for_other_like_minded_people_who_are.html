    <div class="md"><p>The Joke. Have you ever heard the statement, &quot;the question, and the answer.&quot; If you&#39;re a human being, what if your Creator decided to play the cruelest joke on you, to make you in his like image but decided to shunt your potential? I don&#39;t think you need to speak with other humans to find the truth; you&#39;re Creator hid it from you by hiding it inside you - DNA. You may recall, a few years back some Scientist said humans have sizable amount of junk DNA!!! You&#39;re Creator didn&#39;t build you wit Junk, just deactivated your potential - turning down your full capacity. Ever wondered why Humans only use a small portion of their brains. The Brain is the super-processor, that can do things you Humans can not imagine, you&#39;re DNA is the supercomputer that executes the instructions to preform things humans can&#39;t even imagine. But, if you could well over 80% of the things you do physically would become obsolete. Time and space as constraints would cease to exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The beings you&#39;re talking about in the Law of One aren&#39;t even the same as the Annunaki. Moreover, we were never a slave race, so folks like Stitchin are wrong about that too. </p>

<p>Anything implicitly negative, fear provoking and disempowering about the human race shouldn&#39;t be trusted, period. </p>

<p>We were not created either. We evolved as any other race did. We were however experimented on and had our DNA altered, by different races, not just the likes of the Annunaki. Stop reading fear porn and go with your gut instead. </p>

<p>Do you not think the Elite are being divided within there own collective?
I believe they are.</p>

<p>They are loosing the fight and starting to stomp on there own toes just to keep hold of our people. And personally, I see Humanity growing consciously ... </p>

<p>And that&#39;s what needs to happen!</p>

We are as humanity clearly showing we have had enough of being censored / Controlled / - Waking up to the power &amp; creative LOVE within them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Joke. Have you ever heard the statement, &quot;the question, and the answer.&quot; If you&#39;re a human being, what if your Creator decided to play the cruelest joke on you, to make you in his like image but decided to shunt your potential? I don&#39;t think you need to speak with other humans to find the truth; you&#39;re Creator hid it from you by hiding it inside you - DNA. You may recall, a few years back some Scientist said humans have sizable amount of junk DNA!!! You&#39;re Creator didn&#39;t build you wit Junk, just deactivated your potential - turning down your full capacity. Ever wondered why Humans only use a small portion of their brains. The Brain is the super-processor, that can do things you Humans can not imagine, you&#39;re DNA is the supercomputer that executes the instructions to preform things humans can&#39;t even imagine. But, if you could well over 80% of the things you do physically would become obsolete. Time and space as constraints would cease to exist.</p>
