       I AM SEEKING others who are like minded and wishing to dive deep into our HIS-STORY " History". Meme Makers, ect..
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everything we are taught from birth is a LIE and maybe for a good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people as we know in power that wish to hide the truth and they will go to great length to hide it. 
I can not do this alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need you.
I need you to think, think deep, think outside of the box!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know your thoughts.
Thank you ahead of time.

       The Joke. Have you ever heard the statement, "the question, and the answer." If you're a human being, what if your Creator decided to play the cruelest joke on you, to make you in his like image but decided to shunt your potential? I don't think you need to speak with other humans to find the truth; you're Creator hid it from you by hiding it inside you - DNA. You may recall, a few years back some Scientist said humans have sizable amount of junk DNA!!! You're Creator didn't build you wit Junk, just deactivated your potential - turning down your full capacity. Ever wondered why Humans only use a small portion of their brains. The Brain is the super-processor, that can do things you Humans can not imagine, you're DNA is the supercomputer that executes the instructions to preform things humans can't even imagine. But, if you could well over 80% of the things you do physically would become obsolete. Time and space as constraints would cease to exist.

       I'd start with the oldest civilization that we know of that that recorded their history, the Sumerians. Check the creation story with Enki and Enlil. Hope you have an open mind.

       To either EVOLVE Consciousness to that of them?
or DIE as their ( Harvest ).
      </p>

       See,
There is channeled information known as THE LAW OF ONE which speaks of a harvest.

       What Harvest?
What does it mean to Harvest?

       The beings you're talking about in the Law of One aren't even the same as the Annunaki. Moreover, we were never a slave race, so folks like Stitchin are wrong about that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything implicitly negative, fear provoking and disempowering about the human race shouldn't be trusted, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were not created either. We evolved as any other race did. We were however experimented on and had our DNA altered, by different races, not just the likes of the Annunaki. Stop reading fear porn and go with your gut instead.

       I agree 100%. However, Think about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think the Elite are being divided within there own collective?
I believe they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are loosing the fight and starting to stomp on there own toes just to keep hold of our people. And personally, I see Humanity growing consciously ...

      <p>
       And that's what needs to happen!

       They were once divided, and then united. Now they're divided again due to this time period of awakening. Its good see this in my lifetime; never thought people like you or I would.

       This is an amazing time to be here and be alive indeed.
We are as humanity clearly showing we have had enough of being censored / Controlled / - Waking up to the power &amp; creative LOVE within them.

      <p>
       The system does not like to be challenged nor does the few like those that speak out? To get attention when teaching this above.

       The Joke. Have you ever heard the statement, "the question, and the answer." If you're a human being, what if your Creator decided to play the cruelest joke on you, to make you in his like image but decided to shunt your potential? I don't think you need to speak with other humans to find the truth; you're Creator hid it from you by hiding it inside you - DNA. You may recall, a few years back some Scientist said humans have sizable amount of junk DNA!!! You're Creator didn't build you wit Junk, just deactivated your potential - turning down your full capacity. Ever wondered why Humans only use a small portion of their brains. The Brain is the super-processor, that can do things you Humans can not imagine, you're DNA is the supercomputer that executes the instructions to preform things humans can't even imagine. But, if you could well over 80% of the things you do physically would become obsolete. Time and space as constraints would cease to exist.
