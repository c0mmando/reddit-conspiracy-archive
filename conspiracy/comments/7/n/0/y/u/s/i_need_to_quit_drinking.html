        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been interested in conspiracy theories since the early 90&#39;s. The more I learn the more I drink. I have stumbled across things that I should not have seen. Which led me to drink more. I am highly functional. I am employed and have a wonderful family. But it is difficult to continue without something to numb my senses. Every day is a fucking struggle. I constantly feel alone. I have to keep my mouth shut and go on as if I know nothing. I am thankful for this community even though I rarely post or comment. I made it 8 days without a drop of alcohol. And then I picked it back up. The booze killed my father and his father at an early age. I don&#39;t want to join that club. I don&#39;t use other drugs anymore. Kratom fixed that problem. So, what I would like to know... How do you continue life without pounding liquor every day to escape reality? I would love to live a long healthy life but I am constantly tortured by the truth of what I know, what I have seen and experienced. I just can&#39;t seem to back away from the bottle. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been drinking at least a fifth of whiskey or more daily, for over a decade. My body is starting to give up on me. I was raised in a strict Irish Catholic family. I have given up on religion but I most certainly believe in a God. I have died a couple of times and I know that there is much more. I do not fear death anymore, but I have a family that needs me. And I need them. It is very difficult to stay sober and grounded most days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you gotta stick in there for your family man, know that in the end good WILL over come evil... also it helps to just stop looking at conspiracy type stuff that would bum you out/ worry you. Sorta put it out of your mind.. I feel like I would go insane if I just sat there and thought about it all the time. Just know there’s really nothing you can do but ride it out and enjoy your time here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit drinking because I realized you can&#39;t escape reality. You can run from it with alcohol/substance abuse but once you sober up, there reality is... right where it was all along.</p>

<p>One day I realized how much of a waste of time getting drunk was. I found myself in a loop of getting drunk but not taking care of my responsibilities. Day in day out. I got sick of that situation and decided it was enough. That was maybe 3 years ago.</p>

<p>What I did to keep me on track was mostly diet and health related. I massively cut out sugar and carbs. I quit fast food. I cook almost all of my meals (minus when I&#39;m out with friends or at family gatherings). I do strength training exercises with only my own body weight and a pair of rusty dumbbells that I own, because I don&#39;t really have the money for a gym and I don&#39;t like working out in a social setting anyway.</p>

<p>I realized that I lacked discipline. I believe that any adult who wants to be successful in life needs discipline.</p>

<p>I have a long way to go but the daily struggle of keeping myself in check is what keeps me sober. Every time I force myself to do something I don&#39;t want to and stop myself from getting drunk or high is a small victory for me and another step cl9ser to being a more disciplined person.</p>

<p>If not for you, do it for your family. Your posting this shows you see the negative effects your drinking has in your life. We all have the power to cease our bad habits. It takes discipline to muster up the strength to do so, though.</p>

<p>You can do it. I&#39;d wish you luck but this doesn&#39;t involve luck. Just your will and the love for your family should get you through this.</p>

<p>Looking forward to your &quot;I did it!&quot; post. Take care!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I managed to get through the withdrawal alive this time around. It was brutal. I had the shakes, bugs crawling under my skin, vivid nightmares and other horrific things happening. Booze is always around in my family so it is more difficult to quit. Now I know I can get through the physical withdrawal, but the psychological is a different beast. I really appreciate your support. I am not going to give up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent work brotha.  Gotta find that balance.  There are those of us that by nature do things excessively.  Like top comment mentions, focusing on building healthy habits is way easier than removing bad ones and leaving a void.  I know personally my first go to for filling voids.</p>

<p>Be wary of the AA cult stuff, but we each have our own road, ymmv.</p>

<p>For me a big paradigm shift was getting over this Western notion that life has to be amazing.  Once I focused on appreciating things just being okay life got exponentially easier and less stressful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats on having made it 8 days. Shoot for 9 next time. </p>

<p>I watched my dad go down that hole. I&#39;m proud that he was able to dig himself back out, but it left him a shell. My granddad made it to 45. I hope you have better luck.</p>

<p>How do I not drink? I have a tequila or Moonshine rule. I only allow myself to drink tequila or Shine. Since I can&#39;t function on either and usually end up singing karaoke in a panda suit or a grass skirt, it keeps me from drinking often enough to stay away from alcohol, except on rare occsions. Pick something like Potin. You definitely won&#39;t function on that.</p>

<p>As for the stress of knowing shit? The first step is accepting you can&#39;t take care of anyone other than yourself. Then you accept that what &#39;truths&#39; you find, will not always be accepted, so there is no point in seeking approval or justification. Since you have a family, accept that you&#39;re going to have to play the game to an extent for their benefit. You can&#39;t force others into your truths, but you can pick which battles you take on to have some balance. </p>

<p>The world is a fucking cesspool and will probably cave into itself, but you still have something real and beautiful with your family. focus on them for strength to give you some hope to keep maintaining. </p>

<p>I&#39;m being harsh out of love, from one scrappy, little bastard to another.  Take of it what you will, just know that you aren&#39;t alone. </p>

<p>Most importantly, do what makes you happy. if that means going offline, to try and connect with real life, dooo it. we all need a break every once in a while.</p>

Yeah, nature does magic, something to try, i havent tried it myself, but i see a lot of people in these circles do it, earthing, or just go barefeet on the ground outside. Apparently it helps with stress and whatnot. Breathing exercises helps a lot too, and if you start doing those meditating will come naturally. Both of those take only 30mintues to an hour depending on what you want. 
Bad eating habbits will also make anyone more depressed, so if thats something you should change, I strongly suggest you do it!</p>

<p>Good luck brother, and stay healthy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit drinking the night I was driving home, fairly bombed, hand over 1 eye, and, with my last shred of Reason (alcohol impairs judgement), realized that I live in a nice little town, and, if I&#39;m going to be in the newspaper, it will be because I told them what to say. That was enough for me. 7+ years now, not a drop.
   After a short while, I began to see Big Alcohol a different way- Fake &#39;Freedom&#39; peddled for outrageous profit by licensed gangsters, and an excuse for the bulls to run the slaves around the plantation. Prize and Punishment, all in one.
   First thing you&#39;ll notice is how less fuzzy and miserable you&#39;ll feel when you wake. No more sick green draft beer blasts on the toilet.  I get up, without a headache, enjoy a good cup of coffee, and spark up that first bowl of the day. Aaaaahhh...
   Quitting alcohol wasn&#39;t that difficult for me - No shakes, DTs. If you&#39;re an alcoholic, you may want a medical professional&#39;s guidance.  But, once you&#39;re off it, you&#39;ll start seeing through A LOT of BS the Man has established around Booze Culture to keep the slaves in line, like you&#39;re wearing They Live glasses.</p>

<li><p>The way alcohol works is by stripping the thin film of oil that coats your red blood cells. Stripped of this oil, they can no longer freely slide through the tiny capillaries to deliver oxygen to, say, your brain. Everything gets numb and you make bad decisions because alcohol is making your body malfunction. Why would you intentionally make your body malfunction?</p></li>

<p>After nearly seven years working with Drug and Alcohol treatment facility I can attest that alcohol is A BITCH! It&#39;s acceptable in society and you can buy it on every corner! Deadly to quit cold turkey but you know this, baby steps!</p>

<p>Read up on <strong>Cognitive Behavior</strong>. Change the <em>trained brain response</em> by making physical changes to your environment that reinforces the learned <em>urge</em>! Move your computer habit where you might sit and drink and isolate...</p>

<p>Example: Smokers and that morning coffee, first smoke...move your coffee pot, the filters, the coffee beans, grinder, your coffee cup. It forces your brain to start rewiring the steps that lead to that morning smoke. Make it crazy to get the fix!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone as far as encouraging people to move which side of the bed they sleep on and get out of or the direction the bed faces. Move your tooth brush? Yes. Small things like this do help. <strong>Whatever one can do to fire the brain cells to rethink steps!</strong></p>

<p>Sugar will feel like consolation - so read up on your nutritional needs! Certain foods or food experiences will make you crave a drink...know what those are and share them with your partner! That favorite dish or eatery is part of the <em>comfort and soothing</em> that tells your brain &#39;This is gonna be good&#39; - your damned brain is lying!</p>

<p>Self care! Self care! Self care! </p>

<p>How do you continue life without pounding liquor every day to escape reality?</p>

<p>How does your stomach not stop you for you? lol like take kratom 4-5 times in a row, and I feel like shit stomach wise for a week. Pound hard liquor and it&#39;s the same story. Zantac (knock off ranitidine really) saved my bacon when I was drinking too much, but oh man what really made me stop was realizing how much pain I was putting myself in by drinking liquor/kratom teas, and then both of them just looked like pain when I would consider drinking them. </p>

<p>Also, whip yourself up some DMT. Really drives home these sorts of lessons; makes it easier for the stuff you realize to actually impact your behavior. Doesn&#39;t take much either. </p>

<p>Among the more commonly used coping mechanisms are:</p>

<p>Support</p>

<p>Talking about a stressful event with a supportive person can be an effective way to manage stress. Seeking external support instead of self-isolating and internalizing the effects of stress can often greatly reduce the negative effects of a difficult situation.</p>

<p>Relaxation</p>

<p>Any number of relaxing activities can help people cope with stressful situations. Relaxing activities may include practicing meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or calming techniques; sitting in nature; or listening to soft music, for example.</p>

<p>Problem-solving</p>

<p>This coping mechanism involves identifying a problem that is causing stress and then developing and putting into action some potential solutions for effectively managing it.</p>

<p>Humor</p>

<p>Making light of a stressful situation may help people maintain perspective and prevent the situation from becoming overwhelming.</p>

<p>Physical activity</p>

<p>Exercise can serve, for many people, as a natural and healthy form of stress relief. Running, yoga, swimming, walking, dance, team sports, and many other types of physical activity can help people cope with stressful situations and the aftereffects of traumatic events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try this:</p>

<p>Make a pros and cons list of qutting:</p>

<p>-: sobriety sucks in the beginning, boredom, lose a way to rid the anxiety/stress, lose a hobby, might not be able to go out to certain areas, might have have to make new friends, etc</p>

<p>+: health picks up again, saves money, proud of yourself, builds courage by facing reality, a hero to your children, a Man to your wife, no longer an addict, clear head, confidence, you will find productive hobbies in place(exercise, reading, music, meditation), you don&#39;t have to worry anymore about your impending alcohol related doom.. etc</p>

<p>This is just what I can think of but I recommend you make your own list. And then post it on your bedroom wall and take a picture of it so that you can look at it whenever the cravings come.</p>

<p>Next step:</p>

<p>The 7 Times Rule: The goal is to resist 7 <em>intense</em> cravings, the ones where you are about to relapse, and keep track of them. You can do this in your head but I highly recommend actually tallying it somewhere. But the point is to keep track of how many times you have resisted your cravings. 7 is a lucky number, it&#39;s also God&#39;s number so if you are a spiritual person(you pray to God or the Universe) to give you strength to overcome the cravings. Just a simple one sentence prayer will do it.</p>

<p>After the prayer, pull out the pros and cons list. Read through all of the pros of drinking and then look at all of the cons. But when you reach the cons(of drinking) spend a lot of time visualizing how amazing those benefits truly will be, especially as to how it will benefit you as a Father.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the fun part and this is important. If you can resist 7 cravings, you get to drink a 6 pack of your choice! I&#39;m serious. You earned it. So every time you are resisting an urge and tallying each victory, keep in mind that&#39;s what will be your reward. Of course, after that 6 pack, you go back to to the 7 Times Rule/pros and cons list. You repeat this over and over again until you have created new neural maps in your brain which allows you to moderate your drinking. You will no longer be drinking to escape or to self-medicate, but you will be earning each 6 pack while simultaneously re-enforcing and developing those sides of yourself you feel you are lacking in.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best. God Bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to drink two glasses of wine a day after work.  I noticed that when I came home and drank I got this happy feeling, like a nice little buzz and a feeling of relaxation.  </p>

<p>I stopped drinking for a month out of concern I might be a &quot;functional alcoholic&quot;.  I didn&#39;t think I was an alcoholic since I was never drunk BUT  I sure went straight to the wine the minute I got in the door.  </p>

<p>After not drinking for an entire month, I noticed when I had my first glass of wine that I very curiously I didn&#39;t get the happy buzzed feeling with it.</p>

<p>This made me think the happy buzz relaxation feeling I got was more like a withdrawl symptom being quenched, like a junkie getting a fix.  I didn&#39;t like that idea.</p>

<p>I have stopped drinking except for &quot;occasions&quot;.  Like when friends come over, or it&#39;s a holiday, or on a Saturday night. </p>

<p>Try viewing alcohol like something you only have on occasions and only allow yourself two.  This worked for me because I know I like the taste of it entirely too much to be a tea totaller for life.  </p>

<p>For the stress, exercise works best.  Nothing much, just a brief walk with the dog around the block improves my outlook.  I used to sit on the porch with the dogs and have the glass of wine and relax. 
 Now I sit on the porch with the dogs with a glass of iced tea and feel just as relaxed.</p>

<p>Honestly....I know it sounds silly but it worked...give it a try.</p>

I&#39;ve been going through the exact same thing (seeing/realizing some shit I can&#39;t escape, like social media pages of very eerie stuff that just confirms all the horrifying stuff), and what has helped me is RELAXING. Replacing the bad habits like drugs and alcohol with milder stuff, like a really hot and long shower, followed by some nice tea or hot chocolate in a blanket every other night, watching old comedy sketches. Anything comforting and nostalgic. You also have to remember that you can&#39;t change the world, you can only fix issues in your immediate vicinity. Focus on helping yourself before you worry about what some sick assholes do. It&#39;s all temporary, and all you can do is hope for the best and be the best that YOU can be. You&#39;re the &quot;trillionth x eternity&quot; individual to go through this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stay away from alcohol by staying busy. It&#39;s the downtime, when I&#39;m not engaged, that gets me in trouble. Idle hands are the devil&#39;s workshop or somesuch other thing.  If you&#39;ve got some hobbies, invest more time and effort in them. If you have none, get some. Things like exercise, woodworking, music, yo-yos.. they can all be meditative and serve to free your brain from fixating on the alcohol and the fucked up shit. I personally have way too many hobbies for my own good, but my life would be miserable if I wasn&#39;t able to make things. Make anything. Dedicate yourself to perfecting a craft. I stay busy enough with woodworking, stained glass, repurposing old shit, fixing up my house. </p>

<p>If hobbies aren&#39;t your thing, invest your time in other people.. your family, your community, your elders or youngers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend some soul searching.  :)  What do you feel is important in life?  What is good?</p>

<p>I eventually returned to Christ.  I believe God will make things right in the end.  While I am here, it is most important for me to love with all of my heart, soul, and mind, God and to love my neighbors, such as yourself, as myself.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 4:4</p>

<p>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</p>

<p>1 John 5:19</p>

<p>We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:12</p>

<p>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.</p>

<p>I hope you are able to find peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being Irish myself I believe in our genetic predisposition to addiction particularly alcohol.  I am 5 years sober and I quit as it brought me to my knees mentally, physically and spiritually.  You could try a 12 step program - it may not be for you but the shared experiences of others in recovery can be a great source of strength and encouragement - you can walk away if it&#39;s not for you.  </p>

<p>If you have suffered such a bad physical withdrawal then you realise that the drinking gig is up.  Although you attribute your drinking to your knowledge gained since the early 90s it is very likely earlier and deeper issues are the root causes of the addiction.  I am a believer in the &#39;Iceberg Theory of Addiction&#39;.  Addictions/behaviours are the part of the iceberg showing above the surface but below the line in the remaining larger part are the hidden causes such as anger, depression, resentments, lack of self worth, and a huge amount of fear.  This may explain why your increasing knowledge is creating fear and feeding the addiction at the same time. Like you I was raised in a strict Catholic family and that is a fear based/dysfunctional start to life!</p>

<p>As others have said here - step away from your computer for a while - connect with nature and enjoy your family.  The knowledge you have gained should not lead you lowering your consciousness with fear of reality being blotted out by alcohol - there is beauty and truth in humankind and not all inhabitants of this planet are bad.   </p>

<p>Take the advice on nutrition and exercise by the kind people on here as they are vital to your mental wellbeing.  Good luck!  I made it and I just wish I had done it years earlier.  Let us know how you get on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Plato’s allegory of the cave. To summarize it (because I don’t have a link to give you). It’s about these people who have lived in a cave their whole lives being shown nothing but shadow puppets on the wall and that is what they perceive reality to be. Then when one escapes and is faced with what is real in the world small things terrify them. When they finally see the reality of the world they decide it is far too harsh and go back to the cave and watch the shadow puppets and neglect the reality that they witnessed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see lots of comments here and most are positive which is great.  I also had to give it up because it honestly is too much.  Sometimes I think this sub is bad for me because it is a constant stream of good versus evil, exposing the evil and how close we are all becoming to blowing the lid off of the bad guys.  But in reality, that will never happen.  It really is disheartening and yet I come in here daily to stay on top of reality because that is what this place is.  It&#39;s reality.  There really are devil worshiping politicians that bang children and our &quot;voting&quot; didn&#39;t do anything to put them there or keep them from being there.  It&#39;s all a sham and unless you have your own country, you are not a player in this game.  Even millionaires that get red pilled also have very bad things happen to them and lets face it: Most of us will never be that wealthy so we all have to live in our little world where we have no control or say about what is happening in it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s. Deeply.  Depressing. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s no wonder we drink to make it better.  Drinking is a quick salve to heal the immediate, but what it really is doing is pushing the shit farther down the road.  I sometimes think that drinking is like a tractor pull...The longer you do it, the heavier the load.  Eventually something will break and you have to start all over again.  It&#39;s a no-win so why play the game?  </p>

<p>For me, booze is not the healer here.  I find a good combination of certain strains of THC help calm the nerves, fight the depression and cure the anxiety.  Booze seems helpful up front but only makes it worse in the end. </p>

<p>I also started conspiracy type thinking in the 90&#39;s when a work buddy showed me these strange lines in the sky and said &quot;You know that&#39;s not natural, right?&quot; and down the rabbit hole I went.  I&#39;ve been mistrustful ever since and honestly, it makes it very difficult to be with other normies that think it&#39;s crazy to think that a massive concentrated effort has been happening for 20+ years by the government.  For me, I always try to think of the bright side:  Perhaps the chemtrails we all see are because the government knows something about the earth that is a deal-killer so they implemented a spray program to control the weather to keep the circus act on the ground from coming apart.  </p>

<p>In the end, my long rant/comment here is about drinking and why it&#39;s not a good idea any more.   I think every person asks themselves this question at SOME point in their lives.  Some take longer than others and this might be your moment, OP.  I&#39;m not saying for you to stop but maybe think of that tractor pull next time you imbibe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent work brotha.  Gotta find that balance.  There are those of us that by nature do things excessively.  Like top comment mentions, focusing on building healthy habits is way easier than removing bad ones and leaving a void.  I know personally my first go to for filling voids.</p>

<p>Be wary of the AA cult stuff, but we each have our own road, ymmv.</p>

<p>For me a big paradigm shift was getting over this Western notion that life has to be amazing.  Once I focused on appreciating things just being okay life got exponentially easier and less stressful.</p>
