       For the last few years, a common theme in movies, and especially comic book movies, are alien invasions, and the appearance or return of a powerful and evil being to Earth. In at least two movies, the alien invasion is via some type of portal.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, The Avengers (The Chitauri and Loki), Justice League (Parademons and Steppenwolf), Avengers: Infinity War (Thanos), and X-Men: Apocalypse (Apocalypse).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, the band Judas Priest, whose music is slap full of dark and possibly prophetic lyrics (Especially their albums Defenders of the Faith and Painkiller), made a song called "Night Crawler."
      </p>
      <p>
       The lyrics contain this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Straight out of hell, one of a kind, stalking his victim, don't look behind you, Night Crawler
      </p>
      <p>
       Beware the beast in black, Night Crawler
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You know he's coming back
       </em>
       , Night Crawler"
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I mention my hypothesis, let me be clear that in my hypotheis, I am not talking about a Christian-type end times, but just a generic end times that will contain a battle between good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there is something coming soon. Maybe there is going to be an "alien invasion" via a portal (Why would aliens use a "portal"; one would think they would just show up in spacecraft and start invading. "Inter-dimensional portal" just reeks of evil spirits), followed, accompanied, or proceeded by, the arrival of a powerful and evil spiritual entity. And, perhaps the masses are being conditioned to not question, and to accept, such an event(s)...

       evil entity or not we have the choice to just love and be present for those who are around us.  it doesn't really matter what this fake reality is.  the only thing that really matters are other people and your experiences with them.  we're in a weird hell and by remembering that love keeps us together we can overcome anything.

       agreed!  very important.  i guess one way to think about it is to just try to help your neighbour and be content with the actual direct supportive change you can give, and not to get caught up in unnecessary drama.

       you can "hate" whatever you want.  i'm not the hate police.  go do whatever you want.  but you may find that "hate" is kinda shitty regardless of the target.  it doesn't really help anything, so good luck with that.  although of course there are some nuance-y edge conditions where language could be tighter with regards to this, but i digress.

       I have a fun theory where the aliens arrived here and offered us their knowledge and technology. One of the main clauses to this was that the people in charge of these gifts had to be completely open and honest to the rest of the human race.
 Greed and power soon corrupted this agreement and the technology began to be supressed from the general populous... Hollywood became manipulated by tptb and as the aliens have no idea about our primitive entertainment, they simply do not understand it, it was believed by them that these films are the disclosure. 
Perhaps these blockbuster films and entertainment are described to the aliens as educational and part of the agreement. Therefore secret groups and eletes get to hold onto the technology and knowledge to decieve the masses aswell as the said aliens.

       Ehhh, I tend to think the aliens would be able to figure out what was going on...If the rest of us don't have the tech, then clearly TPIC (the people in charge) arent doing as they were supposed to do...

       To be fair the examples you gave are all COMIC BOOK movies and alien/dimensional invasions are a recurring theme in comics.

       i was brought up christian and had the belief God was evil .. not just evil but super evil ..
      </p>
      <p>
       he created man , kept him locked up in a garden . forbid him to eat a fruit that would make him smarter . punished a serpent being for offering the fruit to man (Eve)
      </p>
      <p>
       sent a deluge to destroy man . saved only a few . destroyed man again at Sodom and Gumarah
      </p>
      <p>
       had a slave race (Angels) , 1/3 of the Angels decided they had enough of this dictator and tried to over throw him . the leader of this resistance was labeled father of lies . wicked one only by the people who wrote the bible . the bible . the fake news of its day eh ?
      </p>
      <p>
       now here where it gets messed up ..
      </p>
      <p>
       he sent him self as his son and had him self crucified , forsake him self on the cross and died , made a promise to man that who so ever believes in him ( Jesus , him self in the form of his son) will have ever lasting life as his death signified for man a covenant once again as he had done so in the past ( after the deluge )
      </p>
      <p>
       now to me this makes no sense .. believe in God as his son Jesus and your sins will be forgiven ?
      </p>
      <p>
       but ... why cant i just believe in God ?
      </p>
      <p>
       so when the rapture comes to pass i can either have my sins forgiven by asking God ( Jesus ) to forgive them or i can stay behind and die along with the rest ? burn in a lake of fire ?
      </p>
      <p>
       what kind of shenanigans are you trying to pull here fella ?
      </p>
      <p>
       so where is the resistance ? oh wait .. locked up in the abyss but wander the earth ? how the fuck does this happen ?
      </p>
      <p>
       are they locked up in an abyss or roaming the earth like a lion waiting to devour man ?
      </p>
      <p>
       make sense please..
      </p>
      <p>
       so the winners get to write history and spew all the propaganda they want .. because what are you going to do ? question the holy roman bible and have the inquisition come knocking while God plays tricks on you coming here as his son and dying for your sins on a cross where he totally ignored him self when he cried out to him self "father why have you forsaken me" ? you know .. me .. you .. father .. ? dad ?? me ?/ answer your self .. me .. you ..
      </p>
      <p>
       go home God youre drunk ..
      </p>
      <p>
       so this bad guy .. is he locked up or wandering the earth ? i have to pick one ?
      </p>
      <p>
       i have to have a belief in this shit i take it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       ok .. i believe theres a guy whos drunk and makes shit happen to amuse him self , sees the suffering of billions and tells us we can get into heaven and live for ever but i have to believe he he died on a cross and all i have to do is believe this shit ?
      </p>
      <p>
       how much weekly / monthly do i have to pay ?
      </p>
      <p>
       nothing in life is free..
      </p>
      <p>
       good vs evil ? bollocks ..
      </p>
      <p>
       taxes replaces the dish passed around in churches . pay government to protect you from bad man who came from the sky in the same way handing out money in a church to protect you from a bad man who came from heaven its all the same ..
      </p>
      <p>
       God .. evil dictator needed to be over thrown just like the president who wants your tax money to give to the military industrial complex
      </p>
      <p>
       bible .. give your money to the church to protect your soul from burning in a lake of fire and protect you from the bogey man rawrrr..
      </p>
      <p>
       if aliens land all i will be thinking is it kylo ren come to look for resistance fighters ...

       Catholicism =/= Christianity. The bible is the word of god and people can manipulate it for their own gain. Church/catholicism =
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       , bible = book. If you listen to people you can be manipulated and lied to, because people can be liars, or just ignorant, leading you the wrong way. Are the 66/67 books of the bible all lies? I don't know man I only read about 12 but so far I feel like my soul is pulled away a little from damnation lol, at least it didn't feel like being lied to.

       i suspect a lot of normies know and are just keeping quiet.  the ones who are fully asleep i feel more sorry for.  i also am concerned for their reactions during the peaking of this event, and we should probably try to help them.

       It seems to me that any (good) story about a great battle between Good and Evil is in actuality a metaphor for the constant battle within the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I can understand why so many of those foreign spirit invaders enter our domain through interdimensional portals and such, as each individual carries such a portal around with them (the brain). The hero tends to have to make a choice along the way. Luke is tempted by Vader to join the dark side, which would have allowed him to rule the Galaxy completely, but he chose the path of the unruler, the liberator, trusting not in man but a higher power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best heroes reach a point at which they are tempted to become a villain but decide to become the hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any kind of alien invasion will ever come, but I do think the battle is already here and has been for millennia.
