       Right, slightly less than half. I voted for Bernie, not because I thought he could win, but because I didn't want to give a vote to either of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm viewing this from a different perspective. Can you take a step back from your political view and picture someone using your tactics to convince you to back the other candidate? Would you do it? If you said 'half the country' and someone else tries to knock it down by saying 'hurr durr less than half', how would you respond? Would you stop and give their argument a few moments of consideration, or would you just ignore them and move on?

       How do you think society works without banks?  Even something like universal income is very dangerous to our financial systems.  Most of you look at debt the wrong way, and are also badly in need of economic and financial instruction.  Every single one of you should be capable of going and getting $1000 worth of credit from a bank and likely up to $5k from a non-bank lender as long as you aren't a criminal or have committed fraud.   You can turn that into a fortune with some hard work.
There's a lot of African countries without banks too.  They're killin' it.

       But if you hate the banks so much, buy some of their stock and at least get in on the profits.  Its not hard.  If you had borrowed $1000 on a credit card last January and bought 10 shares of Apple at $117 ($1170) your stock would currently be worth $1720, which is enough to pay back the entire loan plus interest and pocket around $500.   And that's just if you're broke.

       ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       this line of reasoning "but nobody would work, if you do not force them to work." has no empirical background. even within philosophical circles it is hard to find people agreeing to this thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is a purely abstract fear not based on anything you can empirically, that is scientifically, prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can only guess where this fear is coming from. the person postulating this thought would not continue his
       <strong>
        current
       </strong>
       job, because he finds no satisfaction in doing said job -- but it forced to do so because of financial reasons. this self-analyzed thought gets scaled up to jobs/tasks, which actually are important for society to function. (spoiler: most jobs are not. a few examples: engineers working on planned obsolescence, corporate/private shills spamming forums/social media, bankers)
      </p>
      <p>
       a lot of current work/job is only there because of financial pressure. e.g. we could perfectly automate trains, trucks and a lot more jobs. why don't we do that? we have an abstract fear. our financial system is fucked beyond repair (my interpretation!).
      </p>
      <p>
       humans are not machines. we seek some kind of "fulfillment". doing nothing doesn't make us happy. we want to do stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       several test-studies (sry, i am a lazy ass. you gonna have to dig them up yourself) showed, that universal basic income would lead to
       <strong>
        more
       </strong>
       work being done. no joke! the test subjects, aka people, continued their job and started doing stuff they
       <strong>
        liked
       </strong>
       to do. they worked less hours at their previous job and used the gained time for other,
       <strong>
        productive
       </strong>
       stuff. a lot reflect along the lines "i wasn't forced to do stuff. i could focus and concentrate; helped a lot to get work done."
      </p>
      <p>
       but, there is another study as well, which showed that financial gain
       <strong>
        can
       </strong>
       be motivating. they had two groups do mundane, physical labor. one group was promised X amount of monzeys if they do "more" or "quicker" -- the other group just got a fixed amount.
       <br/>
       the group, which was promised financial gain, outperformed the control group.
       <br/>
       they did the same setting, but this time with cognitive demanding tasks. the control group getting a fixed amount outperformed the "financial pressure" group
       <strong>
        by far
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       in a world where more and more labor can be done by machines, we still have a system in place that was designed to motivate people to do mundane physical labor. :/
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       to be fair: i think a "thingy" we can refer to for evaluating "is this worth the labor/time" is very useful for human society -- i just think monzeys doesn't fit as a metric for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think "energy" would be a way better metric.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        does it cost more energy to get multiple engineers working on planned obsolescence and produce such products in an increased interval compared to simply design a working, lasting thing?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       yes, it cost more energy? don't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... but the monzeys! we can get so much monzeys out of planned obsolescence!
      </p>
      <p>
       gosh... monzeys is just a social construct. why are you fucking wasting a real resource like energy? are you sane?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       i noticed i am more ranty as being serious... and i am even getting more ranty the longer i type^^
      </p>
      <p>
       my main point, i think, is that a metric to evaluate the question "is this action rational; should we/I do it?" is useful for human society, but monzeys is not a fitting metric for this question. my idea would be to use energy as a guide.

       Cool, thanks for answering.. so you still didn't answer my question about what do we do with people who will still not want to work? Do you believe such a person would simply cease to exist? Do you believe that every non-desirable job can be turned over to automation? If so, within what timeframe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what about the crap jobs that we can't automate in the meantime? Not everything can be turned over to robots right now allowing humans to pursue the arts and sciences. Someone has to fix the trash collecting robot when it dies don't they? Who gets stuck with that job? What about the transition period into this new automated economy?

       i consider that a small problem compared to todays situation where a lot of "work" done is actual harmful to human society. i would much prefer some lazy asses doing nothing over some desperate asses doing whatever you tell them, just because they need monzeys.

       no. although... current suicide rates are as high as never before -- worldwide. maybe those, who do not fit in the system, just say "i'm out."? if that trend would still continue after a system change, maybe... yes.. maybe lazy people would just suicide. (i know this is a absurd chain of thought ;p)
      </p>
      <p>
       to be more realistic: i think there is some really fundamental need for human beings to "do something meaningful". maybe that person just needs a bit more time to sort out what he wants to do?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        who does the shit job without financial compensation?
       </p>

      <p>
       i think i can maybe bring a little anecdote here.
      </p>
      <p>
       i like to visit festivals which are purely donation based (no fixed entry cost). everyone does volunteer work, nobody gets money (you have some expenses and the donations usually go into covering these or invest it in equipment for the next festival)
      </p>
      <p>
       some people prefer to leave a big bulk of monzeys other prefer to do more volunteer work -- a very, very small fraction may abuse that concept (i didn't notice such, yet. so i do not have empirical evidence for that.).
      </p>
      <p>
       of course there are some shit-jobs. even literally. cleaning toilettes for example. without much oversight, those jobs usually are being avoided (naturally, duh!), but as soon as there is the concrete need for someone to do that job, a simple "uhm, we need like ~4 people to do a really, really shitty job. i've done it previously, alone, and i do not want to do it yet again." shouted over the crowd and a few mins later you have enough people to volunteer for said shitty job. true story.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's the same reason you clean your house, take out your trash and so on. you just need some feeling of being within the same community, to be responsible, and it works. we are humans. we can reason and determine some things
       <em>
        just need to be done
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       you don't like how the community around you operates or handles the shit-jobs? maybe it is your responsibility to change it? or maybe, if you think that community is beyond hope, move to another one more fitting to your own values?
      </p>
      <p>
       i am pretty sure you have as much responsibility for
       <strong>
        your
       </strong>
       community to function as everyone else within it. don't just blame "the others".
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       about this automated stuff:
      </p>
      <p>
       we are in a unique time where this is possible. it would be a shame if we do not take this possibility just because some humans do not need to do these labors anymore... and have to look for something else to do with their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       they could learn to science? art? whatever? hydroponic gardens maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think automated economy is the solution -- but it is a option available to us. it would free a lot of much needed time to delve into bigger problems... like what to do when dis sun too big? how to get to mars? how out of this solar system?
      </p>
      <p>
       i would assume this idea of taking energy instead of monzeys as a metric is closer to what i would label "a solution" ;)

       Congratulations, this is the stupidest thing that I've read all day. Professional money managers are ecstatic to make over 5%. Borrowing at 10-20% to invest in stocks is idiocy. Your investment could just as easily have gone down and your loss would be compounded by the interest.

       Are you seriously telling people they need financial literacy classes in the same paragraph that you recommend investing borrowed money? If you borrow money to invest you aren't guaranteed to get screwed, sure, but what happens if your stock crashes and you suddenly need to start putting half your food bill toward paying the bank back? People in bad financial situations should NEVER borrow money they can't pay back on their own income, and should not invest in stocks unless they are very confident in the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like a trust fund baby who made their money investing inheritance and you assume 'the poors' can just do the same thing by borrowing money. If this was a viable plan don't you think like, literally everyone would've done it by now?

       Most people borrow money to invest.  It might not be your strategy, but regardless, I was making a point about how easy you could make money if you were destitute under a banking system.  And if you had borrowed any amount of money over the last 10 years, and invested it in pretty much any blue chip, you’d be up year over year, so I don’t care for your uneducated opinion based on your bullshit experience.

       No, you cannot 'easily' make money in a banking system when you're destitute. Have you ever tried being fucking destitute? What happens to that one person who tries this strategy but makes a terrible investment. They're fucked. When you're destitute you should never borrow money if you can't make the repayments comfortably on your current income.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work at a loan company, one specific for working with people who are in financial hardship. I think you really need to understand a lot more about how difficult living while being destitute is, let alone being approved for a loan when you're destitute.

       Cost of capital and liquidity. I've borrowed to invest, granted I had the money to pay the loan before taking out a loan, but it was more desirable(cheap interest) to borrow and keep the liquidity and not incur an immediate opportunity cost. For 99% I agree it's bad advice, but for someone well versed in finance and investing it's not uncommon, especially if the line of credit is not a personal loan but through a company(no personal liability)- shell companies

       No, the post was about attacking countries without banks for the purposes of setting up banks you asshat.  It’s the oldest anti Semitic theory going.  My point is that banks aren’t bad.   If you don’t know what you’re reading, don’t comment.

       You don't understand the post. Countries with central banks are not in the ((())) controlled marketplace. So TPTB are attacking them since they participate in a separate economy.

       Almost 10% of what you need for the down payment of a home! Too bad that is only set to get lower until the tax cuts eventually expire around a decade from now. Unless you're a corporation or a multi millionaire of course, in that case your tax cuts will still be there.

       But like I said, taxes aren't the reason a blue-collar worker can't afford a house or to take care of a family.The economy has been rigged against them by the millionaires and politicians who just gave themselves triplecrown winning immortal horses while everyone else got a dying mule.

       I see things a little differently. I think the middle class has slowly been crushed by globalist policies, fueled by millionaires, billionaires, and politicians for many decades now, and the tax cut is one of the few times in recent memory that the middle class has been given any real help.

       Does the fact that these same millionaires, billionaires, and politicians got, by far, the better end of the deal not suggest to you who orchestrated these tax cuts? If the cuts were intended to cut the taxes of the middle class that's all the bill would have done and they would be permanent. The only permanent cuts go to the very-wealthy. That should tell you all you need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when they expire people will say "damn, remember when America was great, back in 2018 when I got those tax cuts? Let's make it great again" and they'll do it again, and the wealthy will get another one too, but their previous one will still be there. That's the slow crushing your describing in action.

       They always get the better end of the deal, and they always have their cut, because they do have a massive and undue amount of influence. I think we agree on that point. But I also think the cuts for the middle class was a concession that they would have rather not made.

       Aaaaannnd we're right back to where we started. No apparent thought about why your tax cuts expire and the rich's don't, or why you can't afford a home in the first place going into it.

       Really? 3K over the next few years is all it took to "make America great again"? No, 3K over the next few years was all it took for you to be convinced Trump is a good guy and to pull the wool over your eyes.

       I said above why they sunset, although that doesn't mean they will expire. Totally depends on who is in power 10 years from now. Trump has said that the middle class would get tax cuts and they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm honest, it seems to me that you are criticizing the money I'm saving only because Trump was responsible and you clearly don't like him. Its a good thing for me, and $3K a year is nothing to sneeze at. My 401K has been gaining a ton of value too.
      </p>
      <p>
       We pay way too much in taxes as is. And I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be saving that money if Hillary had won the election, so I'm actually happy that Trump won.

       No, I hear you and I addressed that a long time ago. If you expected anything different, I'm not sure what to tell you. But at least this time the middle class was given something, too. "Thrown a bone," as you put it. When was the last time we were thrown a bone? An extra $2-3K a year may not be much to you, but for many people that makes a huge difference.

       MAGA is a dumb slogan but slogans work. What I bought into was what Trump campaigned on and he is doing what I expected, and actually even more than I expected so soon, especially considering all the opposition. Clearly you see things differently than I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you probably think that getting out of the Paris Climate Accord was a bad move, and I would disagree. You may feel the same way about reducing immigration. Or the TPP, or NAFTA, etc. So what you consider to be bad, I may think is good.

       wtf are you talking about dude? I thought your first response was a little weird and off topic but you've gone totally off the rails. The guy was saying MAGA made sense but "Hope" did not. I thought you were saying MAGA referred to the tax cuts.

       To be frank, its not my fault if you can't follow me. I've been completely clear and on topic. My first response was about how America
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       better in some ways in the past. So, there is a grain of truth to the slogan. Hope this makes sense to you.

       That's the point, it means whatever you want it to mean, so everyone just makes something up for themselves. The most effective slogans are simple things that leave everything up to your imagination.

       That’s usually the argument, or that there will be political incentive to mess with interest rates before elections. Every system has a con. I’d rather nationalize it and try to deal with those issues democratically vs just having a privatized system run by the banks themselves. I see the current fed system as basically fascism.

       Or hitlers economy right? There are ethical objections to all of the examples discussed here, whether you find them compelling enough to risk trying a different system is up to you. I’d argue that there is much about the economy that the fed is not succeeding at, and much of our success that has more to do with the MIC and geopolitics than it does the Fed’s policies.

       At the apex of power, the private sector, public sector and organized crime converge.

       If the Fed was “nationalized”, do you really think different people would be in charge?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many G20 countries have “public” central banks. No difference whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is fraudulent money, legal tender laws, fractional reserve banking. That’s the source of the usury you’re correct to expound. Indeed the very notion of a monopoly over money is absolutely and utterly tyrannical.

       It never got into my head on why bankers would get rich just because they had the money in first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corrupted or not I prefer that money decisions would be done by elected peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be better. I would imagine, in one country's constitution, an "algorithm" that define the money supply. Inputs would be stuff like GDP per capita and this would be the government's income. There would be no need for taxation. Regardless on how you tax, the economy always adjust itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money should serve as a "proof" of labor. I see no labor in interests on loans. On large scale, money seems to become a "unit" of power. Loans should be issued by public institutions and the interests reglemented accordingly.

       That’s perfectly fine, as long as you don’t force me in your system. That’s the whole point: coercion. The initiation of violence. Imposing a “system” on everyone (monetary or otherwise), however virtuous/effective one thinks it might me. Mine is not an
       <em>
        utilitarist
       </em>
       ambition, it is a
       <em>
        moral
       </em>
       one. (I happen to think that liberty is moral
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the most effective system in terms of propsperity and happiness, but that’s just my opinion, and I wouldn’t want to impose it on anyone).

       So while you devise your ideal collectivist society, I’ll go live in a remote valley with like-minded people. You can also expect us to invite the most productive members of your society.

       In the face of this rotten world I would tend to do the same as you and become self-sufficient off the grid. It will work for some generations but this never last. Look at the history of Native Americans: a superior (wealth and technological) bully will come to impose its laws.

       I feel that the society need people that will work to make a better world together. We need to identify the core problems (easier said than done), build up a simple message (or solution) and spread the word.

       It’s crazy that People really thought that trump would be revolutionary and for the working class. I mean even scumbag Obama would shit on netanyahu once in a while.  This reality tv doofus is literally isreal first and Goldman Sachs second.  This is insane and everyone on the right should be up in arms over this.  Just because he wasn’t Killary Clinton doesn’t mean he isn’t doing irreversible damage to the American people.  I don’t want to  be allies with all the never trump anti Russia freaks, so how do we get people to keep trump from selling us out even more then he has

       He his, the tax cauts are meant to be an incentive for corporations to come back to the U.S. after the Globalist/Nafta deals decimated the U.S. economy via previous Presidents. Now Germany, China, many others are freaking the fuck out because the U.S. is legit attracting Corporations to come back

       Swamp = Globalism, Rothschilds/Soros, Central Banking/Fiat System via IMF/CFR/Tri-Lateral Commission, MIC/FBI/CIA, Cultural Marxism/Kalgeri Plan/Forced Diversity, the new German Speech Censorship rules, and it continues from there.

       If Trumpo was el swampo, he would of never rejected TPP + Paris Agreement.

       Also the tax cut to corporations has a bunch of corporations making plans to bring their businesses back here and China, Germany, Other nations are freaking the fuck out right now:

       HE's not perfect, and I dont want anything to do with Israel or the Banksters. But, imagine you become Prez and realize the Jews literally run and own the Media, the Banks, the IMF, are the Top Elites (Rothschilds/Soros/Et el), you sort of at the very least have to play nice and pretend.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of banking, cryptocurrencies are fucking up their game right now and they are pissed about it. Sure they can create laws or force a 1 world crypto mandated, but the cats out the bag and money is now globally decentralized and growing in epic proportions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israel problem, that's probably the biggest problem there is and its not so easy to just tell them fuck off and think everything will be gravy, they'll just pull another 9/11 like they did the first time w/ the Saudis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pulling away from the joos will take a very long time, being very quiet about it, and being as keen as possible and even that doesnt guarantee anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how the Jewish Banksters are fucking up Europe right now with Islamic immigration by the 10's of Millions. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       All because the EU population was having less kids which = less debt/wage slave cogs, which means less $ for the banksters, taxes, etc. So they decided they will replace the natives with 3rd worlders, and yet 90% are on gov housing and gov handouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a massive mess, I think Korea is legit. I think Venezuela Collapsed because the CIA made that happen after they Cancered Chavez, but I think Iran is another MIC Psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       End of the day, shit is confusing. Maybe Trump is letting the Jews have Iran in exchanging for something?

       How can you still actually have faith in this guy?  You used the Tax cuts as proof he’s for the people? Really.   Damn this guy is just horrible.  So horrible that he actually has people doing mental gymnastics thinking he’s good because there’s no way anyone could be that bad.  And now bad=good.   We are fucked. Happy new year though brother.   I do appreciate the response being well cited and you having a educated opinion.

       You do realize that everything is compartmentalized? Which would explain the beef that some of the establishment has with him. And you take two very small issues(in the grand scheme of things) like the TPP and Paris agreement to somehow ignore the many many other much more important things like his awful neo-con-on-steroids foreign policy, utter and blatant allegiance to two of the worlds most tyrannical countries in Israel and Saudi Arabia among other things. Man you are really stretching there, pal. God save us.

       Holy mental gymnastics, Batman! Seriously, that's a lot of effort you put into to try and justify another criminal NWO scum who has been 'elected' president. Damn, sometimes I wish I was as simple minded as you folks. But then realize no matter how hard it is to live in such dire times surrounded by such blind people like yourself, I'm actually still better off. Good luck with all that..

       It's just thinking out loud, relax. He does some things that I support 100%, other things that I don't but I understand he has to toe the line (the Jews), and some things which were seen one way at first only to end up being something else entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       His trips to Saudi Arabia have resulted in some seeming coups there w a nrlew Prince coming into power who is more progressive and is allowing women to drive, while ISIS funding and control looks to be drying up.

       Also, imnsure he knows about the banister cartels, but this is the capstone on Illuminati and not something u can just undermine in a year or two. It would take a massive power play with many allies and an alt system to get off the banister tit

       Wow, can you actually hear yourself? Tiptoeing = "let's declare Jerusalem capitol of Israel and move the embassy there" LMAO. You forgot to make excuses as to why his foreign policy is a neo con's wet dream. Also, yeah Saudi Arabia is coming around aren't they? Tell that to Yemen. Dude you need a reality check. You are so deluded you bend over backwards 25 ways from Sunday in order not to face the sad reality that you've been fooled once again.

       I've already given you many many points which you gloss over with whatever weak excuses you tried to put forth. And most here agree with me. Trump is only going to get worse and lose more support as it becomes painfully obvious with each passing day that he is just the other hand of the NWO/Rothschild cartel. But you are boring me and obviously a lost cause. Some people just have to touch the stove to realize it's hot and will burn you. You'll learn. The hard way.

       OMG look at this guy, all he does is Parrot leftist propaganda from Fake News CNN and then when you call him on it, post links, bring up examples, he runs away into misdirection and name calling psyops like "fuzzy logic" and stubborn and other weak ass non debate tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can mention Trump didnt sign TPP/Paris Agreement (2 Globalist agrrements, which if he was in bed with Globalists and Rothschilds, he would have signed and wouldnt be going for the Wall and closed Borders) and he won't debate you on a smoking gun like that. He will instead redirect into more name calling and fuzzy logic and call you pathetic this and loser that.

       Ross was head of Rothschild's Bankruptcy division and Trump needed a bailout of a casino, where only a few banks take those kind of risks with something that is worth hundreds of millions. Because he did business with a Rothschilds bank, does that make him linked to them? I had an account at chase and had a loan from them for a car, am I now a Chase, Jamie Dimon shill?

       Europe has massively out preformed the US economically over the last few years, and last year was a noticeable difference. China have been getting stronger for years and have slowly been moving away from a manufacturing economy, they are going to achieve this by focusing on green energy, futurology, robotics etc, mean-while Trump throws money at oil and coal. The petro-dollar is going to be replaced by the RMB mainly because of Trumps abysmal diplomacy skills. For some reason he has failed to support the electric car industry and has been hostile against American electric car companies. We will wait and see how his across the board tax cuts pan out, what we can be sure of is there is not going to be a lot of money for infrastructure projects, especially if he insists on building that wall, and infrastructure is how you stimulate an economy. It seems that his plan is to do nothing, have zero government interference and let the captains of industry run wild. It seems that he harks back to the 1920's as the golden age of America. Also bear in mind that in the 1920's America didn't have any international competition and America was at the forefront of technological development, not anymore. But instead of playing catch-up he has decided that oil, coal, steel, combustion engine transport is where it's at and green energy is silly because global warming is a myth. What. A. Wanker. The reason the markets are stronger now is because these companies are going to make more money because they are going to pay less tax, the economy is a lot more nuanced than that and the EU have much, much stronger markets than the US even though they maintain a high corporation tax.

       Wheels were in motion long ago. Trumps the new puppet on the same hand. Jesus said it is easier to go through the eye if a needle.. And yet we let billionaires rule over us to destroy foreign lands for more wealth. Only when we stop 'voting' for them and start ruling over ourselves and take up our own mantle of just action, will we ever find peace.

       There are no countries with Rothschild-owned or Rothschild-controlled central banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a hoax that first appeared in December 2005 in
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051217133551/http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm">
        <em>
         The History of the House of Rothschild
        </em>
       </a>
       by Anonymous Andy and Daryl Bradford Smith. This was later marketed as
       <em>
        The Synagogue of Satan
       </em>
       by Andrew Carrington Hitchcock.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really astonishing how widely accepted this hoax is in the conspiracy community since it's easily disproved. Often when it's mentioned on r/conspiracy, people from other countries have said,"Wait, I'm from [Norway, France, New Zealand, Canada, ...], our central bank is owned by the government." In fact, almost all central banks are government-owned. In fact, there are only eight countries in the world that have central banks with any private ownership at all, and there are a lot of restrictions on the ownership.

        Nah. She wouldn't have opened herself up for embarrassment at the UN by calling Jerusalem the capital.

      <p>
       The US has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital for around 20 years. Moving the embassy was the only thing Trump did. Not sure if it was a good idea, but I thought I'd help make it clear what actually happened.

       I think there are 3 presidents that don't fall I to that category
      </p>
      <p>
       Eisenhower. He didn't even want the job but like Washington it was kind of thrust on him. He defeated Nazis and won ww2 as the supreme commander for allied forces Europe. I think he kept some secrets but I don't think he was a central bank stooge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter is another. Dude literally spends his time building houses for poor people. He's not out doing speaking engagements for a quarter million a pop
      </p>
      <p>
       And Kennedy. Dude literally got domed standing up to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is just more of the same. He's an even more obvious Zionist than our previous presidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton would have been more tactful I think. She's super intelligent when it comes to that stuff (but stupid with the American people) and I doubt she'd have rubbed so many of our allies the way trump did.

       Hussein gave NK and Iran uranium. Targeting them was inevitable from this point forward no matter who assumed the presidency. This post is to conflate Trump with the NWO under a pretense that's fault lies squarely on Hussein. Disinfo.

       The Agreed Framework was one of the more seemingly diplomatic things America has ever done and it was working well. North Korea was fully willing to transition to nuclear energy rather than nuclear weapons if it meant normalized diplomatic relations, something NK has always wanted. Then Bush pretended it never existed.

       No, I added to your point of him "favoring" Russia. I don't think he favors them, I just think he doesn't want any problems with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how he can favor them by arming the Ukrainians. But it's strange, because yes, I did say he doesn't want problems with Russia, and he has said in the past he wants better relations, but here he is arming the Ukrainians against the Russian proxy in the region.

       Except that he didn't want to arm the Ukranians, and it's his administration that wanted it. If he tried to push back against arming Ukranians then it would look just as bad as vetoing the Russian sanctions.

       How about you go live in one of these countries, say North Korea and after a couple of years come back and tell us all about it. Anyone can sit in the west dreaming up vast conspiracies of shit but really you need to step up to the plate and find out what life is like there. Hopefully you can avoid the death camps, no wait if you stay here Trump with have you in a death camp won't he? fuck it's terrible. We're doomed.

       For me, the veil was lifted as soon as he spoke to AIPAC and how he said it. From then onwards, I knew who owned DJT. Also I see sanctions as financial terrorism which is essentially what he’s done.

       Trump is a puppet. But he spews very Christian sayings. Is that the Catholic in him or will he betray Lucifer and fight for the light? Interesting to say the least.

       Dude, your post makes zero sense.  North Korea is a non-central bank nation?  They are the very definition of a central bank state because their govt controls EVERYTHING.  Venezuela?  They are collateral damage from OPEC policies and the collapse of oil prices worldwide, not some nefarious plot undertaken by the US.  Iran?  Do you have some proof that we don't have that Trump somehow started the uprising?  Or are you referring to the fact that we are rolling back extremely stupid policies which Obama secretly implemented without the knowledge of the American people. (i.e. give them $1.8 billion in cash)
      </p>
      <p>
       Prop up Israel?  Do I need to remind you that it was all past Presidents and Congress who UNANIMOUSLY voted to recognize Jerusalem as the Capitol of Israel?

       It's the same thing that we must do in our own communities. I'm American. Many Americans believe that the elites actually care about us, that our government works for our benefit, etc. So we have to educate them. Once we educate the country, we can educate other countries not through war or colonization.
