    <div class="md"><p>I stopped watching TV a couple years ago because of the blatant bias &amp; uncomfortably forced dark narratives. </p>

<p>But the things I’ve come across lately are pretty relevant to what’s happening with the collapse of the cabal. </p>

<p>For the first time ever I see they’re going to have a series about the ‘murder’ of Nikola Tesla. </p>

<p>Anybody else notice other shows that are relevant to the Awakening of the masses? </p>

<p>My husband and I watched part of a series the other day on the corruption in the history of the automobile industry.  It was definitely new info that wasn’t mainstream about Ford that my husband, an avid car lover, had no idea about. </p>

<p>But,  he’s part of the sleeping sheep. Was nice to see him getting a different point of view that was a bit shocking for him. </p>

<p>Id ramble on but reddit posts are useless. Wish people would understand coming together in unity is needed. We are all being bent the fuck over and have been forever.

<p>Meh. I want to have discussions with different views while knowing the respect is instilled before you open your mouth. THAT basic idea seems like fantasy. Everyone that lives in the struggle I’ll tell you I’m with you. That’s all I can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More like TPTB realize the masses just mimic their awful behavior like mindless robots. Monkey see monkey do. </p>

<p>The British imperialism Oliver Stone&#39;s son talks about continuing through &quot;informal means&quot; is alive and well. What&#39;s worse this stealthy approach has carried over to every other aspect of life. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even get a fair trial from your peers because no one will even confront you with charges because deep down they know how bogus they are, and how they would be ridiculed if made public.</p>

<p>And so the persecution and exclusion of &quot;undesirables&quot; continues through &quot;informal&quot; means - blackballing, etc.</p>

<p>The gestapo, ss, hitler youth, snitches, brown shirts whatever you want to call them - the unthinking mindless robots the TPTB use to impose their will are still around. And they can&#39;t wait to be put on a leash. Only the uniforms have changed a bit. Now they look like your mother, father, neighbor, professor, mailman, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tbh we&#39;re probably pretty fucking close to establishing one. </p>

<p>US space companies are starting to realistically make plans for the multi-Trillion dollar asteroid mining industry. Suddenly the government starts UFO disclosure. Not a stretch to say they&#39;ll start selling ships with warp tech to the private sector soon.</p>

<p>These inevitable mining cartel(s) are going to need an outpost to process and store product. Mars. This will lead to a &quot;gold&quot; rush to the new wild west. A society that anyone can shape provided they have the capital and are in the right position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. There is definitely an attempt in play. Problem is it&#39;s fundamentally based on dysfunction. Secrecy doesn&#39;t really exist, but that&#39;s what their whole shtick revolves around.</p>

<p>Same as basing society around the idea of the world being meaningless and random. </p>

<p>You can have all the fun you want pretending there&#39;s no order - just like you can pretend until the cows come home there&#39;s such a thing as &quot;secrecy&quot;. It won&#39;t make it a reality though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wrote it better then I could. Great post.</p>

<p>What you are talking about is going to be prime time TV tonight as we watch thousands of people willingly get put into pig pens to watch the ball drop in sub zero temptures. Nothing like spending your hard earned money by willingly getting shoved into sections while every tries to look happy as they all slowly freeze to death. And that&#39;s even after they heard about the record amount of &#39;security&#39; at this times square bullshit. So on top of the cold if you have half a brain you might think &#39;gee I wonder if one of those 10000000s of snipers they got looking on at all of us defenseless blocks of ice is looking at me right now?&#39; </p>

<p>Since most are just consumption based husks of what they should be they will be happy to have that fucking hashtag! Maybe a couple intragram photos with a hopeful trending topic of &#39;i survived the 2018 New year&#39;s in times square!!! Hehe!&#39; It&#39;s so obvious and too easy for even remotely smart people with enough power to sit back and watch bewildered that it&#39;s this simple. </p>

<p>Just keep sending out them iPhones and shit so you get a little dopamine hit to keep society not completely collapse on it&#39;s self from mass undiagnosed depression. That&#39;s what the reality people who think rationally have to cope with. Blind leading the blind, like you said. </p>

<p>Though I&#39;m glad to be able to read posts like yours that lays it out for what it is. And I see it pretty frequently now, which gives me some hope   that more are getting slapped in the face by reality. But damn I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say that their are a metric shit ton that are and stay willfully ignorant even if they were given a sheep head to wear before running on in their cage to watch the sparkly ball drop. And those are the ones that are SO. FUCKING. VOCAL. On shithole antisocial media websites. I love it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also if someone is asking himself, “why would they broadcast/tolerate something like this? Netflix seems on board with the whole mind control / propaganda stuff”, I’ve got another question for you:</p>

<p>**Why didn’t they plant WMDs in Iraq to say Saddam was guilty?”</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5v7fwp/the_conspiracy_of_trust_or_why_didnt_they_simply/">Here is the answer</a></p>

<p>TLDR: the PTB are purposefully undermining the public’s trust in their institutions; this is quite difficult to see, especially if you despise said institutions (as I do). It is nevertheless indisputable (imho), as there have been many examples over the years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smedley Darlington Butler (July 30, 1881 – June 21, 1940) was a United States Marine Corps major general, the highest rank authorized at that time, and at the time of his death <strong>the most decorated Marine in U.S. history</strong>. </p>

<p>During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the Banana Wars, and France in World War I. </p>

<p>Butler later became an outspoken critic of U.S. wars and their consequences, as well as exposing the Business Plot, an alleged plan to overthrow the U.S. government.</p>

<p>By the end of his career, Butler had received 16 medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the Medal of Honor twice, one of three to be awarded both the Marine Corps Brevet Medal (along with Wendell Neville and David porter) and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.</p>

<p><strong>In 1933, he became involved in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a congressional committee that a group of wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time</strong>. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations. A final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler&#39;s testimony.</p>

<p><strong>In 1935, Butler wrote a book titled War Is a Racket, where he described and criticized the workings of the United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those he was a part of, including the American corporations and other imperialist motivations behind them</strong>. After retiring from service, he became a popular activist, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church groups in the 1930s.</p>

I sometimes wonder if the CIA is a bunch of guys who either don&#39;t care about people like us, or think we are stupid and that they are doing a true patriots work or what. I like to think that maybe, just maybe, they actually know more than we will ever will and that these shitty decisions were somehow the right ones, but we will never know.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should think about the format that you inform people on.  My biggest struggle with conspiracy folks is the smugness of how &#39;woke&#39; they are and how they&#39;ve been down the rabbit hole and until you agree with them you are just a sheeple.  It&#39;s a turn off to anyone not drawn to that automatically.  I still find that a lot of conspiracy people just get off on feeling like they know something most others don&#39;t and feel special because they are &#39;in the know.&#39;  From the outside looking in, it is a turn off.</p>

<p>Scoff and look down on people for that all you want, but the fact of the matter is that you catch more bees with honey.  Learn to make your message and information more readily digestible for a skeptic and you will be surprised what they will believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for all truth seekers, but I know I get frustrated having the same arguments, with the same types of &quot;common-minded&quot; people. I didn&#39;t get &quot;woke&quot; (god I fucking hate that term) by listening to some conspiracy theorist talk his version of truth to me. I changed mindsets by attempting to put down my personal and cultural bias, and started wading through all the sources of information online. It&#39;s a learned skill that no one ever perfects, but it takes practice to sort through the massive amount of dis and mis information online. If you&#39;re truly interested and looking for a place to start, I recommend starting on this page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you are missing the point.</p>

<p>If you want others to take the red pill, you are going about your tone the wrong way.  Think of how many you may have turned off.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care if they take it because you know it takes self-determination to make it happen, then why say anything at all?</p>

<p>Really think about your own psychology here.  You became annoyed that someone got their urge from Netflix and not self-determination.  Instead of allowing that germinated seed to grow or god-forbid nourishing it, you cast shade and tried to belittle the person.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t interested in spreading the gospel, then STFU because you may be undoing others&#39; hard work with your own need to feel superior to someone who didn&#39;t find their way independently the way you did.</p>

Your word, or anyone&#39;s word on the internet for that matter,  is not nearly as credible as the solid evidence provided by this doc series to the average person. Have you even watched the series?

    <div class="md"><p>You wrote it better then I could. Great post.</p>

<p>What you are talking about is going to be prime time TV tonight as we watch thousands of people willingly get put into pig pens to watch the ball drop in sub zero temptures. Nothing like spending your hard earned money by willingly getting shoved into sections while every tries to look happy as they all slowly freeze to death. And that&#39;s even after they heard about the record amount of &#39;security&#39; at this times square bullshit. So on top of the cold if you have half a brain you might think &#39;gee I wonder if one of those 10000000s of snipers they got looking on at all of us defenseless blocks of ice is looking at me right now?&#39; </p>

<p>Since most are just consumption based husks of what they should be they will be happy to have that fucking hashtag! Maybe a couple intragram photos with a hopeful trending topic of &#39;i survived the 2018 New year&#39;s in times square!!! Hehe!&#39; It&#39;s so obvious and too easy for even remotely smart people with enough power to sit back and watch bewildered that it&#39;s this simple. </p>

<p>Just keep sending out them iPhones and shit so you get a little dopamine hit to keep society not completely collapse on it&#39;s self from mass undiagnosed depression. That&#39;s what the reality people who think rationally have to cope with. Blind leading the blind, like you said. </p>

<p>Though I&#39;m glad to be able to read posts like yours that lays it out for what it is. And I see it pretty frequently now, which gives me some hope   that more are getting slapped in the face by reality. But damn I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say that their are a metric shit ton that are and stay willfully ignorant even if they were given a sheep head to wear before running on in their cage to watch the sparkly ball drop. And those are the ones that are SO. FUCKING. VOCAL. On shithole antisocial media websites. I love it. </p>
