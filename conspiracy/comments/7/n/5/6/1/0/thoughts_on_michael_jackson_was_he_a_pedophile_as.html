       I personally don’t think Michael was capable of doing something as horrible as molesting children. His sister has said publicly that she thinks he was murdered. 
Interested to hear the thoughts of everyone here

       He was creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was not mentally healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the publicized instances (the lawsuits) of his crimes against those kids was fake, a hoax meant to get cash from him via settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that I'd say he was completely innocent, overall? I don't know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the BIG stories on him, the headlines that captivated Court TV and CNN and Fox News and all the rest? I believe those were false. If nothing else, everyone accused him of bleaching his skin to appear whiter (because he was ashamed of being black) and dismissed his claims that he had vitiligo and was self-conscious about it and did what he could to even out the patches. But that was true!
      </p>
      <p>
       Who killed him? His dad, many decades prior, by fucking him up so bad that he became insanely wealthy without ever developing as a healthy human being, and fell into a life of quack doctors and dangerous drugs.

       Michael owned 50% of ATV, which owned the rights of popular music from The Beatles to Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga. Sony owned the other 50%, and bought out Michaels share for $750 mil after he died.

       I havent seen convincing evidence that he harmed children. From what I have seen he was very protective of their innocence. Its speculation either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       He died under very suspicious circumstances. I mean a doctor was giving him drugs for surgery in his home and that was brushed away. Now add onto that the $1,000,000,000 his name made just in the year after his death. You have very clear motive and oppurtunity for this crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the same way about Whitney Houston and a few other stars. They reach their maximum value alive so they are killed when the profit machine is in place to cash in on their death. I felt like the memorials for Michael on TV were just commercials to get the people who killed him even richer.

       I happen to genuinely believe MJ had severe psychological damage from an incredibly fucked up childhood and abnormal life.  I think his plastic surgeries, his behavior, and his ultimate  addiction to pain killers and potent “sleep aids” were ultimately his choice and the manifestations of his life experience (and aforementioned psychological issues).
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, I don’t think his death was a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the pedophilia claim.... I have reservations about those. Every bit of evidence against him could have been planted. Someone with that kind of star power and accumulated wealth could have been dangerous. His accusers stories were as credible as any other without proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that there are people in show business who were young boys that hung around MJ and have stated that he never did anything wrong and was good to them. IIRC Corey Feldman, who does claims to have suffered horrible abuse, said Jackson was never abusive toward him. He spoke highly of his time spent with MJ.

       One of the kids who sued him successfully described his genitals, which MJ had to show the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were going to kill MJ, they would've waited until after his first comeback performance. That would've been legendary and maximized the money, which is all that this is about anyway. Can you imagine if he gave a spectacular comeback show at the Millennium Dome and dropped dead immediately afterwards? Biggest celebrity death event ever---DVDs of the performance sell in the millions, live CD goes straight to #1, etc. No way he was hands-on murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure he was raping boys, though.

       They ended up buying out his shares in music publishing. That is worth more than any comeback tour would have ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted this in another thread but Ron Newt, manager of The Newtrons, was offered 200k in the early 90s to say MJ touched his kids. He refused. That said I'm not ruling out that he may have touched some kids, since its a blackmail and power tool in entertainment.

       Apparently that was a 1990’s fake news, he never gave an accurate description. Jordan Chandler said that Jackson was circumcised and his autopsy report proves that he wasn’t. The accuser’s lawyer demanded to search if he had any plastic surgery on his genitals that would explain why his client description was not a match and there were none. He was just never circumcised. Chandler did said that he had spots on his genitals witch was accurate but when ask where they were he failed at giving the correct places of the spots except for one which didn’t perfectly match and could be attributed to simple luck. Jackson had vitiligo, his entirely body was covered with white splotches. Which gave the illusion that his body was white with brown spots.  In videos and pictures he was photoshopped and wore makeup that’s why he looked like he was entirely white. Anyone who would be close to him, who would go to the pool with him (like Chandler and his father) or simply see him in a t-shirt will know that he had a mismatch skin. Saying that the skin of his genitals must ressemble the rest of his skin was actually an easy guess. The lawyer Tom Sneddon tried to prove in court (2004-2005) that Jordan Chandler gave a correct description in 1993 base on the one spot he got correct and ignoring the rest of the description but was not capable of giving a stronger argument than “it’s my belief that the one spot is not a matter of luck but the result of a memory”

       Except he also said that looking back it wasn't normal for MJ to be showing him nude magazines when he was so young. Typical grooming behavior tbh. Abuse is sadly most often a cycle.

       That’s a fake news article. Radar online fabricated the story the real police report can be seen in the FBI internet site. He had no child porn and if he had half of what radar online pretended he had, he would have been in jailed. There is no way that the jury would have given him a not guilty verdict.

       Im sure many people had reason to kill MJ, but I think someone at Sony had a lot to do with it though, since he owned 50% of the music publisher ATV. When he bought in they owned a lot of old music rights like The Beatles, and now own the rights to many mainstream pop artists. After his death they bought out his shares in the company for $750 million. Something tells me they had been trying to get that from him for a while.

       Music is very important in my life and MJ was my favorite artist around the time Thriller came out. When I saw the video, which was produced every bit as a movie, I also became a huge fan of horror movies. I also followed all the accusations against him over the years and almost 100% were outright false to sell papers/magazines/ad time or to try to get money out of him from settlements. I think that the pedo accusations also fall on the same box. If you’re extremely wealthy, tons of people around the world listen to you and you’re naive emotionally and mentally, people will try to take advantage of you, and his was definitely the case with him. He was almost child-like.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a video online of an interview by this Indian-British guy that ended up being edited and aired in a way that made him look like a nut and distorted his statements to suggest those accusations were true. MJ had only of his assistants record the interview as it was being conducted and the unedited version later aired on a different network, CLEARLY showing that it had been twisted to make him look bad.

       his dad used to kick the shit out of him and his siblings but focused mostly on him. he also made fun of his wide nose incessantly, and you can see how that affected mike. janet is more private for sure, but she was kinda blacklisted by the industry after the titty incident a while back too. none of the other brothers really reached prominence so they may not have had the opportunity to speak out, or they could have a touch of stockholm syndrome too.

       i think he was a targeted individual.  i think his disfigurement on top of having a horrible family life really fucked with him.  i don't think anybody can understand what that is like unless they go thru something similar.  i think it's unfair to judge him given that.  his music preached love and togetherness and he was immensely talented and we fucked him up.  so it's our error whatever the case is, and however he ended up.  it's hard being in that position with that much talent and few people who really understood him.  i hope he's at peace wherever he is.

       And no tabloids that would come with the ultimate proof of his guilt will ever be real, if they would have any proof like that that existed it would have became public by now. The FBI wired his phones and followed him for 15 years, he would not have been able to hide things like having massive starch of child porn or 200 millions hush money. Those are stories fabricated by a certain type of media who pays people 100,000 $ to lie. Why paying people to lie if the truth is so spectacular? A 15 years FBI investigation founded nothing it’s not a tabloid who’s going to find the truth. Please for your own good stop reading tabloids their slogan could honestly be: “dumb people believe in our crap and we make money with their stupidity”.
