       I noticed about a year ago talking about 2009 green revolution protests that shills would try hard to fool people into believing it was a Soros/CIA/Israeli funded operation, it wasn't. The same thing is happening with the (not so) recent protests...pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me assure you, many Iranians are angry with the corruption within their government who aren't paid to protest.

       Can't upvote this enough...so here's some more evidence. Today is the 6 year anniversary of where Syria's troubles began. I don't think it's a coincidence.

       By the way...many many people who are fortunate enough to still be alive in Syria consider the FSA to be terrorists. Not that the FSA gives a shit.

       Important to realize this. Regime changes are seldom grassroots. The protests that lead to them can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right questions, in my opinion, are the ones that look down the path at both the forces that want Iranian leadership t stay where it is and those that want it overturned, and see what, exactly,  those people think would be best in the region...and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The protests and the PR campaigns behind them are inconsequential in the long run.

      <p>
       The two questions are:

      <p>
       (1) What are the political and policy aims behind the main groups of protestors and;
      </p>
      <p>

       Many people don't realize in the dynamics of Iran. The government is much more authoritarian and religious than the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious note, being a chess player/fan following large tournaments. Iranian chess players automatically forfeit to Isreali chess players. This is sports wide I'm told. Two Iranian expat masters broke this rule and got kicked out of the Iranian national team and forbid from playing any tournaments in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I've seen and witnessed portrays a populace much less extreme than the oppressive religious government. These protests fit the bill.

       Who is claiming these protests aren't genuine? I haven't seen any of that.... Yet, anyway.

       Of course Iranians are mad that their country is a pariah (thanks to israel and the US) and that the oil price is still in the gutter ( thanks US and Saudis). But anyone with a brain has the right to be skeptical of any "popular uprising" going back to at least the french revolution. Iranians need to know israel/US will NEVER accept them until they have a subservient quisling government whose main role is to SELL THEM OUT. Guys, the most hardliner Shia theocracy is preferable to what the zionists have planned for you.

       No, I'm sure the protests are genuine. My personal belief is that the Iranian government is much closer to the global establishment than would first be apparent.

       I have never seen protests like what had become a cookie cutter productions in this last several years.  Streets streaming with tens of thousands of protesters.  Organic protests are not that organized. Ukraine,  Arab Spring, S Korea, South America, US antifa...  All very similar. Same rhetoric.  I do not believe it for one minute.

       Antifa was protesting rising food prices and Iranian military interference in Lebanon?  Weird.  I don't remember that rhetoric from them.

       Actual antifa could not articulate what they were protesting.

       People who have real life threatening food shortages.  Tunisia.  Venezuela.  Iran.

       Antifa is not protesting these things, because that's not the issue in the US.  They're also not that organized.  So I guess that must mean they're organic.

       Venezuela is starving, not so in Iran. Antifa is organized to point of being bussed in and hired from crailgslist.

       There's no way to tell whether they are legitimate from here, especially so soon. Anyone claiming to know if they are legitimate must bring forward a LOT of evidence to convince.

       considering whats going on in Syria right now i highly doubt its grassroots. Israel has lost its proxy war and Hezbollah and Iran are stronger as a result.

       really? i see them trying so hard to convince us westerners that yet again a small fringe protest is something a 1000x bigger than it actually is.

       Starting yesterday and this morning I suddenly noticed a number of month old accounts that have been spamming nothing but anti-Iran sentiments with hyper-fixation. I mean, with a name like Whitey___McPrivilege I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting going into that comment history.
