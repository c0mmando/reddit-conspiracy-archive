<p>We are also nice and close to Asia to keep an eye on that part of the world for whoever is running the show. </p>

<p>I think we were an early testing ground for gun control, I mean, it worked, and there&#39;s lots of fishy shit that went on in Port Arthur. 
&quot;There will never be uniform gun laws in Australia until we see a massacre in Tasmania.&quot; New South Wales Premier Barry Unsworth, after a specially called Premier&#39;s meeting in Hobart, December 1987. </p>

<p>I think we mightve been the fist spot for the elites to hole up when the shit hit the fan, now I think Antarctica might be more hospitable for them.</p>

<p>Lots of systemic child abuse, so you know were under control if push comes to shove. </p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s a nice place to live if you&#39;re white and middle class like me. The hypocrisy stings at times.</p>

<p>Port Arthur has always astounded me, but I read that gun ownership is on the rise in Australia again...hopefully that doesnt lead to another crack down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s clear from the replies here, that outside of America, little is known if Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>The ANZAC treaty will continue for as long as both countries exist. So militarily they will forever be close, there&#39;s even an open visa policy.</p>

<p>As an Australian, my hat is off to the Kiwis. They didn&#39;t join in Iraq 2, because they&#39;re prime minister at the time didn&#39;t swallow the bullshit or was deemed not corruptable. Then when the Kiwis banned US warships from NZ ports (nuclear free), they were temporarily removed from the five eyes community. NZ has stuck it to the US a few times, unlike Australia which 100% needs the US as long as they remain the  number 1 Pacific naval power.</p>

<p>Australia has always played a role in doing British and American bidding and has been a member of the five eyes since WW2. Think about that, the world&#39;s 53th largest population, 18th largest economy, but 15/16th ranked military and part of the most elite US Military Intelligence group with countries way larger.</p>

<p>Australia is effectively the British and American eyes and port for the southern hemisphere.</p>
