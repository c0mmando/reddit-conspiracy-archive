       I guess what I'm asking is what evidence is there that there is a singular ruling entity that gives orders to both sides? Not sure if you watch Game of Thrones but the Iron Bank seems to be a symbolism of the Federal Reserve and in the show, this entity may fund all factions in war against one another but they don't necessarily engineer or interfere in the conflicts themselves. Couldn't this also be true for the Democrats and the Republicans, that they are actually opposed to each other as opposed to following a script given to them by a higher force?

       You could argue that the Iron Bank did meddle in the affairs of Westeros when they came calling for their debt. They straight out said that they would finance a usurper to take over the throne if the old bag didn't pay. In the book there's a bit more conversation regarding this aspect of their "business".

       So the Iron Bank controls.... the white walkers?

       lol... I'm jp. But I'm guessing the Federal Reserve is then in cahoots in organizations like the CIA who act as their muscle men. I'm sure it's a lot of more complex than that because we have to consider groups like the NSA, the MIC, foreign nations like China, Russia, the Jesuits, Zionism....

       They almost all fall in line lockstep with the Republicans when it comes to Trump's military and intelligence picks. Then most of them vote for over half of Trump's cabinet anyways. However it stands out in how they vote.

       I find it also interesting that Mattis, who
       <a href="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2014/12/19/mattis-joins-center-for-a-new-american-security/">

        Tony Podesta was an adviser
       </a>
       before he was kicked out after recent revelations, was Trump's first pick and the Democrats at the height of their pink pussy hat marches all fell in line for Mattis.

       Mattis is snek.

       That is the biggest smoking gun I have ever seen that the 2-party system is beholden to the same forces. Even with an anti-establishment  president who campaigned on ending the wars and no nation building. Just like Obama. Just like G.W. Bush.

       Politicians don't even have to be continuously coordinated by any central power - they just have a common interest of living a parasitic life funded by taxation and just like any profession (say, physicians or lawyers) they may seriously compete against each other, but they will stand united if someone puts in question the very integrity of their whole profession.

       .  This link is for General Dynamic's PAC contributions to congress for our current election cycle (ie toward the 2018 midterms).  General Dynamics is a huge weapons manufacturer, and if you look at their spending, they donate to democrats and republicans fairly equally.  You will see similar for United Technologies Corporation (missile and helicopter manufacturer), Similar for Northrop Grumman, and similar for Boeing (though in the 2018 cycle, republicans seem to be favored by them).  These are some of the biggest players in the American MIC, and they're buying politicians left and right.  If this isn't enough to convince you/that person, then that person is intentionally blinding themselves to the corruption inherent in our government today.

       He also would have pulled the majority of independents easily, especially if his opponent was named Clinton. And if any Republican is gonna have crossover appeal among Democrats, it's gonna be a more libertarian one who might bring an end to cannabis prohibition, one who might end the illegal wars abroad.
      </p>

       Problem is that I don't think Paul would have been able to beat Trump when he had Hillary's pied piper strategy ensuring him more coverage by the corporate media than any other candidate. He would have been blacked out kinda like Bernie was, and the free advertising Hillary secured for Trump would make it difficult for Paul to be taken seriously by Republican voters.

       Was there any republican president that was like that ever? Republicans became conservative in the 60s. Every one after up till Trump and Bush were modern day democrats. Trump and Bush figured out the power of running in bs social issues.

       Ron Paul's strong anti-abortion position lost him the election. He might have been president if he had been more flexible on that one issue. It turned off too many women who otherwise would have supported him.

       I attended one of his rallys, I don't think there was more than 100 people there. No one seemed to know he was running. Someone stole the sticker off my car. It's as if he never even ran. It's sad how horrible the media is in this country and the people, its so frustrating.

       Fair enough, that was the essence of it. Your neighbor is closer to you than the system, just because you bicker over taxes doesn't make them your enemy, that makes them an ally. If we all reaffirmed each other's beliefs and never challenged them, we couldn't learn and grow.

       Exactly. But the point to note here is that I could be in any country and still be the victim of the system. I think a lot of people need to realise this! It literally does not matter if I'm Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, White, Black etc we all suffer.

       I was watching someone on youtube the other day and he explained it really well. If I identify myself as a person from Glasgow, I will feel connection to Glasgow and it's residents. If I do it for UK, I will identify with nation. If identify as a human, I will identify with the world. Let's stop the division and fight the true enemy = the political/financial system.

       I believe it.They want "their guy" in. Not "ours".  And your right. I've succumbed to the partisan shit myself as of late. Realized it yesterday. TPTB very much want this division. There are enough issues that both sides can agree on and work towards together. We can have different beliefs and be respectful to each other at the same time. Nice reminder of that my friend!

       Ron Paul was cheated out of a nomination he rightfully won by a candidate who represented nearly everything he opposed (the big machine) and then endorsed said candidate? I missed that! Bernie is a fraud.

       Politicians don't even have to be continuously coordinated by any central power - they just have a common interest of living a parasitic life funded by taxation and just like any profession (say, physicians or lawyers) they may seriously compete against each other, but they will stand united if someone puts in question the very integrity of their whole profession.
