<hr/>

<p>Do the math you dumb, ignorant mother fucker:</p>

<p>6mbpd</p>

<p>At 60 Dollars per barrel comes out to a potential total revenue of 131 Billion dollars.</p>

<p>Maybe a sixth of that is rough cost? So you&#39;re linking contract negotiations, now you just need to prove that there&#39;s approximately 117 Billion dollars of fraud in the contracts.</p>

<p>Then that the contracts remain that way for long enough to recoup the insane total costs of the war.</p>

<hr/>

<p>You have no fucking clue what you&#39;re talking about, and you&#39;re not even close to understanding the basics, but keep fucking thinking it&#39;s as simple as you make it out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be very intelligent based on your clear and elegant linguistic skills but...</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand that the taxpayer pays the cost of war, while the corporations are the ones that reap the benefits afterwards. Royal Dutch Shell didn&#39;t pay for the invasion, you did buddy. </p>

<p>You also don&#39;t seem to understand that the war itself is a business and every corporation like G.E., General Dynamics, Raytheon, Lockheed etc, make make their money during times of war, not during times of peace. There&#39;s a reason why Vietnam went on so long, why Afghanistan is taking so long, why companies like KBR get &quot;cost plus&quot; contracts to build infrastructure and why there will always be an overseas war going on as long as you live. Other country&#39;s conflicts are none of the US&#39;s business, but the US makes it their <strong><em>business</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Ok, again, another material claim. Can you demonstrate of all the shitty stuff to come out of the war starting, a documented case of oil executives pressuring US congressmen to go to war for their financial interests? I&#39;m not saying it didn&#39;t happen. I&#39;m saying if it did, then I don&#39;t know it off the top of my head.</p>

<p><em>You also don&#39;t seem to understand that the war itself is a business</em></p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t the one claiming that it was about resource pillaging. The direct quote from you:</p>

<p>&quot;The US uses the military to attack other nations for no other reason than seizing their resources for the multinational corporations&quot;</p>

<p>So, I get it. You want to use hyperbole to make your posistion, then when you get treated like a child for speaking like a child, you want to act like you&#39;re not ignorant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ok though. I&#39;m not really going to take the time to go off about militaristic keynesianism. In stead, I&#39;m going to call you a dumb mother fucker.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>why companies like KBR get &quot;cost plus&quot; contracts to build infrastructure and why there will always be an overseas war going on as long as you live.</em></p>

<p>There&#39;s always someone that needs killing. It&#39;s just hard to find them sometimes.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>Other country&#39;s conflicts are none of the US&#39;s business, but the US makes it their business.</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what you think is or is not the US&#39;s business. That&#39;s for our geopolitical institutions to figure out. Of which, the war for Iraq was supported fully by congress, by both major political parties.</p>

<p>So either a) our political parties are entirely fucking stupid, or b) bought. or c) it&#39;s not that fucking simple.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go with c.</p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s a or b, then congratulations, you&#39;ve managed to be &#39;woken&#39; to a world where everyone is stupid. That&#39;s a pretty strong material claim to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You claimed it was about resource pillaging?</p>

<p>Oil? The cost benefit analysis isn&#39;t there. Opium? The cost benefit analysis isn&#39;t there. US taxpayer resources? At least your talking in the right order of magnitude now, but good luck proving it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re like a child that thinks because you believe it&#39;s true, it makes it true.</p>

<p>If you make a claim you need to prove it.</p>

<p>You claimed it was about resources. I can link the costs of the war, I&#39;ve demonstrated a yearly maximal for iraqi oil, I could do the same trivially with world wide heroin consumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, in direct response to vulgarity:</p>

<p>This is the most baseless claim I&#39;ve ever heard. You&#39;re trying to compare me calling you a fucking incompetent child to <em>holding a worldview</em> in which a large portion on the population is willing ignorant and supportive of <em>blatant</em> war crimes for profit. </p>

<p>What could be more vulgar than that? If I told you to chop of your dick and eat it, that would be less vulgar than what really happened on the ground in those countries. So I don&#39;t understand how my revulsion to your worldview is <em>vulgar</em>. </p>

<p>There&#39;s zero sense of proportion in your world view. It&#39;s literally a litmus test of stringing together phrases. You&#39;re a bad markov chain, you&#39;re &#39;woke&#39; to a world that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<li><p>Limiting SWAT to handguns would seemingly create a need for the Swat team to get into a closer proximity with a supposed hostage taker and would result in an even more heightened state of danger for both parties and isn&#39;t the perceived threat level getting too high a major determining factor in LEOs deciding to pull the trigger, with this also applying to the suspect, no?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, but they called in a fake armed hostage situation didn&#39;t they? So you have to expect the police to act fast in a situation like that and be very much on edge. The police go into a situation expecting to come across a very dangerous, possibly insane, gunman and they are naturally going to go in guns blazing. Obviously I&#39;m not a fan of current police militarisation and think that police should take a more measured approach. Maybe bringing a hostage negotiator or another more peaceful means for de-escalating the situation would have been more effective in the long term and resulted in less civilian casualties.</p>

<p>Either way you can&#39;t make a call like that and expect the police not to behave aggressively.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re referring to the swatting incident this is one of the few times I sympathize with the situation of the officers. </p>

<p>Imagine that there was a deranged person who was holding their family at gun point and had already shot one of them. You have been told (by who you believe to be the shooter themself) that they have a gun and have already used it. You then see them make a movement that looks like they are reaching for said weapon.</p>

<p>It&#39;s far from an impossible situation, and in that situation the response would be justified. In this case the unfortunate reality is that the cops were lied to about what the situation was.</p>

<p>I think the real issue is Police training when it comes to how to deescalate (although I don&#39;t believe that was a specific factor in this case), and the general limitations we have right now as far as being able to discern truth.</p>

<p>People who want to commit harm simply have access to better tools that Law Enforcement at the moment. 9/11 is working with dated technology and poor infrastructure. They have no way of knowing if a call is coming from where the caller claims it is, and obviously there is no way of assessing the truth of the caller&#39;s words until they get on scene. It&#39;s a no win situation for the cops.</p>

<p>There is a separate issue when it comes to the types of supplies made available to police forces (things such as tanks and highly inappropriate military weapons and goods) but again not really something relevant in this specific case I would think most people agree we want police to have the basic ability to stop active shooters and protect people. I think a fire arm of reasonable power is appropriate for officers to carry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know if I’d agree with that. The problem that seems to be present is the lack of mindset or ratios used with their shiny new weapons. Often they appear to just dump off highly dangerous weapons and let the cops do what they want with them.</p>

<p>But I don’t really see a failure in tactics in this situation. Remember the cops can only go off of what they’ve heard and seen at this point. They have been told the suspect is armed, has already shot someone, and is considering setting the house on fire. </p>

<p>They then see this suspect after being told to keep his hands up quickly drop them to his waistband and raise them back up to eye level. Based on all that I can’t fault the cops for what happened in that moment. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong I think it’s absolutely tragic, that man did nothing wrong, he was obviously confused and had no way of knowing how any of his actions would be interpreted, and he may not have even been conscious that he dropped his hands at all.</p>

<p>Imagine for a moment that everything said in the call was true, I don’t anyone would be outraged then. The issue is that the cops were operating under a perceived threat (which I think was reasonable for them to do) that turned out to be non existent.</p>

<p>I think the real failure is everything that came before that. We need to be able to accurately assess where calls are coming from and if descriptions coincide with reality. However there isn’t really time to investigate in an ongoing shooting like that, people already complain about response times.</p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that cops have dealt with fake swatting incidents many times before. In majority of these cases, there were no deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct, the lack of correct training is the problem. Police are trained to perceive and believe the worst-case scenario will happen, so they are more likely to kill people even if they are no real threat, because they perceive anyone as a threat due to the hyper-vigilant training they receive. They are trained into a &quot;danger imperative mindset&quot;. Changing the training as oppose to just throwing more money at training is what is needed, however de-esculation training (like human psychology and social work classes) are complex and usually requires a lot of money to fund for officers. There needs to be better training mandated, more money specifically spent on that &quot;good&quot; training to help fix this problem.</p>

<p>I had to mock it off with the statement, &quot; that&#39;s how it was in a class system of the 16th century&quot;.</p>

<p>It isnt far from how it is today. How we choose to see it and how it is gone about, it is the relevance and perspective of those involved. Us outside will always have to have continence.</p>

<p>The destraction is that that was 500 years ago and that this is today. Nothing has changed.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t cite any thing recently; I can&#39;t say police localities haven&#39;t been militarized, and I can&#39;t say that they haven&#39;t been trained in urban warfare.</p>

<p>What I can say is be aware. If you&#39;re approached by such, be forthcoming to avoid unnecessary violence. More likely than not they&#39;re 100x more misinformed than you, as per programming.</p>

Immobilization should be the first alternative to peaceful resolution, not from negotiating straight to shooting them to death. I swear American cops are trigger happy, simple, egotistical and or have fucking horrible aim. They&#39;re basically the equivalent of stormtroopers.

The fact this is being played as entirely the prank callers fault fucking blows my mind. It&#39;s like the cops aren&#39;t human, they&#39;re robots, tools, or dogs, if you sick em on someone it&#39;s not their fault if they murder harmless innocents as a result. like no, the cops should be peacekeepers not an execution squad for &#39;hire&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to be the one supporting police, but this one made sense to me after hearing the reasons why.</p>

<p>+They only denied employment to those scoring in the top 2%tile on the IQ test. </p>

<p>+Top 2%ers are capable of getting a better job than a police officer.</p>

<p>+Police work is extremely boring 99% of the time.</p>

<p>+Training each officer is time-consuming and expensive.</p>

<p>What the police employment agencies found was that very smart people would only last in the job for a short amount of time after training. They would get bored and start looking for that other 6 figure job.</p>

<p>I can understand that as someone who used to hire delivery drivers. I wouldn&#39;t bother hiring someone with a CDL license because I knew within a couple months they would leave for a tractor-trailer job that paid 3 times as much.</p>

<p>The smarty-pants cops are not using leave. They are outright leaving the profession.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say it would be ok to not hire a pregnant women if the training costs were high <em>and</em> she had the intention of leaving the job permanently a few months later. That should be acceptable for any reason. Employers want long term employees if training costs are high. It&#39;s that simple. Social justice nonsense doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>No, you&#39;d be putting <em>citizens</em> above the police, which is where they <em>should be</em>. The cops are here to protect <em>us</em>, not to protect <em>themselves</em>, and the dozens of police murders we&#39;re seeing every year where the officer &quot;was scared for his life&quot; only to find out that the suspect was unarmed, or that it was a toy gun or bb gun or whatever, should no longer be acceptable. They should <em>never</em> have been acceptable, to even the most dogged supporter of the police. </p>

<p>If you want to treat cops like heroes maybe you should enforce heroic expectations for them and their behavior. They&#39;re not doing anything heroic &quot;putting themselves in danger&quot; when at the first <em>perceived</em> sign of danger (to poorly trained officers) they react with lethal force. That&#39;s not them protecting us, and until there is a change in this (along with an end to the war on drugs) public sentiment against the police will only get worse. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out why, although I expect you&#39;ll still defend the police up until <em>you&#39;re</em> the one dealing with a jumpy rookie cop shoving his gun barrel in your face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, all people are scared, jumpy, nervous animals. Cops are no different. You don&#39;t see the problem in giving a scared, jumpy, nervous animal a lethal weapon and the badge and authority to kill with impunity? That&#39;s why our police need to be trained, so that they can suppress their fear response sufficiently to make calm, professional calls of judgment in potentially tense situations. That&#39;s what they <em>should be doing</em>, not blasting away anyone even remotely considered a <em>potential</em> threat and picking up the pieces when they&#39;re dead, to go on to receive all the support from their union necessary to keep their jobs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about turning the police into robots, it&#39;s about turning <em>people</em> into actual <em>police</em> rather than simply handing any thug a badge and gun and telling him to &quot;go out and protect people.&quot; </p>

<p>The way some of y&#39;all talk about cops I really wonder if you know the difference between actual police work and a military occupation, how they should have the right to &quot;just fucking shoot you&quot; if you &quot;do something stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>the original comment would indicate that they shouldn&#39;t be able to shoot even if a gun is being pointed directly at them. the same as the Obama administration&#39;s ROG.</p>

<p>there&#39;s all this talk about training but that costs money. whenever there&#39;s proposals to increase budget they&#39;re protested because it would be funding those darn murdering pigs. </p>

<p>there&#39;s also different levels of stupidity. many claim putting pineapple on pizza is stupid but that&#39;s not life threatening. pointing a gun at someone is.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole point, my dude, <em>I&#39;m not a cop</em>. And <em>neither are you</em>. We shouldn&#39;t base our expectations for police behavior on that of the average citizen. They&#39;re <em>supposed to be better than that</em>. Otherwise they&#39;re no different than any random thug with a badge and gun. </p>

<p>Anyway, idk why you disagree but it seems you&#39;re set. </p>

This is life, it&#39;s unfair and tragedy happens.  If we tell police to keep their guns in their holster until fired upon, that&#39;s when you run into tragedies where civilians and police officers are put at risk.

<p>I get people&#39;s outrage, I really do.  I&#39;m fortunate enough to never have put myself in a situation where a rookie cop would need to suspect me of something.  But what are possible solutions? You can&#39;t train someone to react a certain way in instances where their life feels threatened and even if you do, you&#39;ll never know how they react until they actually are in a situation like that.</p>

<p>I volunteer at a local street festival every year.  Probably a few thousand people are there at any given moment so they hire off duty cops as security.  If a fight breaks out these days, they just let them beat the shit out of each other because the moment they get involved everyone takes out their cell phones to film hoping to catch them doing something wrong.  They&#39;d rather sit back and keep their jobs because they have families to feed.  This is not the world I want to live in. But that&#39;s just me</p>

<p>1) You&#39;re not describing police work, here, you&#39;re describing a military occupation. Armed officers patrolling, hands on weapons at all times, ready to shoot any who resist or flee with no questions asked or any official reprimand of any kind... </p>

<p>2) What the fuck are you even going <em>on about</em> in the last half of this? There is no mutual exclusive property where cops can&#39;t be trained to suppress their fear, to make appropriate and responsible calls of judgment, while still stopping liquor store robbers or &quot;people who smoke weed in a car with toddlers&quot; (<strong><em>what the actual, everloving FUCK does this have to do with armed police response?</em></strong> Unless you&#39;re referring to the actual, real world cases where such people have been shot in cold blood?)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually, you can train people to <strong><em>not shoot unless fired upon</em></strong>. It&#39;s really that simple. For an officer to <strong><em>respond</em></strong> with lethal force, there must first be lethal force or a credible threat of lethal force used against them or another. People aren&#39;t trained to respond professionally in tense situations, so woops they get scurred and end up shooting people. It&#39;s just going to keep happening over and over again until something is done. </p>

<p>Maybe people will be less primed to record improper actions by the police if the police no longer supported police who constantly commit violations? Maybe when the police are no longer able to murder with impunity, this behavior will see a decline? </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the world I want to live in either, which is why I&#39;m talking about and thinking about solutions. The way things are aren&#39;t working, because the police are primed from the get-go to have the very fear-based reactions their training should be suppressing. It&#39;s topsy-turvy from the start to finish, how we train and handle our police. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but what this person was saying is they shouldn&#39;t be able to shoot unless being shot at. I&#39;m not talking about shooting at someone who is unarmed or even someone reaching for something. like I said if I&#39;m stupid enough to point a gun, real or fake, at them I fully expect to be shot. why? because I&#39;d do the same if I was in their position. if I was an officer and I was told I couldn&#39;t shoot someone who has a gun pointed right at me I&#39;d quit in a heartbeat. yes a situation can be de-escalated but then you&#39;re gambling with your life. </p>

<p>especially with what they get paid I guarantee many officers would not be willing to take that risk. and then what happens when the majority of police quit and things go south? oh yeah they send in the national guard.</p>

<p>1) When armed police give you instructions, follow them to the letter it might (big might, dependson how trigger happy they are) save your life.</p>

<p>2) I&#39;ve always gamed online, yep i can get frustrated at some kills or if i do something stupid but i would never want to see another human lose their life over it (IRL). I have to wonder, are games making people more violent? Would the nerds at the LAN party do this shit back in the 90&#39;s while playing Quake? Would somebody get stabbed in an arcade for beating the PacMan/Space invaders high score?</p>

<p>Very very troubling trend that i see in gaming, especially online games like CoD Battlefield etc. As if our youth are being programmed with more &#39;violent&#39; games. To be clear, games were much much more violent back in the day, but they seem to induce more rage in kids nowadays.</p>

<p>Wrong, you are dead.</p>

<p>Its ok, do not worry. The guy the cop shot got it wrong too.</p>

<p>Correct response was &#39;fall on face keeping arms over head then slither like a worm&#39; which is very hard to do, because when you fall that way your arms instinctively pull in to protect the face, which will also get you shot.</p>

<p>This is the problem. Why do cops in other countries seem to be able to do their jobs better than our cops, but without shooting up the citizenry in the process.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>right.  b/c no one in the event chain between prank call and dead guy could have made a decision to de-escalate.  typical cop b.s.</p>

<p>that cop wanted to shoot someone and was looking for an excuse.  nobody becomes a cop because they&#39;re interested in building their communities.  Construction, healthcare, teaching, any of the trades... those are what build communities.  Firefighting or EMT if the the adrenaline rush is that important.</p>

<p>cops become cops for one reason: power.  either wielding it or being afraid of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I think those are the reason why most ppl join the force. 
BUT, you also need a specific training to be able to shoot a man with such efficiency and cold heartedness. You need to have everything already rationalize and see whoever stand your way as a number rather than a human.
Somebody says that US police lack training, I think they are having too much, just of the wrong kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An arrest was made in L.A.</p>

<p>According to what I have read so far, the accused swatter called city hall initially, and was transferred to a dispatcher.  The caller attempted to make the dispatcher believe there was a hostage situation, and he was one of the hostages.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe, but I would think part of the police militarization ramp up over the last decade would give local authorities the ability to at least know where a call originated from (like Los Angeles?), and quite possibly far, far more than that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them">Here we see stingray status in KS is unknown</a> This certainly does not indicate they don&#39;t have it, just that no one is sure on the matter.</p>

<p>Coupled with the fact that <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article184179651.html">Kansas is one of the most secretive states in the U.S.</a></p>

<p>Everything is not a conspiracy.  Sometimes bad shit just happens.  Unfortunately my complete lack of trust in my own local, state, and federal government has forced me to now see things like this through the eyes of a cynic, and I am simply exploring possibilities.</p>

<p>After a tragedy like this, it seems to me the people of KS would simply  cease to question technology like this being available to their local law enforcement, possibly even welcome it through fear.</p>

<p>Another consideration here is an unquestionable big time elite up to their eye holes in all levels of politics that just so happen to live in Wichita, and would want nothing more than local authorities keeping a finger on the pulse of the local population.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/us/koch-brothers-donate-heavily-in-kansas.html">The Koch brothers</a>  </p>

<p>This is not an accusation, simply an exploration.  I am not at all saying this is some big conspiracy that&#39;s all been faked.  I do think this will usher in much more open use of surveillance by local authorities if nothing else, or maybe I am just sitting here drinking coffee slowly losing my god damn mind.  I can&#39;t tell anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, my first thought was “how the fuck could they not know the call didn’t originate from inside the same house?”.</p>

<p>Actually, that was my second thought. First was just how horrible a situation for all involved it was. </p>

<p>When I was a kid, in the 80’s, me and a buddy made a prank call to 911 from a payphone. We thought it would be funny to pop a balloon near the phone and pretend it was shots fired. I lived in a really small town, one cop to patrol like three towns. Holy shit were we surprised to walk the mile or so back to his house and find the State Police sitting there waiting for us, with a $150 fine.</p>

<p>I’m not saying this was the smartest thing to do on our parts, and I’m certainly not proud of it, but Point is, this was nearly 30 years ago. We were pinpointed within a few minutes. And the cops didn’t show up and just blow everybody away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Straw Man often?</p>

<p>The smarty-pants cops are not using leave. They are outright leaving the profession.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say it would be ok to not hire a pregnant women if the training costs were high <em>and</em> she had the intention of leaving the job permanently a few months later. That should be acceptable for any reason. Employers want long term employees if training costs are high. It&#39;s that simple. Social justice nonsense doesn&#39;t matter. </p>
