    <div class="md"><p>The Manhattan nanny charged with killing two tiny siblings she was supposed to be protecting begged to be put out of her “misery” as she recovered in the hospital from slicing her own throat with a kitchen knife, a cop testified Thursday. Yoselyn Ortega, 55, repeated regrets about fatally stabbing little Lulu, 6, and Leo Krim, 2, in October 2012 before trying to kill herself in the family’s Upper West Side apartment, where she regularly cared for them, according to NYPD Officer Delilah Solis. Marina Krim, the mother Lulu and Leo arrived home to the horrifying scene of her dead children in their W. 75th St. apartment, with Ortega in the process of slicing her own throat with a kitchen knife. Krim and another daughter had been out at a swim class when her oldest and youngest children were killed.</p>

<p>This is like saying, &quot;louie&#39;s pizzaria runs the block&quot;.</p>

<p>No, friend. Certain countries are just front-organizations for large shadow-governments operating like organized crime. Israel is an Anglo-American/ashki-russian front. &#39;NK&#39; is a Russian/Chinese front. Palestine is a Arab/Iranian front. Hezbollah an Iranian front. ISIS a Saudi/Israeli/Turkish front - using US capital. </p>

<p>Fronts serve as funnels for the world power projections. They are not &#39;in control&#39; of anything more than those that own the majority capital that supports such entities. The &#39;brains&#39; can do little without the &#39;lungs&#39;</p>

<p>They had them murdered that same night the article aired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No &quot;article&quot; ever &quot;aired&quot;. The only thing that CNBC did was to post <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/major-banks-governmental-officials-and-their-comrade-capitalists-targets-of-spire-law-group-llps-racketeering-and-money-laundering-lawsuit-seeking-return-of-43-trillion-to-the-united-states-treasury-175828861.html">this press release</a> from Spire Law Group on its web site. <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/CNBCvanishedarticleSpire.jpg">Here&#39;s a screenshot</a> that somebody captured in 2012.</p>

<p>As part of an automated process, CNBC and other web sites ran the press release; for example, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121027235720/www.marketwatch.com/story/major-banks-governmental-officials-and-their-comrade-capitalists-targets-of-spire-law-group-llps-racketeering-and-money-laundering-lawsuit-seeking-return-of-43-trillion-to-the-united-states-treasury-2012-10-25">here on Dow Jones&#39; Market Watch</a>.</p>

<p>Nor was this the first press release. Back in April 2012, they <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-1647025.htm">ran this one</a> which also was posted on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120428003648/www.marketwatch.com/story/home-owners-across-the-nation-sue-all-bank-servicers-and-their-offshore-havens-spire-law-officially-announces-filing-of-landmark-lawsuit-2012-04-23">marketwatch.com</a> and yahoo.com, among others.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was initially filed in NY state court. It was then removed to Federal court in NY. The judge there denied class status and dismissed all the cases except for the first named plaintiff, Deborah Abeel, which he ordered transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. <a href="http://voidjudgements.net/suedc/AbeelClassDismissed.pdf">(Source—PDF )</a> That case was withdrawn a couple of weeks later.</p>

<p>This case was designed to bilk the <em>plaintiffs</em>. Spire Law group got thousands of dollars from each of its clients without any reasonable chance of ever winning any award. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120626003359/sherriequestioningall.blogspot.com/2012_04_01_archive.html">Here&#39;s a blog post from April 2012</a> from someone who thought their earlier lawsuit (in state court) was great until she contacted them: &quot;It seems they want $10,000 to $18,000 from anyone who wants to join the suit.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in 2012, a redditor collected some information here: <a href="http://pastehtml.com/view/cgi2dqpym.html">http://pastehtml.com/view/cgi2dqpym.html</a></p>

<p>This lawsuit was started by Mitchell J. Stein, who is now disbarred and in prison. The California Attorney General took action against Stein and 3 other attorneys for scamming clients <a href="http://www.calbarjournal.com/September2011/TopHeadlines/TH2.aspx">in September 2011</a>, almost a year before the CNBC nanny murder. Mitchell J. Stein was convicted in 2013 on unrelated fraud charges and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-sentenced-17-years-prison-multi-million-dollar-stock-fraud">sentenced to 17 years in prison</a>.</p>

<p>The children&#39;s alleged killer —the family&#39;s nanny— is still awaiting trial. There is <strong>no evidence</strong> that anyone else was involved in the deaths.</p>

<p>You wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s a clear sign of &quot;no concrete evidence, but common sense says connect the dots&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm, let&#39;s see what &quot;dots&quot; there are.</p>

<ol>
<li>A law firm files frivolous lawsuits to get fees from homeowners.</li>
<li>After that law firm is disbarred by the California attorney general, another law firm takes up the suit.</li>
<li>To get publicity and attract more homeowners and steal more money from them, the law firm issues a press release, and months later, another press release.</li>
<li>Many web sites publish the press releases.</li>
<li>About 3½ hours after the second one is published, a nanny kills the children of a CNBC executive.</li>
</ol>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to make up some incredible &quot;dots&quot; to connect point 5 to the others. Let&#39;s try.</p>

<ul>
<li>Somebody (Person X) is annoyed that the lawsuit is publicized—even though it is so frivolous it is dismissed within weeks and the attorney general of California has already declared it fraudulent.</li>
<li>Person X picks one of the web sites where the press release ran. Why this web site?</li>
<li>Person X picks one of the executives at the company that runs the web site. Why this executive?</li>
<li>Person X finds the residence of the executive, kills the children or convinces the nanny to kill the children, then convinces the nanny to attempt suicide in front of the children&#39;s mother. How? Why? What did it accomplish?</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this within 3½ hours! Seriously?</p>

<ul>
<li>Later, the nanny confesses multiple times to the crimes and never mentions any other person being present. Why?</li>
</ul>

<p>Are those the dots you were thinking of?</p>

<p>Later, the nanny confesses multiple times to the crimes and never mentions any other person being present. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A nanny accused of stabbing two children under her care in a Manhattan apartment confessed to the murders as she lay in a hospital bed on Halloween in 2012. Unable to speak because she was on a ventilator, she pointed at a chart to indicate yes and no to questions from investigators, a former assistant district attorney testified at a pretrial hearing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>“She admitted that she had killed the kids and that she had used at least two knives,” the former Manhattan prosecutor, Gregory B. LeDonne, said. “She indicated she was mad at the mom.”</p>

<p>A defense lawyer, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg, has asked Justice Gregory Carro to throw out several statements made to the authorities by the nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, arguing that prosecutors ignored messages from a defense lawyer hired by her family that she not be interviewed without him present. Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg has also asserted Ms. Ortega was too sick and too impaired by drugs to waive her right to a lawyer, much less to answer questions truthfully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The update is that the nanny lived and maintains her innocence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the system locked her up, declared her insane, pumped her so full of drugs that she couldn&#39;t speak. Then claims the nanny admitted to the crime by pointing in the direction of a written response.</p>

<p>Nanny is wheeled in on a bed with a ventilator.</p>

<p>Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg has signaled her intention to mount an insanity defense, and her client has been examined by forensic psychiatrists for each side.

<p>Because that&#39;s what you&#39;d do if you were trying to kill yourself in a murder suicide. It&#39;s the little details that give most people pause when they actually look into this.

In my experience self stabbing or cutting isn’t that far out of the norm. But, that’s anecdotal. I don’t know what the statistical breakdown would be, but I wouldn’t say that act makes this suspicious. It is something people do. I’ve seen the aftermath of it many times.

<p>So you meant that you know a lot of people who&#39;ve stabbed themselves and are comparing them to the group of people who cut? Or... suggesting that they&#39;re in the same category? Or... that of all the people who&#39;ve mutilated themselves, most stab themselves? </p>

<p>And, do you really think they don’t fit in a category (self inflicted neck wound by sharp tool)? Sure, there is a distinction but they’re in a broader category.

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, you mean cutting like the kids with black hair who scratch their arms. I meant the term more literally. Like cutting/slitting. Cutting your neck to commit suicide. 
And, in my experience, it is not unusual for people to attempt suicide this way. To stab themselves in the neck, or slice/cut it open. Who cares, it’s interchangeable to me. The point is that lady stabbing herself in the neck does not, to me, indicate a conspiracy. People do that. They stab themselves in the neck. </p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculous that you think that stabbing and cutting are literally, by your own words, interchangeable. It&#39;s ridiculous how you&#39;ve been weirdly forcing the comparison between them in an attempt to downplay the argument you are pretending to deal with. It&#39;s ridiculous how you pick and choose little snippets to reply to, but never the spirit of the comment, just little angles that you think you can use. It&#39;s ridiculous that we&#39;re having this conversation when the original point that I made was that a person is unlikely to stab themselves in the neck to kill themselves. This is all ridiculous.</p>

<p>What?? You are going to have to explain that one, champ. I mean, the whole thing. It doesn’t make sense. It is nonsensical.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Grammar aside, what is this imaginary department? And, is the chosen method (that you see in your department lol) to cut their wrists when found by a Mother after killing her children? Is it entirely unlikely that she stabbed herself in the throat (even though we’ve seen cases of this in our departments.. lol)? Could this have been an exigent circumstance that caused an impulsive/grandiose act of self mutilation (that we’ve seen in the past in our departments 😂)?</p>

<p>Sometimes.  Questioning everything and anything can be a waste of time.  Like, that dude provided links backing up his talking points, but you’re choosing to focus on the fact that the comment is gilded like it’s the most interesting part of the comment.  You could be applying your skepticism towards the facts or links or any other part of the conversation that might be useful.  Instead, you’re questioning the Reddit gold.  Sounds like a waste of time.</p>

<p>Also, are you accusing me of spreading lies and propaganda?  You’re already digging through my history - give me some examples of propaganda or lies that I’m spreading.  I’m interested to see what you consider propaganda.</p>

<p>That says nothing.  Give me some examples, prove yourself right.  My stance on race is informed by facts and statistics, I tend to push back against uninformed assholes who preach racial inequality.  If you’re one of those people, stand up for your bigotry.  If I’m spreading lies, then prove it.  </p>

<p>Also, according to this article, she is pleading not guilty by way of insanity. </p>

<p>What the fuck does that even mean?^ Did they take a patient out of intensive care and wheel her ass into court while a ventilator is doing her breathing for her? (In case you don’t know that absolutely would not happen and absolutely did not happen here)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the Abeel v. Bank of America case? Where Spire Law Group took several thousand dollars from ordinary people as part of a <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0256-mass-joinder-lawsuits">mass joinder scam</a> and then vanished? Something tells me that the banks weren&#39;t quaking in their boots on that one. And CNBC probably took the &quot;report&quot; down because it was a press release from scam artists. I also sincerely doubt that Kevin Krim (the &quot;person in charge&quot;) actually had or has editorial control over what gets posted, seeing as how that wasn&#39;t their job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple people did debunk it above you in the comments. cnbc published a press release from a lawsuit which was itself a conspiracy to defraud &quot;plaintiffs&quot; the Spire lawgroup charged multiple of thousands of dollars to participate. Multiple other news organizations published the same press release. This particular press release wasn&#39;t even the first one given on the suit. 3.5 hrs after the press release, an executive at cnbc&#39;s wife walked in on her stabbed children, with the nanny red handed. Nanny attempted suicide, lived and pled insanity. There is no plausable connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember when this murder happened here in NYC. This is the first I&#39;m seeing of this angle. The mom and the super of the building walked in on the nanny murdering them, I think. No mention of anyone else being in the room when it happened. This was so horrific. The front of their building was a beautiful memorial of cards, candles, flowers and notes from many nannies saying they would never do something like this to their young charges. It was always a mystery to me what set this nanny off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh this is weird. I was emailing with Kevin the day before this happened. Was at a company that did a lot of segments with CNBC at the time.</p>

<p>I can assure you that this came out of left field and I’ve never heard anyone even suggest it had to do with them airing this. Not to mention, this segment wasn’t something that Kevin would have even been on the ground with as he actually dealt much more with their more mindless talk shows on CNBC.</p>

<p>Interesting to see this thread trying to connect the dots, but I think it’s highly unlikely these were in any way connected. He had a nanny that went insane and started stabbing. It was a tragedy and I don’t think there’s any particular reason for it other than her own mental issues. I’ve never heard Kevin or anyone else suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>If this was truly a “hit” than wouldn’t the people doing it make it clear what it was payback for?</p>
