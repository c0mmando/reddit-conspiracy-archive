        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Erica Garner became and activist against police violence after her father, Eric Garner, died at the hand of police during a brutal assult by the police. She was also an advicate for Bernie Sanders during rhe 2016 primaries. She died today at ONLY 27 years old of a HEART ATTACK. I would like to discuss the suspicions that people may have about this and this communities opinion of her death.</p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/30/erica-garner-dies-after-suffering-major-heart-attack/">https://nypost.com/2017/12/30/erica-garner-dies-after-suffering-major-heart-attack/</a></p>

<p>I also wanted to provide an source stating her death which is the link above.</p>

<p>On a side note, I was lying on my couch listening to whichever news station is on TV right now and heard the story of her death. I then picked up my phone and opened google to find out more about her death,  before I even startes typing the google suggestion was &quot;Erica Garner dies at 27 yrs old&quot; or something to that extent. Kinda freaked me out but being an everyday lurker off this sub it didn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

<p>Sorey about any format, grammar or spelling issues, I am on a phone posting this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I understand that it isn&#39;t impossible for someone that young to have a heart attack but it definitely struck me as a bit odd when i heard the cause her death. I am very close to her age and I work at a Cardiology office so with both of those things in mind it was just hard for me to dogest I guess. I haven&#39;t dug into her life or anything yet, this is honestly the first I&#39;ve heard od her, but this situation definitely sparked mu attention. 
Also with that said I an sure young people do have heart attacks but seeing all the elderly that come through my office with previous MIs on their chart I just wonder the chances of them surviving one and a 27 not after a week in the hospital. Maybe there were other complications I am not aware of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 28 so I can agree that its always shocking to hear of people our age dying like this. After looking into it a bit it seems that she had a heart attack earlier this year after an asthma attack.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, google is creeping on everything. Sometimes I feel like it is reading my mind, I don’t even have to type anything before it has my query listed. </p>

<p>Interesting about Erica Garner. 27 is pretty young. Did she have any known health issues or drug habits? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah my first thought when I opened the text box was damn did google just read my mind then i thought it through and I know they are listening through my phone. Also it is a fairly new story so it is probably a popular search right now but do they have to be so creepy about it.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t really dug into her life yet but this definitely sparked my interest and I will be when i get the chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super creepy indeed. And with stupid stuff, not just hot trending topics. I was eating an apple one day, my dog wanted some. I picked up my phone to check if apples are ok for dogs to eat, first thing that came up, I didn’t type it and didn’t speak it. Did the fuckers hear me biting an apple and know I have a begging dog? Fucking stalkers, man! </p>

<p>PS: apple is ok for dogs, just not the seeds. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol.. yeah I wish I knew why they were listening and could hear what they were hearing. As far as sound quality if you put the phone in the other room and turn the radio on run the shower flush the toilet stand on your head rub your stomach and counterclockwise circles does it make it harder for them to hear? Also I had such a great visual while reading your post about your dog. I just gave my dog peanut butter-filled Apple like a Kong love the peanut butter left the Apple</p>
