       i've written a few posts on the hiearchy / hero system deal.  in a nutshell it's a shitty way to model a domain.  the heroes/nodes in the hierarchy all fail the same way.  it uses the same shitty model hero/villian/victim paradigm to perpetuate itself, which is also fucking fractal.  it sucks at cross-cutting complexity.  and it leads to oversimplified models that truncate capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       the better way to model things is thru phi.  in other words, appending narrative design.  that's why language is phi - it's the best technique we have to describe things.  it doesn't suffer the same cross-cutting modeling issues.  and it scales in complexity linearly instead of combinatorically.
      </p>
      <p>
       so to answer your question we use narratives of single responsibility rules to describe our society's rules.  we control mutation of our "social book of rules" in this way.  we test our models in this way.  and we solve things on an issue by issue basis where the responsibility of our social management functions is clearly described, clearly understandable and can be parcelled out to service providers.  no more hierarchy.  no more hero failures.  just constantly improving design.  the legal system kinda uses this approach but it does it shitty and we have the tech now to make it function much better.

       The answer I've come to, and it's really not popular, is that we need hierarchies but...
      </p>
      <p>
       there's never going to be a hierarchy thats 'the good guys' and their enemies are 'the bad guys' and it's all really simple and easy to figure out.  Having a good hierarchy requires constant monitoring of their actions and motives and a never ending fight against the corrupting forces that inevitably attempt to infiltrate it.

       Whenever humanity (all of it, not this 50/50 bullshit we have now) works for the greater good. Let me put it this way, some people can't even decide what to eat for dinner; and now you want them to think about saving the earth? Heiarchy will always exist as long as people are content with what they have; because others won't be content with being average. And it's those people, for better or worse; that invented electricity, the internet, etc.

       I really think that the vatican is not involve in something like this. Catholic church values go against all evil,yes there are pedo priests as there are pedo doctos,teachers etc but I think that the church always have a bad reputation because by doing this people continue been against the church and been away by doing to the right things that the bible encourages to do.

       Most Catholics are very humble, honest, devout people as taught by the Catholic Church.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hierarchy of organizations like this though are like crack cocaine to people obsessed with power.  Invariably this lever of power becomes fought over by every group of psychopaths who want to use it to increase their wealth and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Catholic Church, being thousands of years old, has been absolutely rotted from the inside by corruption.  I don't look down at people raised in the Catholic faith as most of them are really good people trying to better themselves, admit their personal flaws and treat their fellow humans well.  There isn't much more a human being can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the organization controlling the whole thing is living large off of a really corrupt and bizarre network.  And the Jesuits in particular seem to always be involved in worldwide conspiracies and the historical atrocities committed in the name of the Pope and his puppet monarchies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess what I'm saying is try not to take what's said here about the Vatican as a personal attack.  There are some very evil people pretending to be good and exhorting other people to live in a moral way just like your average mason is just a guy involved in a fun club that does things for charity.

       They actively hid and covered for priests. It wasn't some big surprise. Don't be fooled. They use the righteousness of spirituality and connecting with god and use that so you would never "suspect" they are up to something. Same thing with crooked CPS workers, adoption agencies that traffic kids. Same scenario of playing on our empathy and emotions because they lack them and can see the potential for control they have.

       I did some astral projection over at the Vatican recently and it looked like they had some majorly discusting human experimentation in the 50s going on. I think that they sort of tried to clean up some of their act, but they appear sort of dark like they aren't really walking in the light. Like they have their sins all over them. I got so angry I wanted to destroy it all. I saw lots of religious iconography and imagery and it just looked like a slideshow. It was so fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I left and then heard a voice telling me nononono. I sat down near a cave mouth and felt like the earth was calming me down and massaging me. I believe that maybe I was being told that there was another way to face this evil than through angel.
