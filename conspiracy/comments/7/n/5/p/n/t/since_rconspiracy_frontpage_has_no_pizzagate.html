    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but this video is bullshit. This guy is just cherry picking a few ridiculous theories from 4chan and random bloggers to &#39;disprove&#39; pizzagate.</p>

<p>At 17:00 he shows the photo of Alefantis with holding the kid, and this evidence is &#39;debunked&#39; because he disproves the theory that the yellow necklace is a &#39;sex bracelet&#39;. But he conveniently ignores the hashtag on the photo, #chickenlovers, which is much more damning than the yellow necklace. At 25:00 he talks about the moon and star on the Comet Ping Pong logo, but also conveniently chooses to ignore the Besta Pizza logo which is an FBI-recognized symbol for pedophilia. At 19:00 he &#39;debunks&#39; the picture of work being done in the basement, without realizing that the work is actually being done at another property owned by Alefantis.</p>

<p>There is no hard evidence of a sex-ring run by James Alefantis, Podesta brothers, and other D.C. elites. But there&#39;s a lot of weird shit out there that suggest that there might be, and this video does absolutely nothing to &#39;debunk&#39; pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you are having difficulty distinguishing in your mind two different concepts: one is circumstantial evidence of a crime, which would typically lead to an investigation and prosecution.

<p>Oh yea forgot to mention, the only one&#39;s I saw were cheese, pizza, cheese pizza (The general subject of child porn or CP if your confused) and maaaaaaaaaybe hotdogs. Although that one doesn&#39;t really need proving but whatever.</p>

<p>Basically any 4channer has seen em before, And it&#39;s pretty (Embarrassing?) to admit they know pedo code words and maybe took the risk of taking a peek into a CP thread, So yea theirs not gonna be much people trying to prove it on forum of discussion that has comment history and muh upboats.</p>

<p>Or maybe your saying why aren&#39;t their any governmental investigations into it? In which case we can both agree their should be.</p>

<p>Ok so why are you being manipulative? You <em>debunked</em> the code&#39;s being FBI list, But theirs no point in doing that when I already proved the codes were legit?</p>

<p>Not sure if you know, But pizzagate investigators are calling for a <em>official</em> investigation (Yes their&#39;s people are T_D getting all hyped and acting like this is put you behind bars evidence, But again it&#39;s just hype, Not really serious).</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s a helluva lot more than one by the way.</p>

<p>Well now I know your a shill. Literally explained where you could find the records (Archives which would be 100% proof). And now your just ignoring that completely? And also being manipulative with the &quot;It&#39;s all just a larp&quot; thing.</p>

<p>Uh &quot;no connection&quot; huh? Even though their are literally right next to eachother?</p>

<p>Actually I just found something real interesting. The owner of Besta Pizza was a attorney in a human trafficking prosecution unit... And if that wasn&#39;t strange enough of a coincidence. I will point out how <em>HE SOMEHOW DIDN&quot;T KNOW ABOUT THE PEDO SYMBOL</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about that. But the issue here what &quot;circumstantial&quot; actually means.</p>

<p>I could claim that someone&#39;s red hair is circumstantial evidence that they are spawn from hell. That doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence relies on inference. There has to be a reasonable association between the evidence and the accusation. No reasonable person would infer that a red headed person is evil because of the color of their hair.</p>

<p>Fingerprints and even a smoking gun are considered circumstantial evidence, but that&#39;s only because a reasonable person infer the crime because of the fact. The first fact in OP&#39;s video references an email sent by a low-ish level employee that makes a joke about hot dogs. There&#39;s no reasonable association between that and pedophilia, sex-trafficking, etc.</p>

<p>This means it&#39;s not circumstantial evidence (at least not to a reasonable person), even though some people say it is. There is actually very little (if any) circumstantial evidence I&#39;ve found that implicates Alefantis, Podesta, etc.</p>

It&#39;s not very comprehensive, but it goes over some of the major circumstantial evidence. There&#39;s no proof, but at the end of the video Swann asks the same question that I&#39;m asking - why hasn&#39;t anyone investigated any of this?</p>

<p>If you do more research there is quite are quite a few strange &#39;coincidences&#39; that Swann didn&#39;t touch on. I would suggest you at least look into it and decide for yourself. Some additional things that I think are important to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alefantis&#39; Instagram <em>does</em> contain some very strange things. In a <a href="http://archive.is/DLjk7">photo</a> with a young boy, he uses the hashtag &#39;#chickenlovers&#39;, which is widely known and recognized pedophile code. The photo with the girl taped to the table is also relevant. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pELKbz9HaoM">This video, NSFL</a>. The kid in the video supposedly calls the abuser both John and &#39;Skippy&#39;, a nickname that Podesta uses for himself in the leaked emails. The voices sound remarkably similar, and the strobe light in the video is also the same light pattern as a strobe used by Heavy Breathing at a Comet Ping Pong show. Again, this is absolutely not proven, but with all the other ties to Podesta/CPP, I think it warrants some further investigation.</li>
<li>Comet Ping Pong&#39;s website contained a password protected section with individual files available to download that <em>also required download keys</em>. This password protection section has since been removed. Why does a pizza place have multiple levels of password protection for individual files on the back-end of their website? When the gunman fired 1 shot inside of Comet Ping Pong, <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/05/comet-ping-pong-police-report-edgar-maddison-welch/">according to the Washington Post</a> the only things damaged were &quot;a door, door lock, <em>computer tower</em>, and barrier wall&quot;. This, to me, seems like a staged event to dispose of the hard drive on the computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there was an investigation and &#39;Pizzagate&#39; turned out to be true, All of this would be presented at the trial as circumstantial evidence. Again, there is absolutely no proof. I&#39;m not disputing that fact. But it hasn&#39;t been debunked as the mainstream media seems to suggest.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about that. But the issue here is what &quot;circumstantial&quot; actually means.</p>

<p>I could claim that someone&#39;s red hair is circumstantial evidence that they are spawn from hell. That doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence relies on inference. There has to be a reasonable association between the evidence and the accusation. No reasonable person would infer that a red headed person is evil because of the color of their hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically your talking about the pedo code. You just don&#39;t <em>say</em> it clearly for some reason. Anyways the pedo code is real unless 4chan literally time traveled. That simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fingerprints and even a smoking gun are considered circumstantial evidence, but that&#39;s only because a reasonable person can infer a crime because of that fact. The first fact in OP&#39;s video references an email sent by a low-ish level employee that makes a joke about hot dogs. There&#39;s no reasonable association between that and pedophilia, sex-trafficking, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it&#39;s pretty reasonable to equate hotdogs to dick. Especially if used in a odd way. Which is typical in the emails.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This means it&#39;s not circumstantial evidence (at least not to a reasonable person), even though some people say it is. There is actually very little (if any) circumstantial evidence I&#39;ve found that implicates Alefantis, Podesta, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not circumstantial evidence to people who haven&#39;t done research or have been lied too. Or lieing shills.</p>

<p>You <em>completely</em> misinterpreted what I was saying. I wasn&#39;t referencing the codes at all. I was more thinking along the lines of the Podesta art:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are no examples of pedophile serial murderers collecting &quot;weird&quot; art like Tony Podesta.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet, according to PG, this is &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence that they are pedophile serial killers.</p></li>
<li><p>However, without any precedent or examples of this ever happening, there is no association between their art and pedophile serial killing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, there&#39;s no reasonable inference that there&#39;s an association between &quot;weird art&quot; and pedophilic murdering. <em>That&#39;s</em> what I mean by it not being &quot;circumstantial&quot;. And just because people <em>say</em> it&#39;s &quot;circumstantial&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so. It&#39;s the reason the vast majority of professional investigators (journalists, cops, etc) can debunk so much of the evidence. It&#39;s not what PG proponents say it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually it&#39;s pretty reasonable to equate hotdogs to dick. Especially if used in a odd way. Which is typical in the emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right in a very general sense. But I&#39;m referencing a specific email:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing here that would associate the writers of the email to the accused and there&#39;s no clear association between what is said and child sex trafficking. In other words: no reasonable person can infer a crime from this evidence. Thus, it&#39;s <strong>not</strong> &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it&#39;s not circumstantial evidence to people who haven&#39;t done research or have been lied too. Or lieing shills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;m either fooled or a shill? This is why I created this account. As the PG arguments are shot down, PG proponents inevitably start personally attacking people who are legitimately trying to look into pizzagate but simply disagree with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve explained my reasoning as thorough as I can and I haven&#39;t called anyone names. Seeing as this is what you&#39;re argument has devolved into, I&#39;m checking out. We can agree to disagree, but I think I&#39;ve made my points as clear as I could.</p>

<p>Ah, I see you were extremely vague on purpose just so you can pull this &quot;Gotcha!&quot; move. Even though it doesn&#39;t work on anyone who can use basic logic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you have any idea how obvious your manipulation is?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh your accusing someone who has art of sexualized abused children of being a pedophile&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;But what about a pedophile <em>serial</em> <em>killers</em>!&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;Has their ever been one of those who had art like this!&quot;</p>

<p>This is actually the most absurd manipulation of words I&#39;ve ever and probably will ever see in my life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, there&#39;s no reasonable inference that there&#39;s an association between &quot;weird art&quot; and pedophilic murdering.</p>

<p>&quot;weird art&quot;</p>

<p>Are you ACTUALLY FUCKING IMPLYING THE ART IS NOT WEIRD?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what I mean by it not being &quot;circumstantial&quot;. And just because people say it&#39;s &quot;circumstantial&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You forced it to not count as circumstantial evidence through the most broken logic I&#39;ve ever seen. Your logic is so bad if anyone heard you say it in real life they would attempt to get you checked into a mental hospital for mental retardation, Not even exaggerating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s the reason the vast majority of professional investigators (journalists, cops, etc)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes the &quot;PROFESSIONAL&quot; &quot;DEBUNKING&quot; that was mostly targeted at one subject that the MSM made to be the lynchpin of pizzagate. The basement in CPP not existing. (...Even though their was an article that existed before all of this where the owner mentions his basement).</p>

<p>Also no cops were involved, Dunno where your getting that from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can debunk so much of the evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok let me use an example of a typical &quot;Debunking&quot; article.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">https://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>Their debunking is the <em>WORD</em> of the suspects and... Nothing else... They mention some general subjects of the investigation and... Just don&#39;t fucking even <em>try</em> to debunk it. They literally just say it&#39;s crazy/absurd and move on. Oh and they also think that the &quot;Shooter&quot; somehow debunks it. (That guy who went there with a <em>assault</em> <em>rifle</em> and shot <em>one</em> bullet. That also conveniently hit the computer hard drive. What a coincidence!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing here that would associate the writers of the email to the accused and there&#39;s no clear association between what is said and child sex trafficking. In other words: no reasonable person can infer a crime from this evidence. Thus, it&#39;s not &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Well no actually, You kind of missed the part where he literally quotes &quot;Waitresses&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&#39;m either fooled or a shill? This is why I created this account. As the PG arguments are shot down, PG proponents inevitably start personally attacking people who are legitimately trying to look into pizzagate but simply disagree with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your either a shill, Or a troll, I refuse to believe anyone is retarded enough to use that logic you used and take it seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve explained my reasoning as thorough as I can and I haven&#39;t called anyone names. Seeing as this is what you&#39;re argument has devolved into, I&#39;m checking out. We can agree to disagree, but I think I&#39;ve made my points as clear as I could.</p>

<p>For a subreddit that claims to be skeptical and not take people&#39;s opinion at face value, they sure seem to put a lot of weight into people calling them &#39;crazy&#39; for believing that there is a large global network of very rich people who trade human lives like cattle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a minute of this and got to the first claimed fact, that &quot;no outside food can come into the White House.&quot; I would expect some kind of link  to verify this statement but there wasn&#39;t one so I googled and found a news story from 2010.<br/>
President Needs a Hot Dog Helping Hand<br/>
<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/President-Needs-a-Hot-Dog-Helping-Hand-96078774.html">Local helps cook hot dogs at White House picnic</a><br/>
The food was cooked at the White House. The $65,000 included transportation for two cooks from Chicago to come and cook the hot dogs. It is on record that it occurred and was public knowledge before it was a wikileaks item.<br/>
I think that stopping human trafficking and exploitation of children is a great goal but this is an example of how five minutes of research shows that a claim can be  dismissed. It&#39;s not even a claim. It is really only a wild speculation as nothing specific is ever stated about what the $65,000 was for exactly.<br/>
There are pedophiles with lots of power and there are pedophile rings. But pushing #pizzagate isn&#39;t going to bring them down.<br/>
I think it&#39;s just easier and more exciting to make wild accusations and claims, but then when stories do come up that deserve attention, such as investigations into the Clinton Foundation, a lot of people won&#39;t pay attention because they equate it with stories that have already been debunked.<br/>
The first thing that guy in this video talks about is entering a contest to win an Amazon Firestick. There are a lot of people commercializing this and they find a ready audience of believers who will give them clicks.. Use your own critical thinking. Research things yourself. &quot;Trust No One&quot; if you really want the truth to come out. I think this is all a huge distraction and probably started as a joke. If you are creative and want to make connections between things you can &quot;prove&quot; anything, and it might seem convincing with a mass of &quot;evidence.&quot; But I only looked at the first claim in this video and found it to be incorrect and false information, which even if it were true would only lead to speculation. But, again, it&#39;s not true. This kind of thing is what gives &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; a bad name. Of course there are many conspiracies and it&#39;s great that so many people are interested and have access to so much information. So use your brain and your resources wisely.  </p>

<p>Also in the same email their is the literal quoting of &quot;Waitresses&quot; (I guess video didn&#39;t mention that).</p>

<p>And I&#39;m confused as to why you think one &quot;debunking&quot; makes the whole theory debunked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be very clear.<br/>
The video says &quot;no outside food can be brought into the White House.&quot;  This is used as evidence.<br/>
Then it turns out that a shopping list was given to the White House staff and the food was prepared at the White House.<br/>
This invalidates the point of &quot;no food can be brought into the White House.&quot;<br/>
This is one point which is the first point given in the video before it quickly moves on. In five minutes I found out that the point is irrelevant and used in a misleading way.<br/>
Your point that he was assisting staff doesn&#39;t make any difference. No one said he was making it himself. No one mentioned poison. The entire point is that the video is saying that Obama couldn&#39;t have had food brought into the White House. It turns out he didn&#39;t.   </p>

The video says no outside food can be brought into the White House.<br/>
No outside food was brought into the White House.   </p>

When you have to use as &quot;proof&quot; the fact that they are sticking to the focus of the topic  -<br/>

When you have to do any of these things you are not helping anyone. You&#39;re just swearing your own excrement on the walls and calling it a Picasso.<br/>

<p>Cool, Your still ignoring what I said in my edit. Even when I repeated it in the last reply. Wonder why. Also circumstantial evidence doesn&#39;t work like some complex structure that falls apart from one piece not working. Think of it as a mountain. Not a skyscraper or some shit.

<p>Again I did not do this. Your just lieing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You still haven&#39;t said what you think it means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s quite simply either adult prostitutes (The optimist answer) or child &quot;prostitutes&quot; (The more likely answer considering everything else). Their is no other realistic one at all. It can&#39;t even be drugs like people like to say the other codes are. Oh and since I have a feeling you won&#39;t &quot;realize&quot; this quoting something like he did <em>implies it something else</em>, So literally no matter what it&#39;s something bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not denying there are sexual predators at the top levels of US government. Bill Clinton and Donald Trump both are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your talking about the pussy tape your quite wrong, He said &quot;They let you do it&quot; and he was talking about groupies anyways (If you don&#39;t know what that is it&#39;s women who hang around rich people to try to suck off fame/money from them usually for sexual things like pussy grabbing, Pretty common.</p>

<p>Or if your talking about the Epstein connections, then your also pretty wrong. Bill clinton went <em>many</em> times meanwhile Trump went <em>one</em> time to the island (Epstein&#39;s word though of course).</p>

<p>And since you can&#39;t use basic logic I&#39;l have to explain what it means if he went <em>once</em>. Worst case scenario he fucked children and then regretted it, Or the more likely scenarios Epstein lied/ Trump went there to see if the rumours were really true and got the fuck outta there. Latter is likely cause he even called out Epstein with the &quot;He like&#39;s them on the young side&quot; comment.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the first point in this guys video. He doesn&#39;t mention waitresses. I didn&#39;t mention waitresses. You&#39;re mentioning &quot;that thing about waitresses&quot; but it doesn&#39;t relate to the point and you put no effort into explaining what it&#39;s supposed to mean.<br/>
My point is if you have a &quot;10 point video&quot; and point 1 can be dismissed with five minutes on google, then I have to doubt your ability to research and present your points.<br/>
You coming along and mentioning &quot;waitresses&quot; is completely irrelevant. You&#39;re free to talk about waitresses but you haven&#39;t made any statements about what you&#39;re trying to say.<br/>
That would be a different conversation but it&#39;s you&#39;re free choice to make your point any time you&#39;d like to. </p>

<p>Are these really the top 10 &quot;facts&quot; that make people think this is a thing?</p>

<p>Hastert is a pedophile so anyone who knew him/worked with him is pedo too?</p>

<p>Of the thousands of major donors to the Clinton&#39;s, some of them were also pedos, so that implicates the Clintons?</p>

<p>These are some really flimsy connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Basically your talking about the pedo code. You just don&#39;t say it clearly for some reason. Anyways the pedo code is real unless 4chan literally time traveled. That simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You <em>completely</em> misinterpreted what I was saying. I wasn&#39;t referencing the codes at all. I was more thinking along the lines of the Podesta art:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are no examples of pedophile serial murderers collecting &quot;weird&quot; art like Tony Podesta.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet, according to PG, this is &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence that they are pedophile serial killers.</p></li>
<li><p>However, without any precedent or examples of this ever happening, there is no association between their art and pedophile serial killing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, there&#39;s no reasonable inference that there&#39;s an association between &quot;weird art&quot; and pedophilic murdering. <em>That&#39;s</em> what I mean by it not being &quot;circumstantial&quot;. And just because people <em>say</em> it&#39;s &quot;circumstantial&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so. It&#39;s the reason the vast majority of professional investigators (journalists, cops, etc) can debunk so much of the evidence. It&#39;s not what PG proponents say it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually it&#39;s pretty reasonable to equate hotdogs to dick. Especially if used in a odd way. Which is typical in the emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right in a very general sense. But I&#39;m referencing a specific email:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing here that would associate the writers of the email to the accused and there&#39;s no clear association between what is said and child sex trafficking. In other words: no reasonable person can infer a crime from this evidence. Thus, it&#39;s <strong>not</strong> &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it&#39;s not circumstantial evidence to people who haven&#39;t done research or have been lied too. Or lieing shills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;m either fooled or a shill? This is why I created this account. As the PG arguments are shot down, PG proponents inevitably start personally attacking people who are legitimately trying to look into pizzagate but simply disagree with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve explained my reasoning as thorough as I can and I haven&#39;t called anyone names. Seeing as this is what you&#39;re argument has devolved into, I&#39;m checking out. We can agree to disagree, but I think I&#39;ve made my points as clear as I could.</p>

<p>Yet here we are, with you replying twice even, which is odd behavior for one who &#39;don&#39;t give a shit&#39;. </p>

<p>Why would I explain anything to you? You seem to just want to scream into the wind and call people names. Maybe someone will give you a hug today. Seems many redditors need hugs lately.</p>
