    <div class="md"><p>Ha thanks, I have indeed watched S3.  I liked it much better than S2, less cerebral mind-fucks and more political thriller.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see what happens in S4, I&#39;m glad it got renewed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liked it. The first episodes were very good although somewhere along the line, I don&#39;t know... I am not sure how to put it. Sometimes it didn&#39;t feel right. I very much enjoyed the character Irving played by Bobby. Such a great performance! </p>

<p>Something that didn&#39;t sit right with me was sometimes the quite obvious propaganda. Like the insinuation Russia asked the Dark Army to hack the DNC. There were some other things that stood out but right now I can&#39;t think of them.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is a great show. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Thanks for taking the time to reply and I wish you and your loved ones will enjoy the coming holidays. </p>

<p>Greer is in the business of turning UFO interest into cash. Whether you like it or not. Any money Tom’s company gets comes from the same pool Greer is trying to work.</p>

<p>That’s why he’s claiming false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tom’s been rich his entire life, his parents were wealthy in San Diego, wealthy enough to humor tom’s musical interests, instruments and lessons ain’t cheap. Not knocking him but he went from wealthy to holy shit I’m a rockstar wealthy. I don’t know the guy but am familiar with the region and time period, knew surfers similar to him. Money is literally the farthest thing from a concern, they all have drive and know hard work, but they don’t have that greed drive,  that “I need more money now, got to hustle or I’m back on the street” money hunger. They just have money, if they don’t stuff it in their pocket someone else will. Shit like loans and mortgages are other people’s problems, not theirs. Greer strike me as the opposite, the obsessive buy what I’m selling whatever it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get this theory that people are going to fake an allen encounter so they can take our freedoms and start a fake war with the fake aliens in order to profit. Let&#39;s say for the sake of argument that someone could pull off a alien hoax that convinces the world. Believed cntact from alien life would be a mind blowing experience. I don&#39;t think any of us could even wrap our minds around what we would experience in a situation like that. Why would any of our initial thoughts be that we better go to war with those alien bastards? </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more about rolling out information to the public, fake or real, in order to start public debate and discourse to move the world towards a new paradigm (globalized society).  The nationalist backlash seen over the past couple years with Trump, Brexit, etc., threatens propaganda towards globalization.  An &quot;alien contact&quot; event, would help right the ship.</p>

<p>Use a new (or unknown) type of weapon/bomb to cause mass casualties somewhere in the US.</p>

<p>Have the CIA/FBI determine it is alien technology and came from outer space, like a comet. Prior to this strike, it is assumed they will have leaked many bread crumbs like the NY post story, thus shaping the public conscience to either believe in aliens, or at least consider is possible.</p>

<p>From there, it&#39;s all too easy to consolidate power under one government, &#39;for the sake of humanity&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s all about &quot;fear-mongering,&quot; and &quot;taking freedoms away cuz&#39; dem&#39; damn alieunhz!&quot;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more about rolling out information to the public, fake or real, in order to start public debate and discourse to move the world towards a new paradigm (globalized society).  The nationalist backlash seen over the past couple years with Trump, Brexit, etc., threatens propaganda towards globalization.  An &quot;alien contact&quot; event, would help right the ship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake an alien attack*</p>

<p>Use a new (or unknown) type of weapon/bomb to cause mass casualties somewhere in the US.</p>

<p>Have the CIA/FBI determine it is alien technology and came from outer space, like a comet. Prior to this strike, it is assumed they will have leaked many bread crumbs like the NY post story, thus shaping the public conscience to either believe in aliens, or at least consider is possible.</p>

<p>From there, it&#39;s all too easy to consolidate power under one government, &#39;for the sake of humanity&#39;</p>

<p>This is all still a wild theory at this point, of course </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tom’s been rich his entire life, his parents were wealthy in San Diego, wealthy enough to humor tom’s musical interests, instruments and lessons ain’t cheap. Not knocking him but he went from wealthy to holy shit I’m a rockstar wealthy. I don’t know the guy but am familiar with the region and time period, knew surfers similar to him. Money is literally the farthest thing from a concern, they all have drive and know hard work, but they don’t have that greed drive,  that “I need more money now, got to hustle or I’m back on the street” money hunger. They just have money, if they don’t stuff it in their pocket someone else will. Shit like loans and mortgages are other people’s problems, not theirs. Greer strike me as the opposite, the obsessive buy what I’m selling whatever it is. </p>

<p>They both scare the shit out of me. </p>
