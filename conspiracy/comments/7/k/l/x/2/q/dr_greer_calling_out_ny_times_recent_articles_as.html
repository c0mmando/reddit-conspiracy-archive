       Not a big Greer fan, but I won't lie...he has been talking about a fake alien event of some sort for the past few years with consistency.  Out of everything he's said, this is the only period of time I've ever clicked with the various talks and speeches I watch of his.

       Ha thanks, I have indeed watched S3.  I liked it much better than S2, less cerebral mind-fucks and more political thriller.  It'll be interesting to see what happens in S4, I'm glad it got renewed.

       I liked it. The first episodes were very good although somewhere along the line, I don't know... I am not sure how to put it. Sometimes it didn't feel right. I very much enjoyed the character Irving played by Bobby. Such a great performance!
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that didn't sit right with me was sometimes the quite obvious propaganda. Like the insinuation Russia asked the Dark Army to hack the DNC. There were some other things that stood out but right now I can't think of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it is a great show. Don't get me wrong. Thanks for taking the time to reply and I wish you and your loved ones will enjoy the coming holidays.

       I understand about the DNC stuff, but I at the very least found it relevant to today, which helped keep me immersed in the Mr. Robot mythos and universe.

       Anyone paying attention was seeing this for decades. It was a couple of years after 911 I was driving my mom to the doc when the conversation turned to war. She asked what was my opinion on who was next. I told her it looked like they might claim some sort of space boogeyman or alien invasion. She thought I was nuts.

       I watched unacknowledged last night, and my problem with Greer is that he always puts himself front and center. 'He's the man to do it cause no-one else will' sort of thing.

       One of them just got over 2m from UFO enthusiasts. And that was way before he released the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greer is in the business of turning UFO interest into cash. Whether you like it or not. Any money Tom’s company gets comes from the same pool Greer is trying to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s why he’s claiming false flag.

       lol, that was exactly what I thought when I saw Delonge was pushing this. "Greer ain't gonna be happy they have a new boyfriend now". All the alien money going to Delonge.

       I do believe Tom is more of a useful idiot than a conman, maybe that's why they moved on from Greer.

       Tom’s been rich his entire life, his parents were wealthy in San Diego, wealthy enough to humor tom’s musical interests, instruments and lessons ain’t cheap. Not knocking him but he went from wealthy to holy shit I’m a rockstar wealthy. I don’t know the guy but am familiar with the region and time period, knew surfers similar to him. Money is literally the farthest thing from a concern, they all have drive and know hard work, but they don’t have that greed drive,  that “I need more money now, got to hustle or I’m back on the street” money hunger. They just have money, if they don’t stuff it in their pocket someone else will. Shit like loans and mortgages are other people’s problems, not theirs. Greer strike me as the opposite, the obsessive buy what I’m selling whatever it is.

       I don't get this theory that people are going to fake an allen encounter so they can take our freedoms and start a fake war with the fake aliens in order to profit. Let's say for the sake of argument that someone could pull off a alien hoax that convinces the world. Believed cntact from alien life would be a mind blowing experience. I don't think any of us could even wrap our minds around what we would experience in a situation like that. Why would any of our initial thoughts be that we better go to war with those alien bastards?

       I agree, and I don't think that it's all about "fear-mongering," and "taking freedoms away cuz' dem' damn alieunhz!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's more about rolling out information to the public, fake or real, in order to start public debate and discourse to move the world towards a new paradigm (globalized society).  The nationalist backlash seen over the past couple years with Trump, Brexit, etc., threatens propaganda towards globalization.  An "alien contact" event, would help right the ship.

       I suppose so. I guess in my opinion if there were some alien government or society suddenly every human law and social construct comes into question. I don't assume that all aliens would be cool with that. Most of the 'beings' I have met in the astral plane seem quite nice and cool, just like normal people. If people got access to awesome people with lots of technology and goodwill then things like war and taxes wouldn't make much sense anymore.

       Some people astral travel. Sometimes those people travel to other planets and meet alien beings. I don't really care if you believe me, but its something that a lot of people experience on a regular basis.
