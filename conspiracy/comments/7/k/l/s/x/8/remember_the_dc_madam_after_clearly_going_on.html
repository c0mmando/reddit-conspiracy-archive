      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In combination with Palfrey's statement that she had 10,000 to 15,000 phone numbers of clients, this caused several clients' lawyers to contact Palfrey to see whether accommodations could be made to keep their identities private.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, ABC News, after going through what was described as "46 lb" [21 kg] of phone records, decided that none of the potential clients was sufficiently "newsworthy" to bother mentioning.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Possible translation: ABC found some of their top execs on her list and decided it wasn't "newsworthy."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sibley, Palfrey's former attorney, claims to have her phone records and that they are relevant to the 2016 presidential election.
       </p>
       <p>
        In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the request to lift a lower court order, in place since 2007, that bars Sibley from releasing any information about her records.

       Why down-voted? This is supposed to be a place for conspiracy, don't we have room for the good ol' 'faked-their-death-to-spend-their-spoils-in-peace' gag? For my part, one grainy video wasn't enough to convince me that a devious head of state, known to have many body doubles, had actually met his final accounting.

       We already knew Trump had connections to underage prostitution rings in the past from his good friend Tevfik Arif.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        how is this historical gem being used today? As a high-end bordello, staffed with beautiful models who also serve as prostitutes, working at the beck and call of Tevfik Arif. A wealthy Russian-American businessman, he is a real-estate developer who has partnered with Donald Trump on several projects including the Trump Soho and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Fort Lauderdale. Arif was rounded up along with about ten others this week in a raid on the yacht.

       That's not evidence. Your links are just articles containing accusations that try to say trump is guilty because someone he round-about associated with committed a crime. That's not evidence. Evidence, if it actually existed, would have gotten him impeached by now.

       And I shat out a unicorn this morning.... Anyway, yes Trump is straight.... The most concrete evidence that exists on the subject of Trump possibly being a sexual predator is of him saying "grab em by the pussy," which is a terrible thing to say, but most straight males have said MUCH worse, including myself. He just got caught on tape. Please back up your Melanie came from the mob accusation with info.

       Lol are you fucking serious? Say what you want about this specific case but acting like everything against trump is propoganda is the silliest bullshit imaginable. The guy is on fucking tape bragging about waltzing into dressing rooms of underage girls and them not being able to protest, bragged on tape about forcing himself on and groping women, and that's just the one related topic. The dude is a shitshow, it's not some big conspiracy of him being treated unfairly.

       You do know trump went to epsteins island right? They were  close friends. And the person who gave ep 2 years for child trafficking is now the trump appointed secretary of labor...
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump didn't drain the swamp like he promised and laughed at all his supporters who actually believed that, on camera, did you just ignore it?

       And no one said anything about his policies, just that he's on tape bragging about seeing underage girls getting dressed. But these facts destroy your whole identity that propaganda has built so good luck with the cognitive dissonance, I bet it hurts.

       If you could indulge me in a hypothetical question, I would be forever grateful: If everything Trump said was revealed to be true, with indisputable evidence, would you accept it? If it was revealed, with proof, that JFK was right about secret societies and the CIA, and they were after Trump, who would you support? Trump or the people who killed JFK?

       So are you actually saying that he didn't say what he is on tape saying? Or are you saying it wasn't him? Take your pick because the tape is the fucking tape. Maybe you're saying they're forgeries invented by George Soros!? He went back in his zionist time machine! Speaking of, would you call yourself a zionist? Trump sure is. So explain it to me. This is a little pathetic.

       Meaning, they consented. So what's the problem there? If I want to touch a bag, and the women let's me touch her vag, it's A-ok. Otherwise vages would never get touched and humanity would disappear.

       So you're saying it's ok to shove your tongue down some random stranger on the street's mouth in the hopes that they're in to it? And uh bud. Actually. If you listen to the tape he says right in it that he tried and failed. If you think trump is batting 1000 with his straight to the pussy technique (which is sexual assault on its own), Ive got a great deal on a bridge you may be interested in

       Lol. Nah man. Dude was defending Trump's claims of shoving his tongue down someone's throat/grabbing a woman in a sexual way who he just met because of his comment of "they let you", I simply took what he said to it's logical conclusion, that the statement implies it's not assault as long as they want it, and therefore every woman trump ever did that to would have to want it for him not to have committed sexual assault. Besides, I simply asked if that's what he was contending. He didn't reply, because what he said was disgusting on the surface and there's no defending that statement. Read up your fallacies bud. There's nothing fallacious about asking someone about the clear as day implications of their statement

       The statement doesn't imply that it's not assault if the woman wanted it- it's actually isn't assault if the woman wanted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't reply because I said something disgusting? Um no, here I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the details of the married woman he hit on, I don't know, I can't speak on that, I just know she was married and he hit on her anyway, which I said was sleazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way you slice it, sexual contact that's wanted, because he's rich it a celebrity or whatever, isnt assault. He clearly picked up on enough signals to think it was welcome, and his results seem to confirm, as he was never arrested for sexual assault. Your argument hinges on a woman eventually not wanting it. I havent heard from this hypothetical woman yet. I'll take Trump's word over yours.

       Have you ever kissed a girl without asking first? Do you characterise that as assualt? Take that back. Have you ever kissed a girl?

       you are just digging yourself deeper and deeper. you are attempting to conflate just having met someone in a professional setting, cornering them, grabbing them, and shoving your tongue down their throat, with the idea of having to literally ask the words "can i kiss you?" to someone who you are on a date with or some shit. that is the most disingenuous attempt at bullshit i have ever read. absolutely pathetic and par for the course of this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah, keep going on about how you "can't speak to" something he literally said in that video. the answer is yes. walking up to someone you had just met, in a professional setting, cornering, and shoving your tongue down someone's throat... is sexual assault. not "hitting on someone". their fucking marital status doesn't matter the slightest bit. it was not wanted, and the sexual contact still happened. i'm sorry you find that hard to understand, but it speaks to the character you've displayed in your posts here.

       So, was it wanted or not? If so, wasn't assault. You keep laying on unessesary details and settings and "cornering" and all this extra bullshit to make your argument fly.

      <p>
       Was it wanted or not? If so, wasn't assault. Jesus.

       Yeah you've conceded the argument when instead of making your point, you waste your own time  trolling someone's post history or even worse, subreddits, to find something to hang on them. It proves you got nothing in the argument at hand.

       can you read? I said multiple times through this conversation it was NOT WANTED. my argument has been pretty clear the whole time. one little quip as an edit isnt the end of the world dont let it get to ya ;) i only mentioned because i joked about TRP earlier... besides there are prevalent mindsets in TRP that are just a

       Why don't you tell me how saying hoes throw themselves at famous billionaires has to do with policy? ORANGE! It's the same irrelevant shit that is meant to distract from reality. Tell me how that tape has fucked American policy? (You wont) Policy doesn't matter to you. You're more concerned with what shoes the first lady is wearing. Grow up and look at the big picture, you Colbert drone. FFS.

       Hoes? Are you fucking kidding me? The incident we are talking about, they we're working together, he tried to shove his tongue down her throat and pin her against a wall not letting her pass, and then tried to have her fired because she "rejected" him. You are exactly the problem dude, fucking comments like that. "What do hoes throwing themselves at billionaires have to do with anything"? Fucking disgusting.

       I love just how partisan about this you are. You believe everything some liberal rag prints about Trump, but deny everything some conservative rag prints about Clinton. I would be fine if you simply believed everything you read, or didn't, but you cherry pick. That's the problem with people like yourself, you treat politics like rooting for a sports team. It's no better on the right, but for the party that espouses itself as logical and intelligent, the left sets itself up to fall so much further.

       We heard her interview that day, she was absolutely serious about the whole thing. Then the way they found her, it emediantly reminded me of that scene from the movie
       <em>
        shooter
       </em>
       , where the TPTB set the scene of the murder up as though it was a suicide.

       I think the problem is that once you're "approached" and let into the "club", it's near impossible to reject the offer and come back and tell everyone about it. You'd rather say "fuck it, I made it".

       It’s probably pretty exciting when you get to the level where you start really exposing the truth and pissing off powerful people but then you realize that these motherfuckers don’t play.

       I think this is one of his strongest interviews and her murder probably scared the shit out of him.

       That was also around the time that they murdered Bill Cooper. He was the much better version of the Alex Jones Show and the cops hid on his property and shot him dead in his front yard.

       I thought that one particularly massive dump from a little while back, before Trump 'won', was the official warning that WikiLeaks had become compromised? This was following warnings of/from multiple whistleblowers who became apprehended, killed, or went missing... and last I read, the site continues to run under U.S. Federal control, despite denial on their twitter page [at the time]. When I read that, I became convinced they're masquerading the change.

       I remember her and I remember how outraged I was when I read about her murder and the news saying it was a suicide. I felt so powerless and I desired intensely to have been there to stop the bad guys. She should have gone into a witness protection program. It is incredible that her case just died out without the authorities or the press investigating her death more deeply. She surely knew a lot.

       Failing to see a difference here. The govt obviously can't kill anyone on it's own - the govt is just an idea, a legal fiction. I was saying a govt actor killed her.

       Streisand effect: the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. Named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress obscure photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. In pursuing legal action in court to get a cease and desist order led to the photos of Barbra Streisand's home being broadcast on national TV. Instead of a few hundred people knowing about it millions now know what her house looks like.

       I don't think the DC Madam actually knew all that much but killing her certainly woke a lot of people up at a time when 9/11 truth wasn't really mainstream yet. Killing the DC Madam caused a Streisand effect for the truther conspiracy movement. That was more than 10 years ago now.

       These sex/pedo abuse stories are turning up absolutely everywhere. The only explanation I can think of is that it's a very effective way of blackmailing people in key positions to do what you want. It has to be systematic too because of the amount of people who "enable" the system to work - judges (not prosecuting), police (cover-ups), politicians (re-directing), media (deflecting), and so on.

       That guy is a complete clown. He announced during the primary season in 2016 that he had bombshell information (Palfrey's client lists) that would radically shake up the election, and promised that if the courts didn't allow the unsealing of the records by a certain date, he would go ahead and release them anyway and take whatever repercussions came from it. Supposedly he also had a "kill switch" that would see the records released if anything happened to him. The promised date came and went, and he extended the deadline a bunch of times until well after the primaries were over. Then one day he announced on his blog that he was starting a new social network to replace Twitter, and he never mentioned the records again.

       Something set up somewhere safe monitoring an innocuous twitter account.    You only access it from a burner phone and tweet goofy posts about cats.    If it goes silent for X number of days have your dead man servers start unleashing all your dirt.
