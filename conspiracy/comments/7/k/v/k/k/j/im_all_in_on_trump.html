       I'm kind of a cynical person. Like, this whole thing's out of our control to an extent. We can make a difference but the world's too big to make an educated guess on what's coming next. You guys know that more anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would have told me in 2014 that Donald Trump would be the next president I would have died laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet here I am, watching him change the world single handedly every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either this is a true revolution, a clandestine, shadow counter coup that we all contributed to. Or it is the
       <em>
        single largest psyop ever conducted
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, it's an opportunity for us as committed individuals to get more involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's do it!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone criticizes you for valuing what Trump has done, use it as an opportunity to educate them on
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       we support this ancient Frog god reincarnated.
      </p>
      <p>
       He represents the fall of the control system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean seriously, it's hilarious. Either the control system has made the biggest error in its history, or this orange faced bafoon has become our greatest hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all in!!!!

       You call the slowest recession recovery in the history of our country a "boom"? You're full of shit. Look at any graph measuring anything about the economy and there is a clear discontinuity in November 2016.

       These are facts and I value that. If you look a bit back the discussion was about Trump being the cause for the good economy and low unemployment. My argument was actually that this started BEFORE Trump, exactly as your graph shows. You can argue about the word "boom" but I used the words of the guy I was responding too and this wasn't the issue at all. Still: the company I work for cranks out more products than ever and has great trouble finding employees. So are most companies in this area.

       Wat. You know what Nov. 8th was, right? How can you claim that two years of absolute stagnation suddenly ending and rocketing up is not because of the election? The economy was in a downward turn up until the election night. This boom was 100% caused by the election of Trump, and has continued throughout his presidency. Claiming otherwise is willful ignorance.

       I already did that, that was the entire point of the first picture. For your viewing pleasure I also added a rough line of best fit for the last two years of stagnation
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mHLiX">

       . The black line shows the stagnation, the red line shows Nov 8th AKA The election of Trump.

       The economy numbers look like a rich cash grab before the next recession and it has for a while now when even Obama was getting the record highs everyday. So now that the stock market is doing bigly because of the election and corps going to 20% from 35% taxes, do you think we'll see a significant rise in income for all? Or will the corps just keep wages where they are at 8 bucks an hour for minimum and just pocket the cash?
      </p>
      <p>
       If something like 2007 happens again it could go all the way back down to it's lowest point or even lower. That's going to affect us and not the billionaire president or the other CEOs. Obama said multiple times their strategy was slow and steady to get it moving in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So bragging about flying close to the sun may work out, Icarus. I'm just preparing for the next recession because it could be worse when we got 15% less taxes from the megacorporations to help people with. That's schools, firefighters, police, money for roads all getting cut because they do not get enough money to pay people a salary.

       If you graduate high school, get a job (any job) and don't have a kid out of wedlock, you will most likely end up in the middle class (U.S). This puts you in the top 1% of the world. Doesn't seem like too big of an issue to me.

       I don't see a bunch of gender studies majors leading a successful revolution when ~80% of privately owned guns are owned by right-wingers and ~75% of the military is red. Good luck lol.

       Eventually when the income inequality gets so large the poor will rise up and kill the rich. Happens a lot in history. They call it communist uprisings nowadays I guess.

       The stock market is one aspect of the economy. And one that mostly benefits people who have financial ability to invest. There is no guarantee that a good stock market will result in more jobs or better wages. And for the average schmoe, wages and jobs are far more important that XYZ corporations financial disclosure.

      <p>
       Those are correct statements. But it's still only relatively modest decline in unemployment. In Sept 2016, unemployment was around 8% for Black Americans. It dropped to 7.7% by August and had huge drop in September 2017 to 7.0%. A 17 year low, yes. But only a 1% decrease.  And if we take into account jobs lost due to the hurricanes (august - sept 2017), the decrease is on .4%,
      </p>
      <p>
       Hispanic workers fared a little better. Dropping from 6.4% in sept. 2016 to 5.1% in sept. 2017. This is still a relatively modest 1.3%.

       The numbers at the above link were derived directly from the Bureau Of Labor Statistics monthly jobs reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terms like all-time low and 17 year low are technically correct. But they also give the impression that there were truly significant decreases in unemployment for those groups. Which the numbers do not bear out.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, overall unemployment hasn't changed much. 4.6% in November 2016 vs. 4.1% in November 2017.

      <p>
       This is laughably incorrect. There was a time when someone with a high school diploma could aspire to being middle class. One income was enough to buy a house, have a car and support a family. Those days are long gone. Someone coming out of high school without at least a trade isn't going to make the kind of money someone needs to be what could be called middle class. And forget about buying a house or supporting a family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being in the top 1% in the world is a bizarre and irrelevant statistic. It is cold comfort to know you have it better than say a poor person in Somalia when you don't have enough to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one last point.  Whether someone has a kid in our out of marriage doesn't matter in terms of finances. Having children does, of course. But married or no doesn't.

       Neither of those pieces address the issues with education and low income kids. There is an underlying assumption that all kids are equal and that they will all have the same opportunities. In short those pieces don't show the whole picture.

       Lol ok. All of those points were included in my original point, but apparently showing that discounting one of the three steps doesn't change much is "moving the goalposts."

       It was stagnant for two years. Barely getting it back to where it was doesn't count as raising. Obama was the first president in history to fail to reach 3% growth.

       So slow growth somehow equals fast growth?  Sorry - spending close to a trillion dollars on a stimulus that did nothing but line the pockets of his special interests didn't ignite the economy.  It was slow growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Trump, the strangling regulations are being lifted and we're getting a tax policy for business that makes us competitive.  That's how you grow an economy and that's why the stock market is up 5000 points this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not Obama policies creating that growth - that's the repeal of Obama's policies that is creating that growth.

       Presidents don't have all that much influence on economies: it's a complex machinery. Obama didn't cause growth, neither did Trump. Trump is a cold businessman who is out there for himself: not for you. Most politicians are though, so nothing new.

       Why do you care so much about imaginary lines on land? I don't mean that in jest. I genuinely want to understand. Cause I'd like to care. I see people waving flags and shit and talking about the good ole days and I really can't wrap my head around it. I don't see anything in America's past worth preserving. I mean objectively speaking, we haven't done a whole lot in the last 250+ years worth being proud of.

       I don't think they have our best interest at heart at all. Which makes them no different from our current form of government. What I'm trying to ascertain is why you are are more keen on being nationalistic as opposed to all inclusive, if both forms of government won't have our best interest in mind. I don't get it. I'd much rather be able to travel freely around the globe and not be looked at like I'm a fucking sociopathic wackjob just because I'm American. Im not saying it should happen over night. I kinda like the idea of a North American Union as a baby step.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I, in no way, think my nation's past is worth preserving or fighting for. Im not particularly fond of genocide, racism, slavery, military occupation, war profiteering, police brutality and a corrupt government that serves corporate interests and the expense of my kids future. But that's just me.

       I identify as European to indicate why I don't watch US news stations. I am pretty sure that you don't watch European news stations? What is scary about that? 
About national identity: I do love my country and I don't think I will ever move far from it. But I am not a "right or wrong, my country" kind of person. My parents lived through WWII and like many Europeans I get a bit nervous about excessive flag waving as it reminds them of the dangers of nationalism. I also traveled a lot and people all over the world have much more in common than they differ. 
About sovereignty: I see Europe as a way for small countries to survive among large forces like the US, Russia and China and actually still keep a fair amount of sovereignty.

       I don't think Muslims are "invading"? I actually work with several Muslims, non Muslim refugees and migrants, no problems at all. We have people from Ukraine, Russia itself, Turkey, Morocco, Italy, Slovakia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, you name it. Both Muslims and refugees/migrants from other countries work hard, respect each other and cause no problems. 
The only one that is actually causing grave problems is a national. The largest danger is Western converts to Islam as they do often tend to radicalism.
Still I do think that a thorough screening is in place and that there should be a limited number per year. 
Compare it to the Jewish issue just before and during WWII. Is it the right thing to do just to let people rot out of fear that there might be a few assholes among them? Isn't the US build on refugees and migrants?

       Ha.  Being downvoted by the people who still think this system can be fixed.  The USA is fucked.  It's a crazed military empire in its final stage before collapse, whether people want to admit that or not.  When people are no longer held accountable, and our congress doesn't work for the people, it's over.  It's been over for a while.

       Proof that those who support the president at this moment and enjoying dragging us through their miserable life. While you continue to live in self loath do you ever think that most of us don't enjoy this lingering cloud over our head? Probably not because I know your type, sad and wants to stay sad but gets a little rise when the president raises his voice and tweets something rude to a world leader or state senator which you have never cared to learn about because that's how much of a joke our democracy is to you. Sometimes I just don't know how we can recover from how badly this administration has tarnished our world status and military. It's sad to see how manipulated people have become and how he can make up any lie and people believe him over literal experts who worked hard to have knowledge will he inherited his life, it's not that easy for everyone else

       Yeah friend we went from being pussies to being putins bitch. All planned though so don't worry, trump has always had that secret weapon to help him win, americas most feared state enemy of the past century, full support from Putin, maybe a little KGB flattery and boom trump begins his life working toward being the president of the United States so that he and his family stay wealthy for ever after a repeal of the estate tax and Putin forever weakens americas place in the world, something we are never able to climb out of because of the idiotic anti America position trump takes on many things to do with our country.

       I also find them pathetic as I also see what you say implying the trump is a "real man" because of his view of women, trump can throw the ugly most childish hissey fit but you will see him a more a man than the always composed and always appropriate Barack Obama who served with pride a dignity, stated faithful to his wife and children and was able to keep the respect of most people he worked with by far a Long cry from the current administration, trump is honestly embarrassing, have we no shame?

       The idiocracy has been coming since the early 70s.. Trump is just another step in a direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know if its a step in the right direction, or the wrong one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what i do know is that even Trump cannot stop the train and where its eventually heading. He might be able to mitigate the damage but we'll need to see more than a year's work to make that judgement.

       The sick part is he has everyone believe the criticism are "lies" despite the fact that it's not, trust me that man writes his own tragedy and his words should be damning enough when repeated, but it's the denial of truth is most telling of his control over his supporters

       Your "that suggests he is a good man" line in response to the Trump "best president" line puts an implication forward that in order to be considered the "best" president; you must be a good man. Granted: I also had to make an assumption to reach that conclusion.

       Downfall of most men is that they try to be great men and end up being remembered for what they really were, usually not good. The men who want to be remembered as great often attemp to write that narrative themselves and end up being remembered for nothing they want to be remembered for in history. Trump speaks too highly of himself and his actions to ever be a great man, to do that one would need to be humble at times and when faced with fear demonstrate both great strength and restraint. All trump can do is talk about what he has "accomplished" in his first 11 months in office (something no one else is really able to answer) and when faced with a difficult situation he restores to childish behavior such as his approach with the North Korean leader Kim

       i'm the same way.  i was totally against him before the election (and hillary) but over the course of the last year i've seen him do some great things (while being vilified by the media at the same time...which makes me like him even more).  And now seeing the likes of the Rothschilds take to social media to berate him makes me think he's the real deal.

       I agree.  Why is he hated by msm, the deep state, the Hillary machine?  Why is there a concerted effort to destroy him?  No man can garner this many enemies and so much hatred by such shady people if he wasn't a threat to them.  His greatest detractors are those whose motives have always been questionable.

       The beauty of this system is that TPTB don't even need three-letter agencies, gulags, martial law, htreats of generic bad things to happen and all the other trappings of a classical dictatorships.

       I didn't say he is a moron. Not even ol' Dubya was one. As I said, in my view all this hate is engineered; they don't really hate him, they're playing a part and he's playing his. These are the rules of the game. Think about it, man, they're all on the same friggin' side! They're giving us the illusion of choice and as i said earlier, partisal politics are a convenient distraction at best and a powerful weapon of class warfare at worst.

       This is essentially a battle between the owners of MSM outlets and Trump. They're using their minions, Trump uses Twitter. Trump is the greatest manipulator of media the world has ever seen. He has vision, high optics. Sees past the sale. He's an expert salesman. I work in sales, and nearly everything he does his high level, high volume sales. I see it a mile away, and this isn't some snake oil salesman shit, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are playing their part and want to control and infect the populace. Trump is calling their bluff. Even if he says lies or half-truths, Trump always has a way out(part of a sales technique) he'll make it a win because the media is so distrusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has a type-A personality. I think we can agree Trump is an alpha-male, too. He also has strong leadership skills. He has been in a power position his entire life where he's the boss, he calls the shots. Trump built himself a huge empire worth billions, and given a 0% chance to win. Why would a person who could spend the rest of their days living the lavish life they always had to have your name ran through the mud, risk everything you've built, risk your life, your families lives just for a job that is very high stress and low paying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a dog they cannot put a leash on. That's the problem.

       Come on people stop only getting your information from Reddit and expand your mind. I watch CNN and Fox News and the NYT and huff post and also Reddit. The problem we have in this day and with the current culture, is that everyone is willing be an expert on any given subject, but no one wants to actually know anything. Your egos are over inflated and you have boxed yourself into a corner where you can never not support trump because if you did you'd have to be wrong, I'm tired of having to shake people out of themselves for them to realize that HELLO the world is not in a good place and no matter how hard you tell your self it is, it will never be so and the cycle will never break.

       Be the change you wish to see in the world. You can truly create the world you want. If you dream it, you can achieve it if you put your mind to it. It might sound cliche but it's true.

       More open minded about what? Depends on the subject, no? Somethings you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       and other things you don't know jack shit. If you take a stance on something, and are presented with new information that contradicts/disproves your stance, and you don't change, you may have an ego problem. Personally I like to be proven wrong. It helps us grow as individuals. A whole lot of people on this site have an ego problem though.

       One clear example recently was his decision to appoint the acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau despite the fact that was not his decision to make according to the law, judge ruled in favor of trump and thus changes that power of the president forever.

       That's not true.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows the President to appoint an acting director of any executive branch agency in the event of a resignation of a director.  Which is what Trump did, and which is why the judge ruled in his favor.

       I want you to understand that you and everyone like you are a lot like little kids sitting in a playground looking at clouds. One of you sees a cloud that kind of looks like an ice cream cone, and then you all hear the ice cream truck music, and assume that the cloud brought the ice cream truck.

       Just read this and wanted to point out that America is not 100% capitalist and that no country has ever demonstrated a 100% rally behind a single economic system (funny you call is control system as we are governed by our democratic ideals and what's left of our moral fiber but I'm not sure that's there anymore as demonstrated by the many immoral acts of anyone at this point. But to my original point we are also not true democratic, we elect representative which makes us a republic

       I called it a control system because that’s what the person I responded to referred to it as.

       It's cute how you put two words together and expect it to mean something and rationalize what ever you think capitalism is my friend. We don't operate in a "global capitalism" we operate on a variety of global channels and with some we trade, some we have established authoritarian regimes that operate under a leader appointed by the US, Saudi Arabia and Iraq when Saddam was still in power, other places we create something of an empirical control over such as Germany or Japan or South Korea, propped up democracies with constitutions writing my America diplomats with terms of the servitude to use while we maintain military control

       The Pendulum swings. Obama was too left, it upset people. The spectre of Hillary was unbearable. The others on the right were too bland to compete. They fell, one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pendulum started moving. The inertia was great. To the shock of the left, it started moving right. The Pendulum could not be stopped. It went all in. Full right. Like an orange falcon. Phoenix. Something really cool and metaphoric.
      </p>

       Now what? Is it still going right, or a quick swing back? We wait, we watch.

       "Successful Obama administration."   Slow growth despite record spending.  A health care system that didn't work.  Rise of terrorist networks like ISIS and Boko haram.   $400B to Iran.  Europe flooded with islamic refugees.

       I fail to see the big wins here.

       Much more complicated than that ... 32 million people racist? I still miss Obama's soothing voice, though. Trump should've had some voice coaching. But then , he was never destined to soothe.

       Seeing the establishment shove the Clinton/Bush dynasties down our throats in the beginning seemed predictable. Then Mr. Orange man (with the help of a lot of free advertising) takes down both dynasties. He would have lost to the Bern man, but I digress (err, I mean "voting is a sham!") If Trump is a reverse psychology of the hidden hand then I would be surprised, as that hasn't seemed to be their M.O. If Putin conspired with him to take down the two dynasties, why would the most openly pro Israel candidate be chosen,amplifying the U.S., Israeli relationship that stands in opposition to much of the world? to foment WW3?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump and Putin colluded, will they now somehow broker world peace to make themselves the saviors of humanity? Maybe they have their own Blue beam to unfurl.

       Felt the same about Trump, I actually saw him a joke and honestly thought HC would win the election, she seemed the better of a bad bunch tbh.

       But.......
Since Trump has taken office my opinion has totally changed. He is a real patriot and I do believe he wants the best for the American people. He is no angel, but at least he doesn't try and hide behind a media persona, he is who is, like it or not.

       "He is who he is, like it or not" is not a qualification to lead. And he's super gimmicky. Didn't you see the ribbon cutting he did in front of just... reams of paper? That's his media persona and he's sticking to it even if it doesn't make a lot of sense.

       Trump's policies: name one actual policy he's promoted (and not just mentioned on the campaign trail) that a typical neocon wouldn't support. I'll then point you to a collection of elected Republicans (i.e., Congress) who all support it. He's a neocon. This is not even a remotely controversial opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's supporters: they either like that he's a neocon, or they don't understand that he's a neocon (aka they're idiots).
      </p>
      <p>
       You: "He represents the fall of the control system." LOL! Let's start with an obvious premise: the greatest source of power in this world is money. Agree? (Or do you say military? Find me a legit powerful military without money.) Trump is hellbent on furthering the consolidation of that money (that power) in the hands of the same small group that already holds that money (power). Without question, his administration is doing everything they can to promote the interests of capital (i.e., the individuals and corporations that hold that vast majority of all wealth). Yet, DELUSIONAL IDIOTS think that he's somehow a revolutionary counter to existing power. Why? Because he's anti federal regulation? What a massive departure from other Republicans in power! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude, face it, he's not a revolutionary. You support a Republican toolbag. (IDGAF about your unrelated opinion about Democrats, who are also toolbags for the most part.)

       Certianly not. Is your demesia too severe for you to forget how his criticisms were not nearly as intense?

       For a second I thought "demesia" was some sort of r/T_D way of referring to democrats' feigned amnesia, but then realized you just can't spell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no. Criticism of Bush's policy was every bit as intense. Criticisms of Bush as a person were much more relaxed, for obvious reasons (he was capable of base-level politeness in public).

       We'll see, you're probably right but you can't just kill the president. They were plotting against JFK for two years.

       I don't think Muslims are "invading"? I actually work with several Muslims, non Muslim refugees and migrants, no problems at all. We have people from Ukraine, Russia itself, Turkey, Morocco, Italy, Slovakia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, you name it. Both Muslims and refugees/migrants from other countries work hard, respect each other and cause no problems. 
The only one that is actually causing grave problems is a national. The largest danger is Western converts to Islam as they do often tend to radicalism.
Still I do think that a thorough screening is in place and that there should be a limited number per year. 
Compare it to the Jewish issue just before and during WWII. Is it the right thing to do just to let people rot out of fear that there might be a few assholes among them? Isn't the US build on refugees and migrants?

       This is essentially a battle between the owners of MSM outlets and Trump. They're using their minions, Trump uses Twitter. Trump is the greatest manipulator of media the world has ever seen. He has vision, high optics. Sees past the sale. He's an expert salesman. I work in sales, and nearly everything he does his high level, high volume sales. I see it a mile away, and this isn't some snake oil salesman shit, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are playing their part and want to control and infect the populace. Trump is calling their bluff. Even if he says lies or half-truths, Trump always has a way out(part of a sales technique) he'll make it a win because the media is so distrusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has a type-A personality. I think we can agree Trump is an alpha-male, too. He also has strong leadership skills. He has been in a power position his entire life where he's the boss, he calls the shots. Trump built himself a huge empire worth billions, and given a 0% chance to win. Why would a person who could spend the rest of their days living the lavish life they always had to have your name ran through the mud, risk everything you've built, risk your life, your families lives just for a job that is very high stress and low paying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a dog they cannot put a leash on. That's the problem.
