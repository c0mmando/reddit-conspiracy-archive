<p>I provided all the information that they refuse to look at and they insist on spreading misinformation, lies, and hate. </p>

<p>Anyone who posts to topminds should automatically be banned from participating in r/conspiracy. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7kuyu0/top_mind_has_a_meltdown_threatens_to_withhold/drhdhrf/?st=jbdzo5qy&amp;amp;sh=11eec254">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7kuyu0/top_mind_has_a_meltdown_threatens_to_withhold/drhdhrf/?st=jbdzo5qy&amp;amp;sh=11eec254</a></p>

<p>I have submitted threads to try to get this information out to the masses so they can make their own judgements and enhance their understanding of what information is being fed to them.</p>

<p>Please, no more of this, JamesCole, we talked about this the other day, although I left it at: &quot;If there is such an insignificant amount of topmind users directly harassing r/conspiracy users, then don&#39;t worry about it&quot;, I take this back. They are here to harass people. They have no control over anything they do, say, or share, they just provide everything in a harassing and biased manner that forces a distorted projection of the user. </p>

<p>Remove all posters of TopMinds please, if they are posting threads on topminds, they are not contributing to open discussion, they are directly working towards direct user harassment and hate. </p>

<p>How is this allowed? </p>

<p>I provided links to my threads and peer reviewed studies directly talking openly and constructively about this.</p>

<p>This sub is literally breaking rule 9 of r/conspiracy, and is attack me individually as a user, I request that it is removed as it promotes hate, bias, and misinformation.
&quot;</p>

<p>I sent this directly to the admins of reddit. I am curious of whats going to happen about this, reddit cannot become a social media platform if it allows pure hate/bias to attack users. I do realize its the holidays and it will take some time to get a response, but this is no longer acceptable. The admins should be seeing TopMinds as a direct threat to the growth of Reddit, and in the end will just chase users/money away to voat and other platforms that offer a much more constructive atmosphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I should have had that in the body of the post but I remembered that I had a discussion with a moderator about this fairly recently.</p>

<p>Its weird as well, I am mostly on League, DBZ subreddits, I just come here to shoot the shit and toss theories and when their is proof/evidence of something, I like to dig it up and present it logically.</p>

<p>I am honestly sick of their shit. If they have a problem with information/proof being provided then they should voice their concerns/or provide their side so we can ameliorate the things they are concerned/questioning about, etc. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if they create a r/conspiracy related account, just like other subreddits that ban you immediately for posting on other subs, conspiracy should autoban anyone who makes a thread on topminds. </p>

<p>They can come back and sound stupid all they want, but the second they start spreading hate to other subs, bam, banned from this sub, create a new account and wait a week. </p>

<p>TMOR has always banned our own users for brigading, it&#39;s against our rules and we do <em>not</em> sit there in secret discords planning to come in to your posts or whatever.  That&#39;s in your head.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t charge in disrupting threads - we have no need to - that isn&#39;t the point of TMOR.  The point is to watch you guys do it to yourselves.  Like you are doing right this second.  Like, we&#39;re watching through a window at you, and this is me tapping on the glass right now.</p>

<p>So just... chill.  We&#39;re not out to get you, you do this to yourself.  Threads like this are the reason for TMOR.  You&#39;re self-reinforcing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be <code>r/conspiratard</code>, users would complain about them, then the responding comments would be a variation of users in agreement and others saying &#39;just ignore them&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the implication of &#39;muddied waters&#39;. I think people find it hard to participate when they know there are others whose (seemingly) only goal is to disrupt natural discourse of the subject matter for this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that grievances users here have with them shouldn&#39;t be discounted, even if TMoR activity isn&#39;t such a threat as you suggest.</p>

<p>IIRC, there is a rule that states users can be banned for posting somewhere such as TMoR, depending on context. My only point here is that they have and will continue to be a problem for <em>some of</em> the users here. So considering how you feel I guess it&#39;s a matter of perspective.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m conflicted because of my principles in the belief of freedom of speech as well as my history with those subreddits.</p>

<p>Pallets of their own money that we&#39;d been holding onto, that we traded to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of a hostile nation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>creating a failed state in Lybia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NATO-led intervention, spearheaded by France and the UK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>arming ISIS through Yemen,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like Trump is doing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>destroying congressionally subpoenad evidence, taking hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes from foreign countries</p>

<p>A perfect example of this is TMOR.</p>

<p>Step 1) Don&#39;t be afraid to speak out.</p>

<p>If you never make it past step 1, you are exactly where they want you.  Looking away, doing what they say.  </p>

<p>I agree. Submission guidelines in the sidebar of <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> does not approve posts or comments from submitters with a history of posting in subs modded by the mods of Top Minds of Reddit. They mod a lot of subs. We ban those submitters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of people think blanket banning people who post in T_D is stupid. In fact I think it may be the prevailing opinion on reddit as a whole. Either way &quot;They are doing it too!&quot; isn&#39;t a very good reason to do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re also bullies. Went in there to point out the hipocracy of invoking the Dunning-Kruger effect in a sub such as theirs, had a civil discussion(from my POV at least) and the guy ended it with saying participation were encouraged. </p>

<p>Bout an hour later I got banned and then had 6 or so mods message me with sarcastic remakes about my big penis(which I never mentioned) and the like, after I asked how what I did was &quot;brigading&quot;, when I was just browsing the sub and clicked a link regarding r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just bullies with no ability of introspection what so ever.</p>
