       I believe the explanation provided was that Comet Pizza didn't have a basement because the basement belongs to the adjoining Pegasus Museum, also owned by Alefantis. Semantics

       The museum isn't adjoining the restaurant at all. It's in another part of the city. There is a basement in his other restaurant on the same street though. The whole point though is that PG was never about a basement, the media tried to say it was all about some crazy theory about keeping kids in a basement and that there wasn't even a basement there, as a way to try and make the investigation by concerned citizens and independent journalists and researchers sound like some crazy nutso conspiracy theory propagated by loony alt right Trump supporters. Anyone who actually looked at the investigation and followed what people were finding and talking about realised pretty quickly that the supposed 'debunking' was a total cover up and didn't actually address any of the legitimate concerns and information brought up by the people who were looking into it.

       This right here is why I still believe in PG. To anyone who connected the dots, the whole shooting setup followed by the intensive debunking process in the media just meant confirmation.

       Ffs Alefantis used to date David Brock, the CEO of Media Matters. Wouldn't he know how to stage an event and sell a fabricated news story? The shills are here to make you feel stupid and to doubt your intuition, PG has not been debunked.

       Bartender also says everyone started to panic and run towards the back. Why did the people panic? This isn’t the bartender claiming there was no gun, this is a reporter asking a follow up of ‘Did you see the gun?’ and the bartender saying no I didn’t see it, but I saw people’s reaction to it.

       Media has never, to my knowledge, rushed so quickly to call something debunked - let alone without any investigation.

       No one has even pressed Podesta on what his language in the emails referred to. He could clear it all up if it's so ridiculous, but no one in the media will even go there.

      <p>
       Rubbish: the existence of a basement was a major feature of early pizzagate discussions, and that's why pizzagaters got all excited when they thought they'd caught Alefantis lying about it. People were constantly speculating about the basement, hidden rooms, and connections to the sewers through which the children were delivered. It was a nutso theory, and so some people tried to rebrand "pizzagate" as "pedogate" so that they could claim any child abuse case was evidence that they'd been right all along.

       James Alefnatis
       <em>
        never

       admitted Comet Ping Pong had a basement. In an interview, he talked about harvesting tonnes of tomatoes, canning them, and storing them in the basement. He never said "in the basement of Comet Ping Pong", and clearly they weren't growing tonnes of tomatoes there, but pizzagaters were so desperate to catch him out in a lie that they just ignored what he actually said. In fact, in another interview he said it was the basement of Buck's Fishing and Camping.

       Really? Dyar's tunnels were kilometres away from Comet Ping Pong and apparently amounted to only about 400 metres in total length across several levels. And where's the proof they even exist any more? Considering they were discovered when a truck fell through the road, they were probably filled in at the time.

       Dude, my mom was close-ish to Biden when she was in her late teens/early 20s because he was friends with my poppop. She said he always gave her the mega creeps but she couldn't say anything because of who he was. Apparently he was super touchy feely. And it wasn't just her who told me that. One of my neighbors said she walked past him on the street one day when he was in her late teens and was wearing a novelty "kiss me I'm Italian" button and the fucker actually did it without even asking. He's been a known creep for years.
      </p>

       The White House had to do some form of preliminary damage control knowing they had a potential sexual harassment shitstorm on their hands. That's where the shills and Lol Biden memes come in.

       You mean you never bothered to check the original claim out? I did, and not just on this camera but on other cameras that were claimed to be turned off. (They weren't.) Proof is simple: go and have a look at it yourself. Is it facing Comet Ping Pong right now? If not, then either it doesn't face there normally or it's commonly facing in another direction.

       Ah, no, the proof is there for you to see right now – log onto the camera and see if it's pointed at Comet Ping Pong. Log onto it tomorrow and see itf it's pointed at Comet Ping Pong. Log onto it every day and see if it's pointed at Comet Ping Pong. And ask yourself why it would be pointed at Comet Ping Pong anyway when it's a
       <em>
        traffic
       </em>
       camera. Or why a traffic camera mounted Or why a traffic camera mounted at the southern corner of the Connecticut Avenue and Nebraska Avenue intersection looking northwards across the intersection would normally be pointed northeast across the road at a block of shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of seeing for yourself, you'd rather just believe that they point a traffic camera at a pizzeria.

       Yep, the whole 'fake news' thing suddenly became a huge thing right after the PG stuff started getting out. The truth is that actual fake news websites, the kinds that put out ridiculous obviously fake sensationalised stories, have been around for years and they were never mentioned before, they were never a problem because most people recognized they were nto based on any evidence and were just stupid. PG though had plenty of evidence - evidence at the very least that something weird was going on and that these politicians were into some weird stuff, connected with weird people and that they had real questions to answer about the kinds of things they were up to. So the 'fake news' trope was born as a way to discredit it all, and conspiracy theories in general, as more and more people started waking up to the fact that the msm was not the honest bastion of free speech and holding power to account that people had been led to believe.

       I fear it is only a matter of time, another year or two at most, until those of us who claim things like "Fake News was created to cover for Pgate" will be laughed at as lunatics by people who weren't there. Who didn't see it unfold, who didn't see the search term statistics, and how they coincide with one another. Hell, it's already starting it seems.

       I just worry that this is our perspective, those of us who are paying attention, who are engaged and have watched this bullshit begin and develop here on Reddit and elsewhere. Does the average American care? I have a lot of faith in the American People, but I do not know how many are truly tuned into Pgate/Pedogate and the censorship of the internet that began and continues.

       I agree, but this is why they are attempting to drive the average American into a constant state of destitution and economic instability. If one is too worried about providing for their family and putting food on the table on a day to day or paycheck to paycheck basis, do they really have time to tune into the larger issues of the country? They know shit is bad, but they don't know the specifics, because they're worried about their kids and their futures.

       I feel you man. I've been feeling like you sometimes and it's back and forth. We just got to have that Blind Faith and keep going. But I will tell you that things are looking much better as of late and there are enough reasons to stay hopeful.

       I was here. It wasn’t created to talk about pizzagate. It was created in reference to articles like ‘Pope supports Trump’ and ‘Clinton wants Sharia Law’ that started popping up on Facebook during the election. It did get used by the media to talk about pizzagate quickly though, because unfortunately pizzagate fits the description pretty well. Just like flat earth didn’t magically reappear to discredit pizzagate. This is just a weird claim that gets repeated because people either don’t know or they think it helps prove pizzagate so they cling to the idea it must’ve been created for that exclusive purpose.

       Look up 'fake news' on wikipedia and you'll see they use Pizzagate as the prime example. Nothing was as widely and systematically labelled fake news by corporate media as much as pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus fake news has existed for years without it being an issue to the powers that be. National enquirer anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the worst examples of fake news, sites like neonnettle and yournewswire, are not being blocked by fb's alogorithm to 'fight fake news' like legitimate alternative media is. Hmmm almost like problem&gt;reaction&gt;solution

       Fake news has existed for years, but it’s different when it says National Enquirer on the top than when fake sites are doing everything they can to look like a legitimate news organization but are intentionally spreading knowingly false information. I agree Neon Nettle is garbage. I don’t know how Facebook is doing their algorithm thing. Pizzagate, in my opinion, fits a generic definition of fake news, at least with the way it is talked about here (often) as a matter of fact despite the circunstancial nature of the evidence, but the topic itself is not what I would consider inherently fake news. I do believe there are people that are genuinely suspicious of what they perceive as creepy stuff, and their feelings are not fake, whether I disagree with them or not.

       These "your downvotes prove me right" posts are one of the stranger things in this sub. Pizzagate posts hit the front page several times a week. There could be a group hired to keep it off the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . If that's the case, they suck at their job.

       Not here, In a lot of the threads about PizzaGate. Ive seen comments on there claiming “I can’t believe anyone thinks this is true!” While not actually giving anything to back up why they think that... and those comments have tons of upvotes. Meanwhile, I give a link to the paintings and it gets downvoted... Idk just my observation.

       Holy shit that doesn't even just apply to Pizzagate, this is a holy compendium of the exact type of bullshit I see encroaching on anything deemed wrongthink. Yo, u/polkadotgirl - This might be a good link for the sidebar over at your sub. It goes along with some of the recent topics and trends that have been discussed like shit-post planting and censorship. These tactics are DEFINITELY used when they try to baselessly make us seem like anti-semetics.

       Shouldn't the side which is claiming that the guy is a pedo be the one who presents proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't see how creepy paintings or cryptic emails discussing paintings are proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's great that people discuss theories like this, but people need to stop treating this theory as proven and call everybody who disagrees a shill. That won't help promote your cause either.

       There's people not allowing to get beyond even the first step of this conspiracy which is admitting that the paintings are in fact of pedo nature and creepy. How can you even try to begin to convince a conspiracy to somebody who clearly doesn't see anything wrong with these paintings?

       There's certainly a group

       to keeping it on the front page. Whether or not there's any money in it, who knows.

       Your first comment was 4 days ago. You adamantly speak out against pizzagate. Why? Do you think Wikipedia is correct in labeling it debunked? What about how instead of investigating they just said cpp was the target of fake new? Ever heard of fake news before that point in time?

       You see, Wikipedia has found it debunked, because wiki says that NYT says that WaPo says that CNN says that Snopes - a fact checking website - says it's debunked because there's no basement and pizzagate is exclusively and specifically about Hillary Clinton and John podesta raping and eating kids in comet ping pong's basement... which definitely isn't a cover story/distraction.

       You gotta be silly if you think it has anything to do with the Clinton foundation covering up human trafficking in Haiti, laundering money through art, or sexual political blackmail a lá project Monarch.

       Just more unsubstantiated nonsense. The closest thing you have to the truth is the Clintons bailing out someone who was by all accounts misguidedly trying to move kids out of a disaster area - a ridiculously inept ultra-Christian who was clearly too stupid to know she was breaking the law when she thought she was doing "God's work".

       What you don't have is any proof - nay, any
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       at all - that she was involved in anything intentionally nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the Haiti thing is a genuine scandal, it still has nothing to do with Podesta, Alefantis, or pizza. Calling it part of "Pizzagate" is an attempt to ground and legitimize all of the
       <em>
        total fucking nonsense
       </em>
       that comprises what Pizzagate
       <em>
        actually is
       </em>
       . Just because Pizzagaters
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       believe the Clintons were running a sex-trade out of Haiti doesn't make the sex-trade out of Haiti theory part of Pizzagate.

       As a pizzagate theorist from before the subreddit even existed and ex-mod of the sub, I gotta say that this guy is telling it true. Ignore what cmdr_lightbender says. He's not debunking anything, simply dismissing it with insults, slurs, and ad homenim attacks.

       I don't participate much (others are far better than me at research) but I was there at the beginning, too, on 4chan.  I was one (of many) to bring up Franklin, etc. Silsby's name was dropped within a day or two because of MSM articles about it and references in the Clinton emails.

       The artist is Serbian and has painted artworks implying violence and abuse as a direct result of the Balkan war of the 1990s. Why is it so hard to understand that someone whose country went through that might want to address something serious in her art? Pizzagaters often claim they want to bring attention to child abuse, but apparently it's not okay for Biljana Djurdjevic to do the same through her art.

       What bout the organ stuff? How is that supposed to represent child abuse. When I look at these paintings I don't see somebody trying to promote the message of anti-child abuse. Nice try though.

       There’s literally nothing in there I haven’t read before. I will admit the article you linked was better written and researched than most. It admits the Arch has nothing to do with the Dahmer pose (but does spend a lot of time talking about the similarities). Paintings of women with no heads doesn’t make Tony Podesta a murderer or a pedophile. I disagree that knowing Maria Abromovich makes them occultists. Kleinman is in a shitty shock band, so I’m not clutching pearls over what she said, and her connection to this seems to be their band player there and nothing more. I’ve got a collection of horror movies in my house that if you used to define me as a person would be pretty damning, that doesn’t make me a slasher with a hockey mask. 
Which part seals the deal for you? What is the best piece of evidence you see for your case?

       Fuck off. I took you seriously. I read your articles. You are a pearl clutching retard trying to push an agenda or you are just really really dumb. This is the best you’ve got? Can’t respond to any of my arguments, better deflect? Franklin coverup is real. Real shit happens. This isn’t it, or at least your evidence is hot garbage at best, and the fact that you cling to it soooo desperately makes me wonder about you projecting your feelings on this topic.

       It's art. It's not meant to be a signpost with "Child abuse is bad" in capitals on it; it's more subtle than that. You youself say you find the works creepy. That's part of the point – you're supposed to find them disconcerting. They're not glorifying violence in a
       <em>
        natural Born Killers
       </em>
       way or depicting children erotically, they're making their comment through the feelings they evoke.

       Really? I thought you found them creepy. I look at her works and find them disturbing and unsettling. I see nothing in them that romantises torture or violence. But are you saying you find them enticing or erotic or that you want to go out and torture children after seeing them?

       Now you're just putting words in my mouth. In itself the artwork is very creepy. The fact that the podesta's and their buddy James have an obsession with a creepy lifestyle further glorifies the creepiness in this particular artwork.

       No, if I had been putting words in your mouth, I would have written:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You say you find them enticing or erotic and you want to go out and torture children after seeing them."

       Instead, I asked a question:

        "But are you saying you find them enticing or erotic or that you want to go out and torture children after seeing them?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And that was a reasonable question to ask considering you had written "looks like they're promoting it here" in answer to my comment that the paintings didn't glorify violence or depict children erotically.

       You're missing my point, which was that for the paintings to promote violence, they would have to somehow make it appear attractive or justified. If you find them creepy, I don't see how you think they're promoting violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about your claim Tony Podesta and james Alefantis have "an obsession with a creepy lifestyle". Do you have any evidence to back that up or not?

       That's what a lot of people in this thread have basically tried to do. They try to use clever wordplay to get me to admit it without realizing it. It's very obvious they're here to accuse and to normalize pedophilia. Maybe your word play is more subtle but I think this is where you are trying to get at with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you didn't accuse me directly but implied it through a question doesn't really change much in fact you're not so subtle at all. Your intentions are very obvious and I'm here to expose them. Slowly but surely.

       Any examples of where someone's trying to get you to admit something you don't believe? Frankly, I think you're being paranoid: you're not the point of the discussion – the lack of evidence for pizzagate is. And nobody here is normalising paedophilia: child abuse is an absolutely vile crime that can have devastating lifelong consequences for its victims. And, precisely because it is such a horrendous crime, people shouldn't go round doing such inane things as replacing words in someone else's emails with terms like "little girl" and then claiming they've proved that person's a child abuser.

      <p>
       Chill out. I asked a clarifying question because I didn't understand your logic. I'm not implying that you are a paedophile at all. That would be ridiculous considering (to repeat myself) my whole point is that people shouldn't be round accusing other people of such vile crimes without credible evidence.

       Get over yourself – you're not exposing anything, but you are avoiding answering questions. If you want to know something from me, just ask it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, how about we get back to the discussion and you tell me what evidence you have to back up that Alefantis and Podesta have "an obsession with a creepy lifestyle". In case you've missed it, my not-at-all-subtle intention here is to get you to answer that question and not deflect again.

       People who buy walking dead figurines are probably walking dead fans. People who buy rap music are probably people who listen to rap music.
People who buy creepy paintings involving uncomfortable looking children lined up with their hands behind they're backs wearing swimwear...
Probably have unique interests.
And before you whine, sure there's no red star next to it.  Make yourself proud and prove he doesn't own the other paintings too.

       Yes, I was. I was taught to be critical, to research for myself and not to just accept what someone else says, to differentiate between actual evidence and allegation, and to not go round accusing people of crimes without proof. It's a pity more people haven't learned these things.

       And some conspiracists could twist that to say you're obsessed with sex. Sexual imagery involving adults has been used by pizzagaters to accuse Alefantis of child abuse, notably the Koons artwork, which they claimed showed a child.

       But show me where Podesta has picture of a dead or abused child decorating his home.

       So, you admit you are obssessed with sex and you have challenging Beardsley prints: you must be a rapist or a sexual harasser on the level of Harvey Weinstein. At least, that's how the pizzagate logic works for Tony Podesta: he owns some confronting art therefore he's a child abuser.

       He doesn't have paintings of dead, abused children. And violent models of people with decapitated zombies are just fine, they're just for people who enjoy TV, but art that some find uncomfortable must be for child abusers. It's ridiculous.

       Just repeating it doesn't make it true. Even if they were, that wouldn't make him a child abuser. According to you, people who display models of decapitated mutated humans are just TV fans. There's no evidence he's anything but an art fan.

       That's exactly what you're saying. If people like a popular show that's filled with extremely gory and violent imagery, that's fine, there's nothing going on there. But if a person likes a "fairly obscure artist" who has produced disturbing paintings, then they're a child abuser.

        It's because the FBI is currently investigating Comet Ping Pong as well as the threats issued by Alefantis …

       Any evidence of this apart from the guy who claimed he was threatened claiming that the FBI are investigating?

       If you even watched the video you would understand that Alefantis told him to push the Pizzagategear angle to discredit him.

      <p>
       He also proved he had contact with Alefantis' number in a later video.

       "Did we forget about David Seaman saying he has a source saying the FBI is seriously investigating this matter" You mean a random dude on the internet who has a site deeply invested in making PG a real thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Looks like we got an investigation boys." Thats your evidence? Really? You say he proved he had contact. Whats his proof? Do you really trust some random dude on the internet supporting a 4chan theory that the government is running a literal child sex ring for more than 30 years involving some the most important people in the world? All with zero victims coming forward, zero family members of victims coming forward, and LITERALLY zero evidence? And it was only figured out now because someone said they wanted to get some pizza in an email? DC is full of reporters and journalists looking to make it big with a huge story like an underground pizza ring involving world leaders. But somehow nobody has found it yet. Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact that if there really was such a high level crime being committed, and they managed to hide it for so long, would they really just casually joke about it in emails? And why the FUCK would they involve a pizzeria in DC? These people own enormous swathes of land right outside DC where they could molest children free of any police for miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is just a dumb cash grab made to trick rubes and conservatives in to spending their time watching ads and buying bumper stickers. Isn't it funny how it matches up with all the people the RNC hates? You are a victim of the new MSM. Don't be a sucker.

       Yes you've figured it out bro, Pizzagate is a behemoth conspiracy invented by a handful of citizen journalists who have risked their safety, social lives, reputations etc so they can make money off youtube ad revenue and bumper stickers. All the evidence of elite pedophile rings protected by law enforcement and media is a sophisticated hoax.

       But now I'm reminded of the $65,000 worth of hot dogs Obama needed flown in for the white house. The same white house that doesn't permit outside food or drinks to be taken inside. Everything has to be prepared in-house.

       It could be pizza and hot dogs (things which Chicago is known for) and other expenses for an event. It could also just be two employees gossiping about government spending and making a joke. We have no idea but it's probably not child rape because why would it be?

      <p>
       TL;DR, The email's writer hates Obama and is making a baseless accusations in private. He has no inside knowledge of Obama's dealings and was most likely regurgitating some bullshit/talking point he heard, exaggerating, joking, and/or making it up from whole cloth.

       Here is the explanation: some random guy who votes Republican saw a random blog post shared on Facebook about how OBUMMER was WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY on such FRIVOLITIES as PARTIES with CATERING, and referenced that blog post in an email to coworkers. It was never based in fact. It was just a partisan talking-point that got circulated among some dude's friends and co-workers.

       Better explanation here, these are comments from the past year I've saved on this.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let's just do the hot dog one. That's taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it's false on its face - you can't bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First of all, this is
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">
        an intra-office email in Stratfor.
       </a>
       It has nothing to do with Podesta or Clinton. Fred Burton of Stratfor said "I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago." He's not claiming to have any special, inside knowledge, so he is probably referring to something in the news.  The email was in May 2009. Just a few weeks earlier, there was a very minor kerfuffle about Obama flying in Pizza. Though the pizza had Chicago-themed names, it was actually from St. Louis, which made some Chicago pizzerias mad.

       Some right-wing bloggers and a few in the media tried to stir up anger at Obama for extravagance or wasting taxpayers' money, but it turned out that no taxpayer money was used to fly the food out.

       None of those are code except for pizza, and that code is usually cheese pizza, which never appears in the emails. The only one that reads weird to me is the handkerchief one. Everything else is clearly, literally, the food that they are talking about.

         Literally that. Will I think better on a stomach full of cheese (from the box you usually give) or pasta (the gift you gave this year). Also there’s emails from the year before talking about the previous year’s gift. Along way to go to set up a code word sentence a year later.

         Literally that. I’ve got an hour lunch would you like to meet up during that time for pizza. ‘You wanna go get drinks for an hour or two?’ would be a more normal sentence, but I fail to see how this is weird.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Its a joke. Like a cheap boss joke. I’m going to only buy one slice ha ha. It’ll be like Jesus, and the loaves and fishes. If we slice it thin enough everyone can have a slice.
        </p>

         Agreed handkerchief is weird. Still could be any number of things as well as code. A handkerchief with marinara on it. A handkerchief someone has drawn on. It could be a reference or inside joke we don’t get. It could also be code.

         Lol. It was $65,000. It was a made up number (‘I think’ is the phrasing in the email) mentioned in an email as an offhand remark meant to criticize Obama’s spending. It was also on pizza and dogs. Why do I have the facts better than you on this?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The triangle is ubiquitous (especially when it comes to pizza logos), but sure, that’s a weird coincidence. I guess more logo designers should be aware of FBI press releases so they can avoid stuff like that, unless it was intentional of course. The ping pong paddles being the butterfly is a real big stretch. The Terasol logo is a hand in a heart, not a spiral heart. I couldn’t find any claims about the politics and prose logo.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I count two weird coincidences tops. If those are enough for you, by all means dig, but that is not enough for me, and it is definitely not enough to call someone a pedophile.

       Yeah, the brigades are always extremely obvious to regulars. The invaders often do things like refer to all of the people in this sub as "you guys" while blatantly trolling. I guess the top level comment is trying to tell us that some of the TMOR brigaders are unpaid "shills"? I guess that's possible, but I feel sorry for the people who would do that shit without the motivation of desperate need for a paycheck. So gross.

       Evidence for a global elite pedo ring is in no single place. But if you look into the Franklin Scandal, Finders Cult, Operation Darkroom, Jimmy Saville, Ted Heath, Jeffrey Epstein, the claims of Fiona Barnett, Ted Gunderson, Cathy O'Brien you start to see how the pieces fit together. Pizzagate was just a glimpse into a global conspiracy that has at times over the last few decades threatened to emerge.

       U/FartOnToast is the only one here who got the message. Maybe I was a bit too ambigious. But anyway this comment from him got downvoted too;

       He clearly wasn’t ambigious at all and made a good point with clear arguments. Doesn’t deserve downvotes, but still gets it because he is defending my point.

       No, I am comparing to the comment above where he said that having only 2 painting from a collection of 11 bizar paintings doesn't make it bizar. So my point here is that if I have two weapons in the hand of my gang, I am a gangmember. Just like how owning 2 bizar paintings out of the 11 bizar paintings makes those two paintings still bizar. The comment above was arguing that owning only two paintings which indicate CP does not indicate CP because Podesta doesn't own the other 9 paintings.

       They have the same theme. This is a very poor defense you guys are using.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photo isn't also misleading because it indicates which of the paintings Skippy owns just to show what the artist is about and how there is a general theme to the paintings. You just seem to be angry that the rest of the painting seem to paint a bigger picture. And you don't want people to find out. That's what I'm getting at least from your argument

I personally downvote it when, like in this post here, it intentionally spreads misleading info, like claiming Podesta owns all of those art pieces (or at least not pointing out only 2 of the paintings are his). Reasons I think it’s bullshit...
There are no victims that I know of. The only code words mentioned that have a legitimate history are pizza. Walnut sauce isn’t a code word. Cheese pizza is never mentioned in all of the emails. It is often pushed as a fact that Podesta and Alefantis are pedo’s, when that is not a fact, it is speculation at best. Hotard is not evidence of criminal behavior or intent. Playing dominoes on cheese or pasta refers literally to playing dominoes with a stomach full of one of those two foods. The pool email went out to multiple parties, and kids are fun. 4chan whipped people into a frenzy and people that don’t do well with critical thinking are easily swayed by a couple of Instagram pictures with gay stuff in it.

       but "cum panda" seems to involve blackening a child's eyes either through violence or make-up, and it seems to match the description of PadeoSadism, and he didn't just take a passing interest in the subject, he seemed to have been stuck on it for some time

       I haven’t seen any evidence that Cum Panda is specifically in reference to kids, but if it is, and if that’s the context he’s using it in, yeah that’s fucked up. It seems more likely to me that’s not the context he’s using it in based on what’s in the pictures he’s posted with that hashtag. I could be wrong. That’s still not enough to call him a pedo in my mind, and to me it reeks of 4chan making something fit the result they were looking for.

       Christ Punchers! The Simpson’s was trying to warn me all along! It could be a cheese pizza type code sure, but then the context doesn’t really make sense in the Instagram posts if that’s what it’s referring to, but yeah, it does have those two letters. I’ve never heard of that being used before to replace cheese pizza, but makes me wonder if Podesta has ever been seen wearing a Chris Paul jersey!

       Alefantis' use of the word "chickenhawk", "chickenlover" in his instagram, a slang term for a homosexual pedophile are just inside jokes too i'm guessing. Such a funny guy!

       So many weird coincidences, but i guess pointing them out means i'm the one with the problem.

       I don’t see Chicken Hawk anywhere in these Photos. Chicken lover yes, but I have no evidence he’s using your obscure slang term, could be, but it seems more to me likely they ate some chicken than they are soliciting. The other photo he is wearing a shirt that says Butt. Yikes! Is there any evidence Cum Panda refers to children and isn’t just a Donkey Punch variant that 4chan has now said is about kids? Or is it just an inside joke we aren’t privy to that now has been assigned a deeper meaning despite it appearing in Instagram posts without children in them (and having panda related items in the pictures)?

       Still not child porn. It's a dude holding a little girl. The Pizzagate explanation of the term "chickenlovers" as a pedo reference doesn't make any sense here, since a "chicken" is a younger (usually underage) gay male. Not a baby.
      </p>

       If anything, the "chicken" in this photo would be the dude holding the girl.

       Yep, it's such a "persecution complex" thing going on with a lot of the mentally ill/emotionally immature who buy into a lot of these conspiracy theories.

       According to them, everything is out to kill us and everyone who disagrees with their narrow-minded viewpoint is a government shill, whom they shout down and treat like crap if they bring a rational sensibility to proceedings.

       Yeah i mean it's not like it's been common knowledge for close to a decade that the internet is overrun by astroturfers, bots and paid commenters who work to promote a consensus in all kinds of topics. Comment sections in reddit is one of the most blatant examples of this on the internet. If you have a large scale business/organisation and aren't using these methods of PR in 2017 you are well and truly behind the curve.

       Thing is, art has always been subjective. It's like when Tracy Emin won awards for her "unmade bed", where she just displayed her bed as it looked in her home, with the covers messed up, used condoms on the floor and other things, while others complained that it offended them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally speaking, I dislike that artwork because I dislike children, but if it were adults being painted, I'd have no issue with it.

       Art is a great tool to hide subversive messages because normies will always defend it as 'subjective'. Don't be gaslit into doubting your own intuition. There's nothing normal about the pictures you mentioned, nor any of the pictures and art related to PG.

       I have learned a lot from studying how desperate some people are to believe in and talk endlessly about 'elite pedo rings'. And how quickly they accuse those who ask for evidence of being 'shills'. Like some kind of sick religious cult tbh fam.

       I was informed that it was all bullshit and everyone knew as much.  I hadn't been following so was news to me.

       Regardless, it's an open secret of the sex abuse of these people. I've seen what they call art, read testimony of people who have been around all of it, and I have to admit, I believe there is definitely abuse going on with these groups.  Just too much adds up to it.

       The word "shills" is thrown around in this sub, and the meaning has been boiled down to "someone who doesn't agree with a particular conspiracy theory".  More and more people, in this sub and elsewhere, got tired of pizzagate because after digging and reading emails and looking at all the "evidence" in it's proper context, it adds up to nothing at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, in every single comment section, I see people cherry picking the same emails while leaving out the context of the emails to make them sound more nefarious than they are.  I see people taking art out of the context of the artist's intentions.  So on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was worth looking into, but it didn't turn up shit.  There is no damning evidence.  Just a few coincidences among a giant pile of out-of-context "circumstantial evidence".  Most conspiracy theorists have moved on to pedophilia among elites with a wider scale than the PizzaGate nothingburger.  But for some people, Pizzagate is absolutely real and no amount of rational explanations can change their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       People not agreeing with you isn't because of "shills".  It's because, sometimes, people don't agree with you.  Shills exist, but most people in this sub seem to go out of their way to explain the reality of pizzagate.  This sub, for the most part, seems to be over it.  There are bigger fish to fry.

       Shouldn't the side which is claiming that the guy is a pedo be the one who presents proof?

       And I don't see how creepy paintings or cryptic emails discussing paintings are proof.

       I think it's great that people discuss theories like this, but people need to stop treating this theory as proven and call everybody who disagrees a shill. That won't help promote your cause either.

       Well the organ stuff can represent the violence of war. Seems to still fit with the themes of violence and abuse caused by war.

       So you ignore that there is zero evidence of the code being used, outside of conspiracy circles, then claim there's fire because of this non-existent smoke existing where only conspiracy theorists can see it?

      <p>
       There
       <em>
        is

       no smoke, because theres no fire. We need more than some less than credible website claiming something to be true that isn't.

       It's art. It's not meant to be a signpost with "Child abuse is bad" in capitals on it; it's more subtle than that. You youself say you find the works creepy. That's part of the point – you're supposed to find them disconcerting. They're not glorifying violence in a
       <em>
        natural Born Killers
       </em>
       way or depicting children erotically, they're making their comment through the feelings they evoke.

       Look up 'fake news' on wikipedia and you'll see they use Pizzagate as the prime example. Nothing was as widely and systematically labelled fake news by corporate media as much as pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus fake news has existed for years without it being an issue to the powers that be. National enquirer anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the worst examples of fake news, sites like neonnettle and yournewswire, are not being blocked by fb's alogorithm to 'fight fake news' like legitimate alternative media is. Hmmm almost like problem&gt;reaction&gt;solution

       Yes you've figured it out bro, Pizzagate is a behemoth conspiracy invented by a handful of citizen journalists who have risked their safety, social lives, reputations etc so they can make money off youtube ad revenue and bumper stickers. All the evidence of elite pedophile rings protected by law enforcement and media is a sophisticated hoax.

       Yeah i mean it's not like it's been common knowledge for close to a decade that the internet is overrun by astroturfers, bots and paid commenters who work to promote a consensus in all kinds of topics. Comment sections in reddit is one of the most blatant examples of this on the internet. If you have a large scale business/organisation and aren't using these methods of PR in 2017 you are well and truly behind the curve.

       I haven’t seen any evidence that Cum Panda is specifically in reference to kids, but if it is, and if that’s the context he’s using it in, yeah that’s fucked up. It seems more likely to me that’s not the context he’s using it in based on what’s in the pictures he’s posted with that hashtag. I could be wrong. That’s still not enough to call him a pedo in my mind, and to me it reeks of 4chan making something fit the result they were looking for.
