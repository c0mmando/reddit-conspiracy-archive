        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look into getting a hardware wallet for safe storage and to buy/sell I would recommend a combination of Coinbase and Binance. This will make it easy to deposit to your Coinbase account from a bank account (has a bit of a wait...5 days I think) or Credit/Debit (Instant, just have to go into your transactions and confirm 2 pending charges they put on for a dollar that they remove after).</p>

<p>Once you get the coins in Coinbase, you can then send the funds to your Binance account (obv. make an account on binance first). You can find your wallet hash in &quot;Deposits&quot;.</p>

<p>It can be a bit confusing so please let me know if you need me to walk you through in PM. :)</p>

<p>Binance: <a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=12701287">https://www.binance.com/?ref=12701287</a></p>

<p>As for what to look into, obviously Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin are the main players (most popular to people outside of the space) and are generally peoples starting point. Other coins that have been popular lately include XRP, NEO, XVG, TRX, POE, and others. Those are some other good starters that have been relatively popular and have had insane movement the past few days/weeks. It is all about doing your own research at the end of the day and backing projects that you find innovative and that have potential. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Best of luck! To the moon ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what we are seeing is the first time in history a system has been created that is threatening the power structure within socioeconomic status that has not been changing favorably for the common man in years. This is the first time the masses have the ability to dramatically reverse who controls the money, and it is very difficult to shield what is happening from people. All of this talk about uncertainty and risk is not coming out of left field, but it is also being deliberately spread to increase levels of fear uncertainty and doubt so the masses hold off a bit more letting those with money currently to get in as early adopters, while waiting for things to settle down in their favor a bit more before pushing early/late majority to buy in once they deem it is &quot;safe enough&quot;. I understand that there is much greed out there and a lot of shady stuff going on within the space, but if you put in the work and do your research, there are promising projects that will succeed in the mix, and those are the ones that are going to change the lives of people like myself and others who are smart enough to see what is going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever you feel comfortable with, in all honesty. It found it best to start small (100-250$) and use that to try doubling up/building a base. It&#39;s always best to play with the houses money ;). Moreover, this will give you more time, and less stress so you can start doing more research on the principal technology behind most of these coins and learn more about the individual projects themselves, the teams, upcoming announcements, etc... </p>

<p>I would stay away from BTC if going small at first due to higher transaction fees, by the way. Look into ETH or LTC. </p>

<p>Stop trying to pimp crypto here.

Don&#39;t come at me with this pro-crypto bullshit. If you can&#39;t see that it&#39;s as big of a bubble as Dutch Tulipmania, then you deserve to be fleeced for all the cryptocurrency you have when stuff turns sour.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I was just curious, wouldn&#39;t the whole point of having a currency that is not the one we are currently using to avoid paying taxes. I mean, it isn&#39;t even US dollars so how can they tax you for something that isn&#39;t even theirs. Makes no sense. So how does having bit coin or any other online currency make any sense if they can still get you like that. Since they need to be able to trust that you are reporting your income correctly they will likely want some sort of records or tracking system in place to the amounts your are making right?</p>

<p>Sorry just really dumb when it comes to online currency don&#39;t really understand the point if you are still being taxed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t make enough money to try and hide what I earn, just thought the whole point of a crypto currency was to move away from the taxations on money earned. Seems I&#39;ve made some bad assumptions in my ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry...i should have clarified. I tend to withdraw on gains and this is taxed after exchanging into USD just like any tax is.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I see, that makes much more sense. I knew I wasn&#39;t getting something. Thanks for clarifying. So only when you go to exchange it then you get the tax. </p>

<p>So, next question. The only way to get or make new bit coin that has never been owned or umm discovered? before is to mine it? But what gives bit coin value. How do those zeros and ones = money. Or is it because just like our money it is all fake and it is agreed upon that it has value because we say it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is similar to FIAT in the sense its only a store of value and not really a commodity like gold or other metals/oil. There is a limit on # of total bitcoins (21mil) in existence/to be mined so this helps with inflation control and in theory leads to an increase in value/difficulty of each bitcoin being mined. The main reason we are hearing about BTC today is due to the fact is a much more efficient store of wealth and is essentially dollar 2.0 in the sense that it is built for the age of technology we live in in terms of being able to be exchanged easily and at high speed with a decentralized ledger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we stay the course it is a given that we would transition to a digital based currency, just not sure if that is the right move either.

<p>With the recent discover of back doors hidden into intel processors what kind of threat does this pose if any to a digital currency? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that this space is VERY INSECURE! Which is why I do not recommend investing more than you are comfortable losing...and by losing, I mean like having your account turn to 0 over night (ask MT.Gox traders.....) But that is where it is crucial to do your research and find exchanges/coins that are run by solid teams, without any bullshit going on. Moreover, that is why it is imperative if you really are trying to dip your toes into this scene, you have to take it seriously and do your research on not only what the next moonshot is, but how to protect your money and make sure you are being safe. I recommend looking into a hardware wallet you can purchase easily online for not so much (100-200 .. but there are more expensive ones). Essentially a secure &quot;wallet&quot; (usb drive) that can be completely offline when not needed so you don&#39;t have to worry about security issues when not connected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. It really is a pain at first. I went through like 4 different exchanges over the last few weeks and I personally like BInance the best. Has a good variety of altcoins and its easy to use, has low fees, and is fast. Also...you don&#39;t have to go through much authentication stuff if you never plan on working with large sums of money. All you really need is coinbase and binance. I can help you out in more detail in PM or something if you need anything.

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1: Open Coinbase and Binance accounts.</p>

<p>Coinbase: <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a2ffa33c72cdf02c516a622">https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a2ffa33c72cdf02c516a622</a> Binance: <a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=12701287">https://www.binance.com/?ref=12701287</a></p>

<p>Step 2: Upload preferred payment method (bank account takes 5-7 business days to process FYI). You can chose debit and credit card which is instant. If you chose debit card or credit card, you will get 3 authorization charges on your credit card. They will be for $1.00 $1.xx $1.xx. You will have to enter the 2 digits (Cents) from the 2 transactions that have cents value and it will ask you to enter them back into Coinbase.</p>

<p>Step 3: Once you select payment method and purchase your desired amount of BTC/LTC/ETH, you are now ready to transfer to Binance and buy other coins. You will see a tab called &quot;Funds&quot; on the top nav bar. Click on Deposits/Withdrawals and select &quot;Deposit&quot;. There you will see a list of all coins available on the exchange there. Select &quot;Deposit&quot; on the cryptocoin you want to deposit into your account. This is very IMPORTANT! DO NOT CHOOSE THE WRONG ONE OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY! Make sure you send BTC to your BTC wallet and LTC to your LTC wallet etc...</p>

<p>To do this, Copy and pase the long string of digits (Called a hash) to the &quot;address&quot; in coinbase. It will ask where you are sending the coin when you choose &quot;send&quot; in coinbase.</p>

<p>Step 4: Select amount you want to send over and copy and paste the address in and hit send. Within an hour or so max depending on volume of transaction (usually only a few minutes) you should see the deposit in your account on Binance.</p>

<p>Step 5: Purchase the coin using the &quot;exchange&quot; tab on the nav bar. Click on &quot;Basic&quot; and from the Right ticker box, select whatever coin you deposited into your binance account. Then select the pair (i.e. XRP/BTC or XRP/ETH etc...)</p>

<p>Step 6: there will be 2 boxes (buy and sell) on the bottom of the page. Select the &quot;Market&quot; tab, and enter the amount you would like to purchase (easy to use 25,50,75,100% buttons to save you calculating the coin you want to purchase to the coin you are using to purchase). Select &quot;Buy&quot; and you now own the altcoin you purchased and it can be visible in your account.</p>

<p>Please let me know if this is good enough or if you need more help!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. You can honestly never go wrong with BTC, getting in soon. I do not see it having any issues reaching 40-50K. And these are relatively modest compared to many expert projections at 100k+. I think we will see a lot of developments in 2018 re: ability to actually make purchases easily with crypto. There are already a number of rumors that Tron/Alibaba are partnering and WaBi is actually already being used to fight counterfeit baby products/alcohol (go figure) in Asia. Will be moving to some pharma products in 2018. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not a bad strategy for starting. Personally i got in on ripple at about 15 cents and plan on holding. I have never been hot on IOTA (thought their team was not A+ from the start) and the little incident with them hyping a microsoft partnership proved that for me. I really like Tron (founder is close with jack ma and alibaba people) and Wabi (is being used to fight counterfeit products - baby products/alcohol for now, pharma and others later). The nice thing about Wabi is that it is proven tech that is being used already by real people and it is getting great reviews. Another is Verge. Has a great marketing team and is promising in the privacy coin space. Pat Mcafee stated it could get to 15$ by eoy 2018...its at like 6 cents right now. As with anything, the more time and effort you put in researching, the better you will fair. But those are some good ones to start. DRGN (DragonChain) is promising as well but a bit difficult to get since it is not listed on many exchanges yet... these are my bags for now. Will post more on my twitter and here in coming weeks for other tips and shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I&#39;ll check some of those out. </p>

<p>Is there any point in spending 10$ to acquire fractions of things like monero zcash dash etc? Or much more LT potential in the sub 1$/coin ones? </p>

<p>Presumably some of these coins u can only buy by using other BTC is that correct? Seems like they&#39;d be intrinsically linked. </p>

<p>Wondering how much of the rise in various coins is linked to growth in BTC </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that BTC rising is linked to alts falling is not really proven, just something that a number of traders have noticed, but due to the lack of actually having data showing this, I would not count on this 100% of the time. </p>

<p>I can see why many people starting think that cheaper coins make more sense to get into due to their ability to grow rapidly and this is not necessarily true. $10 investment into a more expensive coin that grows 100% is still going to get you 20$ the same as a cheap coin doubling, however, it does get a bit more difficult to sustain super high growth rates down the line. I would say it all depends on what projects you find potential in...there are some really solid altcoins under 1$/$10/$50 etc... i would focus more on potential near/mid/long term growth (depending on what your goal is) and learn about any upcoming announcements, partnerships, etc.. that are going on to leverage those to land into something that moons before it does. </p>

<p>A majority of the altcoins are usually easiest when bought via other coins (BTC, ETH, LTC). The easiest way to do it is to get started with coinbase and then send funds to Binance from there. I have a walkthrough if you&#39;d like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for reply.</p>

<p>actually i was pondering about the opposite whether alts are rising because bitcoin is.</p>

<p>true i guess a 100% rise in value would be same for w/e coin you have...i guess my qs was more around any potential transaction fees or w/e linked with the coin and potential usability factor if e.g. in 10years you have 0.1 e.g. monero and u will need to be using 0.000001 to buy something if you wanted to rather than just using 1 cheaper alt coin (of which you have more).</p>

<p>interested to read any walk throughs.</p>

<p>another thing im interested in is if i can store multiple types of alt coins in a single wallet. is there a best hard ware one for that or is it better to eg have multiple paper wallets if the plan is to diversify </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some decent wallets out there that are compatible with a number of coins but you are going to have a hard time finding one that is readily available with a number of altcoins. I think part of the reason is newbies are buying in on these cheap altcoins in hopes of BTC growth #&#39;s...which is never going to happen (i.e. get to 19k+), but that not to say you cannot still see great returns. I would say if you are looking at transaction fees than anything but BTC is really a viable option. There are tons of altcoins that boast tiny transaction fees and seem to be more setup with this in mine (think .006 xrp per transaction....tiny in comparison to some of the 25$+ fees with BtC  ive seen)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, that’d be great. I just need a step-by-step guide on how to go from the $200 in my bank account that I want to spend on Monero, to having the Monero. Keep in mind, I only have a phone, and I’m not tech-savvy at all. </p>
