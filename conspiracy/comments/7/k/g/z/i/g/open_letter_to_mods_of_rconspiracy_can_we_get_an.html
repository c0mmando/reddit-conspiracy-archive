<p>It seems that users on there that are new accounts, are tagged with the age of the account.</p>

<p>I think this would be useful here.</p>

<p>There will be things at 15 you will have no clue about that a 50 year old will know.</p>

<p>Eg you wasn&#39;t even alive to experience a pre 911/internet world.  Unfortunately experience does count for a lot. You can read all you want but nothing compares to expedience unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started this by stating the straw man fallacy  (i how this is the right one) would be become an issue</p>

<p>Thank you for making my point</p>

<p>9/11 was NOT a drop in the ocean, all conspiracies aside that day changed everything and you couldn&#39;t understand that without the experience. In the same way I will not thoroughly understand turning on the radio and finding out the world is at war for the 2nd time,  I&#39;ve never had to deal with my food being rationed. I can pretend to understand but I will never really understand what it is like to go to the local market with my entire bank account and not afford bread</p>

<p>Age does not necessarily equal experience. Not all 12 year olds have the same  personal experience but in the wider (historically)experience they do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you mean that experience is important it is one of the most important thing in life without experience knowledge wouldn&#39;t even exist because knowledge can&#39;t exist if now one thried to experience the thing that is needed to make knowledge out of it knowledge and experience are bounded together they are in essence the same but the difference is only that the one way is simpler than the other humanity itself is based on experience with experience we had knowledge we advance and now we are here I know  what you mean with knowledge doesn&#39;t speak for itself experience does and I 100% agree with you on that but we as humans must see al the experience for each individual human so we can understand what&#39;s the cause what is the true problem because nowadays not everything does seem what it is everthing can nowadays be faked or photoshopped therefore it is needed that we need to learn each generation of men and women to learn what is right and wrong but not in a single way because the right and wrong way are so diversed because everyone has it&#39;s own interpretation over it so therefore it is needed that we must see  each side of the problem if we don&#39;t we repeat the cycle of our ancestors of understanding problems that we face like  racism superiority greed being selfish  lust envy in the end we as humans need to understand each side of each human to understand each other.

What is a very small minority? 5%? There are websites where you can buy accounts in batch, like 1k accounts with one single purchase. While I can not say an exact number it&#39;s way higher than very small minority. This sub might not be their biggest target but i&#39;ve already seen some people spot fake users. &quot;Paid shills&quot; are real, even if the term is over used. </p>

<p>I&#39;m this war against shills we have to be smarter than them and that means studying their tactics even as they are ever adapting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an idea for a simple ago</p>

<p>IF account x &lt; 2 months old</p>

<p>AND ratio of down votes to up votes &gt; 80%</p>

<p>AND number of comments &gt; 100</p>

<p>THEN send comments, votes and posts for mods to review.</p>

<p>This is a filter that can be adjusted over time so people don&#39;t reverse game the system and Mods can get access to troll accounts faster and more fairly since all have to play by the same numerical rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are third party websites where you can put in reddit usernames and it crawls the profile page and spits out a report.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is scalable though.</p>

<p>reddit seems to be upgrading the user profile pages so it now shows you what subs someone is active in but not much detail.</p>
