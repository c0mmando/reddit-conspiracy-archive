    <div class="md"><p>Awesome! Thanks! I&#39;ll mix up some and give it a go. </p>

<p>Yeah, I think the next thing I should do is eliminate all grains. I&#39;m still eating organic oats and rice. I&#39;ve tried for a couple weeks going grain-free, but I struggle with feeling like absolute shit if I don&#39;t have a protein, veggie and carb. I&#39;m still on the fence about listening to my body or maybe it&#39;s just carb sickness? How many days/weeks going keto before carb sickness goes away? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you stay under 20g of carbs a day, it takes 48 hours to get into a state of nutritional ketosis. For me, still had cravings for about a week. But it is a lot easier to not give into them because I felt incredibly less hungry. Binge eating stopped with very little effort on my part. Now I can have a cup of coffee in the morning and not really feel hungry until 5 as long as I&#39;m staying hydrated. If you up the amount of fat in your diet and limit the carbs, (pretty much the only carbs I eat are leafy greens and occasionally coconut/almond flour to make pizza) your body has a constant supply of energy in your stored fat, even if you are a lean individual. So the carbs aren&#39;t messing with your blood sugar constantly, not nearly as much insulin so no crashes, and as my body learned to run on fat more, I&#39;ve noticed less depression/anxiety, more motivation and most importantly a reduction in the severity of my autoimmune disease.</p>

<p>Whew, sorry for the wall of text lol. Lurking at r/keto was incredibly helpful for me, as was Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast with Gary Taubes (which, interestingly enough, comes at the issue from a bit of conspiracy angle)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was really helpful info! Appreciate you spelling it all out for me and providing additional links. You make it sound so doable, I&#39;m going to give it another try. I think I&#39;ll just need to be strategic w/my 20g of carbs, like having half a sweet potato with lunch and the other half for dinner. That could be enough for me to feel normal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I forgot to mention under 20g of net carbs, which just means you subtract the fiber from the overall number of carbs because fiber isn&#39;t really digestible. So that may make things a bit easier. </p>

<p>So about the sweet potato, one cup of sweet potato has 27g of carbs with 4g of fiber, so net carbs for one cup is 23g. So while you could get away with like a half cup of sweet potato in a day, you&#39;d have to be very careful for the rest of the day. I&#39;d try to substitute the sweet potato with avocado. Also I&#39;d suggest trying not to think of it like &quot;I can&#39;t have x, y, z&quot; but instead thinking about it like &quot;I get to have bacon and eggs, bunless burgers, steak, butter, chicken wings, avocado, cheese, etc&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stopped eating wheat too for the last six months. Gave me super bad heartburn when I tried to reintroduce it to my diet. Removing wheat didn&#39;t help any of my many autoimmune diseases, though. Maybe I need to give it more time. I won&#39;t eat wheat again anyway. I don&#39;t miss it much. It&#39;s certainly not good enough to poison myself w/all that glyphosate. </p>

<p>I tried glutamine and it made me super bloated and in pain the entire day to the point I couldn&#39;t eat and just stayed in bed. Either it was a bad batch or I have some bad bacteria in the gut I need to address first before taking glutamine. In the meantime, I&#39;m taking zinc w/carnosine as it seems to be helping my stomach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats great, interesting your health hasn&#39;t improved.  What does your diet consist of usually?</p>

<p>The borax and baking soda I use in the shower.  I live in an apartment and have dirty city water, and it&#39;s like 60% of what&#39;s in the water gets absorbed in to the body.  I don&#39;t have a house water filter which is essential to have in my opinion.  Boron acts like a barrier to protect your bodies cells.  Borax helps counter act all the bad stuff including fluoride in the water, also use it in my mouth.  </p>

<p>Food grade hydrogen peroxide is great to take to increase the amount of oxygen available in the bloodstream.  Disease can not live in an environment with lots of oxygen.  </p>

<p>I also stay away from soy (soymorphines) and dairy (casomorphines).  Also stay away flaxseeds, beans and all kinds of fungi.  </p>

<p>And garlic yes its basically my favorite flavor too I was raised eating garlic and onions.  Onions are supposed to have the same effects as garlic also.  It was hard at first to stop </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My diet is no gluten, dairy, soy. I eat all organic and make everything from scratch.  I intermittent fast until lunch when I eat things like granola, fruit, coconut yogurt, fruit smoothie (fruit, coconut milk, protein powder), organic homemade muffins, avocados and bacon, oatmeal or leftovers. Dinner is usually meat, veggie, rice or a starchy veggie. I eat nuts, fruit and organic dark chocolate as snacks. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to cut out all grains and nuts, and beans, but after cutting out gluten and sugar, I lost so much weight that I&#39;m severely underweight now. I&#39;m trying to gain but w/o sugar, it&#39;s a struggle.</p>

<p>Do you just drink the food grade peroxide? Do you do it every day? How much?</p>

<p>Also, do you apply the borax and baking soda to your body and then hit the shower? Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just had never heard of this before. I&#39;m also limited in my water choice as I live in an apartment and can&#39;t put in a RO filter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just listened. Excellent episode! Lots of good info! Will be looking into Clive de Carle. Thanks so much!</p>

<p>By the way, do you happen to know any more info about that heat machine Clive mentioned that was used for the Rothschild&#39;s accountant who had brain cancer? Sounded like something we should get our hands on! It spoke to me because I&#39;ve never had a fever in my life (never had a temp over 99) and think that&#39;s a huge part of my problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stopped eating wheat too for the last six months. Gave me super bad heartburn when I tried to reintroduce it to my diet. Removing wheat didn&#39;t help any of my many autoimmune diseases, though. Maybe I need to give it more time. I won&#39;t eat wheat again anyway. I don&#39;t miss it much. It&#39;s certainly not good enough to poison myself w/all that glyphosate. </p>

<p>Glad it&#39;s working so well for you, though!!</p>
