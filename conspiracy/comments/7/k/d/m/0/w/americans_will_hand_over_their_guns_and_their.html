<p>Two possibilities exist :</p>

<p>1) Government medical/legal marijuana will be offered in exchange for your right to bear arms/right to own a firearm
2) &#39;weed for guns&#39; (all marijuana, regardless of how or where it is grown) will sweep the country. Make love not war etc.</p>

<p>Many people may not want to give up their right to bear arms in exchange for legal weed. But how many people will want to? Think of all those who want to legally smoke weed but can&#39;t and who don&#39;t ever intend on carrying a firearm...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Hawaii you allow police access to your medical records in order to get a permit to purchase a firearm.  If you have ever seen a mental health professional in your lifetime you are required to get doctor clearance to own a firearm.  Kaiser never gives out clearance by policy.  Many doctors dont give clearance because of fear they will be held responsible for the actions of their patient.  The majority of denials for permits in Hawaii are for &quot;mental health&quot; reasons.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the point of the Second amendment is to be able to arm the people in order to overthrow a tyrannical government that is oppressing the people.  9/11 happened a while ago, who stood up then?  </p>

<p>Orwell&#39;s warning has now become reality.</p>

<p>So when are American&#39;s going to do it?
Or keep crying foul over the possibility of weapons being taken away just so said government can control them.. ignoring the fact your AR-15 won&#39;t mean much against a drone strike.
Meanwhile the weapons you hold so dear are just being used to kill yourselves.</p>

<p>Less guns, more weed seems like a recipe for a better (albeit sedated) society.. if the worst thing to happen is a national shortage of Doritos and no more mass shootings, who&#39;s the real loser?</p>

<p>The thing is, regardless of the &quot;what if&quot; game, it is wrong to deny others the right to defend themselves. It is also wrong to defer your own right and obligation to defend yourself to another. Those who wish to absolve their freedom in exchange for &quot;protection&quot; are dealing with mobsters and expecting a different outcome than outright violence and slavery. </p>

If it were, you&#39;d be targeting the main class of firearm related to gun deaths, which is handguns.

    <div class="md"><p>So, because a car is more likely to kill you, you should throw on a metal outfit and run around in a thunderstorm?  Assault rifles are less likely to kill people, so we should allow people to own any weapon at all they can get their hands on.

<p>When you say &quot;I don&#39;t think people should have access to. . .&quot;, I interpret that as &quot;I think it should be illegal to possess. . .&quot;  If you are proposing legislation, is it not important to clearly define the terminology?

<p>anything semi-auto</p>

<p>This would include most handguns.  You are proposing that the only acceptable firearms to own are; muzzleloaders, pump/lever action rifles/shotguns, and single action pistols.  That is absurd. </p>
