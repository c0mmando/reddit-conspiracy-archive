       We can see the start of this in Hawaii, where medical marijuana users are told they cannot carry a fire arm and be prescribed medical marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two possibilities exist :
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Government medical/legal marijuana will be offered in exchange for your right to bear arms/right to own a firearm
2) 'weed for guns' (all marijuana, regardless of how or where it is grown) will sweep the country. Make love not war etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people may not want to give up their right to bear arms in exchange for legal weed. But how many people will want to? Think of all those who want to legally smoke weed but can't and who don't ever intend on carrying a firearm...

       They want to get rid of guns.

       In Hawaii you allow police access to your medical records in order to get a permit to purchase a firearm.  If you have ever seen a mental health professional in your lifetime you are required to get doctor clearance to own a firearm.  Kaiser never gives out clearance by policy.  Many doctors dont give clearance because of fear they will be held responsible for the actions of their patient.  The majority of denials for permits in Hawaii are for "mental health" reasons.

       So the point of the Second amendment is to be able to arm the people in order to overthrow a tyrannical government that is oppressing the people.  9/11 happened a while ago, who stood up then?

       So when are American's going to do it?
Or keep crying foul over the possibility of weapons being taken away just so said government can control them.. ignoring the fact your AR-15 won't mean much against a drone strike.
Meanwhile the weapons you hold so dear are just being used to kill yourselves.

       Less guns, more weed seems like a recipe for a better (albeit sedated) society.. if the worst thing to happen is a national shortage of Doritos and no more mass shootings, who's the real loser?

       What if there is in the future, god forbid, and actual war on your homeland. Are you planning on relying on someone else to defend you? Or would you at least like the option to possibly defend yourself without resorting to an illegal black market?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, regardless of the "what if" game, it is wrong to deny others the right to defend themselves. It is also wrong to defer your own right and obligation to defend yourself to another. Those who wish to absolve their freedom in exchange for "protection" are dealing with mobsters and expecting a different outcome than outright violence and slavery.

       I'm not against guns.  I am kind of against assault rifles in particular, just because I don't see why anyone would need one.  I don't know what scenario you're positing here, I'm in the US, is Canada going to invade us and somehow the Army and the National Guard are wiped out and the only thing that can save the country are citizens with assault rifles?

       The second amendment does not recognize your right to hunt.  It recognizes the inherent right of self-preservation.  Police, the national guard, the army, they exist to protect Americans who cannot protect themselves.  Many Americans are quite capable of protecting themselves, and have a natural right to do so.

       I don't think its so cut and dried.  The second amendment doesn't let me build a bomb, or own a cannon.  I don't want my neighbor stockpiling rocket launchers no matter how good it makes him at protecting himself.  You have to draw the line somewhere, and I think my line doesn't include assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, silencers, a bunch of things that make people better at killing other people.

       My point is that I don't think people dying is your real motivation.  If it were, you'd be targeting the main class of firearm related to gun deaths, which is handguns.  According to FBI homicide statistics 2010-2014, rifles killed less people than knives, blunt objects, and personal weapons (hands, feet, ect.) but they're somehow the biggest problem?

       Then what is my real motivation?  What a weird insinuation, I'm not sure what you're getting at.  Maybe I just don't want to be at a concert when someone opens fire at the crowd and, thank god, they don't have to take too much time out of their busy day to stop and reload because their mags hold 40 rounds.

       But statistically, you have a far greater chance of being beat to death than shot by a rifle.  I find your position comparable to someone who is afraid of being struck by lightening, while also driving a car to work every day without a care.  What I'm getting at is that your proposed action against gun violence is out of touch with reality.

       So, because a car is more likely to kill you, you should throw on a metal outfit and run around in a thunderstorm?  Assault rifles are less likely to kill people, so we should allow people to own any weapon at all they can get their hands on.  People hardly ever die from grenades, should everyone be allowed to have as many grenades as they can find?  Should you be able to pick them up at a walmart gun counter?

       I don't think people should have access to high capacity magazines, assault rifles, silencers, anything semi-auto.  I'm guessing you're trying to be pedantic about assault rifle so I'd say any "assault weapon".  I don't see why anyone should be able to fire 60 rounds a minute.  I'm done talking about this.

       I'd rather be pedantic than ideologically inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say "I don't think people should have access to. . .", I interpret that as "I think it should be illegal to possess. . ."  If you are proposing legislation, is it not important to clearly define the terminology?  When you say "assault weapon", what specific weapons are you referring to?

       This would include most handguns.  You are proposing that the only acceptable firearms to own are; muzzleloaders, pump/lever action rifles/shotguns, and single action pistols.  That is absurd.
