       The Illuminati and Occult are psychic third eye brain intruding parasites. They steal energy from people and mentally terrorize their victims. They work in large groups and target individuals. Their leaders are fallen angels and royal and noble families manage these fallen angels. Angels and fallen angels have affinities with aspects of nature and biology. They are ruthless, murderous, sadistic, lying, false accusing, psychopaths. They invade minds and dictate lies onto people. They all hide behind religion and condemn their innocent victims as sinners. The Illuminati is their false light upward pyramid and the occult is their downward false dark pyramid. Those in the middle operate on both sides and are the most deceptive. They are the Illusionati. The Illuminati consume human blood both spiritually and physically. The Occult consume human flesh both spiritual and physical. That is the forbidden fruit. The Illuminati and Occult are psychic trespassers. They are dead inside and they leave their bodies which they call astral projection and trespass on others to steal energy. They are using technology to enhance their demonic telepathy like Chemtrails, HAARP, and the electronic grid. Their psychic abilities are demonic and satanic. They are not natural. Don't be deceived into thinking they are superior because they are not.
      </p>

       How to fight them. If you fight them they will attack you in large numbers. Stability is the key. I am tormented by them 24/7. They attack me daily with armies. Its not fun. Otherwise learn to keep away from them. They are extremely violent and evil.
      </p>

       The air is a like a pond and vibrations are like a stone thrown into the pond creating ripples and effects. Thoughts, the written word, the spoken word, and emotions are the vibrations and ripples in the sea of the atmosphere. Words are like swords or words can even be like medicine. Vibrations are weapons if used correctly. After tears comes the rain, after righteous anger comes thunder, and after joy comes sunshine. These are some of the mysteries of creation. This knowledge expands understanding. This understanding enables power. Having the will to fight is necessary to win against an opponent. The key in spiritual warfare is stability with willpower. Some refer to willpower as faith, confidence, or even the force or chi. Martial artists use the "Kaia" sound as a spiritual technique to enhance their physical attacks and strikes. This also correlates with vocal vibrations when combating wicked spirits. A strong vibration can cast wicked spirits into the underworld like a hammer hitting a nail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ju in Jujutsu refers to gentle and flexible. The gentle approach is underestimated and is subtle. This enables a person to maneuver and adapt with their enemies attacks and motions. This technique is most useful in written warfare. When you face written opposition the enemy often creates an opening for more attacks through their own words. This is mental Jujutsu. The law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. That means if you release energies from you body into the atmosphere they must have an equal and opposite reaction in the atmosphere. This carries over to the theory of sonics and the transmission of mechanical energy. The body is a biomechanical source of energy and vocalized words and emotions are the most powerful forces that the body transmits. Applying understanding and willpower to these natural concepts enhances a persons influences. This is sonic wave warfare.

       PARASITES DEMAND LOVE AND FORGIVENESS and falsely accuse you if you refuse or call them out on this.

       Jesuits and underwordly occult members use defilement, desecration, slander, and blasphemy or disrespect for attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Witches use seduction sex. They trespass on people if they have sexual energies because they feed off it. Witches are sexual sadists. They create energetic knots, binds, and chains in the physiology. They curse and slander people too in order to break down a persons spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freemasons and Kabbalists are builders. They construct psychic temples for idols like the fallen angels. They create mind control programs made up deceptions. Luciferian Freemasons are insane liars and brainwash people with these lies. They invade minds and drill lies into minds. They create mental walls, barriers, and blockages to keep society in ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazi Illuminati are militant and work with Amazon women which are also sexual sadists. Nazis use oppressive sex magic on people and are like pimps using sex gangster Amazons. They are also false teachers that make up insane and irrational teachings to attempt to incorporate their wickedness with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alchemists are trained in chemicals and the human physiology. They trespass on bodies and hack into their physiology. They work with foods and drugs. They engineered vaccines which are designed to target the nervous system which weakens a persons spiritual armor or electromagnetic field.

       Interesting, but i don't agree that psychic abilities is evil, that entirely depends on the person using it. Astral projection is just embedding your soul (which is made of plasma) into some kind of longitudinal EMF wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       You saying it's evil makes me think you are mixing truth with lies and are trying to redirect good people from great power that can help the world to fight evil.

       What? Astral projection is not about invading any bodies or minds, it's just remote viewing. You are just traveling without your body.

       No I am talking about leaving the body and trespassing on another. Those who can do this are either dead or half way dead. Zombies and vampires. Leaving your body is not natural or necessary and only enables corruption. It serves no other purpose.

       Sounds like you’ve had a run in with some negative spirits and you’ve twisted your brain in knots trying to rationalize it and are driving yourself crazy.

       The third eye is not the same as the natural inner eye used for personal thoughts, imaginations, and dreams. The third eye is a deep initiation into the dream realm. The third eye is located in the optic chiasm within the temporal lobe. These parasites persecute people from the temporal lobe to get people to submit to them.

       Personal thought or opinions is located at the left front of the brain.

       I just meditate. Speak my truth. Make (not forcibly, ha) people laugh. I sing and dance. I rid myself of parasites in my own life. Because I don't think that some people are even conscious of their parasitic behavior.

       Because all I know is that if you're aware of psychic powers, and you are using them to fuck up others people's, then you really don't understand your own psychic power. And that's sad to me.

       I really liked your post above but you are not doing your message a favour with this behaviour. You should know by now that blunt accusations and blame are methods "they" use to divide us.

       They didn’t say love and forgive them. They said spread love where we can.

       You are a highly damaged individual, seeking to spread love doesn’t mean to forgive or spare from punishment those that spread evil

       He has a messiah complex and doesn't want anyone else's experiences with these things to matter. Only he "the enlightened one" is allowed to have these abilities. When in reality they are available to all, but we just typically don't even know how to perceive it. We all have the process to put energy out into the universe. In fact, we all do it every day it's just whether we realize it, and what we direct it towards.

       The hosts aren't necessarily consciously aware that they are parasites, that's part of how they are able to propagate. There's vampires, the born and the turned, and then there are sleepers, who are in a type of hypnotic trance. The vast, vast majority of people are the sleepers, the 'dead' who are simultaneously hosts and parasites

       You know, I liked your post, but the way you are reacting to comments is the antithesis of what is written above. I can see why you feel like you are being attacked 24/7, and no doubt you will probably see me as a parasite. One look at your many replies to comments and I can see that you're accusing others of what you're doing yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I happen to agree with the idea that spiritual parasites exist and that the world is infested with them. Everyone here has spiritual parasites and that includes you. One of the manipulative behaviors these parasites exhibit is tricking the host into believing that the parasite and host's thoughts are one in the same, which can be extremely confusing and frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're showing me is that you are being tricked into believing that anyone who replies with a slight difference of opinion or a constructive piece of insight is a parasite. This is a very dangerous path. Without the ability to critically examine other opinions without feeling attacked, you in fact open yourself up to parasites that will feed on the spiritual vulnerability and victimhood that you're holding onto.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Ju in Jujutsu refers to gentle and flexible. The gentle approach is underestimated and is subtle. This enables a person to maneuver and adapt with their enemies attacks and motions. This technique is most useful in written warfare. When you face written opposition the enemy often creates an opening for more attacks through their own words. This is mental Jujutsu. The law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Feeling attacked every time you face written opposition is a sign of a victim mentality. Not only that, but in writing this post, you willingly opened yourself up to "attacks" and inevitably became reactionary with every single statement that was not in exact agreement with yours. If everyone's your enemy, you will never stop being in a reactionary, fight-or-flight state.
      </p>
      <p>
       "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." If this is really true, then you must admit that you invited "written opposition" on purpose with this post. If the comments are reflecting something back that you don't like, maybe you should examine your own behavior, not just the other person's.
      </p>
      <p>
       . You can see me as a parasite doing mental Jiu Jitsu all you want. All I'm asking is that you critically think about what you are saying and what others are saying. Understand that you, nor anyone else, is impermeable to false thinking.

       Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism talk all about spiritual wickedness, demons, fallen angels, and other unseen concepts yet because I break things down more you persecute me with slander. You will continue to ignore the fact that religions all talk about these things. This is how they operate and this is why I know you are insincere and one of them.

       What kind of attacks are you experiencing?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW the only way you can be attacked is if you allow yourself to be attacked. Human souls are much much stronger than astral parasites, that's why they are parasites. You probably are feeding it negative emotions, take responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend strengthening your aura (biofield) and remove any negative entities.

       More false teachings. Like saying innocent women and children murdered by bombs in wars were because they allowed it to happen. You just used a perfect example of a false teaching used to brainwash others. You people on here are a good example of their nature, lies, deceptions, and manipulative tactics.

       Do you experience any of the emotions in the list below?
      </p>
      <p>
       Blaming others, anger, sense of victimisation,  paranoia, fear, guilt, feeling deprived, worry,  feeling sorry for yourself, bothered by being lonely,  self-depreciation, feeling unworthy/not good enough,  lack of motivation, insecurity, impatience, resentment,  jealousy, depression, feeling disgusted, neediness,  feeling unappreciated, feeling irritated, feeling trapped,  head in the clouds, denial of darkness, avoidance of reality,  everything’s got to be perfect, controlling.
      </p>

       I'm suspecting you have a weak aura based on the paranoia and hostility you are showing. Aura (biofield) is certainly not any new age bullshit and it can be measured and explained by science.

       he got my curiosity, but now has my attention. I've been looking into kundalini awakening for awhile now, and I still haven't taken the plunge due to some personal reservations, but I'm interested in hearing his counter argument. Btw, have you had yours awakened?

       Yeah, same. He seems to think anything regarding spirituality is evil, that's a pretty sad mindset. Worship (religions) is evil not spirituality.

       Spirituality can be explained by solid math and science. Check out Dan Winters work.

       Kundalini leads to an expanded state of consciousness, bliss and love if you are able to control it.

       You can't even get your story straight and are mixing things ideas and philosophies together and then doubling down and attacking anyone that can't follow your none sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't balanced and can't even decipher what is real and what is not. Take a break and relax a bit dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like you've opened yourself up to some negativity because of the negativity you're putting out. Perhaps meditate a bit and come back with a balanced state of mind because you seem quite frazzled and scatter brained in this thread and are not very coherent with your thoughts and comments.
      </p>

       Wish you the best but your thread is a fucking shit show and half the things you say make no sense whatsoever.

       I'm a bit conflicted on what dude is preaching. On one hand, the truth is stranger than fiction and I've stumbled across some of the rabbit holes he's mentioning such as official psychic research and the like. On the other hand, what makes him so convinced that what he thinks is "good/evil" is accurate? Life in general is extremely complex and not really easily polarized in such a black/ white fashion.

       Yeah, same here man. He is speaking a lot of truth (what i think is truth) regarding how the NWO system works but damn he's negative. And i don't agree with his opinion on psychic abilities, intuition and clairvoyance could be considered a psychic ability and i definitely don't think that's evil. It all depends on the person.

       The CIA is made up of people, just like the regular population. Their members are not immune to insanity or retardation. Just because a bunch of retards decided to investigate outlandish things in their paranoia-driven pursuit for power and control, doesnt make those things real. "The CIA studied it so it must be real" is not an argument. All the same applies for the Thule Society amongst the National Socialists. Videos and articles posted by schizos similar to you are not proof or evidence of anything and never have been. Shows on television are even less so, knowing what kind of dumb shit the media pumps out for the common mouthbreather. The fact that you consider disagreement with your insanity as a threat to your livelihood is just more evidence for you being insane.

       Yes they would. But there is no evidence they found anything. Every time someone brings up the CIA, they just say, "they looked into it", as if that's prove. They never tell you that the CIA found jack fucking shit. Sure, maybe they covered up what they found. But until you have any evidence that isn't pure speculation, this is a meaningless discussion and common sense and occams razor take precedence.

       The "psychic parasites" he speaks of are indeed very real. Just because we've come up with a name for these "mental illnesses" doesn't mean we know what the hell we're talking about.

       Modern(mainstream) science still doesn't understand the origin, capabilities, or, purpose of consciousness, there have been many many in this world who are given no platform for which to credibly speak this information, it's still valuable information, nonetheless. Nassim Haramein, for instance has some incredible theories that can be backed by quantum physics as well.

       Neither do you. Just because mainstream science can't explain something, doesn't mean you automatically can, unless of course you have evidence. Do you have evidence for psychic parasites? If so, please provide it.

       Show me some links for what you are referring to. I think I have heard of this fellow before, from what I've seen, he just writes papers with elementary equations thrown in to wow laymen, but doesn't actually explain anything and his theories fall apart under the simplest scrutiny of people who actually have a deeper understanding of physics. Also, it is not enough for you to say, "look at this guy, he knows the answers". Can
       <em>
        you

       explain these things to me, or provide any evidence, even simple evidence to support your claims? If not, then how can you claim to have any

       It's where tcraft we're taken after Roswell. The underground of that base is double the size of the city it's in. I know, I've seen the above ground entrances with the signs warning of "authorized use of force." My friends family, have been working at this base for close to 50 years. What he told me is mind blowing, it would induce panic if it were ever to be uttered on live television. The simple fact of the matter is each member of my friends family has verrrry high clearance, and I'd trust these people with my life. Good, hardworking people with families, and struggles of their own. I've posted before about my friend and his disclosure to me. I will not name, or reveal any more than that.

       What do I have to gain from spreading disinformation? I'm just like you, I'm searching for the "truth " the difference is I don't run away when my ego can't handle new information. I'm not a paid bot, shill, or anything. I'm a 23 year old human being who has studied and researched all these topics for 8+years and every time I come across someone like you, I just giggle. You, my friend do not know what I know. I don't hold this knowledge to make me "speshul" or more important than anyone, but the sources they come from do make this information pretty damning. Just look up Archons and that's the basic idea of what's going on, now the SCALE of these claims, I do not know. But I have nothing to gain from lying to anyone. I just want to get as much of the truth as out there as possible.

       I can handle new information just fine, I even crave it. I just have a much higher standard for what I consider "evidence" or "proof". Hearsay from random humans is not evidence or proof of anything.

       If what you know comes from such incredible sources such as people you happen to know, and in the form of such high standards as "hearsay", then I doubt you truly know anything. Or your definition of the word "know" is wildly different from mine and the dictionary's.

       I'm with you on this. Crazy as it all seems I think your more or less right. I was attacked by "entities" twice. I'm not trolling, I'm not schizophrenic. I "made waves" at a cult I worked for (as an outsider) and was quite literally attacked by shadow entities. It was totally unexpected. One was even a full body apparition. It scared the shit out of me. Like I could feel it feeding off my terror through my eyes. This stuff is real and I fear the rabbit hole goes much deeper than most of us can begin to comprehend.

       Area 51 is blocked via astral projection. The government knows about this ability heavily and also knows how to keep you from visiting certain places.... just throwing some facts out there.

       On another note, you can do the same (blocking them from visiting your house) during sleep you are most vulnerable. You can also attack them back if you are able to AP.

       I read somewhere that lining your room with Aluminum foil would help. But who wants a room full of aluminum foil.... there’s other methods I’ve forgotten but just research how to stop AP attacks or spiritual attacks. You will find it

       Because you're literally being a hypocrite and attacking everyone else that is calling out your bullshit. Half the things you comment about you don't even seem to grasp the full picture and you're stuck in a fearful cycle that is playing itself out in your head. You seem to conflate love and positivity with support for "them" whatever the fuck that means and can't even get the concept of astral projection right and have mixed up possession and astral projection. It seems like you need to do more research because you totally blew it in this thread and attacked half the people in here.

       If you were to take meter measurements and have thermal imaging of where you feel pain, you would realize that where you feel pain is being attacked.  See the meters wikis, meter report wikis and thermal imaging wiki in

       This is why you have demons haunting you. There is but 1 who demons cower in fear of, and 1 who can save your soul. The word is my sword and my shield, the Bible lays all of this out very clearly and just the mention of Jesus name will cause them to flee. Try having some faith and pray to be rid of these pests. It will work, or go live your life in denial and be haunted by satanic spirits I mean you do you bro.

       The Bible is the Bible. People use good thing for bad reasons all the time. The Bible is God's love letter to you. I am a Christian but I don't go TO Church because yes, man has corrupted the message, but if you have a personal relationship just you and God there is no interference. You are saying God's word isn't a useful tool because corrupt men use it to make money and twists it's words and messages. Be that is it may, don't put your trust in men, put it in God and he will never let you down. Your argument is super weak and your talking like a schizo with that logic.

       People on here keep using it to defend the wicked and influence people to submit their souls in order to not be attacked. The mafia uses tactics like that. They threaten, attack, and extort people into submission. Once they submit they leave them alone overall. There is your salvation right?

       The one time I was attacked strongly and consciously realized it was an attack, was during the Eclipse in early 2017, this awful creature invaded my consciousness for three days straight and would not leave me alone. It was this undead thing that looked like a living corpse sitting in a throne in front of tacky gold curtains, it was wearing a crown and it's skin was black. It seemed to be hooked into some kind of machinery keeping it alive maybe. I got the sense that it had blue blood

       I think you may be suffering from some form of paranoid schizophrenia.
      </p>

       Please don't read this and think that I'm saying this to discredit or put you down in anyway, that couldn't be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist either, so take my opinion for what it is worth, but something about your post and comments is giving me a gut feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have experience being hyper paranoid before, so I can kind of understand the thought process and feelings that make these sort of things "make sense" to the person experiencing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should consider getting some help / an evaluation from somebody you believe you can trust.

       hey OP, I'm sorry you are being tormented, and I will pray.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is one God, he is more powerful than all other beings. He sent his son Jesus, and he showed us that Jesus is sent by God by raising him from the dead, by performing many miracles in the sight of eyewitnesses, and by giving us prophecy that Jesus would come many centuries before he came. Because God is good, and because he is powerful, he is able to preserve his word. He has left Scripture for us, and since the beginning mankind has not been able to separate us from that Scripture. Mankind has certainly spoken ill of the Scripture, and used the Scripture for evil, but no man can undo the work of God, and so the Scripture remains. I know that you do not believe, but please understand, there are many forces acting on your mind. Please, call out to God, who is good, who hears you. There is a good God, and there is no reason to be separated from him! Please seek him, so that your torment and your troubles can begin to be healed. You're awesome OP. I hope you are okay. See ya

       Yeah, same. He seems to think anything regarding spirituality is evil, that's a pretty sad mindset. Worship (religions) is evil not spirituality.

       Spirituality can be explained by solid math and science. Check out Dan Winters work.

       Yes they would. But there is no evidence they found anything. Every time someone brings up the CIA, they just say, "they looked into it", as if that's prove. They never tell you that the CIA found jack fucking shit. Sure, maybe they covered up what they found. But until you have any evidence that isn't pure speculation, this is a meaningless discussion and common sense and occams razor take precedence.

       Got it, so no evidence then. I have a top ranking CIA buddy who assures me nothing you just wrote is true. Trust me. I trust him with my life. He is a vet too and a really good person. I wont name him though, too risky of course. Youre just gonna have to trust me.

       Nothing, I never accused you of being malicious. Just gullible perhaps.

      <p>
       I can handle new information just fine, I even crave it. I just have a much higher standard for what I consider "evidence" or "proof". Hearsay from random humans is not evidence or proof of anything.

      <p>
       If what you know comes from such incredible sources such as people you happen to know, and in the form of such high standards as "hearsay", then I doubt you truly know anything. Or your definition of the word "know" is wildly different from mine and the dictionary's.

      <p>
       I've read about Archons and the Demiurge on more than one occasion. I have yet to see any actual evidence for either. I can find tons of things written about all this stuff. Just never any
