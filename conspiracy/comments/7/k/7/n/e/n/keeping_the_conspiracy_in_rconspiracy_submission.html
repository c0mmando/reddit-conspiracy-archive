        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">105</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has moved well beyond the 500k subscriber mark, it&#39;s only natural that a &quot;controversial&quot; sub like this has become a battleground of sorts, as the widening political rift in society has brought all the accompanying drama and discord.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is in danger of going the route of the rest of the &quot;major&quot; subs on reddit: full of spam and troll accounts, echo chambers, and little room for legitimate discourse.</p>

<p>After all: <em>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination.</em></p>

<p>The spammers are getting as brazen as they are numerous...they&#39;re easy to spot too: they often have 2-month-old accounts (or thereabouts), they post one or two generic comments in a sub like <a href="/r/AskReddit">/r/AskReddit</a>, and then they repost a previously popular story on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> from a blog spam site, and this post (usually their first) rockets to the top of the sub almost immediately.</p>

<p>Because the #1 spot on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has the chance to reach a very wide audience, this type of behavior has been increasing dramatically, and the mods have correspondingly acted more aggressively to combat it.</p>

<p>One of the other main issues as of late is the sheer increase in political troll/spam accounts. While &quot;politics&quot; as a whole absolutely has a connection to &quot;conspiracy&quot;, it would go against the nature of the sub (which cherishes the free flow of information) to outright ban posts of a political nature.</p>

<p>After all, this stipulation would create a huge burden on the mods, and open us up to even more attacks as we become the arbiters of what or what is not a &quot;political&quot; topic.</p>

<p>Instead, we are entertaining the possibility of requiring a type of &quot;submission statement&quot; for every link post. </p>

<p>As for what this will look like, we&#39;re not entirely sure (hence this discussion).</p>

<p>At the very least, requiring a submission statement would compel OP to not only read the article, but summarize it for the benefit of the rest of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>This would cut down on the output from serial spammers (and make them even easier to spot), as well as from those who post purely non-conspiratorial content/news.</p>

<p>Now, we should be careful to not <em>require</em> an <em>obvious</em> connection to a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, as that term is so loaded (and has essentially lost much of its meaning) that this requirement would open the sub up to further abuse of the tired &quot;where&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; trope.</p>

<p>Instead, this potential rule would require OP to provide <em>some</em> sort of justification for posting a link in this sub, and that justification should be more eloquent than &quot;well, it&#39;s politics!&quot;</p>

<p>As for how this statement should be submitted, the title and the comment section are the two options (and can both be used).</p>

<p>It helps combat against the clickbaitization of article titles when OP includes the thesis (or more context) in the title itself. This would also significantly improve the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> browsing experience.</p>

<p>Since the title has a character limit, OP could also include a sentence or two after submitting the post. This &quot;submission statement&quot; should be in OP&#39;s own words, and should provide context and justification for being posted in this sub.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this requirement wouldn&#39;t apply to <em>self</em> posts, as self posts are meant to be their own justification (those that aren&#39;t get removed under rule 12).</p>

<p>For example, many folks reach out to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for help or advice, and <em>requiring</em> some sort of conspiracy would discourage these posts and open them up to the &quot;where&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; forum sliding tactic.</p>

<p>Something needs to be done to simultaneously keep <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> true to its roots as well as keep it healthy and well-equipped for the future. </p>

<p>This sub is awesome and it deserves to thrive!</p>

<p>Any feedback is welcome and encouraged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics are conspiracies are intrinsically intertwined, but we sure do get a whole hell of a lot of reposts that would be better suited for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>... and seem to only be posted to stir up controversy and division.

<p>Agreed, but the real issue is that these posts get pushed to the top by users from subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and most comments from legitimate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users who don&#39;t wish to join the current circle-jerk and buried. </p>

<p>Are you really going to argue semantics when a powerful pedophile was exposed. </p>

<p>So you do not think a political pedophile taken take down by his crimes is a valid topic around here? Or you didn&#39;t like it because he was a Republican? </p>

<p>Honestly, I do not trust mods to be fully non-partisan. The way the contest mode, and misleading title has be used negative Trump stories lately sets of a red flag for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that it&#39;s confusing for you, but if you base your analysis on their actions, eg the McCarthyism of the Dems, stance towards the press, anti immigration policies, further arming police, bailing out corporates and banks during the 2008 crisis through today, war on terror (including arming ISIS), etc. I see the Dems well to the right of Trump, whose right-posturing is partly just token culture war issues that are blown way out of proportion.</p>

<p>And, at least so far, the DNC is substantially more pro-war than Trump, making them further right in many different ways. It could be argued they have simply joined the Republicans and they are identical, but the facts I laid out still stand. </p>

<p>Why not just put a ban on account under 6 month old, and if new users want to participate they can ask the mods to un-ban them and tag them as new users.  It would be easier to remove them, than have a comment that justifies their post.  I can literally make up a conspiracy about anything and it&#39;s it still removed, then claim the mods will allow other conspiracies but won&#39;t allow my BS one.

<p>Thanks for the thoughtful post - I agree wholeheartedly on most points except one - the <em>term</em> conspiracy theory has now been expanded to allow (by whom, another elephant for a different day I suppose) political tweets about Paul Ryan&#39;s early retirement. Until you change the definition back there&#39;s no other way to &#39;keep conspiracy about conspiracies.&#39;</p>

<p>I&#39;d personally <em>love</em> at least one day a week for self-posts. I agree making everything self-posts all at once would be too drastic, but a once a week thing (or twice a week, weekends?) would allow for everyone to see how it goes.</p>

<p>People could still post links in their posts, but they&#39;d actually have to add something of substance, or summarize the article, or both. Same general idea as your OP, but it all has to be in self-post form.</p>

<p>If anything it could be a nice break from all the political links throughout the week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far I have done my best to resist any barrier to entry but shit is out of hand.  As a test of reasonableness I went thru a few posts from the past 7 days or so, and I think you have a great point.  </p>

<p>There are regulars on here whose opinion I wholeheartedly and passionately disagree with but those posts are among my favorites because they serve as checks and balances to some of the outlandish shit I am into.  What truly bogged me down, however, was the weight of the repetitive posts with no conspiracy whatsoever. </p>

<p>The common theme with many of these posts (but not all) is that you see a run of the same OP posting a cut and paste of the exact same post on numerous subreddits in a rapid fire succession.  </p>

<p>When I post I want to know what other people are posting, I am definitely not trying to school anyone in anything as much as I am trying to go to school, so if I post I want to know what other people say, what sources they have, etc.</p>

<p>To fix the problem I was having, being so tired of having to skip over these posts,  I was looking to see if there was some sort of orphan post identifier I could find, something that would show if someone drops a post and never returns to said post to see what sort of response there is or what discussion they have generated.  If I could back burner those posts  I would be happier, but alas no idea how to do this.  </p>

<p>Yours is the best idea Ive heard so far.  I am starting to develop a sort of conspiracy malaise, and it is not due to my questioning the validity of the conspiracies but the validity of a small subset of bad actors.  To paraphrase, Democracy Dies in Darkness (or D.C., I dont remember the exact quote, still a tad buzzed from Friday) Fortunately sort by NEW takes care of some of this, but when I drop into other tabs to see whats going on, say CONTROVERSIAL, I notice I am missing alot.  And I very much agree with the this sub is awesome statement.  There are people who post here whose beliefs are so opposite of mine I can&#39;t fathom how we are the same species but at the same time if I lost their input I would be lost myself. </p>

<p>Well said. I think you hit the nail on the head. The problem isn&#39;t that organic content needs to be improved, it&#39;s that people come here in bad faith and conduct organized attacks against sincere contributors. It&#39;s intentional and the fact that we see them turn it on and off like a switch is just another confirmation as to what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>It ruins the sub and steals your energy while trying to filter through it and even more so if you get dragged into it. People don&#39;t like how this makes them feel and they stop coming to the sub. Then it&#39;s mission accomplished; Dissemination of information thwarted. </p>

<p>I think mods should be less tolerant against this pattern of behavior. In their defense, the housecleaning they did recently was along these lines and it&#39;s been effective. I&#39;m sure they are already back building up profiles for the next batch of accounts, but I don&#39;t care so long as they aren&#39;t shitting in the sub like it&#39;s their job.</p>

<p>So imagine a college physics professor being asked to teach first graders: incredibly annoying! Those of us who have lived conspiracy theory all our lives are that professor - those of us who come to doubt, to taunt, distract, belittle, shove around, and generally betray ignorance of the very real-world consequences we study, are the first graders.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You raise a good point here, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been mulling over myself. The issue with the mainstreaming of conspiracy as it&#39;s happened is that many people haven&#39;t really found their way here in the same way I think many of us have. For us, it was either an event like 9/11, or a series of them, or just reading the history of the Fed or the CIA or something like that. And it drove us to dig deeper.</p>

<p>This new wave of people (not all of them) who came in since the election seem much more interested in scoring a political point for &quot;their&quot; team, or even more often, just against the &quot;other&quot; team. They don&#39;t really want to learn anything that doesn&#39;t go against they&#39;re preconceived notions or ideological positions, most of which they&#39;ve just taken fully from some outlet like MSNBC or FOX. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it is not only good, it is essential.</p>

<p>First, understand that many (most?) most people have <em>no idea</em> what the terms <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/conspiracy?s=t"><strong>&quot;conspiracy&quot;</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/conspiracy-theory?s=t"><strong><em>&quot;conspiracy theory&quot;</em></strong></a> actually mean. </p>

<p>Many people have been misled to believe that a &quot;conspiracies&quot; are unproven and unprovable <em>crack-pot &quot;theories&quot;</em> that have no substantial supporting evidence, and that have been rejected by &quot;authoritative&quot; figures and other so-called &quot;rationally minded&quot; people.</p>

<p>This misconception did not happen by accident.</p>

<p>Following the assassination of JFK and the release of the Warren Commission Report, the CIA launched a covert propaganda campaign to attack anyone who questioned the validity of that report:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_influence_on_public_opinion#Influencing_public_opinion_abroad">From Wiki:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>An April 1967 dispatch from CIA headquarters said: <strong>&quot;Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization</strong>, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to <strong>provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists</strong>, so as to inhibit circulation of such claims in other countries.&quot;[17] The Agency instructed its stations around the world to <strong>&quot;discuss the publicity problem with liaison and friendly elite contacts, especially politicians and editors&quot;</strong> and &quot;employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics. <strong>Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.&quot;</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a link to an image of the original article published in the NY Times, Dec 26, 1977: 
(Warning: PDF) <a href="http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/C%20Disk/CIA%20Reporters%20New%20York%20Times%20Series%2012-25-77/Item%2008.pdf"><strong>&quot;Cable Sought to Discredit Critics of Warren Report&quot;</strong></a></p>

<p>But of course, the effort to smear these &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as &quot;kooks&quot; and &quot;nut cases&quot; also targeted domestic audiences, with many US media organs playing a major role in the defaming and ridiculing. </p>

<p>Given this concerted effort, it is little wonder that the <em>perceived definition</em> of these terms has become twisted in the public mindset.</p>

<p>Moreover, the <strong><em>name</em></strong> of this sub may be &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, but it is not and has never been limited to narrow subject matter qualified as &quot;conspiratorial&quot;. It is also an important forum where news and information that is misrepresented or repressed elsewhere can be posted and discussed without fear of censorship by those who are driven by underlying political or other agendas.</p>

<p>To me, the preservation of Free Speech is <strong><em>the</em></strong> most valuable part of the sub, and I&#39;m certain that many others would agree.</p>

<p>Maybe because so many people have been banned here via mod abuse. I mean, we did have mods that trolled people with alts and then banned them. We have also had mods who simply ban people for not supporting trump enough.</p>

<p>This also explains the number of subscriptions. Easy to ratchet those up when you keep banning the same people and they create new accounts in order to be able to participate.</p>

<p>I usually try to put one or two paragraphs from the article as my first reply in my thread. Helps to sum things up imho or at least give people a feel for the article. </p>

<p>I agree with that. A good start was made earlier this year. This is a two way street. Posters can try harder to be more civil, explain themselves and their posts more, and help track what they believe to be spam.</p>

<p>On the other side, maybe consider more strict policies when it comes to banning people (just saw a mod threaten someone in a thread earlier saying the poster better be careful or he/she might see their post as spam - it was a politically charged reply critical of trump). I report when people blatantly call other shills but not sure it matters most the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put everything in contest mode.  Mods did it before and were accused of bias, but they did it selectively.  Do it for everything and you can&#39;t be accused of bias.  </p>

<p>If you wish to stop unwanted behavior you need to understand why that behavior occurs.  This sub gets brigaded by people who want to push their chosen narrative and suppress counter-narratives.  Contest mode simply reorders top level comments randomly instead of by votes, and hides vote count on comments.  No opinions are censored, and there are no additional barriers to participation.  It just makes brigading ineffective because brigades can no longer control the discussion with targeted voting.  Remove their reason for coming here and they will stop coming here.</p>

<p>I think submission statements for link posts are good as well, but that really addresses one symptom and not the underlying problem.  If they can&#39;t control the comment section, they have less reason to push posts to the front page.</p>

<p>I disagree that it would discourage high effort comments.  The only way it would do that is if people are only putting effort into comments in order to get upvotes.</p>

<p>As for people spamming low effort comments, they are much less effective than being able to brigade the chosen narrative to the top and suppress other viewpoints.  Their goal then becomes disruption rather than control.  In my opinion, that is a better problem to have.</p>

<p>My opinion on this is that someone is false flagging to make it look like t_d is responsible. This behavior has been caught and reported multiple times here, and it still continues.  They don&#39;t change tactics.  They make no attempt to disguise what they are doing, even though it would be simple to do so.  Ether they are really stupid, or they want to get caught.  My money is on the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think it’s a terrible idea? </p>

<p>Shooting it down with no context or no statements expounding on why you think it’s terrible reads similarly to the same link posts being considered for requiring a bit of detail from the OP. </p>

<p>I know you’ve been around for a while and contribute regularly, which is why I’m asking. I don’t see how the requirement of something resembling a very brief summary creates censorship. </p>

<p>If the OP can’t be bothered with providing what is essentially a TLDR/DW about their submission, it probably doesn’t need to be here. Similarly, if they’ve read/watched it already, taking an extra minute to provide minimal context as to how it relates as a conspiracy is basically creating the beginnings of discussion and/or generating interest for others to read/watch and participate. </p>

<p>New is often slammed with posts that equate to spam. If the requirement of a TLDR/DW ups the quality of discussion while also slowing down the spammers, it’s a win for the sub. </p>

<p>As for how this statement should be submitted, the title and the comment section are the two options (and can both be used).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree that the title alone should count as a submission statement, for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s going to make the requirements less clear to users. We&#39;ll have users arguing that they <em>did</em> give a submission statement in the title, and I think it will ultimately add more subjectivity to our enforcement. It will also make automating any part of this strictly impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the submission statement should be at least a couple sentences, and it wouldn&#39;t necessarily make a good title. I see the two as being fundamentally different: the title should say <em>what</em> the content is, and the statement should say <em>why</em> it belongs here. Although of course, the user can also add the why to the title.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>Here is how I&#39;d propose the wording of the new rule:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all link posts, we require a submission statement in the form of a comment explaining why the link belongs in this sub, made no later than x minutes after the post.</p>

<p>And we can decide on x, but 10 or 15 minutes would seem fair. </p>

Submission statement and link in the body of the post and the title can be the article headline/subject of the conspiracy.

<p>This is it for me too. Because, many times the post will be a link to a FoxNews story about Saudi Arabia, and OP will title the post something like, &quot;Links to Saudi involvement in Las Vegas becoming more evident&quot;, with no other commentary from OP.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ll ask OP if they, themselves, think the Saudis are behind it??? And if it was even real??? Because in one case it was a mod who posted it. And OP will say, &quot;not sure&quot;. So, OP had added <em>more</em> shit about Saudi re: Vegas (fake angle) that had already flooded the sub for days. Not a fan of that.</p>

<p>While I love to see coverage of political conspiracies, it seems like there have been a lot of posts over the last several months that have just been based in purely partisan politics. </p>

<p>The posts about Franken&#39;s sexual abuse didn&#39;t seem to rise to a conspiracy to me, since it didn&#39;t really seem like anybody conspired to cover it up. Also seen a lot of posts about how &quot;x% of Alabama voters voted for a pedo!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I mean neither of these really seemed to imply a conspiracy, as much play off some tangential connection to pizzagate since both involved an element of sexual abuse. Would be really nice to cut down on the partisan cheering and jeering</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how many times can i upvote this?!?!?</p>

<p>pleasepleaseplease give the submission statement thing a shot.  r/TrueReddit doesn&#39;t seem to enforce the rule all that vigorously but its enough to keep shtposts/low-effort posts down.  and the r/TrueReddit community seems to usually downvote low-effort submission statements.</p>

<p>there will be some headaches and conflicts and drama while the r/conspiracy mods &amp; community figures out what constitutes a non-low-effort submission statement, but it&#39;ll be better in the long run than the current situation.</p>

<p>I mean, maybe it should apply. &quot;OMG we have slightly more than my assumed average traffic on the sub, looks like <em>they</em> are on shift amirite?&quot; posts are everywhere, and the only reason they don&#39;t explicitly violate rule 10 is because they don&#39;t openly explain the conspiracy they are referencing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno man, I think things are fine. This is after seeing people in this thread who only post partisan stuff claiming the sub needs to be fixed. Presumably to ban more leftists because only leftists are shills, amirite?</p>

<p>If you want to do things and demonize 2 month old accounts, no one can stop you. </p>

<p>One thing that kinda begs to be asked... &quot;Serial spammers&quot;? Some of these &quot;spammers&quot; do get banned but only some of them ever get unbanned. Some repeat offenders constantly getting temporary bans. I just don&#39;t see it as fair.</p>

<p>Especially since a lot of those unbanned accounts end up harassing others or serial spamming anyway. </p>

<p>Oh well, whatever you do. This sub is already great. It doesn&#39;t need a Trump slogan stolen from Reagan to make it great again. It&#39;s cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite honestly it has been too easy to post on this sub which I understand is by design. In theory we should be able to freely post our ideas and opinions and let the natural communicative process run its course. If people disgree with or dislike something it can be discussed and if something is simply intellectually void of substance it can be shuffled to the bottom. Shills and Spammers though take advantage of our free thought and voice and intentionally take control of what they can. They can&#39;t control what is said but they can control how much it is read and what people say about it. </p>

<p>Part of combating this is spending time cultivating meaningful contributions and ensuring what is posted serves the purpose of discussing conspiracies. I believe submission statements would help do that. Take the power away from the shills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think events of the past two years have forced a new sense of urgency onto the tending of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Collectively, due in part to sites like Reddit, it seems the public has become more aware of the extent to which they have been and are being propagandized, lied to, and manipulated at alarming depths. &quot;Fake news&quot; is simply a new label for propaganda techniques that began being formulated over a hundred years ago. When you read things like the first paragraph of Edward Bernays&#39; <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">Propaganda (1928)</a> it really puts things into perspective as how pervasive conspiracy really is historically and currently. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> historically dealt with individual and specific conspiracies whereas now we see macro level narrative creation and reinforcement more pervasive and entrenched than previously thought. As a result more events with controlled narratives can be viewed as conspiracy so &quot;where&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; when listening to the government and mainstream media is becoming, &quot;where <em>isn&#39;t it?</em>&quot; with a necessary expansion of what a conspiracy is. </p>

<p>I know the charge can be leveled, &quot;To a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail&quot; but before Edward Snowden, much of what was discussed here was dismissed as &quot;tin foil hat&quot; stuff without much regard. It&#39;s like the line from the movie, <em>Men in Black</em>,  &quot;500 years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was flat. And 15 minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you&#39;ll know tomorrow.&quot; - four years ago most people would have never believed the extent to which the government spied on them. Two years ago the term &quot;fake news&quot; hadn&#39;t entered the national conversation. Ten months ago we didn&#39;t know <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world/">Palantir</a> existed. Many would say Palantir isn&#39;t a conspiracy, just people doing business. Who is to say it is or isn&#39;t? Posting is often that question in itself.  </p>

<p>I like the requirement that OPs actually read articles they post. I&#39;m sad to know that isn&#39;t something people always do.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents. I know it won&#39;t be easy policing this sub. Good luck to you all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d help but only if you do it for all topics. Though for more politically charged stuff, maybe a sub specifically for it? ATS has different sections so nothing&#39;s encroaching (like, for example, an influx of US politics theories drowning out other discussion topics).</p>

<p>For me, the big problem on this sub is the downvoting and harassment of others. It seems if you don&#39;t follow the exact mentality and mindset of most of those who have been on this sub for years (whether because of different ideologies or just a firmer grip on reality), you get downvoted to oblivion and called a shill for not believing that &quot;vaccines were created on Mars by George Soros riding a unicorn to kill off bagels&quot; or whatever.</p>

<p>In that case, we should start a wiki of what is a recognized topic for this sub, and maybe start using mandatory post flairs?<br/>
That would - in the long run - allow a list of noteworthy posts in this wiki...<br/>

<p>I think that a lot of things such as Qanon posts or ongoing conspiracies will result in cookie cutter / copy paste statements just to fulfill arbitrary supporting statement requirements.

<p>Are the admins getting on your case because of the size? </p>

<p>Are advertisers getting on the admin&#39;s case because of the sub&#39;s size? </p>

<p>Are we going to start being sanitized because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t safe for Big Pharma and Big Oil to run their ads in this space and is this sub at risk for being delinted, demoted, or restricted because of this? </p>

<p>Are independent moderators of large subs being conscripted into conformity with this &quot;safe for all advertisers&quot; hostile take over of the net?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you love conspiracy’s. Are you someone who tends to lean A little to the right. If so you’re in for a ride. Don’t waste your time with this portion of Reddit.
Thanks to unscrupulous mods and A rather large and dedicated army of troll accounts this has become a grey area of Reddit. In my experience in what little time I’ve spent here I have now considered leaving Reddit in it’s entirety. That it should be so uncomfortable to share ones views and or opinions is just not acceptable unfortunately that’s what has become of  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>
I can prove without A doubt I have been singled out and strongly believe I’m only one of many more here who have been. I’ve recorded this proof of fuckery for a period of 4 days now at the time of this post. Furthermore I had not ever broken any rules until shortly before writing this post and which prompted me to do so. I’ve had a post removed by breaking rule 8. All in all my post provoked this response all while still remaining in the guidelines of the rules In and of itself being A test as it were and in fact conspiratorial leaning post to try and trigger some sort of response by mods and others. It worked out in my favour giving credence to my beliefs and suspicions. To my amazement I was ultimately lied to in the end when inquiring about censorship and confronting the mod in question about motive who might I add is not to quick on the draw. 
Bias much.<br/>

<p>This is it for me too. Because, many times the post will be a link to a FoxNews story about Saudi Arabia, and OP will title the post something like, &quot;Links to Saudi involvement in Las Vegas becoming more evident&quot;, with no other commentary from OP.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ll ask OP if they, themselves, think the Saudis are behind it??? And if it was even real??? Because in one case it was a mod who posted it. And OP will say, &quot;not sure&quot;. So, OP had added <em>more</em> shit about Saudi re: Vegas (fake angle) that had already flooded the sub for days. Not a fan of that.</p>
