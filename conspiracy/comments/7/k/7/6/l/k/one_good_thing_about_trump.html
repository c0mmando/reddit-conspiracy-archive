<p>Not <em>my</em> outrage. Some people hate Trump because he comes across as an arrogant loudmouth asshole. Many others find him funny. Personally, I think he&#39;s exactly what the American public deserves.</p>

<p>What the hell does that stupid billionaire know about economics?</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t handing out pamphlets as a community organizer.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get my economic advice from &quot;1%-GDP Obama&quot; when I get my medical advice from a stripper at a peep show.</p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;m sorry. The GDP in America is now 4% under the new administration--after just one year of the &quot;stupidity&quot; of this &quot;rube,&quot; as you call him. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll take the &quot;stupidity&quot; of the wealth-generating billionaire over the 1%-GDP growth of the TPP-pimping penniless community organizer any day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama was constitutional lawyer and law professor who was far from penniless. Meanwhile, Trump is a con man known for being born into money and swindling investors, contractors and banks. The concern is because he was such a risky investment he turned to sketchy money to finance his projects functionally acting as an u termedyate to launder Russia money.</p>

<p>Government is different from business. Furthermore, there is not one right path to president. Obama surrounded himself and listened to experts. His economic policy could be described as middle right. Obamacare was thought up by a republican think tank in the 2999s.</p>

<p>Finally, Obama’s was hamstrung by congress introducing stimulus and infrastructure spending and had to rely heavily on quantatuve easing. The republicans did this under the cry of austerity - although now they are happily blowing a 1.5 Trillin dollar gap to give companies and Rasin ch people a tax cut no economist once and no ceo plans on using to raise wages or invest in US capital.</p>

<p>As for Paris accords, most successful US states are staying in... they aren’t even implemented when Obama was there and Chiba is unilaterally stsying in and developing its own cap and trade, solar tech and wind power because they understand a modern rewewable grid and ufastrycture is a necessary investment to become the worlds leading super power. </p>

<p>Your 4% gtiwth is left over from the Obama administration as Trump has not done a single thing to drive it forward and with this absurd tax cut in an overheated economy and stock market we silll be do for a correction. Furthermore, we need to find a way to succeed in an eco friendly manner because if we don’t stop climate change or improve or evironndntal footprint, none of this discussion will matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama worked briefly as a guest adjunct. He was NEVER a professor.</p>

<p>And, as a guest on campus, all he did was race-bait. Students were shocked that he didn&#39;t talk about the Constitution at all. He just showed up and forced the students to look at black-and-white pictures of lynched blacks from the 1910s in the South.</p>

<p>Go Google the accounts of people who had the misfortune of having a class taught by that race-hustler.</p>

<p>And as for &quot;working as a Constitutional lawyer,&quot; excellent: Give me a list of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>What was that? </p>

<p><em>Zero?</em></p>

<p>Fact: Obama could never pass a fucking background check. His house had to be bought by a front company owned by convicted ACORN felon Tony Rezko because Barry couldn&#39;t put in for a loan (which would have triggered a background check). Taking the bar triggers the same background check.</p>

<p>Barry&#39;s solution?</p>

<p>Despite going to Harvard law school, NEVER working as an actual lawyer, and instead going to work as a &quot;community organizer,&quot; handing out pamphlets.</p>

<p>He was a con-man from start to finish.</p>

<p>Listen to e professional debt collector&#39;s account of the Obamas using multiple names and social security numbers--and Barry owning nothing in his own name (due to not being able to take out bank loans as a result of his aversion to background checks): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qavV1P-UMjE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qavV1P-UMjE</a></p>

<p>Yeah, sorry: The Donald-Trump-is-a-Conman talking-point doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Because Donald J. Trump has always BEEN Donald J. Trump.</p>

<p>He has never gone under a different name, nor used fake social security numbers, nor fled from background checks because he was terrified of what they would reveal.</p>

<p>Trump went to school to sell real estate--and guess what: He sold real estate.</p>

<p>Unlike Obama, going to school to be a lawyer and then being . . . a low-paid community organizer (because he couldn&#39;t pass the background check to work as a fucking lawyer).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, he was a senior lecturer, basically an untenured associate professor. Knowing people who where law students there at the time he lectured they remember him as a solid of non descript lecturer who largely stuck to non controversial topics and course material... which matches official accounts. He was editornof the Harvard law review and a senior lecturer at  U Chicago... which is at least equally qualified to Bush junior whose claim to fame was buying into the rangers with family money before becoming Texas governor. Trump has been a fraud all his life. By all accounts Obama was a cerebral and informed President... contrary to the current occupant. </p>

<p>Yeah, economists have found a pretty good margin that can get these corporations lower taxes and also get people lower taxes without ruining the economy. This tax bill is written as a bunch of personal favors to get people to vote yes, I&#39;d be fine if it were written instead by an actual conservative economist.</p>

And economists do not agree. FYI economists  are theories and furious rely on hypothesis but none of these theories have been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt and economists disagree on many different levels just because you agree with one school of thought that does not mean there is an official school of thought that all economists adhere to. That is a fact not my opinion.  Try to see if you can see things from other people&#39;s points of view and take a less fanatical stance because at the end of the day everyone wants more money in their pocket to provide a better life for themselves and loved ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we disagree either but this tax bill is entirely against every economic principle. We are in a booming market and they reduce the tax rate? We have 4.1% unemployment and they want more jobs? Increasing the deficit at the time we need to reduce it is a horrible mistake and to combat it they want to take away some of the most effective programs we have next year to balance the budget. This same exact style of tax plan happened in the Bush years and led to a giant recession but they want to do it again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is more to the story than the simple formula you painted. Way more. And I wish I could talk more about it. One thing I don know is that economists use superncomputer simply to set prices to ensure they get maximum profits without setting the price too high. They do this using complex formulas that take into account a regions cost of living, income averages and more. If simply pricing a tv gets all this leg work, make no mistake they went through a lot of different scenarios before they came to this one. Can you trust it? Of course not trust is only for family. Will some fat cats make out of course. Will things be better for regular people? Hopefully. It seems trump is trying to match China&#39;s growth. Their GDP is at 7%? We still have a long way to go. From the latest trump speech I heard he said he wants employees to have their choice of employers and pick the highest paying employer that they want. That is a good thing. I can&#39;t complain about that. The tax plan does not seem so bad to me. What did you want with a tax plan? A high tax rate for employers? So that they don&#39;t spend their money on payroll? That&#39;s how it works: payroll is a cost, so are taxes, the profits come after. What would you be happy with? </p>

<p>What did you want with a tax plan? A high tax rate for employers? So that they don&#39;t spend their money on payroll? That&#39;s how it works: payroll is a cost, so are taxes, the profits come after. So if taxes are high than payroll costs have to come down. This is reality not wishful thinking. What would you be happy with? I suspect you will never be happy with trump. That is sad and fanatical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stock market is at an all time high and has been for the last 5 years or so but wages remain the same. So either these companies are hoarding wealth and will never pay people more for a job they already are fine doing or they really suck at managing money. Keep corporate taxes the same, increase income taxes for the top half of earners and use that tax revenue to help the poor enter the middle class and the middle class to keep healthcare. Once this bubble bursts we can worry about bailing out the companies after we make sure the people are cared for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love when people speak in absolutes thinking that they sound smart. Excepts absolutes are a fallacy and easily debunked. FYI: there are very few absolutes in reality. So go back and reread and try to figure out the opposit point of view. Learn that understand the opposite of your opinion, then you will have an idea of the range of possibilities of our economy. Your absolutism is a sign of ignorance not intelligence. When you can open your mind and consider that you might be wrong you might then exhibit wisdom. Just sayin....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year Greece fought very hard to get out of the European Union because their economy has been destroyed by the austerity measures. Also Spain tried to get out but it was quashed recently. Just google it. If you want to learn. I also lived in Greece and the middle class that live there hate EUt passionately. There currency lost value and they became poorer as a result of it. I don&#39;t know that there is anything in politics that is considered universally good. I like he kept his word. That goes a long way in building trust and credibility. Politicians are known to make worthless promises. I like that he backed out of the TPP as promised. That he did not block the JFK files release. I like that he has no problem challenging the establishment. I am not a trump fanatic. I believe in holding public officials accountable. I also don&#39;t think he is an angel or Jesus Christ. However the economy is doing better than ever and reversing poverty will change society and eliminate a lot of problems, addiction, child abuse, health outcomes, divorce rates will all be positively effected with a good economy. </p>

I think you are referring to the elections Greece had last year and possibly the revolt Catalonia had a few months back. Nothing really to do with what u say. Have you heard of PIGS?  Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain. The countries who have suffered the most from austerity as a result of the EU. I am a native citizen born and bred from one of these countries. As fooked up as it is where I am, I thank god (expression i dont believe in god) that my new Government is not on a love buzz with that fake tanned reality star gombeen. The EU isnt great no but at least they recognise the fact that we need to save this planet and reintroduce coal mining to get elected  </p>

In fact shills resort to demeaning labels when they cannot convince anyone. Calling someone orange haired is as bad as calling someone fat. If all you care about is the environment then go save it. But you won&#39;t do it without enlisting mass support and you are so fanatical and extremist that only a minority will ever support your purpose. Destotoying an economy increeases child abuse rates but you care about the economy. Under dogs like children don&#39;t matter. Destroying an economy increases domestic violence rates too but you don&#39;t care about abused women either, destroying an economy increases animal abuse but that does not matter. Coal burning matters to you. But hey while Greek children get their ass kicked by their impovershied parents China burns all the coal and continues destroying the same air we all breath. But you stick to your gun and get nothing done while society goes back ward. I can&#39;t stand hypocrites. Disgusting.

<p>The truth is, these &quot;opposition parties&quot; are one and the same party... sent to do the bidding of the elites when in power, and block any real opposition when they are not.</p>
