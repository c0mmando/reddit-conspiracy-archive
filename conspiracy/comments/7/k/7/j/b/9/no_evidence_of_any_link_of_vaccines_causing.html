       After doing research on autism and vaccines, I came a cross a gold mine of a post. A collection of links and information, that so far, has gathered a whopping 144 research papers that show that indeed there is a link with vaccines and autism. The link has the conclusions written so that its easy to read and take in, as well as the links to the papers themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id like to request also to hopefully have this stickied so that we can have as many people as we can see this information and start getting informed. The time has come.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Id like to make a special mention on this post. There is a brand new study that just published a month ago that looked into aluminium in the brain of autistic people. The findings are shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Aluminium in brain tissue in autism".
by Matthew Mold, Dorcas Umar, Andrew King, Christopher Exley.

       Easy to understand bullet points about the study above.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Anything under 1 is considered insignificant.
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anything over 2 is considered pathologicaly concerning.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anything over 3 is considered pathologicaly significant.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are no control brains for this study because they already know what baseline is. They have already tested the amount of aluminium in the brain of people with no apparent neurological issues many times. They are all under 1.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Ok, the results.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         All 5 brains in this study had aluminium content over 3.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         4 brains had aluminium content over 5.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         3 brains had aluminium content over 10 (twice as much as Alzheimer's).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This study found the highest aluminium content ever found in a human brain.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They found significant amounts of aluminium in every brain and in every part of the brain, even the hippocampus. Alzheimer's brains generally only had the aluminium in the grey matter.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since we know that the gut brain barrier and blood brain barrier exist (filtering about 99% of alum) , for aluminium content to be this high in the brain, there is only one primary exposure that is the most likely source and that is vaccines. Dietary and other exposures are highly unlikely to give out these results.

       50% risk of a dead kid worth not getting autism? 25% risk? You have the choice to do that to your kids, but the government also has a responsibility to remove children from dangerous environments (like when parents want to play with their kids health).

       Oh jeez, the fearmongering.

       What is the chance that an unvaccinated kid will actually catch one of the diseases? Very very small.

       What is the chance that the vaccine will hurt the kid? Also very very small.

       You don't have to go far back into history to find millions of people dying of smallpox. We eradicated that with a vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason that the chance of the kid catching the disease is 'very, very small' is that we have high vaccination levels in industrialised nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't imagine being that fraud researcher that lied about the vaccine-autism link. He is likely responsible for the deaths of hundreds of children. I don't think I could live with myself.

       Apparently it was a particular community in England tired of seeing the devastating effects of a mandated vaccine on their children...  for many years. I forget the source, sorry.

       Hey, make it safe. Make it effective. And you will get no argument from me.

       “Ignorant’ is not how I would describe most parents questioning the current depraved indifference of the vaccine scientific community.

       Who are you and the govt to say you will make better decision regarding a child’s health than a parent?  Are you going to care for them the rest of their lives when they are maimed?  Are you going to pay for all the necessary treatments and supervision?  What will you say when the vaccine causes their death?

       You've got this the wrong way round. The vaccine-autism link was the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">
        fradulent research
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many cases when the government are well within their rights to take a child's health and wellness into their custody. We agree as a society that parents who willfully abuse their children should  not be allowed to continue. Refusing a child a life saving vaccine out of some rebellion against science and 'authority' is abuse.
