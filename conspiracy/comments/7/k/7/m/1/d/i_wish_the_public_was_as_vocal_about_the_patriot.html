<p>After watching POI I wondered would the AIs battle each other or absorb each other?

    <div class="md"><p>Fascism was invented by a socialist, embraces socialist ideologies (&quot;fascism&quot; is an Italian term that means &quot;groupism&quot; or &quot;collectivism&quot;). </p>

<p>And fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same atrocity as communism and socialism—the only difference being that whereas communism and socialism openly call for state ownership of all property, fascism holds that some property may be “private”—so long as government can dictate how such property may be used. Sure, you own the factory, but here’s what you may and may not produce in it; here’s the minimum wage you must pay employees; here’s the kind of accounting system you must use; here are the specifications your machinery must meet; and so on. </p>

<p>No it wasn&#39;t. You are radically distorting the facts. Mussolini was thrown out of the socialist party as a young man precisely because he was not a socialist. See:-</p>

<p><strong>As Mussolini&#39;s support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported pacifism were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist vanguard that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war.[7] He began to criticize the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognize the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.[7] He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Expulsion_from_the_Italian_Socialist_Party">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Expulsion_from_the_Italian_Socialist_Party</a></p>

<p>He then went on to declare war on socialism:-</p>

<p><strong>Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement in 1919 with the founding of the Fasci italiani di combattimento, whose opposition to non-nationalistic socialism he declared: We declare war against socialism, not because it is socialism, but because it has opposed nationalism.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_and_ideology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_and_ideology</a></p>

<p>The only reason Mussolini was ever in the Socialist Party in the first place was because he was raised by a socialist father. </p>

<p>In summary, fascism is the exact political opposite of socialism. Whereas fascists want a strict autocratic hierarchy, socialists want to divide power equally among the people. This is the literal difference between far right and far left in politics, and you are trying to merge both together to fit some kind of bizarre preconceived narrative that fascism is on the left. It&#39;s stupid talk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same as communism and socialism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL. The entire existence of the fascist movement was predicated on the desire to eliminate Communism from Europe. Have you ever so much as opened a history book?</p>

<p><strong>The political views of Adolf Hitler have presented historians and biographers with some difficulty. His writings and methods were often adapted to need and circumstance, although there were some steady themes, including anti-semitism, anti-communism, anti-parliamentarianism, German Lebensraum (&quot;living space&quot;), belief in the superiority of an &quot;Aryan race&quot; and an extreme form of German nationalism. Hitler personally claimed he was fighting against Jewish Marxism.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_Adolf_Hitler">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_Adolf_Hitler</a></p>

<p>The very fact that, as a right winger, you are distorting history demonstrates poignantly which side of the political spectrum fascism rest on, because Hitler liked to distort history too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire problem is that everyone believes in the “if you have nothing to hide...” argument.  Truth is pretty much everyone has something to hide.  Did you make a negative comment about your boss to a friend?  Get drunk and say something racist or otherwise not political correct just jokingly in your stupor?  Visit a porn site?  What about a weird fetish porn site?  Made a google search for where to get tested for herpes?  Made a google search asking if your male parts are below average size?  Made radical posts? Said stupid things?  You get the idea.  If you make an enemy in the wrong place, YES you have something you wouldn’t want released out to the public-YES you have something to hide.  With your whole life stored in some government data center- how long until we have people in charge that use all this data like this?  Or maybe the data is already being used like this against people that threaten authorities in the wrong ways.  Either way the potential for a totalitarian application of your data is there for some future dictator to take advantage of.  People think surveillance is no big deal but surveillance itself is a form of control just waiting to be exploited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a fan of the Patriot Act, but what makes you say it&#39;s shown no ability to stop terrorist attacks? It seems to me you&#39;re falling into circular reasoning, &quot;there haven&#39;t been many terrorist attacks, so we don&#39;t need the Patriot Act&quot;; maybe there would have been more without it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Instead the vast majority remain passive on this issue...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same goes for most issues. Just look at the reaction to PA, NN TTP and TTIP. Few people have a clear understanding of what they are.</p>

<p>Lots of people have opinions and oppose these things. But very few do anything more than bitch about it online. Myself included.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re TPTB, online &quot;pseudo-activism&quot; is the greatest thing in the world. I like to call it phantom outrage. People get all worked up, vent their feelings online... and it makes no meaningful difference at all.</p>
