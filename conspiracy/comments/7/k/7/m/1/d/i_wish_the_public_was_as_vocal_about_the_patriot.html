       There's this guy I caught on YT that has been saying the singularity happened sometime this year.  Wish I could find his name.  Makes you wonder.

       After watching POI I wondered would the AIs battle each other or absorb each other?  This whole battle of intelligence communities makes me wonder if there could be AIs that are, perhaps unknown to the agencies, leading these agencies and battling each other via information.  That and the prevailance of "fake news".  An AI battle for the hearts and minds of humanity?

       Not at all, the foundations of fascism were laid well before 9/11, going back to the 60's when leftists took over education, hollywood, and the media; now they're in a position to indoctrinate the youth, reinforce that indoctrination with selective reporting and propaganda in the MSM, add in identity politics and an "other" to rally against (the 1%(jews), conservatives, whites) along with a sense of oppression and victim-hood to justify any questionable actions and you're there. All you need is a heavily regulated private industry, expansive government social programs, public health programs, and a sense that your actions are righteous or that you're on the right side of history, and you've got fascism.

       Fascism was invented by a socialist, embraces socialist ideologies ("fascism" is an Italian term that means "groupism" or "collectivism").
      </p>
      <p>
       And fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same atrocity as communism and socialism—the only difference being that whereas communism and socialism openly call for state ownership of all property, fascism holds that some property may be “private”—so long as government can dictate how such property may be used. Sure, you own the factory, but here’s what you may and may not produce in it; here’s the minimum wage you must pay employees; here’s the kind of accounting system you must use; here are the specifications your machinery must meet; and so on.

       No it wasn't. You are radically distorting the facts. Mussolini was thrown out of the socialist party as a young man precisely because he was not a socialist. See:-
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As Mussolini's support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported pacifism were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist vanguard that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war.[7] He began to criticize the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognize the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.[7] He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention.

       He then went on to declare war on socialism:-

       <strong>
        Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement in 1919 with the founding of the Fasci italiani di combattimento, whose opposition to non-nationalistic socialism he declared: We declare war against socialism, not because it is socialism, but because it has opposed nationalism.

      <p>
       The only reason Mussolini was ever in the Socialist Party in the first place was because he was raised by a socialist father.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, fascism is the exact political opposite of socialism. Whereas fascists want a strict autocratic hierarchy, socialists want to divide power equally among the people. This is the literal difference between far right and far left in politics, and you are trying to merge both together to fit some kind of bizarre preconceived narrative that fascism is on the left. It's stupid talk.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same as communism and socialism
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       LOL. The entire existence of the fascist movement was predicated on the desire to eliminate Communism from Europe. Have you ever so much as opened a history book?

       <strong>
        The political views of Adolf Hitler have presented historians and biographers with some difficulty. His writings and methods were often adapted to need and circumstance, although there were some steady themes, including anti-semitism, anti-communism, anti-parliamentarianism, German Lebensraum ("living space"), belief in the superiority of an "Aryan race" and an extreme form of German nationalism. Hitler personally claimed he was fighting against Jewish Marxism.

       The very fact that, as a right winger, you are distorting history demonstrates poignantly which side of the political spectrum fascism rest on, because Hitler liked to distort history too.

       Patriot act doesn't hit as close to home as paying extra for their porn does so it's much easier to get people riled up about net neutrality which is a huge issue in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to consider that when the patriot act was first signed the internet wasn't what it is now, we would've seen a lot more outrage had social media been as big as it is now.

       You know, a lot of us were talking about it back in the day. For years.

       NN is hot in the news right now so more exposure to it - and we have a bigger online presence now than we did back then (thanks to smart phones imho and more websites).
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, to me anyway, people just don't feel they can do much about it anymore. If trump was truly anti-establishment he would be out there talking about it instead talking about militarizing the police more, etc.

       I can criticize him the same as I did Obama when it comes to the Patriot Act and such (except now people on the right will call me a shill for bitching about him and avoid the fact that he is president and they themselves criticized Obama over similar things).

       Yep, patriot act is just new normal. And I too remember lots of campus organized protests back when the act was just getting passed. Even before then, actually. There was a govt email crawling program called Echelon that I remember protesting back in ‘99 even. Pretty sure all we got out of it was having our names put on a list.

       It's interesting, I can't think of a single person who has ever been exposed to the subject that remotely approves of it but it has never been a subject matter that has been put on a pedestal for everyone by the media so it ends up being an interesting conversation piece until people move onto the next one.

       The entire problem is that everyone believes in the “if you have nothing to hide...” argument.  Truth is pretty much everyone has something to hide.  Did you make a negative comment about your boss to a friend?  Get drunk and say something racist or otherwise not political correct just jokingly in your stupor?  Visit a porn site?  What about a weird fetish porn site?  Made a google search for where to get tested for herpes?  Made a google search asking if your male parts are below average size?  Made radical posts? Said stupid things?  You get the idea.  If you make an enemy in the wrong place, YES you have something you wouldn’t want released out to the public-YES you have something to hide.  With your whole life stored in some government data center- how long until we have people in charge that use all this data like this?  Or maybe the data is already being used like this against people that threaten authorities in the wrong ways.  Either way the potential for a totalitarian application of your data is there for some future dictator to take advantage of.  People think surveillance is no big deal but surveillance itself is a form of control just waiting to be exploited.

       I'm not a fan of the Patriot Act, but what makes you say it's shown no ability to stop terrorist attacks? It seems to me you're falling into circular reasoning, "there haven't been many terrorist attacks, so we don't need the Patriot Act"; maybe there would have been more without it.
