Not sure if its a conspiracy or not, but i&#39;m counting it as one. Want to hear all of your thoughts on this, do you guys agree with this popular Reddit opinion? Like i want to know where people learned &amp; came up with this information, to deny the existence of a real living person, like who are the ones manipulating history to this severe degree? What else has reached this status, that its now become popular to deny its existence as if its never happened? What would the motivation behind this even be, any conspiracies on this guys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. Okes. The vast of majority of Academia, at least concerning Classicists and Historians of Antiquity, acknowledge Jesus as a figure. Some call him Jeshua, but they all agree that there was a Jewish man living in the 1st century who had a cult following and was executed by the Roman authorities, like many other Jewish zealots of his time were. This man formed the basis of what the Roman citizen Paul of Tarsus would go on to spread to Rome and Greece as Christianity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What did non-Christian authors say about Jesus?</p>

<p>As far as we know, the first author outside the church to mention Jesus is the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who wrote a history of Judaism around AD93. He has two references to Jesus. One of these is controversial because it is thought to be corrupted by Christian scribes (probably turning Josephus’s negative account into a more positive one), but the other is not suspicious – a reference to James, the brother of “Jesus, the so-called Christ”.</p>

<p>About 20 years after Josephus we have the Roman politicians Pliny and Tacitus, who held some of the highest offices of state at the beginning of the second century AD. From Tacitus we learn that Jesus was executed while Pontius Pilate was the Roman prefect in charge of Judaea (AD26-36) and Tiberius was emperor (AD14-37) – reports that fit with the timeframe of the gospels. Pliny contributes the information that, where he was governor in northern Turkey, Christians worshipped Christ as a god. Neither of them liked Christians – Pliny writes of their “pig-headed obstinacy” and Tacitus calls their religion a destructive superstition...</p>

<p>These abundant historical references leave us with little reasonable doubt that Jesus lived and died.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another area that few non experts realize there is scholarly consensus is that the Old Testament describes God as leading a council of divine beings (bene elohim in Hebrew) that included some of these deities as lesser, created beings. So yes, in a sense.</p>

<p>But you also don&#39;t have dozens of references to Apollo <em>in historical writings</em>. You have myths referencing Apollo, but I don&#39;t know of any historians claiming he acted in the present age, outside of perhaps the cult of Apollo and the Oracle at Delphi.</p>

<p>By the way, it&#39;s really obvious to me that you don&#39;t have a clue of what you&#39;re talking about and are just shitposting things you heard secondhand from unreliable sources mixed in with outright trolling.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Evidence from Tacitus</p>

<p>Let&#39;s begin our inquiry with a passage that historian Edwin Yamauchi calls &quot;probably the most important reference to Jesus outside the New Testament.&quot;[4] Reporting on Emperor Nero&#39;s decision to blame the Christians for the fire that had destroyed Rome in A.D. 64, the Roman historian Tacitus wrote:</p>

<pre><code>Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome....[5]
</code></pre>

<p>What can we learn from this ancient (and rather unsympathetic) reference to Jesus and the early Christians? Notice, first, that Tacitus reports Christians derived their name from a historical person called Christus (from the Latin), or Christ. He is said to have &quot;suffered the extreme penalty,&quot; obviously alluding to the Roman method of execution known as crucifixion. This is said to have occurred during the reign of Tiberius and by the sentence of Pontius Pilatus. This confirms much of what the Gospels tell us about the death of Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>The article details four other ancient sources as well:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repeating your fideist creed over and over again doesn&#39;t make it reasonable or correct. You&#39;re making specific, objective claims that are simply not correct.</p>

<p>There is plenty of proof that Jesus existed. His followers wrote numerous books and letters attesting to his existence. Several Roman historians mention him, Jewish historians mention him, the Talmud even mentions him.</p>

<p>That is why scholars reject the claims that Jesus did not exist. Because you can&#39;t reject all of that evidence and then turn around and accept ancient history based on a single source with less than 1% of the manuscript evidence of the New Testament. It would be sheer lunacy.</p>

<p>You are trying to change the rules of how historians of ancient history analyze things, and impose a burden of proof that virtually no one from antiquity can fulfill. Not only are you disagreeing with the consensus of experts in the field, you&#39;re attempting to say they aren&#39;t even using the correct standards.</p>

<p>Do you actually know how many people from the 1st century could have their existence verified according to your standard?</p>

<p>This is why <em>subject matter experts</em> don&#39;t take the dismissals of Jesus&#39; existence seriously. Three separate sources for the existence of a commoner in the ancient world is extremely uncommon. And there are a lot more than three sources, there are several dozen, including the various books in the Bible, other writings from the early church, Roman writers, Jewish writers like Josephus, and even the Jewish Talmud.</p>

<p>So much evidence that if you&#39;re going to say Jesus didn&#39;t exist, you really can&#39;t say anyone existed. Which is why scholars reject these claims.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to believe me until you get familiar with the actual sources involved in ancient history. </p>

<p>Do you know how many people&#39;s existence we can confirm with hard copies of historical records from within 20 years of their date of death? I want you to try to find a single example from ancient history that meets this standard.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be surprised to find out that, besides emperors having their names printed on coins (which actually survive, unlike paper), this almost never happens. </p>

<p>Let me give another example. Our whole history of the wars in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars">Gaul</a> is based on Julius Caesar&#39;s account of it. And we don&#39;t have a copy of that document from before the middle ages. But no scholar is questioning it, because that&#39;s actually pretty good documentation for ancient historical events.</p>

<p>What I do understand is that there are no sources showing Jesus as a historical figure until the gospels were written decades after his supposed death and spread around as a new religion, just like there&#39;s no sources of Xenu being a historical figure until L Ron Hubbard wrote the books on Scientology. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve given plenty of sources, and you are making demands that are patently ridiculous because you think that ancient history is as well documented as modern. It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>We only have a few dozen historians from the whole 1st century. Of these, only a handful were in the same area of the world and writing around the time Jesus lived. Several of these mention Jesus: Thallus, Tacitus, and the most important historian of the region, Josephus, writes a good deal about Jesus.</p>

<p>Now, if you can find me a contemporary reference to an unimportant commoner in the Roman Empire, we can have a serious discussion. But you won&#39;t, because there aren&#39;t any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are saying is actually kind of absurd.</p>

<p>Just because it is accepted doesn&#39;t make it true. If you don&#39;t have a contemporary source it is a best guess, not history. </p>

<p>Given the extensive records kept by the Roman&#39;s there would almost certainly be a record of his existence in his time if he existed. </p>

<p>They kept track of taxes they kept track of uprisings, they kept track of so much stuff, and much of the story of Jesus takes place in Rome. There would be records of his crucifixion, there would be records of his disturbance of the tax collectors. There would be records in Jewish writing about a heretic that required dealing with.</p>

<p>If a man like Jesus existed he certainly would have been noticed, there would at least be tales of a man in a far off city bringing people back to life, or allowing people to walk again, and turning water to wine. </p>

<p>There would have been stories from the hundreds of men and woman fed by 3 loaves of bread and two fish. </p>

<p>There are so many amazing things he is credited with that it would be impossible for him to have existed and there not been a record. He would have made an incredible impact on people in his time. And certainly at least some of these things would have been recorded for us to read of today. But there isn&#39;t a single scrap of parchment, or inscription, from that time giving merit to his existence. </p>

<p>Even then, if you choose to accept accounts almost 100 years after his supposed existence, that is still not absolute proof of his existence as the son of God. </p>

<p>Your conclusions can just as easily support the idea that the whole thing is a shame, and someone used a man named Jesus that lived 100 years before and set him up as a messiah. </p>

<p>Both believers in his existence and doubters can use what you think is proof as evidence that they are right. When that happens you can&#39;t say for sure. </p>

<p>Almost all of what we have of history is guess work, and most of it is at least partially skewed by translation issues, perspective, as well as whatever sort of spin the people writing chronicles gave to events to fit their needs. </p>

<p>Too much has been lost, and what has been left to us is often misleading. We aren&#39;t the first time fake news and propaganda has been a thing. And there is no telling without contemporary sources if an event is real or a piece of propaganda. </p>

<p>You do not know anything about ancient history or what sources are available. The <em>norm</em> is for histories to be written decades after the fact. And in most cases, we have a handful of copies from the middle ages, a thousand years or more after the facts. With the New Testament, we have copies from within a few decades of writing, and thousands of copies in total:</p>

<p>&quot;If the critics want to disregard the New Testament, then they must also disregard other ancient writings by Plato, Aristotle, and Homer.  This is because the New Testament documents are better-preserved and more numerous than any other ancient writings.  Because they are so numerous, they can be cross checked for accuracy . . . and they are very consistent.</p>

<p>There are presently 5,686 Greek manuscripts in existence today for the New Testament.1 If we were to compare the number of New Testament manuscripts to other ancient writings, we find that the New Testament manuscripts far outweigh the others in quantity&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://carm.org/manuscript-evidence">https://carm.org/manuscript-evidence</a></p>

<p>Again, this is why <em>scholars</em> don&#39;t take these claims seriously. The only people you see making them are uninformed atheists and deep conspiracy theorists that basically dismiss all history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may want to look into the claims Ralph Ellis makes, because they&#39;re really not supported by any historical evidence and are not treated seriously by any scholars in relevant disciplines. Here is an excerpt of an actual discussion Ellis had:</p>

<p>&quot;You write (and I’m limiting it to this selection because the rest of your conclusions follow from these basic premises):</p>

<pre><code>The historical Izas was called King Izas Manu(el) VI of Edessa.

The historical Izas was a defacto King of the Jews (because his mother, Queen Helena, was the defacto Queen of the Jews).

The historical Izas-Manu’s father was the same King Abgarus of Edessa.

The historical Izas was a revolutionary who fought the Jerusalem authorities and the Romans.
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, your primary argument–that Jesus is actually Izas Manu (a creation whom you equate with three different people)–is patently ridiculous. You are basically suggesting that at least four historical kings (Izates bar Monobaz, Abgar V the Black, Abgar Ma’nu VI, and Abgar bar Manu VIII the Great) from two distinct provinces with separate kings (Edessa in the province of Osroene vs. Arbela in the province of Adiabene) are one and the same person and place respectively. You seem to completely ignore the fact that both of these places exist miles apart (roughly 360 miles/579 km apart, actually). The Tigris river flows between them. The modern town of Edessa (Şanlıurfa) is in Turkey while Arbela (Arbil) is in Iraq. Additionally, these individuals are not one and the same. Abgar bar Manu lived about 200 years after Abgar V and over 120 years after Abgar VI. Your attempt to squeeze these individuals into one figure is beyond questionable. This bizarre conflation dooms your whole argument. But I’m getting ahead of myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="https://tomverenna.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/ralph-ellis-jesus-and-his-myth-of-the-king-jesus-of-edessa/">https://tomverenna.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/ralph-ellis-jesus-and-his-myth-of-the-king-jesus-of-edessa/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another possibility you need to consider is that the copying went the other direction. That is, the sun gods ripped off elements of the story of the son of god.</p>

<p>A perfect example of this is Appolonius of Tyana. The stories of his life are very similar to Jesus, including gathering disciples, performing miracles, even raising the dead. There&#39;s just one problem: these stories have their origin centuries after the New Testament was written.</p>

<p>Consider similarities in ancient traditions that tend to authenticate the stories in the Bible, such as the ancient Chinese worshiping a single god, Shangdi, to whom they offered animal sacrifices like those described in Genesis.</p>

<p>For thousands of years, people have written about the Son of a God who will die and be raised from the dead. Then, a guy named Jesus claims to be the Son of God, gets killed for it, and then his followers say he rose from the dead.</p>

<p>Despite being hated by their own people and their Roman overlords, no one can stamp out this movement or produce the body of Jesus to put these claims to an end. All of the leaders die or are tortured when they could go free simply by recanting their testimony.</p>

<p>Is the New Testament talking about how to make your crops grow by invoking the bull god to rain down his fertility semen onto mother earth? Of course not. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a completely different story than all the different variations on Horus, Isis, and Osiris that different cultures adopted and renamed. None of them talk about a god dying to save humanity... except the ones that were written down very early before they were corrupted.</p>

<p>This is dealt with very explicitly in the Bible. Mystery religions originating from Babylon, also called Mystery Babylon, are the main opponent of Christianity in the book of Revelation. And if you study Freemasonry, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s the origin of their mythology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming that Moses (who actually wrote Genesis, not Abraham) ripped his story off and using that to prove that Abraham ripped his story off. Genesis has significant differences from the Sumerian stories, and the similarities are because they are recording the same events from different perspectives. </p>

<p>Genesis is probably not the earliest account, either. The book of Job is somewhat earlier, possibly before the flood. And the book of Enoch is thousands of year earlier than the Sumerian accounts, having been written before the flood.</p>

<p>The &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; is a serious misnomer. These are traditions that are much, much older, but have been corrupted in most places.</p>

There are no established pre flood works that Biblical scholars agree on.

<p>That is completely false.

    <div class="md"><p>There are two issues here, the first what was the nature and the purpose of ancient historiography, and the second is Jesus even really mentioned. </p>

<p>The first is that ancient historiographers were not just interested in providing an account of what really happened.  They were often employed by courts providing narratives that justify the political systems that employed them.  As such they often mixed myth, tradition and fact.  For example take Livy in his History of Rome:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Evander, alarmed by the crowd of excited shepherds standing round a stranger whom they accused of open murder, ascertained from them the nature of his act and what led to it. As he observed the bearing and stature of the man to be more than human in greatness and august dignity, he asked who he was. [10] When he heard his name, and learnt his father and his country, he said, ‘Hercules, son of Jupiter, hail! My mother, who speaks truth in the name of the gods, has prophesied that thou shalt join the company of the gods, and that here a shrine shall be dedicated to thee, which in ages to come the most powerful nation in all the world shall call their Ara Maxima and honour with thine own special worship.’ [11] Hercules grasped Evander&#39;s right hand and said that he took the omen to himself and would fulfil the prophecy by building and consecrating the altar.

<p>Is Hercules real because he is mentioned by a historian?  Is this fact, tradition, or an an etiological story?  </p>

<p>Secondly we have a mention by Josephus, well we have two, and there is good reason to think they are interpolations.   Who else is there? Tacitus? </p>

<p>What is Tacitus reporting here?  That there are Christians? That they are named after Christus?   Mind you the earliest manuscripts of this passage show that the word Christians was altered, and the authenticity of the passage is disputed. </p>

<p>From your own link:</p>

<p>&quot; The general scholarly view is that while the Testimonium Flavianum is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian interpolation and/or alteration.[5][6][7][8][9][10] Although the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear,[11] broad consensus exists as to what the original text of the Testimonium by Josephus would have looked like.[9]</p>

<p>Modern scholarship has largely acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in Book 20, Chapter 9, 1 of the Antiquities to &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot;[12] and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity...</p>

<p>Almost all modern scholars consider the reference in Book 18, Chapter 5, 2 of the Antiquities to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist also to be authentic and not a Christian interpolation.&quot;</p>

<p>So, uh, yeah, there is independent attestation for Jesus, even according to scholars who think the accounts are false.</p>

<p>Right away you run into a demarcation problem then.  How do you differentiate which fantastical story is myth, and which one is real? </p>

<p>Concerning the Tacitus passage, you somewhat missed the point.  I will grant you that people working in the field, by majority, think there is a historical core.  The question is, even if we pretend that the passage is authentic,  what is it evidence of?  Is it fact, tradition, or is it an etiological story? </p>

<p>It is further compounded by the fact, that the event that Tacitus is reporting on, is itself fictitious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A conventional certainty is that the first state-driven persecution of Christians happened in the reign of Nero and that it involved the deaths of Peter and Paul, and the mass execution of Christians in the aftermath of the great fire of July 64 c.e. The argument here contests all of these facts, especially the general execution personally ordered by Nero. The only source for this event is a brief passage in the historian Tacitus. Although the passage is probably genuine Tacitus, it reflects ideas and connections prevalent at the time the historian was writing and not the realities of the 60s.</p>

<p>Carrier has himself published an article arguing that this is an interpolation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some scholars have argued that Tacitus’ reference to Christ in connection with the burning of Rome under Nero is a 4th century (or later) interpolation. It is here argued that their arguments can be met with no strong rebuttal, and therefore the key sentence in Tacitus referring to Christ should be considered suspect.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>...according to a modern scholar writing almost 2000 years later without a shred of direct support from an ancient source. And who is directly contradicted by numerous sources far closer to the events than he is. It basically boils down to an absence of direct evidence from the 1st century (which is false; there is direct evidence, he just doesn&#39;t <em>like</em> it):</p>

<p>&quot;Two facts that were often asserted about his death in Christian accounts in later antiquity — that it occurred in 64 c.e., the year of the fire, and that Peter was crucified — are palpably the construction of writers who very much desired both things to be true. They wanted Peter, like Paul, to be a victim of a Neronian persecution and they wanted his death, also like that of Paul, to be connected with the Great Fire. They wished the two deaths be seen as typological replays of the executions of John the Baptist (by beheading) and of Jesus of Nazareth (by crucifixion).&quot;</p>

<p>His argument is the fact that the ancient writers wanted it to be true, and it has some similarities to other stories. <em>That&#39;s it.</em> Then he has to go through and try to dismiss all of the ancient sources because <em>he</em> doesn&#39;t want the story to be true:</p>

<p>&quot; The assertion that Peter was crucified is found as early as the African exegete Tertullian who was writing around 200 c.e., but he says nothing about when the execution took place or in what fashion.7 Much later, Eusebius is the first to state that Peter, at the end of his apostolic travels, came to Rome where he was ‘crucified head downwards as he himself had requested to suffer’ Oddly enough, Eusebius does not say when this happened. In this same passage, however, he mentions the martyrdom of Paul under Nero, claiming Origen&#39;s (lost) commentary on Genesis as his source.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, so Eusebius had access to documents that Dr. Dipshit the modern scholar doesn&#39;t have access to? Golly, maybe we should listen to ancient sources instead of modern academics. Good thing that&#39;s been the accepted methodology for historical writing since <em>ancient Greece</em>.</p>

<p>The author goes over the evidence, which is non-existent.   What does writing now have to do with it?    We now know, through scholarship,  that stories Christians told about their origins, and the composition of their books is false.  The Pentateuch was not written by Moses.  Most scholars agree that not all Pauline epistles are authentic, etc. All of this is due to arguments and techniques of modern scholarship.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of the person referred to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference is to a group Chrestians, that are named after Chrestos. Not Christians named after Christ.  It is written in the 110&#39;s, as such it could be reporting tradition already circulating. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His argument is the fact that the ancient writers wanted it to be true, and it has some similarities to other stories. </p>

<p>His argument is that christian writers, writing centuries after the purported events wanted Peter and Paul to be modeled on John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, so Eusebius had access to documents that Dr. Dipshit the modern scholar doesn&#39;t have access to? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference to Origen is explicit.  Origen was born toward the end of the 2nd century, and wrote his works in the first half of the 3rd century.  Century and a half after purported events.  A contemporary witness he is not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good thing that&#39;s been the accepted methodology for historical writing since ancient Greece.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not, literary sources have had a diminutive role in historiography with material evidence taking its place.  The reasons are not controversial.  The sources are not objective accounts, and they mix myth, fact and etiology all together. Ancient Christian communities were especially filled with forgeries, and counter-forgeries.  I mentioned Pauline epistles already as an example. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your source</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I provided an argument.  Either a passage is an interpolation or its not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>John the Baptist is a prominent figure in Jesus&#39; story,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you have this backwards, as Jesus being a prominent character in the story of John the Baptist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People that invent historical claims like this can&#39;t authenticate even non-central details; look at the Book of Mormon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historical fiction often uses real characters, real events and real places for the setting of fictional stories.  We are somewhat lucky because at least nominally historical fiction is a different genre from history proper.  It was not so in the ancient world.  So the fact that Pontius Pilate is a real character does not mean that dead people rose in Jerusalem and wondered around like zombies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to some guy spouting a minority viewpoint that he admits is &quot;provocative&quot; that is directly defiant of the dominant methodology of history for several thousand years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biblical scholarship, as a rigorous discipline is relatively recent.  The views about composition were theological views and views of tradition, not of evidence and fact.  Concerning whether or not it is a minority position,  it does not matter, what matters are the arguments  and facts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are Tacitus, Tertullian, Eusebius, and Origen wrong, or the guy who is bloviating 2000 years after the fact?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tacitus reference has been dealt with already, Origen, Tertullian and Eusebius are writing centuries after the fact and centuries of political and social change of the Christian movement. </p>

<p>So here is where we really stand.  There is no contemporaneous evidence for Jesus. There are theological references centuries later, and historical references whose authenticity is questionable.  There is no material evidence.  In addition, Doherty, Carrier and Ehrman following him all agree that there was an archangel worshiped and that Jesus Christ starts as this archangel. Ehrman just thinks that there was a historical person who was attached. The consensus really is that the Jesus as portrayed in the Gospel is literary character, its just that the majority think there was some apocalyptic preacher that developed a following.     </p>

<blockquote>

I don&#39;t even think it was true back when the critical theorists held the dominant academic positions.

<p>There are physical manuscripts... you don&#39;t have anything early. </p>

<p>There are then works that are written in the past where we make hypotheses about what they contained and when they were written.  Concerning Jesus, you don&#39;t have any other than the references in Tacitus and Josephus, where the passages are of questionable authenticity, and you have religious figures writing exegesis and theology centuries after the act.   You don&#39;t have evidence.  Your claim about dozens of sources is therefore false.  Nor does it follow that if someone doubts the existence of Jesus than everyone from history should be doubted.  We have letters from Bar Kochba for example, to and from, pretty safe to say Bar Kochba existed.  The question of Jesus Christ is what better explains the literary character in the NT, a historical person, or a mythic entity that was placed in history. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that is your position, there&#39;s nothing more I can say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My position is that both the mythicists and the historicists are making conclusions for which there is no strong reasons and evidence either way.  The rational position is one of true skepticism in the ancient way of suspending judgment about the issue either way.  Maybe Jesus is a myth or maybe there was some preacher, but there is no way to currently tell. However, both sides should be given their fair chance to present their arguments. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re ignoring the consensus of the whole field </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, no actually I am not.  The question of consensus is interesting.  It can be either informational or normative.  My conclusion is that it is not informational. The arguments and the facts are what matter.  And the arguments that the historicists throw out are just not good.  In other words a consensus in this case is an analytical bias, not a strength. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either way, there&#39;s nothing more to say. You&#39;re denying known facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the facts:  You don&#39;t have eye witnesses.  Luke pretty much states that the author is not a witness and it is part of the synoptics anyways.  The NT contains forgeries.  This is agreed about the Pauline epistles. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Pauline_epistles">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Pauline_epistles</a></p>

<p>Out of the agreed upon authentic epistles, there is no actual information about historical Jesus.  Carrier and Doherty go over this in detail.  Paul knows about Jesus through visions, and the soteriology works with a celestial being. </p>

<p>That brings us to literary mentions.   The mentions in Tacitus and Josephus are of dubious authenticity, and other references are in church leaders centuries after the fact.  They are secondary sources mediated through more than a century of political and theological development of Christianity.  In other words not primary sources. </p>

<p>Which leaves us with no actual evidence for a historical Jesus.  </p>

<p>All of those are well supported propositions.

<p>I was not clear in my previous responses.  I don&#39;t argue that Jesus is not mentioned in other literary pieces outside of the NT. I argue that the times that he is the passages are of dubious authenticity, like Josephus and Tacitus, and that the mentions are centuries after the purported events took place, in which case, the mentions are not evidence.  </p>

<p>Someone writing centuries after the fact is not writing about what was going on at the time, at least not directly.  Let me make an analogy that might clarify this.  If an elder from the Mormon church wrote a book about Joseph Smith and Moroni now.  That book would not be itself evidence about Joseph Smith and Moroni.

<p>History is not only based on literary sources. Literary sources are copied, changed, interpolated, etc.  That is not even bringing up accuracy of information contained in them.  History as a discipline certainly uses and pays attention to old literature, but it is not based on it.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have  a dozen people in the 1st century. You have the Gospels, which are literary pieces that are dependent one on another. Of which if we grant the early dating, you are looking at roughly 70 AD for Mark.  That is decades after the events took place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can anyone come to the conspiracy sub and not see that religion is the biggest conspiracy ever.  </p>

<p>As for Jesus, There was never anything written about him while he was alive. Let that sink in.  the first mention of Jesus was by Josephus written about 95 AD.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus">Reference</a> </p>

<p>Now, the average lifespan is estimated to be around 40 -50 years 
in ancient times.  Just using these simple facts, the first mention of Jesus would be equivalent to you starting a religious following for your great grandpa that you never met and only had verbal tales from all your drunk unreliable relatives. </p>

<p>Maybe he did exist as a kind of Roman Tony Robbins, wandering around giving speeches and doing some cool slight of hand crap, but if that were the case, someone would have mentioned this amazing dude who could do these amazing things.  We have so many other writings and texts from that time in history, and there is NOTHING on Jesus.</p>

<p>just food for thought</p>

<p>This passage is argued by several scholars to be an interpolation.  The argument against it goes something like this.  </p>

<p>The account is different of death is different than what is in other writers.  If it was an interpolation it would conform to other writers. Therefore it is not an interpolation. </p>

<p>Personally, I find this as one of the silliest argument that are encountered in scholarship.  The interpolation could have been done by a christian sect that had different views about the death of James, or by someone who is repeating hearsay removed from textual evidence, etc. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The historic works and authors that dealt a serious blow to orthodoxy come from Germany in the middle of the 19th century.  The two authors that made systematic arguments that settled that Jesus is mythical, albeit disagreed with each other viscously are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Strauss">David Strauss</a>, and his work &quot;The Life of Jesus&quot;, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Bauer">Bruno Baur</a>, and his work culminating in &quot;Christ and the Caesars&quot;. </p>

<p>While these ideas where denounced by scholars at the time, and the state suppressed their views, they were never challenged on a scholarly level.  It was finally with  Albert Schweitzer and his work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quest_of_the_Historical_Jesus">The Quest of the Historical Jesus</a> that set the &#39;consensus&#39; of the scholars, well... until now.   This was over 100 years ago, before the Dead Sea scrolls, before the Nag Hammadi find.  There was a lot of new scholarship in the meantime.  </p>

<p>Jesus mythicism still had its adherents through out the 20th century, but it was on the edges.  With the internet these debates exploded on the scene again, with the most influential work being Earl Doherty with the Jesus Puzzle, whose ideas were reworked and Richard Carrier and published through an academic press. Carrier published On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt, which kind of dominates the Jesus Myth movement. </p>

<p>To answer specifically where it comes from: it comes from people that are interested in this topic that are assessing arguments and providing counterarguments to works in the field. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He definitely existed as a human, his Hebrew name was Yeshua ben Yosef. The debate is on if he was actually Divine. A number of things set him apart from all others, for instance no other religion has a primary prophet that claimed to be God. He also taught some things that were pretty revolutionary regarding the relationship between between slaves and their masters, pacifism, and salvation through faith instead of works. Everyone likes to try and point out that has a carbon copy of older gods when this is just not the case. Yes he may share a similar story but this was due to God knowing that humans really hate change so we require baby steps. He was still killed horribly for going against the grain as much as he did but now much of what he taught is viewed as what should be normal and emulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a pensioner and I have always known that Jesus is a myth. Paul cobbled together his &#39;Messiah&#39; figure from a number of gods who were popular at the time, then people stitched together the gospels to give his ideas a back story. The only conspiracy is the bullshit religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just 10 min ago on this subreddit I was reading multiple comments that the Sandy Hook shootings never happened and one poster said they would not believe it had until they were provided a dead body.</p>

<p>It would be hard to provide Jesus&#39;s body, presumably, after it disappeared. Ergo, he never existed.</p>

<p>Nevermind that he was a contentious figure in a new religion, I&#39;m sure lots of unsubstantiated things that propogate over 2000 years.</p>

<p>There are dozens of references to Jesus in ancient literature</p>

<p>Provide some then. Preferably ones from when he would have been alive, and not a hundred or so year after, like when the gospels were written. </p>
