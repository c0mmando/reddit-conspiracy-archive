<p>I think &quot;the reptilians&quot; is a bloodline. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The House of Windsor is actually a German family, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha">Saxe Corburg</a>. Like the rest of the European nobles, they are so inbred that you can basically track all of them back to same people in the Middle Ages, including <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9656769/Prince-Charles-heir-to-Draculas-blood-line.html">Vlad the Impaler</a>. </p>

<p>Why does this bloodline business matter? Because these royal families often retain power while pretending to have relinquished it. For example, Britain is <em>not</em> a constitutional monarchy as is often claimed, and the Queen retains real powers like the ability to dissolve the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/01/australia-had-a-government-shutdown-once-it-ended-with-the-queen-firing-everyone-in-parliament/?utm_term=.d10c7293bb22">Australian</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_parliament#Canada">Canadian</a> parliaments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great thoughts. I recently found out they&#39;re actually German and also that Kate isn&#39;t the poor normal girl marrying a prince like the press said, she&#39;s actually distantly related to William and so is Harry&#39;s new fiancé. Again recently heard about the queen getting rid of the Australian parliament too, haven&#39;t heard about Canada yet though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reptile is used figuratively like someone else mentioned, but symbolizes the Reptile (non Creative) side of the brain. If one believes in Evolution, it makes sense we have a reptile side of our brain. I think there is a lot of generic stuff going on that we don&#39;t know about. For instance, it&#39;s not far fetched to think that research has been done on Reptile brains to see what makes them such great predators. They isolate that gene and are probably splicing it into certain humans as we speak to make them more reptilian. Also, I&#39;m sure there are certain bloodlines that are more Reptilian-brained than others. For instance, Prince Charles claiming relation to Dracula (Vlad the Impaler). Dracula translates to Son of the Dragon (reptile).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to watch a lot of David Icke videos and I don&#39;t care what any of these people say he&#39;s great. He spreads a great message about how we are infinite consciousness alongside how non compliance should be our stance against TPTB. </p>

<p>If you ever get the chance watch his documentary &quot;The Lion Sleeps No More&quot;. It&#39;s about 6 hours long but I believe you can watch it on YouTube in 4 parts at 1.5 hours each. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t want to believe that it&#39;s even possible beings beyond our perception could exist and potentially influencing our reality but you need to keep an open mind. You don&#39;t necessarily have to believe but it&#39;s important to weigh out the different possibilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely re open mind. I like a lot of his work and have watched a load of his videos, I think he&#39;s touring next year and I might see if I can get tickets. You&#39;re right as well that most people can&#39;t believe beyond what they can see but I certainly do think not only is there so much we don&#39;t know because the elites are hiding it, but that there is also so much more going on out there. It&#39;s kind of annoying in 1 sense because I hate the not knowing but at the same time I like finding out new information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elites and aristos have a long history of being called and referred to as &quot;blue-bloods&quot; behind their backs by the common people and those same elites and aristos were also well known for their &quot;cold-blooded&quot; ruthlessness, sadistic use of cruel and hideous tortures to slowly and surely dispose of anyone that dared to so much as displease them, and their completely &quot;cold hearted&quot; and unsympathetic attitude towards the plight and misery of the ordinary people they lorded it over while living lives that were dedicated to extravagance, debauchery, and various forms of self-indulgence that knew no limits.</p>

<p>If not genuine reptiles, then perhaps the next closest thing to being one walking around in human form. It&#39;s certainly not much of a stretch to actually imagine them as being some other species altogether that they themselves simply can&#39;t help revealing that they are in any number of ways that either conflict with or are far distant from what know and consider to be any ordinary human nature. Not even remotely human at all, in some cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve read somewhere that Phillip has a strong belief in depopulation. Interesting thoughts, and I agree that there likely is something separating them from &#39;Us normal people&#39;. I watched some Princess Diana documentary recently which for me pretty much sealed my thoughts that she was murdered by them. Oh it just so happens that all of the cctv cameras were &#39;off/not working&#39; at that time. Also they kept her in the tunnel for ages after the crash, she wasn&#39;t rushed straight to hospital like what you would normally expect to happen. </p>

<p>The press made out to the public that Kate was a &#39;normal girl&#39; marrying a prince, turns out she&#39;s actually distantly related to him so in keeping with their whole inbreeding situation. I think Harrys new fiancé is also distantly related somehow too.  </p>

<p>Enough to dispel that myth about almost anyone being able to grow up to be President if they&#39;re determined and prepared to work hard enough for it.</p>

<p>Ordinary people are very different from them and there&#39;s a lot to be said for simply living an ordinary life and enjoying all the simple pleasures that actually go with it. </p>

<p>Fame and wealth and power are all traps of a sort, in which it&#39;s no longer possible to have that kind of an ordinary life or enjoy any of those ordinary pleasures.

<p>I&#39;ve not come across that re presidents though, super interested to learn more about that so if you know of any YouTube documentaries etc relating to it let me know. </p>

<p>Money is, to me, the number 1 root of all evil. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong here, I would obviously love to have more of it, as I&#39;m sure most people would but I think people who have been really broke but then get rich deserve it the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Further to Ike, it&#39;s crazy to me that I almost feel like I&#39;m a different person from learning more about he World over the last 12 months or so. Prior to finding stuff out I was the typical asleep person, who believed everything I read and saw on the news, had no idea about the secrets surrounding the royals and other elites, and actually had never heard of Billderberg group, or the Rothchilds etc. </p>

<p>However now, I guess you could say I&#39;ve &#39;woken up&#39; as Ike calls it, but I definitely feel a bit more aware. I&#39;m also WAYYYY more open minded than I use to be. It&#39;s hard to try and wrap your head around the fact that pretty much everything you&#39;ve ever known or thought, could all be false. </p>

<p>Thanks everyone for posting your thoughts and opinions it&#39;s been an interesting read for me this morning. I like how everyone seems to have kept the thread friendly, even if they disagree with points made, that&#39;s really cool. Have a great day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has a lot of interesting and insightful things to say about world politics, government, religion, etc. But then he starts talking about reptiles and just sounds batshit crazy. You can learn a lot from him if you just ignore the crazy reptile stuff. But most people tune him out because of it, which I totally understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely Scotty, I have watched a lot of his stuff and he has some great content. Was just interested to see what others thought about his reptilian thing. I&#39;ve learnt a lot from his stuff, primarily politics and elites type stuff. I tend not to watch his Saturn and other space stuff because my stance on space is really no one really knows what it is etc and we&#39;re likely to never not know even if the powers that be do know a lot more than they let on. He has some interesting stuff around NASA corruption etc though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I can say for sure is that most of the people arguing over that topic never read any of Icke&#39;s books, never watched or attended his lectures. I remember being obssessed with this material so I read 3 or 4 of his books and watched all the lectures/interviews there are on YT. It seems far-fetched from the beggining, but it slowly starts to make sense once you familiarise with the content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great thoughts thanks for commenting them. I&#39;ve watched a lot of his YouTube videos and he has helped me better understand the workings of the world, I guess I steered clear of the reptilian and also the Saturn/moon things he talks about as initially I think I was probably more close than open minded regarding those subjects. However after learning more from him in other areas I think it&#39;s now something I might slowly start to watch and see what info I can gather re the subject. Have a great day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve read somewhere that Phillip has a strong belief in depopulation. Interesting thoughts, and I agree that there likely is something separating them from &#39;Us normal people&#39;. I watched some Princess Diana documentary recently which for me pretty much sealed my thoughts that she was murdered by them. Oh it just so happens that all of the cctv cameras were &#39;off/not working&#39; at that time. Also they kept her in the tunnel for ages after the crash, she wasn&#39;t rushed straight to hospital like what you would normally expect to happen. </p>

<p>The press made out to the public that Kate was a &#39;normal girl&#39; marrying a prince, turns out she&#39;s actually distantly related to him so in keeping with their whole inbreeding situation. I think Harrys new fiancé is also distantly related somehow too.  </p>
