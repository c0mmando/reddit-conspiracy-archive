    <div class="md"><p>Man this is kind of giving me the chills.  So one of the main pillars of synchronicity is &quot;The student coincidentally meets the master&quot;... This whole thing started because I&#39;m having issues with my car and I was thinking about my old mechanic. He had offered me a job about 5-6 years ago and I was thinking &quot;Damn I wish I would have took that job from Joe. He would know how to fix that my car and maybe then I would know how to fix it&quot;. Then BOOM, Joe popped up on my Facebook 3 hours later, THE first time I checked my phone. I moved to Pittsburgh 3-4 years ago and haven&#39;t had any car issues (I took the trolley my first 2 years and I got a new lease around a year ago).</p>

<p>I live in downtown Pittsburgh. That happens to me every day. However when I randomly think of my mechanic from 5 years ago at work and he&#39;s the first person who Facebook suggests to be my friend (3-4 hours later), I hardly see it as circumstance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correlation is not causation.</p>

<p>Your cellphone/computer is not reading your mind.</p>

<p>I can buy you saying &quot;oh hey, remember Vinnie, the mechanic?&quot; and Facebook picking up on that. Or some sort of GPS shenanigans.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re just thinking &quot;hmm, I should get my winter tires on, ah, Vinnie used to be the best at that.&quot; and Vinnie shows up in your friend suggestions later, there is likely a much more prosaic explanation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you but my phone can barely handle Pokemon Go, let alone mind reading.</p>

<p>It sounds crazy no don&#39;t. I feel a lunatic for even thinking it. Yet 15 years ago nobody knew anything about the NSA/Deep State and that would&#39;ve sounded crazy to most people.</p>
