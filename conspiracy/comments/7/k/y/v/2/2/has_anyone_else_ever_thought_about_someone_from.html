       5 years, you were done! i'm afraid the temptation to return would be high also, just because it's a great way to keep track of old friends you don't see in real life.

       Man this is kind of giving me the chills.  So one of the main pillars of synchronicity is "The student coincidentally meets the master"... This whole thing started because I'm having issues with my car and I was thinking about my old mechanic. He had offered me a job about 5-6 years ago and I was thinking "Damn I wish I would have took that job from Joe. He would know how to fix that my car and maybe then I would know how to fix it". Then BOOM, Joe popped up on my Facebook 3 hours later, THE first time I checked my phone. I moved to Pittsburgh 3-4 years ago and haven't had any car issues (I took the trolley my first 2 years and I got a new lease around a year ago).

       Now I just think of how it’s literally making us think in certain ways instead of purely free thought. Like what’s the percentage of thoughts I have that are created by this social media
       <em>
        thing

       compared to true thoughts I make all on my own without any influence from FB and the likes.

       You ever walk by a streetlight and it goes out right as you pass by? It probably goes out all the time, but if you only notice it when you're nearby, you make the assumption that it had something to do with you.

       I live in downtown Pittsburgh. That happens to me every day. However when I randomly think of my mechanic from 5 years ago at work and he's the first person who Facebook suggests to be my friend (3-4 hours later), I hardly see it as circumstance.

       Your cellphone/computer is not reading your mind.

       I can buy you saying "oh hey, remember Vinnie, the mechanic?" and Facebook picking up on that. Or some sort of GPS shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're just thinking "hmm, I should get my winter tires on, ah, Vinnie used to be the best at that." and Vinnie shows up in your friend suggestions later, there is likely a much more prosaic explanation.

       No, but the other night I had a sexy dream about an old friend I haven't seen in years, then the next day her sister walked into the place where I work. Was a damn good dream...

       Maybe the concept of "randomness" is a human construct. We are unable to see the countless intricate miniscule connections that cause an event to occur.

       No but I’ve had Facebook recommend both my ex-drug dealer and my therapist after being in close proximity to them.

       We don’t run in the same circles but Facebook somehow recommended me to them right after I visited them.

       ... Seriously? I mean I get talking and having conversations and that being recorded, but why take it to this level? I mean, sure I guess its possible to read peoples brain waves in theory, but the ability to read from our phones or computers? No. That technology does not exists for many reasons, one of which, and most importantly, interpreting brain waves to real imagery takes a shit ton of processing power.

       Did you post about car issues?

      <p>
       Did you talk about car issues around your phone?

       As creepy as this shit is, it’s really brilliant how that shit can make connections like it did for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I just think of how it’s literally making us think in certain ways instead of purely free thought. Like what’s the percentage of thoughts I have that are created by this social media
       <em>
        thing
       </em>
       compared to true thoughts I make all on my own without any influence from FB and the likes.

       I’m starting to think we’re fucked.
