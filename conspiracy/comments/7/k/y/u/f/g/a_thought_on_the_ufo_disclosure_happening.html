        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s been a lot of debate on this sub about false flags and project blue beam around the UFO disclosure that is currently going on. This is an alternate view: Let&#39;s assume for moment that UFOs are real and aliens have visited the earth.</p>

<p>Now, people in the military have come out in the past saying that UFOs <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/8026971/Aliens-have-deactivated-British-and-US-nuclear-missiles-say-US-military-pilots.html">were sighted around nuclear bases and turned off the weapons</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBiMzxdc09o">children at the school in Zimbabwe</a> reported seeing a UFO land and said aliens sent them messages telepathically that they interpreted to mean (I&#39;m paraphrasing) that technology is a risk to humanity.</p>

<p>Given this information (assuming again it&#39;s all true), we could infer that the aliens have our best interests in mind. Which would make sense, sentient life in the universe might be very rare, and they see a species with nuclear weapons destroying its planet and they want to prevent that from unfolding (as it likely has elsewhere in the universe). </p>

<p>Now, if the aliens do have our best interest in mind, and we have reached a moment of no return with our climate and our culture, they might view that as the time to reveal themselves. And if they were going to reveal themselves, it might look like something we are currently seeing - a slow trickling of articles and disclosure from credible people along with actual evidence. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m ultimately saying is that what we might be witnessing is the first days of the actual revelation of alien contact, perhaps with living aliens - another species from another planet - finally revealing our place in the universe. Their message might be along the lines that we&#39;ve seen thus far - that we are destroying ourselves. How that message will be received in a &#39;fake news&#39; state of media where no one knows what or who to believe will remain to be seen. </p>

You see, humans are barbaric, shit throwing chimps.  Only lowly humans engage in wars and dream of &quot;conquest.&quot;</p>

<p>Higher beings keep their distance from us. They probably observe our pathetic existence and shake their heads in disdain. Perhaps, out of sheer pity they might intervene to prevent humans from destroying each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming everything you said is true, the logical course of action for a government that doesn’t want to relinquish their arms or change the direction that the last 100 years of humanity has taken, would be to paint the aliens as dangerous and a threat to all humanity.  Technology derived from reverse engineered alien crafts could then be used to create a false flag event that would convince the population that these aliens are the bad guys and not to be trusted. Aliens say “fuck you then” and leave us to be destroyed by our wonderful leaders. The end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree - we seem hell-bent as a species on destroying ourselves, and I don&#39;t see the power structures wanting to give up their authority and control. If the alien technology with crafts travelling dozens of miles in a second is to believed maybe the sheer overwhelming power of that and whatever else they might be capable of will serve as a deterrent against the sort of thing you describe and keep our governments at bay. Total guess, but if these aliens have this technology they could be thousands if not millions of years ahead of us. In which case they might have encountered scenarios like this before and have rules/regs around how to handle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe its a very small set of people that has sold all of us out.  specifically harvard MBA&#39;s that are unwilling to take the ethics pledge.  Only 20% will take the pledge.  That leaves 80% that pledge will never go against shareholder and profit interests.  waste into drains and rivers and soil?  Mergers and aquisitions then stripping and downsizing companies?  oursourcing jobs?  outsourcing manufacturing? </p>

<p>profit before people, peace, and prosperity?</p>

<p>it ALL boils down to the actions of the 80% that refuse to sign the ethics pledge.  Its a systematic corruption and the root of all problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting take. Question I have is, if aliens did warn of technology, why did they pick school children in a 3rd world country as the messengers? It wouldn’t take much observation to see who runs shit on this dirt ball we call earth. </p>

<p>I fully believe in aliens. I don’t see why they would want to help us avoid Armageddon. Even after a nuclear war and 1000 years of darkness, life on earth will continue. Earth could get a reset but, life will still exist.  With that in mind, why wouldn’t aliens be warning of the real danger to earth.. when our sun explodes and sucks our planet in, vaporizing it and all life, instantly? </p>

<p>Then you end this with some kind of &quot;messiahs&quot; like expectations where some &quot;superior&quot; intelligence has all the answers you desire which they are also willing to reveal with no constrains. Seriously?</p>

<p>The wishful thinking, projecting and logical fallacies in so many UFO discussions are truly mind boggling to me.</p>
