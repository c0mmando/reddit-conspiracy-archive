       This was one of the most repeated talking points of the election, over and over we heard about her secret speeches to Goldman Sachs, the implication being she had shady Wall Street ties and would do them good once she was in office. This bill is what doing them good looks like.
       <br/>
       Don't take my word on it, hear Trump himself explain her shady financial Wall Street ties:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.

       I don't care about saying Hillary would have been different, but more than the line of "she's an elitist with and she's in Wall Street's pocket!" was a massive deceit. The elites most certainly still got theirs. The man acted like their enemy to get votes. And now here we have

       Heh. Mueller ain't doing shit but playing his part as a political tool in order to obstruct Trump for on party of Elites so that they can regain power without having to answer to their base- the Progressives who are slowly taking over the Democratic Party and who voted for Bernie. He's a political hack who was FBI Director on 9/11.

       The problem with your theory is Trump/Russia was being investigated long before the election, when everyone thought Hillary was a lock to win. Also, that Mueller is a Republican appointed by Bush.

      <p>
       I'm not sure what Mueller being like 5 or 6 days into his new job as FBI director on 9/11 has to do with anything.

       You think this Trump/Russia BS would have been continued if HRC had won? Hell now. Do you see how they are now trying to say Jill Stein was also a Russian patsy? It's a political tool...to divide the populace and to slander the opposition as patsy's. Also- Bush was a Neocon warmonger just like HRC, he isn't a different faction at all.

       The aftermath of 9/11 being what it was, and the FBI playing their passive part in determining that it was Al Qaida and not an internal plot, is what this has to do. Mueller was appointed in order to ensure a certain outcome.

       Of course it would have. She certainly would not have stopped it, or could stop it even if she wanted to. Comey certainly didn't do her any favors. The Intel community assessment on Russian interference was released while Obama was still president. It didn't suddenly ramp up because of Trump in office.

       This isn't really about any of that though. This is about the fact that 500k+ Dem voters who voted Obama in '12 voted Stein in '16 in States like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. It's about tar and feathering 3rd party candidates like Stein in an attempt to reign people back into the 2 party Duopolistic paradigm.

       I mean, that's fair. But 9/11 isn't just an r/conspiracy thing...it's like, the big one that introduces most people to the rabbit hole. Since you are a skeptic, I ask you to take 30 seconds of your time and watch this video of WTC 7 collapsing...it was supposedly caused by an unchecked office fire on only 5 floors of the building, caused by debris from WTC 1 and 2...yet it collapsed, simultaneously, into its' own footprint.

       I'm a native New Yorker. I actually saw the towers burning although I was miles away (wasn't even on Manhattan actually, but you could see it far away.)

       I know people from the FDNY and NYPD who were up close. The status of the structural integrity of the building was known by them - it had to be - because that affected the status of rescue operations. They knew 7 was seriously compromised before it fell, it didn't come as a surprise when it came down.

        I know people from the FDNY and NYPD who were up close. The status of the structural integrity of the building was known by them - it had to be - because that affected the status of rescue operations. They knew 7 was seriously compromised before it fell, it didn't come as a surprise when it came down.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's a video with FDNY members actually talking about Building 7 and the Molten Steel they saw recovered from the debris field-

      </p>
      <p>
       And returning back to WTC 7...there's absolutely no way that an average office fire, which burns at 870 degrees Celsius, could melt or even weaken Steel support beams that melt at a temperature of 1370 degrees Celsius. WTC 7 collapsed at free fall speeds, as acknowledge by NIST itself. This would require not only the structural support columns on those floors, but throughout the entire 47 story building as well as its foundation to be destroyed before it would collapse like that.

       But as for the NIST and free fall speed, they didn't say it collapsed at free fall, but 40% longer - it did reach gravitational acceleration at one point. During the middle of the collapse.

       Rigging skyscrapers there with explosives is not something which could have been done incognito. It would have been a major endeavor. And nobody noticed the crew doing this? There was security, not to mention some tenants, working round the clock.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how wasn't the demolition material disrupted, or set off prematurely, by the explosions from the planes? Why would they fly planes into buildings rigged with explosives? Why didn't they fly the planes into something else, then just blow up the buildings, maximizing damage, and receiving increased benefits from even more fear and outrage? Instead they went for a plan with more risk and less reward? That doesn't make any sense.

       This video explains how NIST did indeed eventually admit the building fell at free fall, as did my previous video linked, if this is the wrong video please let me know and I

       Yup. OR has captured 8 State Parties, and Bernie is already laying the groundwork for 2020. There's a reason the DNC purged Bernie's appointed to the Rules and Ethics Commission...they're gonna try and fuck us over again come 2020. I can't wait until the day history proclaims HRC, Obama, Bill, and the rest of these Neoliberals as the fools they are who contributed to the borderline (and still, unfortunately possible) destruction of this Republic.

       . lol, just because it goes against you worldview doesn't make it not true. It's a corporate tax cut, dude. Do some research into, and I don't mean looking at only leftist/Marxist publications like the links you've provided. Look into how many small businesses are incorporated in the US, and look at how many people work at or own a small business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, big corporations will benefit as well, because they have the money to hire lawyers for write-offs and such... But, maybe now that small businesses will have more money, they too can hire good lawyers who can get them write-offs, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your logic is the equivalent of saying a gun needs to be banned because you can shoot yourself (bad - corporations get more money), while failing to state that a gun can also protect you from someone trying to attack you (good - small businesses will get a tax break).
