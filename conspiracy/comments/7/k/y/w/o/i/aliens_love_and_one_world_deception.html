        Aliens, "Love", and One World Deception
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, prominent people have been talking more than ever about aliens. For example, our favorite, John Podesta, tweeted about ‚Äúlifting the veil‚Äù recently:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       (By the way, the "veil" is a popular biblical reference).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom Delonge, a popular musician and freemason, has recently openly discussed his interest in seeking the truth about aliens:
      </p>

       </a>
       (He really is a freemason)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, let‚Äôs not forget that even respected political leaders discuss aliens. Ronald Reagan talked about world peace through alien invasion:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúCannot swords be turned to plowshares? Can we and all nations not live in peace? In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity,‚Äù Reagan said.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        ‚ÄúPerhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond,‚Äù Reagan continued.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reagans-1987-un-speech-alien-threat-resonates-now-steve-hammons">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn‚Äôt that "world peace", ‚Äúone love‚Äù, ‚Äúno boundaries?‚Äù thing sound kind of nice, after all, and what if it does take aliens to do something like that for unification in our world? So what?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, I think
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       aliens are real, it is possible we are being deceived on many levels. Further, this all ties back into moral relativism and the removal of God and spirituality in our lives. How? Well, I would love to discuss that in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It is important to note that this post is theoretical, and I am not claiming to have all the answers or even being right about everything I claim ‚Äì for a moment, let‚Äôs just think about some things hypothetically.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What if aliens do exist, but not in the way we are brainwashed to believe they exist by popular culture and popular figures? What does this have to with love and one world deception, anyway? Let's find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Interdimensional Beings
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let‚Äôs start with a fun theory. Relax ‚Äì we can all entertain a thought‚Ä¶nobody has to believe it! üòä
      </p>
      <p>
       When we think of aliens, most are under the belief that they are ‚Äúextraterrestrial‚Äù and somehow exist within our universe, within our space and time. Most popular movies show aliens to be extraterrestrial. However, I would like to argue the possibility that aliens are ‚Äúinterdimensional‚Äù (if they exist), and that would have different implications. To expand:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúThe interdimensional hypothesis (IDH or IH), is an idea advanced by Ufologists such as Jacques Vall√©e that says unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and related events involve visitations from other "realities" or "dimensions" that coexist separately alongside our own. It is an alternative to the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH).[1][2][3][4] IDH also holds that UFOs are a modern manifestation of a phenomenon that has occurred throughout recorded human history, which in prior ages were ascribed to mythological or supernatural creatures.[2]
Although ETH has remained the predominant explanation for UFOs by UFOlogists,[5] some ufologists have abandoned it in favor of IDH. Paranormal researcher Brad Steiger wrote that "we are dealing with a multidimensional paraphysical phenomenon that is largely indigenous to planet Earth".[6] Other UFOlogists, such as John Ankerberg and John Weldon, advocate IDH because it fits the explanation of UFOs as a spiritistic phenomenon. Commenting on the disparity between the ETH and the accounts that people have made of UFO encounters, Ankerberg and Weldon wrote "the UFO phenomenon simply does not behave like extraterrestrial visitors."[1][7] In the book UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse published in 1970, John Keel linked UFOs to supernatural concepts such as ghosts and demons.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdimensional_hypothesis">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdimensional_hypothesis
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever you believe, let‚Äôs for a moment consider that aliens could be interdimensional. What would the implications of this be?
Well, if there are interdimensional beings, could it be possible that these beings are of lower dimensions ‚Äì could they be demonic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, have you heard of Aleister Crowley‚Äôs contact with the demonic Lam? Doesn‚Äôt he look eerily like an alien or "grey being"?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm">
        http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, many, many have reported experiencing ‚Äúalien-like‚Äù beings on psychedelic ‚Äútrips‚Äù:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unique-everybody-else/201210/dmt-aliens-and-reality-part-1">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unique-everybody-else/201210/dmt-aliens-and-reality-part-1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be possible that these drugs allow people to go on ‚Äútrips‚Äù to different dimensions that coincide with ours? It is possible that these beings may be lower than us? Could they be deceiving us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not claiming that I know for sure if any of this is 100% true, but the more I research, the more I am becoming convinced something is not right.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        One Love
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When people have spiritual trips involving drugs, they often come back with the message of ‚Äúone love‚Äù and ‚Äúuniversal interconnectedness.‚Äù In fact, many (as mentioned earlier) meet beings (some that even look like aliens!) that tell them about this message. That sounds great, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, again, what if we are being deceived? At first glance, this message sounds amazing, but I am starting to think there may be some stranger, more deceptive origins based on occult beliefs, or ‚Äúall is one.‚Äù We will get back to this in a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Moral Relativism
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before we can move forward, we have to agree on one point. If all is truly interconnected, then ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù are illusions and exist only as illusions or constructs. There are many words for this belief, and many subtle distinctions, that we will go into in a moment. But just to be clear, these systems of belief inspire thought processes that there really is no good or evil. Let me give you an example from a forum on pantheism:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúIn Divine Science, my preferred flavor of Pantheism, we don't believe in evil.  There is nothing but omnipresent God/Good; though people certainly commit evil acts.  People commit evil acts out of ignorance of their true self, divine good, and therefore don't act accordingly with who and what they they really are.  But when we're afraid, we have to remember that omnipresent God is everywhere, including with us in that moment, and all is really good.  You can change many dangerous and bad circumstances by that realization. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       So evil is sort of like darkness; not really a substance or a power, just a lack of light, or illusion.  Whereas light is genuine power and substance with speed and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love and Light,

        http://community.beliefnet.com/go/thread/view/34789/13325889/Pantheism_and_Evil
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This new age belief is nothing new, and in fact, it is the foundation of most occultist beliefs. The checkerboard, for example, is an example of this ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù duality:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://exposingthematrix.blogspot.com/2012/03/masonic-checkerboardduality-symbolism.html">
        http://exposingthematrix.blogspot.com/2012/03/masonic-checkerboardduality-symbolism.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, ‚Äúwe are all one‚Äù, and the good and evil must exist together for this oneness. That sounds profound, but what ultimately, many are saying, is that evil is necessary in this world, and through these beliefs, evil can be justified. Are evil and good intertwined? Do they co-exist in some sort of balanced reality? Is there necessary evil? Is it all wrapped up in some type of loving phenomenon of existence? Well, that may be what Aleister Crowley, Lucifer, and the aliens want you to believe!
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I will ALWAYS go back to this argument because I have yet to meet one person who can convincingly argue this one point. Is there pure evil? If so, does that not mean there is a chance that good and evil are NOT intertwined? In other words, is there an objective morality? Here is my question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it ever right to willingly rape a child?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody with any moral compass could ever say it is. That would put this on the ‚Äúpure evil‚Äù end of the spectrum and show that moral relativism, the checkerboard, and the ‚Äúall is good and love‚Äù may not be as great of claims as they appear. Is there an objective morality that exists in our universe? Of COURSE, there are shades of grey, and I am not here to argue that. I am here to argue that good and evil are not intertwined as many may proclaim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I admit this subject is a little complex and up for debate, but I would like to go into some different belief systems that seem to be preaching that evil just does not really exist (or that is a necessary duality). Now before you argue with me in the comments, see some eerily similarities in the next section:
      </p>

       <em>
        Taoism

       - ‚ÄúTo understand the Taoist notion of good and evil, it is important to distinguish between the "concept" of evil versus the "reality" of evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a concept, Taoists do not hold the position of good against evil; rather they see the interdependence of all dualities. ‚Äú

       - ‚ÄúIn cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them‚Ä¶‚Äù

       - ‚ÄúBecause all things are God, all things are connected and ultimately are of one substance.
While various facets of God have defining characteristics (everything from different species to individual people), they are part of a greater whole.

      </p>
      <p>
       We can find this basic ‚Äúeverything is one‚Äù belief with many modern religions, but this is nothing new, as explained earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Aleister Crowley
       </em>
       Interestingly, Crowley talked a lot about love and duality, and he was influenced by the ancient mystery schools. He once said,
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúI was in the death struggle with self: God and Satan fought for my soul those three long hours. God conquered ‚Äî now I have only one doubt left ‚Äî which of the twain was God?‚Äù
It‚Äôs all about that duality!

      <p>
       I can keep doing this all night. Even those who are not spiritual or religious have found beliefs in ‚Äúscientism‚Äù and quantum physics to see how ‚Äúall is one‚Äù and ‚Äúconnected‚Äù and there is no pure good or evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I am not saying interconnectedness is not real. I am saying that there is something suspicious about the constant push of the  belief system that all is good because it exists as a duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, what is there is an evil, separateness, and what if people are being deceived?

       <strong>
        Going Back to Aliens
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let‚Äôs say aliens are some type of interdimensional beings, and let‚Äôs just say they are really demonic. Wouldn‚Äôt they want to preach this ‚Äúone love‚Äù philosophy to fool human beings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to Reagan, it would be easy to unite under this one love system, and we are all familiar with the biblical philosophies of one world government and religion. Many of us imagine an oppressive 1984-style takeover, but what if it is was subtler and more deceptive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to aliens, could there be a way for ‚Äúaliens‚Äù or some outside force to preach this message and deceptively ‚Äúunite‚Äù us?

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before this post gets attacked, I am not against love, compassion, or unification. However, I do not feel that we can unite under false pretenses. Further, if there is objective evil, I do not want to unify with any evil force, whether it be an alien, a demon, a person, or the devil himself. In other words, wouldn‚Äôt the greatest deception be to get us to unite with evil itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the guise of  ‚Äúall is love and good‚Äù, many strange things are happening in our society! We are told that we must accept even the strangest, most outlandish things now for the sake of ‚Äúlove.‚Äù For the sake of love, we must not question anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù in our world. For the sake of this oneness, we must accept everything!
      </p>
      <p>
       From no borders to 35023820398 gender identities, there are no boundaries anymore. And doesn‚Äôt that go back to what I was saying earlier? With the yin and yang, or duality, or even Satanism, there is ‚Äúnothing wrong with anything!‚Äù so long as it makes the individual happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want love, I do, but I want authentic love. I wanted to end this section with a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a teacher, I see many teachers today struggle with classroom management. I see many parents struggle with parenting. Many fear making students or their children upset. Many fear saying ‚Äúno.‚Äù Many fear disciplining. They want to be liked.
In a conference this weekend, the speaker said, ‚ÄúSometimes we say ‚Äúno‚Äù or set boundaries because WE DO LOVE our kids. We want what is best for them.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       Boundaries are not inherently ‚Äúhateful.‚Äù We need boundaries to properly function in society. When I say ‚Äúno‚Äù to a student, they may temporarily not like me, but that established boundary is true love. I want to teach my students what is good for them, and sometimes that means showing them what is not right.
In our world, when we claim all is good and nothing is bad, we are not setting boundaries. We are exposing ourselves to evil because we are lumping good and evil together in the classification of ‚Äúlove.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely deceiving. If there is an objective good and bad, then there is right and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever your belief system, I am asking you to question the new age promotion of ‚Äúoneness‚Äù. This is the belief system I grew up with. Not only was I raised in a Buddhist household, but my dad showed me the interconnections in quantum physics. I was a pantheist, for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I grew up though, and I was exposed to true evil in my life (many of you know my story, and I will share my years of abuse if anybody is interested), I now do not see the world that way. I genuinely see good and love daily, but I also see evil, and I feel that is separate, not co-existing, with good. (Please, ask me about the evil I experienced if you do not believe me).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, when we hear about this ‚Äúone love‚Äù, we also hear about ‚Äúequality‚Äù and other buzz words. Is there room for individuality anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I know this post is very spiritual, I ask that everybody has an open mind and is willing to discuss before attacking. I also love ending with quotes. In this ‚Äúbrave new world‚Äù are we losing our individuality, and replacing our spirituality with the world state‚Äôs ‚Äúoneness?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúWhen the individual feels, society reels.‚Äù ‚Äì Brave New World

       I guess I don‚Äôt see how people doing whatever they want (as long as it is legal) will result in everybody trying and being interested in the same things. It doesn‚Äôt imply people will be interested in succumbing to ‚Äúsin‚Äù or evil acts. These boundaries you seem afraid will crumble will always exist in some form. We‚Äôre just coming to terms with different kinds of boundaries.

       Not really. I‚Äôm saying that regardless of boundaries‚Äô morality, we‚Äôll always find ways to divide ourselves. LGBT groups are notorious for infighting and disagreement on who actually needs to been in the LGBT acronym, just as an example.

       Weird shit becomes evil when somebody is getting hurt, I guess? It‚Äôs a very simplistic definition but these things have to go case by case.

       I disagree. I think that is yet another way we have been deceived. Most pedophiles were abused first:

      </p>
      <p>
       There are many studies like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As somebody who has been severely abused, evil has manifested through my environment. It was not an inherit part of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       When evil arises, it is a product of environment.

       Ok, but people being suggestible doesn‚Äôt preclude the necessity of scientific study being performed on pedophiles, and the results of those studies being published.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either we allow pedophiles to do their thing, and not understand how and why they operate, catching and incarcerating those we find abusing children; or we study them, understand how they work, and devise ways to prevent them acting on their desires in the first place.
      </p>

       Obviously every institution has an agenda? An organization is a group of like minded individuals working towards a shared goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no propaganda that desires to make pedophilia attractive to people, and even if there were, we‚Äôve already agreed that pedophilia  is an involuntary desire. Meaning, you cannot convince somebody to be attracted to children if they weren‚Äôt on some level already. Unless you see evidence of a cultural movement advocating a reason to fuck kids, like catamites of Roman/Greek lineage, I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about with ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù.

       But until you can point me to advocation of pedophlia being ‚Äúa good thing‚Äù in the mainstream, this particular example of your desensitization theory is bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The studies and articles on pedophilia nearly always have an eye on understanding the phenomena so as to prevent new children from becoming victims. That potential is worth any risk of ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù, to me, and we‚Äôve already established that normalization is unlikely unless something drastic in society changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other examples of normalization you find problematic?

       So just to be clear, you would advocate for men and women staying in terrible, miserable marriages that cause irreparable damage to children of said unions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that‚Äôs all I see in the uptick of divorce rates. People have the option to leave their bad marriages now, and that is better for everybody involved. A single parent who tries is far better than two who spend all day arguing in front of their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abortion prevents these families from coming into existence. A person who doesn‚Äôt use protection enough to need multiple abortions isn‚Äôt the kind of person who can effectively parent. It‚Äôs pretty simple decision-making skills, critical for raising children well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Childless families are nobody's goddamned business except the people choosing not to have children. This one is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It‚Äôs funny you mention structure and community, because the nuclear family is a decidedly Western and relatively modern phenomena. In times before, it ‚Äútakes a village to raise a child‚Äù. People of all kinds were involved in the upbringing of children, and deficits in parenting could be picked up by other members of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nuclear family doesn‚Äôt represent the ideal, and it‚Äôs propogation as something to be cherished ignores the possibility of dysfunctional nuclear families existing; which is essentially ignores problems in favor of pretending they don‚Äôt exist, something I am not a fan of.

       That isn‚Äôt what moral relativism is. Describe what you mean better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whose values, exactly? The perception of ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù of values depends on who you ask and what values we are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditional values are being broken down, yes, but only proponents of traditional values would have any reason to fear this. Those who don‚Äôt ascribe extensive belief to traditional values perceive this as a benefit to society, and they would have
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       good reasons to think so. Ask... pretty much any minority.

       Morals is such an ambiguous term I can‚Äôt really talk about it.

       The breakdown of the family unit is a huge one. You're being isolated from your fellow man and you don't know it. This concept that's being spread through the brains of the youth through pop culture. That if you are not around other human beings you are going to crumble. High school students being taught shit like "to fit in or not to fit in" and "every man is not an island."

      <p>
       This society is isolating you, making you feel alone in a room full of people. Funny how that quote is a cliche now.

       Any, I'm going on and on, but I think you get the gist of it. People hate me for this but no one can tell me a good reason why we indulge in certain things. It's just strange. We're neck deep in the end times right now and unless you believe- you just

       Every problem you‚Äôre describing is the result of humanity existing in a technological world we created in less than 10,000 years... far less than the rate of evolution.

      <p>
       Put another way, we aren‚Äôt

      <p>
       Social isolation is a function of this; and the breakup of the nuclear family isn‚Äôt particularly relevant because the nuclear family is a relatively new invention anyways. It does not represent the ideal. The social isolation people experience isn‚Äôt because mommy and daddy don‚Äôt live together anymore, or because they have two mommies, and to say otherwise ignores a lot of happy non-traditional family strcutures. Which, again, the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù family structure isn‚Äôt actually all that traditonal anyways.

       But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come. 2For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, without love of good, 4traitorous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such as these!
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why life sucks. That's why there's war, that's why there's evil. You think world peace will come around and technology will heal us. Of course there's no way to predict what will ever happen because the future is so unpredictable (even though history is tricky like that). But like, no, we're in the end times. Right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is... (you have to understand how hard this is to explain) You truly have to see wrong for wrong. Understand yourself, don't do certain things. Understand the world you live in, and the times you live in, and act accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example.... our obsession with violence. Violence amongst humans is not natural. I remember my friend telling me that they love to watch scary movies. Another friend telling me they watched clips of people dying.Those are two diff scenarios yes, but the way violence is so accessible. Especially what you put into your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop this. The rejection of God tells you that we are in the end times. We were once good as humans, we must work to be good again. We don't have to murder. We don't have to envy one another. Don't do it. But the thing is, the devil is at work, and evil is extremely pervasive today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gosh the "information age" ppl call it now but if there is anyone to look back on us in the future, or the beings in heaven today, they will call it "the human garbage era". there is just so much evil and junk that we accept it as a fundamental part of ourselves.... the end times.

       A common theme in politics is accepting corruption and other things from the people in power as normal and society always tells us to look out for ourselves because that's just the way everything is supposed to work. But after being exposed to the way the world really works it really has made me passionate about politics after realizing that I can fix many of the things people think have no solution. Both good and evil are forever linked with us in a spiritual way.

       Wow. That was a good read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good and evil are intertwined with so many different definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say that they must exist together in closeness as one. In some systems, this is true, like nature and the cycles it must go through to recreate itself anew.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think of good and evil in the context of human expression, different words come to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generosity, empathy, and patience would be good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deception, corruption, and hatred would be evil.

       Thanks for reading! Btw I had a deep thought in the shower just now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In today's world, biblical or godly standards may seem extreme. In a world full of evil, we have understandable empathy for those who commit evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still without standards, we have nothing to live up to. In Christianity, we all fall short but daily we must do our best. The standards of Christ are ideal human perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even Christ broke the rules! The rules are important but they are standards and not necessarily judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live oyr lives daily to the best that we can.  I am trying to lean toward the godly standard though I fall short daily.

       Being good doesn't mean being ignorant.  Truly just and good people will use tools of evil to take down evil itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus kicked ass and we can too.  They are trying to demoralize us and take away any sense of confidence against a brainwashed mob, but the separation is so thin that it can be rattled into a higher awareness together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is ready to wake up because of the groundwork done by the occult In our popular culture.  We can use all of this against their plan if we do it correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are doing a great thing here by giving people a perspective that "nostalgia" and "love" are often manipulative in a public setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are virtue signals to hide behind and we must get people to realize this early on so we aren't outcast for being against "their type of love."

       Thank you for the very thoughtful post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have quoted and referenced many brilliant thinkers and writers.  Perhaps, individually from their particular perspective, they are all right. But, they are presenting abstract concepts through the filter of language, translated into a comfortable framework the reader has constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil interdimensional aliens, kind angelic aliens, aliens hyper-spacing their way to us in their physical craft - all are possible; all may be part of our reality. I suggest we will never know. You are right to persue your personal truth. For me, that is all I believe is important and until I'm omniscient, possible. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a tiny fraction on our planet who control the public narrative. They are currently working with their propaganda arm to reveal UFO "truth". Like everything else in their narrative it is totally self serving and will bear minimal connection to the TRUTH.
      </p>
      <p>
       For myself, I try not to feel hopeless.  I know I have the greatest freedom and the greatest job in discovering who I am. Anything else is an unexpected gift.

       I think they all have aspects of skewed truth. But isn't a partial truth still a lie? : )

       There's a theory that the push toward singularity is going to be an attempt to create a hybrid human/AI slave race and that what is generally called ascension or the rapture or the splitting of the world into two involves those who will succumb to it and those who are spiritually equipped enough to ascend to a higher plane. The new blade runner movie heavily features these themes. Check out Wes Penre's material regarding this, his site is a gold mine.

       Polka I‚Äôve held the same belief now for a while, that the natural progression for NWOnto take power would be to create a global false flag. The only thing that unite a nation is an external threat. The only thing that can unite a planet is an outside threat.

       I am a Christian, and don‚Äôt believe in extra terrestrials, but I have believed for a couple years now that demons or other dimensional beings would impersonate our concept of aliens. They probably ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù themselves to a select few who now are in power and worship them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Impersonating aliens also allows a direct explanation for a possible rapture (they will say believers weren‚Äôt called to heaven, heretics were claimed by aliens)

       You're on target. It would be very easy to convince the entire world to accept both a new government and a new religion if we were convinced higher beings from another world were here to help us out, and they were setting things up how the ETs did things.

       Demons are also at play when people think a place it haunted by ghosts or you contact somebody that died through a medium. I suspect demons feed off negative emotions like fear, lust etc. People using Ouija boards often come in contact with perverted inter dimensional creatures.

       Awesome post...
      </p>
      <p>
       Human evolution is not meant to be technological, it is meant to be spiritual, depth of awareness and complexity of consciousness. We are not on the verge of exploring the physical galaxy, but transcending it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think "We are all one", it connects with me on a few levels. One, it resonates because we need to recognize that we are all one species on this planet and to let go of all the fixed ideas that divide us such as nationality, money because none of that is real. Second, it resonates because of the fractal nature of reality, if you examine any one part, that part contains the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I understand how hard it is to reconcile evil and pure evil into a belief that connects those things to us. And I also recognize that a lot of the New Age movement is, well, off base I guess with some values and beliefs and practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I know that the nature of infinity is that nothing exists outside of it, and I believe that there is a profound purpose to evil and suffering, even if I don't understand it.

       All very good points. The truth is somewhere in the middle. There's a connection between all of the religions. They each have a piece of the pie but just a piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I think what these entities and evil forces are doing is playing the Trojan horse card. Everything
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       one but the one allows evil to exist because it is part of the one. That doesn't mean that evil should go unchecked. It should be snuffed out.

       one of the single greatest "redpill" pieces of info I've ever learned was the philosophical divide between Realism and Nominalism - to put it simplistically the divide between the belief in real universals/essentials/archetypes or that there are only particulars and relations between them
      </p>
      <p>
       this might all seem unrelated so I'm gonna try and track down a good lecture on it to post to r/conspiracyundone and I'm confident you'll see the significance &amp; how these concepts shape the worldviews you're writing about here

       I agree with a few points of OP, and disagree with many points, and recognize that it's pretty complicated, and the our practices as a society as a whole fall short, and continue to fall short. But logically speaking, your TLDR just isn't accurate. And if we're going to talk through this, if you're going to influence OP and thier thinking in a positive way, you need to be able to understand where they are at / what they were saying. You can't respond intelligently/share information in response to their statements/beliefs if you aren't even able to recognize like, what they said? Pretty basic communication skills I'm talking about here, Cripplor.

       I've heard/read some stories a while back of people who believed they were abducted and once they cried out to Jesus and said his name, the abduction ended and the aliens left. I can't say those stories are completely true but I also can't disprove it. Either way, it does fit in with the theory that aliens are demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       True Legends: The Unholy See is a good documentary that talks about the Vatican and its interest with aliens, the Nephilim, how "alien saviors" might affect religions, and how it all might fit into the end times.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Christian, I'm not sure if/how aliens are going to play a role in the end times, but it seems like there's a good possibility they will. It would certainly make a one world government and one world religion easier.

       Why do people still think Freemasons are part of some weird cult conspiracy, the organization is dying especially in the US no one wants to join anymore. You do know they mainly do charity work right? Shriners hospitals the Scottish rite with speech and hearing and vision help etc. hell out local lodge has pancake breakfast every month to raise funds to help those in the community, their election of officers for the year is open to the public you can attend. Seems like a bunch of regular people not some global elite.

       No, it isn‚Äôt a false equivalence. In order for that to be the case, the characteristics of the things being equivocated have to be known, but what the characteristics of Freemasons are is the actual debate here. Your argument presupposes Freemasons are, in fact, a secret conspiratorial society, and I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre about as conspiratorial as a frat house.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôve known a handful of Freemasons in my community growing up. They spend so much time arguing over what catering to get they couldn‚Äôt possibly be in charge of the world.

       They ARE a secret conspiratorial society.  Precisely.  I don't agree with frats either, but interesting how they both use alcohol heavily to control constituents.  I don't think frats have that good of a reputation.

       The only secrets they keep are their stupid rituals. They don‚Äôt have the ability to project power in any meaningful way. The most significant thing they do is charity work and have big conventions where hundreds of old people get together and bitch at hotel staff.

       Because they require their members to be religious. And also, the roots of the order were stonemasons. Literal builders. Fuck, the traditionalist Freemasons forbid discussion of politics and religion in their lodges. How do you take over the world doing that?

       Not really...the first Boy Scout president was JFK.  It's not the same cohort, at all.  It's called being disingenuous.  You should make a post on how the Scouts, frats, and Masons are all the same.  See how well that flies.

       One love is all bullshit that higher beings of false light use to brainwash people into New Age crap. All is connected, all is one... it all sounds like trying to push everything back into the cosmic egg with pretenses of extreme empathy, using human naivety and confusion to support the illusion.

       I don't trust any "thought" claiming its Jesus or God or whatever, alien or demon or whatever, I already believe in God, anyone who says I'm not doing it right is a fucking charlatan.

       Been thinking this for a long while. Been at this shit since i was 17 and now 26. Noticed a new wave of "woke af fam" 6 months yogi/vegan types popping up. My gut tells me not to follow the sheep. Crazy santeria/wicca practicing aunt says to do just that.

       Good thing. Youre one of the few i see using critical thinking skills on here instead of just being sheep. Refreshing to see posts like this instead of the typical shit like corey goode (gut feeling about him being a false prophet) and his fantastical stories of fighting 8 foot tall reptilians on mars despite being one of the doughiest people ive seen

       I don't believe in aliens and ufos having physical craft that comes to earth just to observe us humans. If they are that far advanced to be able to do so, I'd think it would be the equivalent to us traveling who knows how many light years just to go see an ant farm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly do believe there is a battle between good and evil. And there is such thing as objective good and evil. Every religion, every religious text, our archetypes that are reflected in movies, books, entertainment of all kinds all over the world, reflect an archetype that is likely as ancient as when man developed consciousness. An archetype of the struggle between good and evil, and the hero's journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I definitely believe in an "unseen world." Even physics acknowledges the possibility of other dimensions. According to the many ancient texts, there are 10 dimensions. The Zohar is one that comes to mind right now. Then there are other esoteric beliefs such as dimensions that contain "thought forms" that exist on a mental or astral plane. Then theres the gnostics and the archons. I suppose you can see where I'm going with this. All of these different beliefs lead to the conclusion that there are forces beyond this world that influence this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout my years of reading and study on all these topics I've come to the conclusion that this dimension we live in is an epic struggle between good and evil. Is it any coincidence that the new age "religion" for the most part refuses to accept that evil exists, and that it's just a state of mind that can be overcome by "positive thinking?" Or that it emphasizes a focus on the self, and that by just refusing to acknowledge evil is how you get rid of it? I think not. There's enough to get into here that could fill a book. I don't know if you've ever listened to Bill Cooper and his talks on how the New Age is being pushed as a one world religion as part of instituting a one world government. One, one, one, we're all one, right?

       Regarding people's identities, who/what they want to marry, or their individualism. If it is truly what they want, but is not conventional, what do you do? Do you deny them of what they want and try to change them? How do you enforce the boundaries and where do those boundaries lay? Who chooses the boundaries?

       I have seen you post here a lot. This is another quality post by you so thank you. I really enjoyed the read. I don't have much to add other than I believe spiritual development is the correct path for humans and ancient humans went down the spiritual pathway. To me it's transcendence through selfsipritual gain, kinda like the rainbow light body. Or its the technological pathway to cyborg AI.

       I am so glad writing and photography are your solace.  Creating in a natural way is such a great example for people to deal with their troubles in a natural and healthy way.  You touch so many people with your writing and many who read it create in return by lifting up your spirit with their writing in response to yours.  I, and so many others here, would have not gotten to know the special person that you are if it wasn't for you posting here on Reddit.

       So...beware of good because it's actually bad?

       Sorry. Not jumping on that bandwagon.

       There is indeed going to be a final effort to control what we understand about the nature of the universe and ourselves. Pay attention to what you are actually seeing, and not what people are telling you you're seeing.

       More like, ‚Äúbeware of things people have decided are good, because I think they‚Äôre actually bad‚Äù.

      <p>
       OP is genuine and I thus respect them, but their faux-harmlessness is insidious in framing their narrative. Note they didn‚Äôt specify any examples of what ‚Äúgood‚Äù things may be bad, likely because they‚Äôd be controversial.

       I‚Äôve had this thought as well. What if the greatest deception is the idea that evil must exist? Some see the Yin and Yang as Good/Evil or Light/Dark but what if it is simpler than that? Male/Female or Right Brain/Left Brain? Creative force + logical reasoning = balance.

       That is true. I have many desires that are involuntary. That does not make them right or justified. If I act on those desires, that does not justify them.

       Obviously every institution has an agenda? An organization is a group of like minded individuals working towards a shared goal.

       I see no propaganda that desires to make pedophilia attractive to people, and even if there were, we‚Äôve already agreed that pedophilia  is an involuntary desire. Meaning, you cannot convince somebody to be attracted to children if they weren‚Äôt on some level already. Unless you see evidence of a cultural movement advocating a reason to fuck kids, like catamites of Roman/Greek lineage, I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about with ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù.

       No, it isn‚Äôt a false equivalence. In order for that to be the case, the characteristics of the things being equivocated have to be known, but what the characteristics of Freemasons are is the actual debate here. Your argument presupposes Freemasons are, in fact, a secret conspiratorial society, and I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre about as conspiratorial as a frat house.
      </p>

       I‚Äôve known a handful of Freemasons in my community growing up. They spend so much time arguing over what catering to get they couldn‚Äôt possibly be in charge of the world.

       The only secrets they keep are their stupid rituals. They don‚Äôt have the ability to project power in any meaningful way. The most significant thing they do is charity work and have big conventions where hundreds of old people get together and bitch at hotel staff.
