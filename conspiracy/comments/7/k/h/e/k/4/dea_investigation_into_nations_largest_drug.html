<p>While DEA agents were considering a 1 billion dollar fine, revoking McKesson&#39;s controlled substance licenses and walking a high level executive out of their San Francisco building in handcuffs...DEA lawyers, the DOJ and McKesson&#39;s lawyers were making a deal.</p>

<p>The deal ended up being a temporary hold on some of McKesson&#39;s distribution centers licenses and a 150 million dollar fine.</p>

<p>For a company that makes 200 billion a year, whose CEO makes a 100 million a year that&#39;s a pretty sweet deal.</p>

<p>From the article:
&quot;The DEA agents and investigators contend that lawyers stationed at the chief counsel&#39;s office in the agency&#39;s Division of Diversion Control were &quot;intimidated&quot; and retreated from the battle with McKesson and its legal team, which included a former top DEA official from that division&quot;.</p>

<p>Hahahaha...that&#39;s one heck of a revolving door..I wonder if that guy will go back to work at the DEA now that his job at McKesson is done.</p>

<p>What more do we need to know at this point? Nothing as far as alot of us on this sub are concerned. Because we know that when it comes to large corporations dealing drugs it&#39;s all good. Our government has got them covered.</p>

<p>In all fairness, this happened before Sessions was appointed. But I expect he will have to make a comment on this case at some point. I&#39;m going to take a wild guess as to what that will be...</p>

<p>&quot;Marijuana is the devil&quot;!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the absurd part. I saw kratom save a friend of mine from a life in hell. He had a knee replacement, developed a taste for the long lasting oxy, and when he was cut off he started drivi g to the west side of Chicago where there are open air markets that make Hamsterdam in the Wire seem tame.</p>

<p>He has lost everything. Job, wife, visitation with kids. He read about kratom after several failed attempts at quitting. Complicating matters it tirned out methadone is harder to kick than heroin for him. Kratom helped him ride out the toughest five days, helped him get his energy back, and helped him start to crawl out of the hole he dug.</p>

<p>He is 1 year clean December 26. Without kratom he would be dead. He still has a mess to clean up, and some parts of his lofe are probably permanently out of reach. Without kratom, however, he is adamant there would be no life left to rebuild. </p>

<p>It is sickening that this corporate dealer gets off with a wrist slap while Bryan is fucked for life. He made bad choices, but apparently he doesnt matter as he didnt have the cash on hand to buy his way out of his mess, he had to live it. This story is infuriating, and the impendi g ban on kratom is one more kick in the nuts to people who need a hand.</p>
