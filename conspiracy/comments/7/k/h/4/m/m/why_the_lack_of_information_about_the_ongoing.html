       Atlanta's airport - the busiest airport in the world and hub for Delta Airlines - has been without power for more than 5 hours now, with no end to this in sight. Along with a noted lack of coverage on TV news (although apparently CNN just covered it for about five minutes), information has been lacking from all sources, including the Airport itself (note it's
       <a href="https://twitter.com/ATLairport">
        Twitter
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some reports have said that cell service was also cut when the electricity, along with most (if not all) background generators, went out.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on?
      </p>
      <p>
       The two main rumors seem to be either that there was one main line that powered
       <em>
        the entire airport
       </em>
       , as well as the backup generators, that was accidentally cut by people performing regular construction. This would be worrying for a variety of obvious reasons. The other is that this may have been a purposeful hack from an unknown party. What do you think,

       Scary thought. There has been talk about it with NK supposedly having a nuke that could reach the eastern seaboard. Detonated in the atmosphere it would create an emp.

       No. Because in that case the power wouldn’t be back on in five hours let alone five months. Testing first responders? I guess...

       It's not powerful enough for that.  A significant EMP blast from a nuclear explosion would need to be in the 1000kt range.

       I am beginning to think that this might have something to due with the foiled Russia attack.  Not just the power was out, but cell service and data/internet was cut as well.  These systems are not interconnected.  They are independent.  With all 3 down, this is an act by the FBI or other government agency.  I wonder if there was to be an attack in St. Petersburg and Atlanta today.

       I see it on the front page of CNN and Fox, though now on MSNBC. And frankly, I'm surprised both CNN and Fox aren't making a bigger deal of it. I was speaking specifically about their TV coverage, however - I don't think any of those networks have paid much attention to this story on their TV coverage.

       No need for apologies. Honestly, you're right not to watch it. I turned it on specifically to learn about this story but was really surprised that no one seems to be covering it.... CNN had about three minutes of coverage after about 20 minutes of me flipping back and forth, but it seems (according to Twitter and my own flipping back and forth) like all the networks have been pretty quiet about this. I wonder why?

       Yeah i mean.  Why aren't they Malaysia planing this thing?

       they cover weird stuff like this.  We know they're capable of at least trying and making a stink over it.

       Which means we know they are intentionally not doing so, which is weird.   Either Malaysia was played up to ignore something really bad happening coincidentally, or this is really bad and we're being played to ignore it.

       I live in Atlanta so this is concerning. The local news has been covering it. The local police are advising everyone to “stay away from the airport area”, so not exactly sure what that means considering it covers a large area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there’s been no identified source of the outage is concerning. No way does GA Power only have one weak ass power line going in there. I’ve heard some reports of there being a fire on the plane train near Concourse C. Not to mention, where the hell are the generators?! How is this such a disaster?!
      </p>
      <p>
       How, after 5 hours now, do we not have a source for the outage?!

       The Atlanta airport is so huge, that unless you are at the gate, you are so far in the building that there are no windows. Also, there are many floors underground, meaning pitch blackness.

       Certainly concerning. They should have redundant generators for radio comms, radar and air traffic control systems, and emergency lighting at the very least. Possible that they have redundant redundant (double redundant or maybe even triple redundant) generators for extremely critical systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once saw a high-reliability data center go down. The backup generator failed and the redundant backup generator failed. The UPS battery backup failed. The whole data center went dark. The backup data center failed. The entire network went down. This was because they had failed to regularly test and maintain their emergency systems. Generators need to be serviced and load tested. UPSs need to have their batteries checked out and replaced every few years. If a generator's start battery is shot, it won't start in an emergency. If the fuel is gummed up, ditto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Piss poor maintenance can do something like this. But if it is indeed found to be the cause of this event, some contractor's heads are gonna roll. A week before Christmas, too.

       Worth noting, some backup power systems use giant flywheels to provide power while generators fire up. They often use them to start the generators too. Pretty neat, super simple idea.

       I have a decent bit of experience with engineering infrastructure for city owned/operated infrastructure in Atlanta. From what I've seen, lack of maintenance is extremely likely. Even for quasi-critical infrastructure we provide full N+1 redundancy and often include measures for partial emergency operation beyond that. 
HOWEVER, evidence of years of poor management/maintenance practices frequently show up. More recent administrations are legit trying to address a lot of these issues, but for a large city, the scale is mind-boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced this is an example of improperly maintained and/or tested equipment, PR management and a shittily placed failure. The airport is the crown jewel of the city government and the outgoing mayor has larger political aspirations. They are likely managing information to the public for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Craft the narrative neatly to mitigate "egg on the face" aspect for city leadership
-Keep things under wraps while security is likely very much compromised at what would be a high-value terror target 
-Ensure that information released doesn't provide too much information about existing infrastructure weak points that can't be addressed immediately and could be utilized for nefarious purposes by people with bad intentions

       This is the ONLY reason I could see this being a catastrophe that would explain itself,  poor maintenance/human error.  People think generators are just magical but they require maintenence,  start up,  and testing to ensure they are magical,  otherwise they are a pile a metal rusting.

       Read a brief explanation that conveniently glossed over some critical details. According to someone very familiar with the incident, someone decided to position the backup generator switches immediately next to at least one switchgear for the main power. While in theory this would make it easy for maintenance staff to swap over (just a quick shuffle to the side), it also meant that a switchgear fire fried the equipment necessary to turn on the generators.

       Publicity of these kinds of failures are absolutely critical to ensure design and construction professionals can learn from someone else's mistakes. I know I'm about to review some ongoing designs tomorrow and make sure I don't help make headlines.

       Whew,  thank god we had all of conspiracy saying “maybe it as a planned drill, or EMP”.   It could be nothing or just a coincidence but my bedroom light just burnt out! Must be connected and a big conspiracy!   Jesus people, the most simple answer is usually right.

       The lack of information in the beginning hours and the length of time how it took for the mayor to hold an official press conference.... people on social media posting videos of smoke in multiple terminals and armed guards, but initial reports blamed the cause on construction workers cutting the main power line.

      <p>
       It just didn’t add up to me.... smelled like bullshit.

       It’s the busiest airport in the world, a week before Christmas... the increased passenger travel, never mind the cargo (major Amazon warehouse recently opened here just south of the airport)
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m supposed to fly out of ATL early Tuesday for business... I’m not 100% tinfoil hat wearing over here, I just don’t want to get stuck in another city away from my family on Christmas if they don’t figure don’t figure their shit out and my return flight is cancelled, if I even get out Tuesday morning.

       One of the biggest hubs in the nation without power or backup generators. Take Delta for example who routes almost all flights through ATL which would then shut other airports down because flights aren’t moving. All this has flights shut down for 6 hours? And there’s no explanation. This should spreading like wildfire.

       Exactly. Not only are they independent but this is one of the largest airports in the US and no one can tell me that they have not planned for these types of situations. So, wth are they up to. And Now I’m reading concourse F has power but they are telling people to stay where they are?

       If there was a problem down stream from the main power and the generator, that would explain why the power was off so long.

       None of what you wrote is how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downstream means nothing. all those "down stream" circuits are independent and protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two or more sources coming in and dozens of branches "going out" to various systems at the airport, like any facility (hospitals,office buildings, schools, factories...they are all set up the same with parallel fused branches fed in series with source supplies.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the main power is interrupted, generators are automatically brought online and service can continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way, other than catastrophic failure, like EMP or massive flooding, that the whole thing goes dark is by design.

       Wow, the ramifications of that must be immense. ATL isn't just the busiest airport in the United States -- it's the busiest airport

       , with more traffic than Beijing International. I can't imagine the chaos this has to be causing all over the place.

       There are repeaters in airports. If they become inoperable, the cell traffic inside the airport must stretch to the sites supporting the Atlanta community. Even if this is not the case, cellular congestion must have been 5x the norm. So many stuck travelers were people trying to stream content to pass the time. During summer fair seasons, large events,  and every NASCAR race, networks deploy mobile cell sites to accommodate the influx of mouth breathers. It is unreasonable to expect your phone would work.

       You'd think the IDF closets in an airport would have battery power for at least two hours.  If they're in the central one, at least 8.

       You might not be able to make a call, but you could text.  The text would go into the tower Que and eventually send.  There was no service.  No data/internet either.

       I was there. There was cell service, but very limited. It was hard to access anything that required data. My dad kept calling me and I could hear him perfectly, but he could not hear me at all. I did see other people successfully make phone calls, although the majority could not.

       Yeah, that makes it especially weird that they waited
       <em>
        hours
       </em>
       to cover the story. 24/7 TV news is usually
       <em>
        looking
       </em>
       for stuff to cover, but no one touched this story for hours? Super strange...

       You haven't noticed they are only johnny-on-the-spot with a narrative already to  go when its a pre-planned event like say for example an airport shooting or a plane crashing into the world trade center.  Unplanned events they have no interest in because you would have to to actual reporting / investigating and not fake news reporting.  There's no money in that, and besides when you interview your camera man, he isn't going to know what to say.

       The lack of information in the beginning hours and the length of time how it took for the mayor to hold an official press conference.... people on social media posting videos of smoke in multiple terminals and armed guards, but initial reports blamed the cause on construction workers cutting the main power line.

       It’s the busiest airport in the world, a week before Christmas... the increased passenger travel, never mind the cargo (major Amazon warehouse recently opened here just south of the airport)

       I’m supposed to fly out of ATL early Tuesday for business... I’m not 100% tinfoil hat wearing over here, I just don’t want to get stuck in another city away from my family on Christmas if they don’t figure don’t figure their shit out and my return flight is cancelled, if I even get out Tuesday morning.

       Most likely the major carriers have at least one cell phone "tower" on premises due to how many people use their phones at the airport.  Usually they have their own battery backup, but it's possible they were using the terminal's battery backup  instead and went offline when the terminal lost all power.  The next nearest tower may have been too far away or unable to service that amount of customers.

       Former airport terminal operations manager here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your 100% wrong.  Most would be amazed at how god awful most US airport infrastructure truly is.  ATL is getting old and even though they and other airports refresh the passenger use areas to enhance “customer experience”,  the airport is currently under renovations that includes running new power and abandoning in place and/or demo of old conduits.  The ramp level areas are dilapidated with 480V wires from several different phases and installs going everywhere like spaghetti.  Mix that environment with incompetent low ball contractors and a lack of spare parts and you’ve got a disaster brewing.  In under two years in terminal management I had a bozo contractor cut a power and/or control wire bundle on THREE different occasions.

       When I saw this news break I had a good chuckle

       I hate the US when it comes to things like this. They knew that the airport needed repairs but fail to do anything to not cut into profit.

       America is a country for profit, owned by the highest bidder.

       I read that a hack had occurred on some control systems that required shut down to rectify. First time power plant systems like that were hacked.
