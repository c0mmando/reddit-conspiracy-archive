        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Targeting and Gang Stalking is a massive set-up by TPTB &amp; Deep State. This is/was prevalent in Scientology communities to silence dissenters, etc. They may be the originators. It involves government agencies, Private detective but also regular citizens, neighborhood watch groups led to belie they are doing something good. These tactics have been used on real bad guys yes but also whistle blower of major corps and govt agencies, reporters snooping in places TPTB/DS don&#39;t want. Assange said it&#39;s happened to him even in other countries. Ben Swan is going through it. It&#39;s essentially what Weinstein did to McGowan. It&#39;s also on the local levels. Whether &quot;random&quot; targets, people that PD&#39;s and corps have a grudge with. I&#39;m experience it in a grudge with local law enforcement and have fought back and found out a major player in this game.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen and felt it first hand. This isn&#39;t just some power play and intimidation tactic. This is a test by TPTB. This is what the future police/big brother state will look like. Seeing how submissive &amp; willing to do anything for money people are. Or not even for money just because an authority figures telling them it&#39;s helping the community fight crime. Local residents and businesses are used along with probation/parolees in lieu of drug testing, them getting a real job, etc. Using ordinary citizens as big brother with no questions asked. Abusing power and public trust and goodwill, Violating civil liberties and privacy while the state stays at arms length away from it. People all over the country have stated they are going through this one way or another and most have no clue besides local PD&#39;s who is involved. But I do. </p>

<p>Digistream investigations is a private Detective chain, yeah you read that right. They&#39;re based in CA. They have offices/branches set-up in major cities and smaller ones under their name or shell corporations and some times in partnership with already set-up private detectives well established in an area. They&#39;re constantly expanding and work along side and even hire current/former local police and have former folks from you know which DS agencies. But also have everything from college students to whomever working for them for a mediocre hourly wage. They do the usual medical insurance fraud type PI work and such while the TI/GS/EH is way more covert but just as prevalent &amp; wide ranging. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been entangled with them and the entire GPD. 6 Vince Tofany Blvd, Greece, NY 14612. Look them up, a very corrupt police agency with not much to do. They&#39;re essentially mall cops that think they are bad ass. Also the RPD, IPD, MCS in that area. Also Clues Investigative Services. They&#39;ve used former/current recruits, even High school part of their outreach programs, senior citizens in the area, etc to try to intimidate me, follow me slander me, etc. They thought I was some big time drug dealer-criminal and were sure they were going to catch me. Nothing ever happened After years of tailing me, and nothing happening I started talking shit to them through social media etc and real rivalry came about. So they just stepped everything up. I didn&#39;t know what was going on at first but I come to find out is TI and Gangstalking. Also some Electronic harassment. </p>

<p>This stuff has been around for like at least a decade. GPD, Digi, RPD and other have built up a gang stalking network around my area and try to play some of it off as neighborhood watch but the gig is about to be up. Trust this is another breadcrumb me and some others have been hard fighting against and will be revealed to the public in the near future. More eyes will open as they have been to all the evils going on. This is a major part that will be exposed. Heads up if you know anyone being harassed in this way. A private detective agency in their area is possibly involved. Also Digi with their company initials conveniently being DS is continually expanding and are also getting bigger in the Hollywood area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would know it&#39;s happening to you. Though I&#39;m sure there are paranoid schizo and people of that sorts on the internet saying the are TI&#39;s or being GS. It&#39;s not set-up to be noticed by the average perrson. </p>

<p>It might be a little different for someone like Terry but for the avg. person that say is a whistleblower, has some sort of feud with a PD or big corp. Like Crews there would be surveillance,the target watched, home/cars bugged. But a little different than say someone the FBI has surveillance on because the want to catch them in a crime this will be just noticeable enough so that person knows whats happening. If it was a violent drug dealer or something there would be undercover and ideally the target/criminal wouldn&#39;t know who or what car is tailing them or that they&#39;re being tailed at all. </p>

<p>In GS/TI&#39;s they want Terry &amp; TI&#39;s to know. But it&#39;s not so obvious for outsiders to notice. In less famous people&#39;s cases Neighborhood watch groups, people that visit the regular places that person goes to would be approached by a PI or even cop with surveillance photos and told lies about that person. And asked to keep an eye on them, or maybe to even join their &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; Or the PD is busy we have a tracker in his car can you tail him for us...for your community. We&#39;ll give you something in return and you&#39;ll be helping your community. And so on and so forth. Little things like the person drives home at night from work. They&#39;ll have someone park in some parking lot or something across from their work or near their house and flash their car lights on them as they leave. No one outside the target would ever know. And the person sitting in their car might not even know they are part of something sinister.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your post is specific to your situation so really anecdotal, instead addressing the issue of targeted individuals and gangstalking in general, but I guess that&#39;s your experience and research about your own situation (ex: involved companies and dates you write as the &quot;start&quot; of covert ops in your location).</p>

<p>But I think you are just partially right, as you say they act as private firms or groups linked to private security or members in PDs being supported by civilian networks (neighborhood watch groups), but it would be extremely naive to say that they aren&#39;t also linked to intelligence services. It would be laughable to state that these are only private sector operations and there isn&#39;t official knowledge about it, even when the stratagems used to discredit and destroy reputations, to intimidate, smear and disrupt, are exactly the same used by the government in the past (COINTELPRO).</p>

<p>The biggest issue to expose these activities is the actual TI themselves (many people might not be, but that for a different post), that go around providing any kind of no sense theory about the origin of their targeting. No effort to obtain credibility to investigate these matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surprisingly to me, contrary to what the title of this post says, this actually <em>was</em> talked about in a mostly competent way in the big thread here about the situation. See my and others&#39; posts here for example: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7k8v1o/terry_crews_if_i_have_a_timely_accident_you_know/drd8zis/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7k8v1o/terry_crews_if_i_have_a_timely_accident_you_know/drd8zis/?context=3</a>.</p>

<p>But what &quot;targetedindividual&quot; says is correct -- you are overemphasizing the rule of &quot;private detectives&quot; and local actors and under-emphasizing that the program is a post-9/11 run by the major intelligence agencies and federal law enforcement. The local entities you mention may be involved in your situation, but this is a federally-managed program and they can &quot;conscript&quot; basically anybody within the target&#39;s proximity to carry out a campaign.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not clear to me from Crews&#39; few tweets alone that he is being targeted by this program as opposed to other types of stalking and harassment, but I am open to the possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry my main point wasn&#39;t to imply that your post was discrediting. Now more than ever we need to address the whole situation of electronic harassment and organized stalking, where powerful companies seem to have access to these high tech criminal operations (Weinstein hiring ex mossad or others). Our only way to undermine them is through expose, and if Terry Crews gets targeted there&#39;s a chance these crimes start getting exposed through tracking the origin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was suprized he called out someone. I was hoping he didn&#39;t. As a strong minority male in show biz it just doesn&#39;t sit right, a nice alpha male minority be put in a situation where  he&#39;s looked at as some &quot;freshmeat&quot; or &quot;booty&quot;. Reminds me of Dave Chappelle thing. Also reminds me why it was so hard for asian actor like &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; to get leading role back in the 70s.</p>

<p>he called that guy, Adam Venit out by name and as well as Russell Simmons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m been gangstalked and had my computer and phones watched for a few months now. People come up to me in public talking about things that I talk about online. They uh, they like screenshot my phone everyday and make it blink and shit. It&#39;s weird but it aint scary, although I reckon this isnt the scary part of it. Also theres this streetlight on a main road by my house, and when its dark and I go by the light, it will turn off and on while i go past it. It happens every time I go by it. Its pretty dumb lol. Some other stuff has happened, its like a long-term effort but I forgot most of the shit, its kinda lame.</p>
