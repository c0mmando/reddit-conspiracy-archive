        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I hear a lot of people talking about how an insurgency can beat a large conventional force in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are right; those countries absolutely can keep the United States fighting for decades and keep causing casualties and chaos for generations.  But it&#39;s not because of guns, and it&#39;s not because of their numbers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent six years in combat in the Middle East and the reason why they can accomplish what Americans never will is actually pretty simple:  they will do anything to win; including things that are beyond the comprehension of Americans.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are you willing to strap a bomb to your child and send him walking towards a military convoy of U.S. Soldiers?  </p></li>
<li><p>Would you have your kid dig holes in a road in the middle of the night to plant IEDs, knowing that it&#39;s highly likely those bombs will kill your neighbors?  </p></li>
<li><p>Are you willing to use your kids as human shields if the Soldiers or Police come to your house?  </p></li>
<li><p>If one policeman were standing among ten civilians, would you be willing to ram your car-bomb into the crowd to kill just the one policeman?  </p></li>
<li><p>Would you be willing to fill your house with women and children knowing that the government is going to drop a bomb on it because you provided false intel to them that there would be a meeting there of senior militia members?  And then call the media over to ensure it gets international coverage?</p></li>
<li><p>Would you be willing to blow up everyone in a church if some of those people were government or military members?  </p></li>
<li><p>Are you okay with torturing and mutilating U.S. Government members on camera to create shock value?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course the answer to all of these are; &quot;no.&quot;  Our military is fighting a VERY DIFFERENT war than the one you imagine fighting in the states.  </p>

<p>It should also be noted that our government has indeed engaged in some of these acts themselves (like torture), so it&#39;s not entirely outside the realm that they could resort to these measures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are correct, that these things wouldn&#39;t happen <em>now</em>. But if, somehow, the US Government were to go from a shadowed to an overt Tyranny, where all pretense of Republican rule was abandoned, and might was used to subjugate the People at the whims of a centrally controlled government (A highly specific scenario, but the one most of these people you reference are imagining) I think the answer quickly becomes: Yes. When stability dies, when security is non existent, when your neighbors start signing up for the government sanctioned thug gangs to patrol the streets, when food becomes scares and the economy collapses, people <em>will</em> be willing to do all of these things, and more. We are only 3 missed meals away from this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it&#39;s also extremely important to know that not all Americans would be on the same side AND some people would simply use the chaos to take revenge on their neighbors, minorities and the rich. </p>

<p>It would be the death of the Republic and the American Nation. Whatever emerged wouldn&#39;t be the US that those of us now know. It likely wouldn&#39;t even be one nation. If the US collapsed, we would probably see regional power blocs form from the ruins, some more and some less Democratic, but this could take an entire generation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you are correct. It would be a complete disaster that would suck millions of souls down the drain and destroy not only the social fabric of country but all of its critical infrastructure. Good luck finding the money in the ruins of the Continental US to somehow repair all of it. </p>

<p>I have seen your posts around here and r/conspiracyundone. I sincerely, sincerely urge you to change that situation. Get a weapon, learn how to use it. Even if you never need to, it serves as a theoretical check and balance. An armed citizenry is the last check against Tyranny, even if that Tyranny never comes.</p>

<p>There were millions of Iraqis that possessed weapons. Did that stop the US from invading Iraq? Of course not. In fact Iraq had much more powerful weapons than any &quot;good ol&#39; boy&quot; will ever have, and it did nothing to deter the US government.</p>

<p>If anything, your guns will be the reason the government uses to start bombing the shit out of you.</p>

<p>Good luck shooting down an F-35 with an AR-15.</p>

<p>It would be a hard sell to get them to fight other Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would? American cops kill more of their fellow Americans every year than all the terrorist attacks combined.</p>

<p>All it would take is to convince the people in the military that the people they are killing are anti-American terrorists... probably supported by Russia... and the US military would have no problem slaughtering them.</p>

<p>Ask the National Guardsmen that opened fire at Kent State.</p>

<p>Bloodlines aren&#39;t some sort of destiny unless this is power behind it from long ago. Bloodlines don&#39;t pass along bravery. They pass along influence.</p>
