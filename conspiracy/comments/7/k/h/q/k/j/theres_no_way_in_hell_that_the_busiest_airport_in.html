<p>Part of my confusion was posts from people going TO ATL, but even with those filtered there seems to be power in alot of these. Less crazily so, though, now that the dude from FL in a bright AF airport isn&#39;t in it lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in concourse C - around 2pm smoke started coming in from the central area - there was zero personnel / Staff from airport, Delta gate agents were terrified and uninformed. Crowds ran to the last gate - C55 where they eventually opened a door and brought everyone down to the tarmac where we waiting in the rain for 3 hours before a shuttle coming. One suv of homeland Security and one suv of FBI were nearby but had zero interaction with passengers or staff. All emergency exits have an electronic lock and without the redundant power we had a very hard time getting out. They eventually brought us to terminal E, no anouncements again, and pushed us to walk to terminal F. I saw one man - not police, more militia looking in brownish fatigues but not military, strapped with an AR. When two men stopped walking to check their phones (all cellular signals were blocked), he angrily shouted at them to proceed moving and not to stop. It was pitch black in Terminal E, not even emergency flood lights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cheap way to do backup power is one giant generator that is capable of running the utility load.  It means one transfer switch and little added extra wiring or control circuitry.  But this usually creates a single point of failure, the load transfer switch, and its usually close to the backup power.  In fact, I think Delta had a similar problem within the last year where a transfer switch got melted, wiping out primary and backup power for their IT systems.</p>

<p>The smart way would be to split the airport into sectors, each with their own generator, so that loss of power or backup generation doesn&#39;t blackout the entire airport.  But it&#39;s really expensive if you didn&#39;t build it that way to begin with and isn&#39;t terribly energy efficient from a power generation perspective.</p>

<p>My guess is ATL has some places with dedicated backup power, but not the whole airport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember I was stuck in the Houston airport when it blacked out in March. It was a mess, but I remember thinking it was all a bit weird when it happened. I know that where the blackout occurred specifically affected the main security check point for the largest domestic terminal. The area where the gates were had power, but down the hall the security check point had no power. That always seemed a bit odd to me.</p>

<p>The fact that only the airport was affected and not any of the surrounding area, in addition to all of the &quot;many redundant systems in place&quot; all failing at the same time, indicates to me that the official story of an underground 🔥 is a fucking lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister in law was stuck their due to a layover.  They landed and went to a restaurant to wait for their 230 flight back home.  My brother in law wanted to watch the Packer game, they had four hours, so he found a place with a tv.  The power went out, he was pissed, but the guy running the restaurant decided to be nice and made sandwiches, people were drinking beers, and people were ok.  Within 20 minutes armed individuals, not Atlanta police, just armed law enforcement, came in shut the restaurant down and herded everyone to the public areas of the terminal.  </p>

<p>They are at a Holiday Inn nearby now but up until a couple of hours ago they were forbidden to leave the grounds of the airport.  Something is not right.  I don&#39;t know if they are looking for someone, what happened, but few power outages come with armed gestapo demanding people drop their sandwiches and be herded into the crowd. </p>

<p>I mean, on one hand, they maybe want to make sure no one wanders around in the dark &amp; gets hurt. Then they can sue the airport, etc.</p>

<p>But getting taken out of a calm area to be herded into the mass crowd by armed men....Umm. Some red flags would pop up. </p>

We can still buy guns, get an (overpriced) education, say what we want, vote, and generally be successful with diligent work and average intelligence.

    <div class="md"><p>As a European, I have felt less free in the US than in most other countries I&#39;ve visited. In the US, you get approached by armed police just if you&#39;re sitting on your suitcase on a grass verge by the side of the road waiting for your friend to pick you up, and told to move on because you can&#39;t just &#39;sit down&#39; out of the way in a public place in America, land of the free, without raising suspicions and needing someone armed to come and tell you to &#39;keep moving.&#39; Every time I&#39;ve been in the US things that are normal and completely unremarkable in Europe are treated with the utmost suspicion and aggression by law enforcement. In 1999 police came and told me to stop smoking outside an airport in New York, in 2009 a police officer chased after me and my boyfriend and told us we&#39;d be fined because we crossed the road when there wasn&#39;t a &#39;walk&#39; sign in Chicago I think it was, even though there were no cars coming, in 2010 was the incident sat on my suitcase in Atlanta. These are just such simple things that you&#39;d think wouldn&#39;t be an issue in a &#39;free country&#39; yet in the US you get hounded by people with guns about them! It&#39;s ridiculous. And I&#39;m a petite blonde girl.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s my American friends who are crippled by debt from their college educations and have to pay significant portions of their salaries each month towards paying off loans, where me and my European friends no longer have student debt a few years after graduating, if we had any at all. There&#39;s the fact that at least two of my American friends have not been able to have children yet because of the crippling financial loss they&#39;ll have to bear for wanting to take more than a few weeks off to give birth to and nurse their newborn child, whereas my European friends get up to a year of paid maternity leave.</p>

<p>I really think that if you believe the US has the most freedom and opportunity then you&#39;re kidding yourself and have no idea about how other countries do things. I love the US, I love the American people, but your system is basically evil and seems geared towards crushing the ordinary person for the benefit of other ordinary people who happen to be billionaires. of course, all these other countries have massive problems too but they are way more free and easy to live happily and comfortably in than the US is. Especially for people who aren&#39;t well off, the people who have to do the necessary but low paid menial jobs get an unnecessarily harsh time of it in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promise this has been my experience, I&#39;ve no reason to lie about it! My friends from the US are almost all from California or live in California so maybe it&#39;s different there with regards to the job thing? I don&#39;t know. As for the other stuff, maybe you&#39;ve just never sat on a grass verge or done that kind of stuff because not many natives do it due to the unconscious understanding that it&#39;s not the done thing or that the police might stop you, so maybe that&#39;s why. I do know that my experiences really surprised me and showed me I never could live there even if it has many positives as a country.</p>

<p>Maybe I was just unlucky, but I dunno, there&#39;s a weird culture when it comes to government and law enforcement that I suspect you don&#39;t see or experience because you&#39;re in it and used to it, so you&#39;re blind to it. Like for example, your police vehicles are all dark and inconspicuous so unless they have their lights and sirens on they&#39;re not that easy to spot, which is odd as in Europe cop cars are white with neon colours so that citizens can see them clearly if they need help - the objective is not to blend in so as to be able to better catch people who might be up to no good. Just little things like that, oh and the way tax isn&#39;t added onto the price labels in shops is SO annoying although I guess you get used to it.</p>

<p>Sure I agree with this Strawman as I agreed to the one before. But the post didn&#39;t say anything about a massacre. </p>

<p>All they eluded to was that if someone was brave enough to take a video of it they would be killed somehow. </p>

<p>The same thing was said by couple that tried to film the actual arrest of off the alleged Charlottesvilles driver. They specific said that armed and men that did not identify themselves told them to stop filming and get back in the house and they felt like they would be shoot by them if they did not comply EVEN though they had ever right to film the arrest. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Did you know about that happening to the couple that posted the pictures of Charlottesvilles and their documented account that they felt they would be shot if they did no comply?</p>

<p>If yes then why not believe it could happen or be threatened to happen here?</p>

<p>If No, then you can not be so confident in the internet age argument that has managed to put a lid on LV.  </p>

<p>to me this implies that whoever it is on the ground would be prepared to publicly kill multiple people on the spot. I guarantee you in this day and age there would be people filming if something weird was going on, and we still haven&#39;t heard any reports of people killed, which makes me think the comment is unnecessarily provocative.

<p>You don’t understand /conspiracy.  Link proof, cite evidence,  just saying “my boyfriends nephew had to put down his sandwich and thought he would be shot because military personal showed up” is laughable as it is borderline paranoia.  Where is the thought process to make the leap people would be murdered? </p>

<p>America has suffered no intentional airport blackouts.  As far as I can remember America has suffered no military airport shootings.  So indeed, I will say something similar with a hearty chuckle, we have nothing to suggest there were going to be murders in the Atlanta airport.  </p>

<p>We only have Q as some source as to a black out but he/she neither mentions death or destruction.  Actually I think she/he says everyone is going to be safe or okay.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be a word for the following:
People are happy to read historical accounts of murders and killing by people in power. Vlad the Impaler, King Henry VIII and so on. They also accept genocide by rogue leaders in Africa. 
Yet when it comes to the western world, suddenly what is a very human trait is not believed any more.
&#39;Our government wouldn&#39;t do that&#39; or &#39;This cant happen nowadays&#39;.</p>

<p>The truth is humans are just the same as they were at any other point in history, they are still greedy, want power and many will go and do anything to achieve this.
The only difference is that those in a civilised world have to go about it in a more sly way. They have to cover up their deeds.</p>

<p>Agaian, I wish there was a word to say the above in shorter ways.</p>

<p>The gist being that people in power still kill and scheme, they are just good at pulling the wool over the peasant&#39;s heads.</p>

<p>Governments murder their own all the time.  It could happen.  But just saying that Henry the VIII did it for hundred years ago is a very weak correlation.  Government will murder their people both public and privately with cause or under the guise of justice until the end of days.....now why was the American government going to murder people in Atlanta? </p>

<p>I honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised. It led to some of the most proportionatly costly projects that San Diego Gas &amp; Electric has undertaken in the last 40 years.

    <div class="md"><p>Very odd indeed but I dunno, it kinna makes sense too. US airports have hella strict security measures and policies. Letting people just kind of meander about in an airport with no power doesn&#39;t seem like a good idea. As cliche as it sounds, it was probably for everyone&#39;s safety. Especially if they weren&#39;t sure of the cause for the power outage and were worried about it being terrorist involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About a week ago, i thought I had left my wallet on a plane (turns out I dropped it on the tarmac at the original departure airport).  Anyway, I asked a rep to go look for me, and he came back and said he didn&#39;t find it.  I wasn&#39;t going to stop stressing until I looked myself, so I went to the traveler services counter and told them.  A woman walked me all the way back to the gate, but when we got there, no one else was there.  She said &quot;I&#39;m not supposed to leave the door unsupervised, so the plane is right over there, go take a look&quot;.  Got to go back on the CRJ700 with no one else.  Was crazy.  Completely powered down and cold.  Didn&#39;t find my wallet, but I did poke my head in the cockpit.  I wonder if she would have let me go alone if she knew that I had a CPL :)  It was pretty wild</p>

<p>This could be a sign, The Delta airlines connection has me thinking of delta=change... as well as things like Antarctica or flooding of atlantis/a. If they really were behind the fires on west coast, then hurricane floods on east coast isn&#39;t so crazy. And on a related note, did you guys know the Age of Aquarius is officially bout to happen in Jan 2018? Not just talk and songs about it happening soon, so that def means something gonna be different in a few months. Aquarius plus the whole &quot;great flood that happened in ancient times&quot; stuff has had floods in my mind a lot recently. </p>

<p>a warning. </p>

<p>Other possibilities is testing EMP or hinting to larger scale blackouts for future. Also maybe there was a high priority target that had to leave quick without witnesses?</p>

<p>She gives a detailed look into it, based off older theories but also happens to match that song lol, but it sounds legit. I&#39;ve seen another guys video too that says something very similar, based off randall carson&#39;s work with the &quot;galactic cross&quot; predicting a big event (ice or fire) when we reach aquarius... but he said the winter solstice that happening Dec 21 2017 is when things will turn. The dude also mentioned that the earth plane would be exactly perpendicular or parallel to the galactic one which is significant. </p>

<p>No answer but seems possible. And this year def seems very off from everything else, I can sense the change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a theory for a long time now seeing the false flag terror attacks in europe, that &#39;they&#39; use them to legitimise militarising airports, train stations, harbors, etc. Basically any point where large crowds converge. Maybe when shit hits the fan they will nail people down and prohibit further travelling. The perfect freemasonic projectbluebeam type event would then be possible, by telling people in the US &#39;europe is complete destroyed by dem aliumz goys&#39;, and the european people the opposite. They faked the planes in the tv footage for 9/11 and 99.999% of people bought it. They could easily stage the perfect alien invasion if populations are forbidden from travelling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time on this sub because I was searching specifically for a post about Atlanta.</p>

<p>I CAN&#39;T buy the fire story. I&#39;ve been reading about this story for four hours so far. </p>

<p>Cell reception was hard to get -- but was reception totally cut off, or was the nearest tower just overloaded with pings from hundreds and hundreds of people trying to ping at the same time?</p>

<p>Videos of smoke were posted on Twitter, supporting the claim a fire was the issue. Some users said it could have been cigarette smoke, as ATL has smoking rooms. Some claim the terminal/concourses smelled like exhaust, not smoke.</p>

<p>How the HELL would an international airport&#39;s power grid be designed so poorly? Backup power on the same grid as the regular power? One fire took out the main power supply, generators, and backups? If so, how the hell could it have spread that much without an employee noticing?
But, I think (took my sleeping pill, things are fuzzy) I just read that toxic fumes from the fire prevented people from dousing the flames.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust our government. Of course, they could be running some drill, but I think officials trying to cover up terrorism is more believable. After only a couple minutes of reading headlines and personal accounts of the airport shutdown/lockdown, I thought something was fishy. After going on five hours, I don&#39;t believe this story about JUST a fire. Whether or not this was an act of terrorism, somebody is withholding information from the American public.</p>

I caught that detail because I used to do utility coordination for projects like that and I wondered if I would have screwed up in the same manner. Reminded me of last year when some dude did the same thing on the Bonner Bridge project on the Outer Banks, cost Hatteras a few weeks of tourism income.</p>

<p>They have to have major backup systems for that airport. And the lockdown people are describing is suspect. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s up, but the official story is a bit shaky.</p>

And I understand workers are human and make mistakes, but how much of a coincidence is it that one would hit the main power source....in a spot where a fire could blaze through all the power supplies...and if so, why couldn&#39;t they have stopped the fire?! 
How long does an electrical fire like that start? Did they cut the line and clock out?
And wouldn&#39;t professionals be more careful or aware of their surroundings than that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former airport terminal operations manager here:</p>

<p>Your 100% wrong.  Most would be amazed at how god awful most US airport infrastructure truly is.  ATL is getting old and even though they and other airports refresh the passenger use areas to enhance “customer experience”,  the airport is currently under renovations that includes running new power and abandoning in place and/or demo of old conduits.  The ramp level areas are dilapidated with 480V wires from several different phases and installs going everywhere like spaghetti.  Mix that environment with incompetent low ball contractors and a lack of spare parts and you’ve got a disaster brewing.  In under two years in terminal management I had a bozo contractor cut a power and/or control wire bundle on THREE different occasions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be back ups and all that fun stuff there.  And the fire knocking out the whole airport is odd, since you would think each section would be on a different line/system so that if something happens in one area it doesn&#39;t fuck up the whole area.</p>

<p>But that airport in general is a mess.  I fly down there 3-4 times a year.  And every time I fly down there&#39;s a delay going in or a delay when I leave.   There could be a little rain, and im delayed.  There&#39;s a technical issue at the airport, delayed.  Just always something causing a delay.</p>

<p>I fly out of other airports with wings that were recently de-iced and its not an issue.  But whatever.</p>

<p>Now the people mentioning the armed guards and all that&#39;s different but I&#39;m guessing they are not looking for a repeat of last years shit show with, I think it was, spirit airlines.  People bought tickets through them and then flights were cancelled due to pilots not having a contract.  People got pissed and started a mini riot in one airport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds fish, too, but I feel like I&#39;m too biased at this point.
If it was just a fire, why would they be locked in a room instead of evacuated? HOW was communication and planning with the entire airport so bad lol. Don&#39;t they have protocol for these situations? The employees not knowing anything was consistent in every story. 
Communication is bad at my job, too. But I work in a bar. They work in a high-level security international airport, the nation&#39;s busiest, during the holidays when they should be as vigilant as they can be. If a terrorist threat is a chance daily at your workplace, wouldn&#39;t you expect plans for that and any other kind of emergency?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked in a lot of industries. Communication is the biggest hurdle in pretty much every workplace I&#39;ve ever been at, even with stringent protocols in place for high security situations. I will say I&#39;ve never worked at an international airport, but I have dealt with the security and communications shortcomings of airport grounds somewhat directly at a major international airport on a regular basis. There are so many companies operating in that terminal with their own bullshit rules that may or may not be superseded by some ground operations bullshit rules resulting in no one really knowing what the fuck to do. A restaurant had some chill and served patrons what they could, and some bigwig panicked and called in armed goons to ruin it all, baggage handlers expected to die in a terrorist explosion and Amazon shipments kept moving. </p>

<p>Airports are pretty fucked up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your experiences are so far from the norm that I’m inclined to say much of what you said is untruthful.
