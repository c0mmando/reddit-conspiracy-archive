        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many of us are familiar with the one World Order, if you are not it is basically what the Rothschilds and elitists have been planning for the last centuries. It is a utopian society, where there is one religion, one currency, one country, one language, and there are no possessions. We have already started seeing some of these agendas taking place, you will never own your house because of property taxes, there is no need for cars because there is Uber, and this possessions will decrease in time, and eventually no one will own property. And a rebellion or revolution would be imposible, because all guns by then would have been confiscated, and the brainwashing would rule over society.</p>

<p>The one currency agenda is approaching rapidly, bitcoin, crypto currency, it is currency that only exists in digital form. I will tell you tell what will happen from now, the crypto currencies will become so popular and convenient to use that everyone will start investing in it, therefore the dollar will drop. And a fabricated economic crash will take place. Something you have to remember is that the Rothschild can do whatever they want, they can fabricated wars and economical crisis. And you will constantly see situations where “desperate times call for desperate measures” is applied. After the economical crisis the dollar will be the price of dirt, and everyone will see using bitcoin as a viable option. </p>

<p>The elite wants to make it seem like they can’t control the bitcoin, and how it randomly blew up. But yet they promote through every news outlet they can. If you are using crypto currency you are buying straight into their trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys just don&#39;t understand cryptos. It&#39;s been the dream of anarchist cypherpunks to create a decentralized anonymous ecash since the 90s. It will be a world wide currency, but it will also be completely decentratlized from any one group to control. If anything, Bitcoin is taking away the one world currency (US Dollar) and fragmenting it into millions of pieces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I&#39;m aware of it. I also know that the crash didn&#39;t happen, because these people are not computer scientists or programmers that &quot;predict&quot; the tether crash. There is no need for Tether to have a currency supply of either fiat or crypto. It can just be a realtime algorithm. This is exactly why people who have no idea about the basic principles should pretend like they are experts in their field. This theory made be believe in the steemit community a little less because they had so many believe in it last month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw an interview of some Russian economist guy. He was brilliant in explaining what bitcoin was.</p>

<p>What the guy said, there was a farmer somewhere in Siberia who introduced currency in his village to help him and others trade. The government crackdown on him and said &quot;only we have the legal rights to print currency&quot;. From that example, what is the difference between one person making currency and bitcoin? Nothing. Also bitcoin does not hold any intrinsic value. People give it value!</p>
