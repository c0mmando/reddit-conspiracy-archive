       Vince McMahon is wanting to restart the NFL at this time. Isn't that Trumps buddy. Maybe the whole NFL protests and everything that's related is the plan to bring back the XFL

       Yeah I saw that. The ball broke the plane of the goal line, the play ends there and it is a touchdown: instead they just ignore that and go into business for themselves.

       OK, I had Big Ben in my FF playoffs, so I'm FUCKING PISSED.    Anyway, he did not survive contact with the ground - the Calvin Johnson rule.  But I'd argue that he made a "football move", as he caught the ball, his knees hit the ground, and then he extended into the end zone.  I think that arm extension should be considered the "football move."  If there is a wildcard for refs to cheat, that is it.  That call did not decide the game, however, it was the subsequent interception.  So, I'd say this is a poor example of NFLspiracy.  It's more apparent in most Lions games (maybe the Jew-run NFL is getting back at the Ford family /s)

       I've heard a theory that the officiating isn't necessarily to completely fix a game, but to either make it much more difficult for one team or make it closer than it should be.  The real money in sports gambling is on points spreads, not in wins and losses.

       The best part of this is that it happens right after King Roger is given a ridiculous sum of money to make sure he runs the game into the ground.  I know a lot of people blame the protests as the root of the decline of the NFL but I don't buy it.  Monstrously large players running at ungodly speeds have turned the game into a bloodsport.  And while a year ago I thought corrupt allegations of corrupt officiating was a cheap shot made by angry fans I now factor it into my handicapping of games.
      </p>
      <p>
       A halfwit marginally talented former quarterback taking a knee isn't destroying the game, the NFL is dying from the top down.  How do these owner / oligarchs expect to expand the sport to Europe and Mexico when it can no longer thrive in loyal cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that pass. How obvious is it the game is rigged in favor of the great white hype, the Brady led Patriots.  Favoring the Pats is a business decision the league has made in the belief that maintaining a white Christian dominance of the league will appease the fans.  The league has no idea how offensive it is watchign this fucking cult allowed to win games on bad calls.

       Billionaires in other countries are dying to buy American sports teams and get their governments to build them stadiums.  Part of destroying the game here is to make it more palatable to sell the teams overseas.  "We have to go where the market is."  The London and now Mexico games are always sell out crowds.

       I was 100% positive the NFL was fixed during the superbowl with the Sea Hawks vs Patriots. It's what? The 2nd down, and you're gonna risk passing the ball at the end zone with mere seconds left of the game during the superbowl? No team would take that risk. And last years superbowl with the patriots comeback was also suspect.

       So the NFL paid off Russell Wilson to throw a pass and gave Malcolm Butler the heads up before the play?  I have a piece of flat earth for sale of interested.

       Don't get mad money controls the sport. And no, I don't believe the players are in on it. People like you are a plague on this sub, making assumptions and attempting to relate one theory with another when they aren't even remotely similar. In this case comparing NFL being fixed to flat earth no less.

       This is the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       A receiver must maintain the catch through the end of the play, the ground clearly causes the ball to get loose from his hands before he's touched. No control, no catch.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Pats fan, I will confirm that I laughed manically we vodoo'd another AFC team. Tomlin's face on the int was PRICELESS.

       I'll agree that different refs have different standards, but as it relates to the "catch" rule I think it is pretty uniformly applied in these situations
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the dez Bryant catch controversy from a few years ago, basically the same as in Pitt on Sunday: receiver catches ball, receiver goes to ground, ground causes receiver's hands to shift on ball, ruled an incomplete pass.

       I think that question requires unpacking to answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the standard on review is "indisputable video evidence" that the call on the field is incorrect. Aside from the standard it is important to note that "the call on the field" is what sets the stage. Two scenarios as it relates to review of a potential catch:
      </p>
      <pre><code>       (1) the call on the field is a catch, and you need indisputable video evidence that a catch did not occur. 
       (2)  the call on the field was an incomplete pass, and you need indisputable video evidence that the receiver made the catch. 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Second, you next apply the "catch rule" under the "indisputable video evidence" framework. The catch rule is defined as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code>          "If a player goes to the ground in the act of catching           a pass (with or without contact by an opponent), he must maintain control of the ball until after his initial contact with the ground, whether in the field of play or the end zone. If he loses control of the ball, and the ball touches the ground before he regains control, the pass is incomplete."
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Under this framework, it is extremely difficult to get the "catch rule" wrong. The one time a pass will never be a catch is when the ground touches the ball, and jars the ball from the player's control.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why no TD on Sunday, on video it's 100% clear the ball touches the ground, and as a result, thereafter the player's hands shift from their initial positions on the ball. Textbook failure to maintain the catch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the call itself, I think the real "wtf" moment for steelers fans is that the TE lost mental focus and outstretched for the end zone instead of protecting the ball and catch and going down at the 1. Plenty of time to spike and have Bell punch it in/spike again and kick. And that, is the difference between a belichick team and everyone else, the relentless preparation for absurdly specific and rare scenarios that ALWAYS seem to happen in game.

       How so, he has control of the ball in the air, crosses the plane with control. At that point it should be TD, are we going to start calling back TD's when they spike the ball in celebration too? Fuck that call, and you dumb

       Idk what you are even saying anymore. The steelers are the second most popular team behind cowboys. To think the NFL wants to fuck them
Over is absurd. It has happened before. Look up Calvin Johnson's catch and dez Bryant's. Not the first time this has happened.

       I know about those PLAYOFF catches. It's a fucking stupid rule and the fact that there is billions of dollars bet on these games makes it look even worse. The NFL rating r in the toilet and more bullshit doesn't help. And the NFL is a registered entertainment company just like the WEE. There is nothing illegal about the NFL dictating who wins games. It just sucks as a sports.

       If you know about them why are you complaining it's rigged then? You are getting away from
Your point now. It's not rigged, viewership is down sure. Once again the NFL doesn't like the Pats and they like the Steelers. They had nothing to gain by "rigging" it for the pats.

       Shill shut up. U weren't aware of that rule. U have seen 100s of td catches that were worse catches that that and called good. The NFL let's scores in for ratings as goes the NBA NHL MLB. MLB of course letting players use drugs as does the NFL. But when Brady might lose or Detroit might win well we make up new rules. It's not a rule that Jim or Tony ever figured would apply. But after 20 replay stupid Tony gets it.....no one called him to change shit up or nothing. A head injured retard just turned 180 for no reason and then can tell us about the RULE. Get fucked.

       Lmao. The steelers are the second most popular team. The NFL would get more money if the steelers are more successful. It's literally the rule bro lmao. But okay have fun.

       His hand turned and the ball was on the ground. Seriously, the NFL hates the Pats. Why the f would they give them the win? Guess they suspended Brady 4 games bc they knew it would help the Pats last year. Please tell me this is a joke.

       Fuck that it's not a catch. If that's not a catch then take the NFL and its shitty ratings because of stupid rulings and rules they make up on the fly and fuck off. I hear Mexico and Europe enjoy your illusion.

       In calls that could go either way, the NFL has big market teams that will constantly be the beneficiaries of these calls.  Patriots are always getting helped.

       There wasn't any angle showing the ball hit the ground. Therefore, bobble or not, it's a catch as it was called that on the field. James' right hand slid under the ball between the ground and the ball. Should not have overturned

       Idk what you are even saying anymore. The steelers are the second most popular team behind cowboys. To think the NFL wants to fuck them
Over is absurd. It has happened before. Look up Calvin Johnson's catch and dez Bryant's. Not the first time this has happened.
