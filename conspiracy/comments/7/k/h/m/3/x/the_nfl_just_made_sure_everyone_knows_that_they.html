    <div class="md"><p>OK, I had Big Ben in my FF playoffs, so I&#39;m FUCKING PISSED.    Anyway, he did not survive contact with the ground - the Calvin Johnson rule.  But I&#39;d argue that he made a &quot;football move&quot;, as he caught the ball, his knees hit the ground, and then he extended into the end zone.  I think that arm extension should be considered the &quot;football move.&quot;  If there is a wildcard for refs to cheat, that is it.  That call did not decide the game, however, it was the subsequent interception.  So, I&#39;d say this is a poor example of NFLspiracy.  It&#39;s more apparent in most Lions games (maybe the Jew-run NFL is getting back at the Ford family /s)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part of this is that it happens right after King Roger is given a ridiculous sum of money to make sure he runs the game into the ground.  I know a lot of people blame the protests as the root of the decline of the NFL but I don&#39;t buy it.  Monstrously large players running at ungodly speeds have turned the game into a bloodsport.  And while a year ago I thought corrupt allegations of corrupt officiating was a cheap shot made by angry fans I now factor it into my handicapping of games. </p>

<p>A halfwit marginally talented former quarterback taking a knee isn&#39;t destroying the game, the NFL is dying from the top down.  How do these owner / oligarchs expect to expand the sport to Europe and Mexico when it can no longer thrive in loyal cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Dallas.  </p>

<p>And that pass. How obvious is it the game is rigged in favor of the great white hype, the Brady led Patriots.  Favoring the Pats is a business decision the league has made in the belief that maintaining a white Christian dominance of the league will appease the fans.  The league has no idea how offensive it is watchign this fucking cult allowed to win games on bad calls. </p>

<p>Plus I am out $150, I took the Steelers and the win.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 100% positive the NFL was fixed during the superbowl with the Sea Hawks vs Patriots. It&#39;s what? The 2nd down, and you&#39;re gonna risk passing the ball at the end zone with mere seconds left of the game during the superbowl? No team would take that risk.

    <div class="md"><p>This is the answer. </p>

<p>A receiver must maintain the catch through the end of the play, the ground clearly causes the ball to get loose from his hands before he&#39;s touched. No control, no catch. </p>

<p>As a Pats fan, I will confirm that I laughed manically we vodoo&#39;d another AFC team. Tomlin&#39;s face on the int was PRICELESS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree that different refs have different standards, but as it relates to the &quot;catch&quot; rule I think it is pretty uniformly applied in these situations</p>

<p>Look at the dez Bryant catch controversy from a few years ago, basically the same as in Pitt on Sunday: receiver catches ball, receiver goes to ground, ground causes receiver&#39;s hands to shift on ball, ruled an incomplete pass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that question requires unpacking to answer:</p>

<p>First, the standard on review is &quot;indisputable video evidence&quot; that the call on the field is incorrect. Aside from the standard it is important to note that &quot;the call on the field&quot; is what sets the stage. Two scenarios as it relates to review of a potential catch:</p>

<pre><code>       (1) the call on the field is a catch, and you need indisputable video evidence that a catch did not occur. 
       (2)  the call on the field was an incomplete pass, and you need indisputable video evidence that the receiver made the catch. 
</code></pre>

<p>Second, you next apply the &quot;catch rule&quot; under the &quot;indisputable video evidence&quot; framework. The catch rule is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>          &quot;If a player goes to the ground in the act of catching           a pass (with or without contact by an opponent), he must maintain control of the ball until after his initial contact with the ground, whether in the field of play or the end zone. If he loses control of the ball, and the ball touches the ground before he regains control, the pass is incomplete.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Under this framework, it is extremely difficult to get the &quot;catch rule&quot; wrong. The one time a pass will never be a catch is when the ground touches the ball, and jars the ball from the player&#39;s control. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why no TD on Sunday, on video it&#39;s 100% clear the ball touches the ground, and as a result, thereafter the player&#39;s hands shift from their initial positions on the ball. Textbook failure to maintain the catch. </p>

<p>Aside from the call itself, I think the real &quot;wtf&quot; moment for steelers fans is that the TE lost mental focus and outstretched for the end zone instead of protecting the ball and catch and going down at the 1. Plenty of time to spike and have Bell punch it in/spike again and kick. And that, is the difference between a belichick team and everyone else, the relentless preparation for absurdly specific and rare scenarios that ALWAYS seem to happen in game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shill shut up. U weren&#39;t aware of that rule. U have seen 100s of td catches that were worse catches that that and called good. The NFL let&#39;s scores in for ratings as goes the NBA NHL MLB. MLB of course letting players use drugs as does the NFL. But when Brady might lose or Detroit might win well we make up new rules. It&#39;s not a rule that Jim or Tony ever figured would apply. But after 20 replay stupid Tony gets it.....no one called him to change shit up or nothing. A head injured retard just turned 180 for no reason and then can tell us about the RULE. Get fucked.</p>
