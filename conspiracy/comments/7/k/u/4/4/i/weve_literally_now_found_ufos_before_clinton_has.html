That&#39;s the AG, Jeff sessions job who recused himself due to pressure; however with all these investigations going on don&#39;t think she&#39;s safe; more and more between mueller and her, etc. they are discovering how they rigged investigations and are involved with the ruskies via uranium 1 deal/fusion god investigations. It&#39;s not an overnight process but it&#39;s in the works; it&#39;s gonna be a slow process especially due to he corruption and media scrutiny at every turn, but truth will eventually prevail. I mean look guy decide to audit the pentagon for 29 trillion missing(that pretty much covers national debt)a first in American history. Deepstate doesn&#39;t like this because their activities are gonna start to be uncovered. Next hopefully fed reserve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember when Donald Trump first started getting pushed on this site and posts about HRC were on the front page all the time.  I remember seeing something about her having epilepsy, about her being &quot;gravely ill&quot;.  At the time, I thought, some of this kind of looks credible.  Now, though, she didn&#39;t die, did she?  Bill Clinton wasn&#39;t murdered like people were saying was going to happen.  Obama never opened FEMA camps in Texas to declare martial law.  Sharia law has never been declared.  I don&#39;t understand when rightwingers are going to realize that they are being fed bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She did have all sorts of health issues, she also fainted several times there&#39;s even video of it when they tried to hide it. You know Jon Mccain was diagnosed with brain cancer and is still alive doesn&#39;t mean reports of the diagnosis isn&#39;t true, people don&#39;t just die over night in every scenario. I never heard about Bill Clinton going to be murdered;  however I have heard over the past couple decades the over a dozen people who were going to testify against the clintons or had information they were going to leak mysteriously end up dead, most recent famous case being Seth Rich.  Sharia law is being pushed by some of the lefts most outspoken &quot;warriors&quot; like Linda Sarsour; yes the same woman who was leading the pussy hat female march funded by Soros following trumps election. </p>

<p>I know I didn&#39;t address FEMA camps etc. but you got to understand that a lot of this stuff is true and there are people actively on the left putting out disinformation or twisting the truth in order to discredit looking at the information entirely.</p>

<p>Sorta like someone living in a wolf infested woods where people are getting killed left and right but the boy who cried wolf is amongst them. So naturally some are gonna be skeptical despite evidence because the boy is putting out disinformation. I know it&#39;s a butchered analogy but hopefully you get where I am coming from. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of Linda Sarsour but as far as I can tell the sharia law that she is pushing is a personal Islam thing, not an actual legal framework.  Don&#39;t quote me on that because I just looked her up for like 30 seconds.  It doesn&#39;t even matter what she believes, because you&#39;re using her as a boogeyman in order to push more bullshit.  There&#39;s people on the right, like David Duke, with some pretty heinous beliefs but I don&#39;t equate them with the rest of the right.  That&#39;s not a courtesy you guys extend to us.</p>

<p>You never heard of Linda Sarsour? She was pretty much leading this. Not to come off rude but you seem to be ignorant to quite a few things or facts which might explain your limited view. You should look into Linda Sarsour her connection to FGM, terrorists groups in Palestine, and her advocacy of Sharia Law in the US all while leading a feminist march movement ironically. Hope this broadens your perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All your links say is that Soros gave money to groups that were involved in the march.  He&#39;s been giving money to liberal groups for decades, so it makes sense that he would have given millions of dollars to groups like Planned Parenthood by now.  Even if Soros did spend money to help organize the event, who gives a shit, like I said, you&#39;re using him as a boogeyman, the fact is that millions of women went to Washington to protest, that shit happened.</p>

<p>The left isn&#39;t pushing for Sharia law.  That&#39;s what I am trying to tell you, I am telling you that you keep bringing up what&#39;s her name because you can&#39;t deal with the fact that the left doesn&#39;t want Sharia law, that&#39;s just rightwing bullshit.  The right uses boogeymen to push this bullshit narrative, and all you have given me is boogeymen and bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah so he funded the march. You think all those signs and the gear and organization was provided free? Soros has been overthrowing countries and funding revolutions for decades, he&#39;s wanted in several countries. He&#39;s on record trying to crash the British pound several times, and funding the neo nazis in Ukraine admittedly, he is wanted in several countries. It&#39;s an issue he&#39;s involved with all these anti-trump groups and ANTIFA because it&#39;s apart of the same blueprint he uses to cause civil insurrection and overthrow governments, and with the violent actions antifa has been taken rioting, destroying stuff, hospitalizing people on a regular basis it&#39;s not hard to see why Soros is a issue. </p>

<p>I understand the left on average isn&#39;t pushing sharia law because most of them don&#39;t appear to know what it is on average, however one of their champions Linda Sarsour, is pushing for it whenever she gets a chance, and she&#39;s well connected and funded by Soros groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah dude, I hate how much Antifa has been hospitalizing people, just filling up hospitals with their victims.  You&#39;re just buying all this bullshit without facing the real world.  In the real world, the left is full of real people who have real changes they want to make to government, and the right is the same.  There are bad people and there are good people but there aren&#39;t shadowy cabals of leftwing villians trying to overthrow the government implement sharia law.</p>

<p>All this antifa, soros, sharia law shit is just bullshit pushed by rightwing sources of bullshit to convince people like you of shit that isn&#39;t true.  If people think that Soros-paid Antifa thugs are coming to take away their guns maybe they won&#39;t notice while the right guts consumer protections, fucks the environment, and does everything they can to move wealth back up the ladder to the wealthiest.  Sites like breitbart and infowars are a cynical attempt to push a narrative.  All the sources you gave me on Soros are all sites pushing the same narrative, the world is a scary place, filled with islamist leftists trying to abort your babies, take your guns, and everything bad in your life is the result of immigrants.

    <div class="md"><p>That made no sense whatsoever. However if they wanna go after trump than prosecute Hillary for her crimes then go after trump. Can&#39;t let her endlesss list of corrupt activities be ignored and let her go free, but cry about Trumps alleged collusion(which is proven to be false now) and demand an impeachment. However until that happens this trump harassment garbage is nothing but a political move; hence the lack of evidence and constant speculations and reports of the speculation. </p>

<p>If you ever studied psychology and are aware of the term &quot;gas-lighting&quot;; this is exactly what they are attempting with the Russian story-- and of course the accusers are gonna say this is what people questioning the collusion are saying trumps doing, but it&#39;s clear when you see there&#39;s no evidence vs trump and plenty of evidence against the accusers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to believe that given how much I&#39;m told he&#39;s dumb everyday but I don&#39;t really have any solid evidence to say he&#39;s dumb or incompetent because just looking at his life prior to his presidency he&#39;s pretty much the definition of success, and prior to politics his life achievements compared to community organizer obamas is like night and day yet teleprompter obama gets all the praise because he&#39;s a good speaker. Con artists are good speakers and if you look beyond his speeches and at the raw data of what obama pulled off it&#39;s quite sad and frightening given the hope and change that was promised. Where as trump it&#39;s the opposite, not the greatest speaker, more blue collar-- legitimately too not the act politicians like to put on, but yet data shows what he&#39;s done for the country so far, especially on an economic level is unheard of in modern politics, stock market is breaking records everyday on behalf of the US and everyone is doing better. Black unemployment doubled under Obama where as it just came out black unemployment under trump is at a 17 year high and projected to continue to improve.(<a href="https://nationalcenter.org/2017/10/17/black-activists-credit-trump-policies-helping-create-17-year-low-black-unemployment/">https://nationalcenter.org/2017/10/17/black-activists-credit-trump-policies-helping-create-17-year-low-black-unemployment/</a> )</p>

<p>Even CNN came out and had to admit trump is actually living up to his promises unlike former presidents and its only the first year; even labeled him as &quot;Keeper of Promises&quot; (<a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/12/07/politics/donald-trump-promises-kept/index.html">https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/12/07/politics/donald-trump-promises-kept/index.html</a>)</p>

<p>Listen, at the end of the day, Clinton is shrouded in crime. Her dad who she lied about during the elections Hugh Rodham, whom she said was just a hard working blue collar worker yadda yadda yadda, was actually a big time mobster who took over for Al Capone in Chicago after Capone was removed. She then became a criminal lawyer her first case being getting a child rapist off who brutally raped a child so bad their insides fell out, the person she defended she knew was guilty and laughed about it on tape. She then became the sleazy  politican she is today who changed her colors to whatever suited the time, hell she didn&#39;t accept gay marriage until 2012 and said how she and encourages others to have a public stance on issues and private stance-- talk about deceptive ? Yet we are still poking at trump spending millions over anecdotal and speculative evidence which is proven to be wrong and drawn up over partisan views? Come on now. </p>

<p>I understand how easy it is to hate trump given all the tv <em>programming</em> and media tells you to do so, but you don&#39;t have to look too far to see the truth by looking at raw data</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how he&#39;s a failed business man, he is/was recognized as one of the most successful real estate moguls of all time, and you may not have liked him very much, prior to criticizing obamas phony birth certificate and running, he was loved by everyone, praised by rappers on the regular, Although I don&#39;t like alot of the people who he had appointed either I don&#39;t think obamas crooked administration (Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Hillary etc.) was any better or Bush&#39;s or Clintons. This administration has been a lot better and since Obama and Clinton both have stay behind factions within the administration it further makes it harder to get things done, particularly when that&#39;s their main goal,  be a wrench in the works, hence the relentless attacks about a phony Russian collusion story, all to muck things up. </p>

<p>I understand the hate though when all you hear is negative stuff about the guy, which is purposely done as a gas-lighting technique, you&#39;re gonna dislike the guy or won&#39;t take much to make you dislike him. If you already hated him then just makes you feel even better cause well that&#39;s in a way a like a confirmation bias although the allegations are phoney which we are now finding out what we already knew, the people who are accusing of collusion and corruption are the ones who are guilty of it themselves, as evidence is now showing. Unfortunately litigation process is a long one but eventually the way things are going justice will be served maybe not to it&#39;s fullest extent but based on the hearings recently it certainly looks that way.</p>

<p>Unfair treatment you say? </p>

<p>Yeah, if I were her I would have deleted the emails too just to spite James Comey, you know why? </p>

<p>Listen to this:</p>

<p>&quot;Clinton Email Server&quot; </p>

<p>Before all this nonsense from the right, looking for any dirt, we know they love that, they decided to attack her email server because it had secure and top secret info on it and the arguement from the right was &quot;someone could have hacked it and gotten all the info they needed to destroy America.&quot; The funny thing is, I honestly think her server was probably more secure that the one she would have been using at the state department, her boss said it was okay. So WTF is the big deal? Trumps team continues to use private email servers, you know why you don&#39;t hear about it? Because the left knows how to pick its battles, I&#39;m sure their shit is fine and so the left moves on, but now literally 2 years after it&#39;s been dropped it gets brought back up to the surface. If you cannot forgive her then don&#39;t, that&#39;s totally your decision but just now those who argue this will always be seen for what they really are (whether they have unpackaged this reality or not), Hillary had to go through twice what any man has ever had to do to run for president, and it&#39;s disrespectful to continue the mantra of lock her up. Lock yourself up, for clearly you have probably never truly respected a women in life and this is why we have sexual harassment charges flying left and right. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of Linda Sarsour but as far as I can tell the sharia law that she is pushing is a personal Islam thing, not an actual legal framework.  Don&#39;t quote me on that because I just looked her up for like 30 seconds.  It doesn&#39;t even matter what she believes, because you&#39;re using her as a boogeyman in order to push more bullshit.  There&#39;s people on the right, like David Duke, with some pretty heinous beliefs but I don&#39;t equate them with the rest of the right.  That&#39;s not a courtesy you guys extend to us.</p>
