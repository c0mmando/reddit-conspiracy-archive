        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am here to help right the wrongs of the past. &#39;As above so below&#39; is as true as it ever was, back in the days of Noah. The terrible things that were done to me throughout my youth were not done <em>at random</em>, there was a always a spiritual reason for my pain. </p>

<p>I was psychologically tormented by demonic entities from the time I was 7 years old. A being of light came to me and whispered the secrets of heaven in my ear. My parents were devout Christians, and my lack of belief contributed to a difficult upbringing. I never lied to them and pretended like I believed their religion. I told them the truth, that their religion has been altered many times and that surely Jesus&#39; original teachings were in there somewhere; somewhere behind all the lies. </p>

<p>I experimented heavily with drugs as a teenager, learning to use my altered consciousness to interact with spiritual beings. I learned that angels weren&#39;t all that nice and that demons weren&#39;t all that bad. At least, that&#39;s what they showed me. </p>

<p>In reality, consciousness &quot;is God&quot; and as a man, we have this spark of the divine that both beings of light and darkness lack. They crave us; they are very jealous the creator chose to bless us with the highest of gifts.  </p>

<p>I used magic to manipulate others. I bent them to my will without question: my bosses, family members, girlfriends, aquaimtances, even strangers. </p>

<p>It was all very exhilarating. Matter itself seemed like a playground. Until I had to pay my karmic price for these selfish pursuits. </p>

<p>I lost everything in a matter of weeks; my finances, my career, my health, the love of my life, my self-respect, my assurances, and many of my friends.</p>

<p>It all happened so fast. About a year ago. </p>

<p>This year I&#39;ve spent picking up the pieces and in doing so I learned the truth. My actions were committed with the intentions of the self. I wasn&#39;t coming from the heart. I cared about other people, but not near as much as I cared about myself. </p>

<p>I was running away from Sophia. From Mother Earth. From the Creator. I was clinging to my individuality. </p>

<p>That is what is wrong with this planet. </p>

<p>That is what these people in high places do. </p>

<p>They cannot cope with the fact that All is One. They reject that truth so fervently, they will go to the ends of the earth to challenge it. They will kill every man, woman, and child in order to preserve their delusions. </p>

<p>They must be stopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the closest we as humans (in our current predicament; flesh) can come to seeing what Ayn Soph would be like is when we are acting as <em>The Fool</em> </p>

<p>The highest of paths. The one that all other paths lead to. </p>

<p>I was hoping to be a warrior or a spiritual master, but even these seemingly lofty pursuits fall at the face of the fool&#39;s appreciation for life. </p>

<p>The fool would gladly and without hesitation sacrifice his life for another. The fool is the closest thing to God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the closest we as humans can come to experiencing Ayn Soph is becoming that of the Fool. </p>

<p>I spent a decade thinking &quot;why isn&#39;t the spiritual master&quot; or &quot;the high priest&quot; the way to god? Why can my bravery and strength not get me where I want to go&quot;?</p>

<p><em>The Fool</em> does not care about titles or awards. The fool would gladly sacrifice themself for another without hesitation. The fool sees the divine comedy (as god must have a sense of humor). </p>

<p>I never glimpsed the Ayn Soph because it is by its very definition, unattainable in mortal life. </p>

<p>The closest we can come to it is through the Fool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start by saying I didn&#39;t <em>just</em> practice black magic(k). I was a jack of all trades if you will. But black magic has a way of taking over. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the coolest! But you know how when you watch a movie, some of the violence is &quot;cool&quot;? But damn is it wicked to just watch that stuff play out. It creates a desensitization in us. </p>

<p>Black magic is really all about psychology when it comes to <em>other people</em> </p>

<p>The actual ritual isn&#39;t as important as the intention and emotion behind it. </p>

<p>Every human being on earth practices black magic, every day, albeit unknowingly. </p>

<p>Once you go into the <em>knowingly</em> aspect, things change. </p>

<p>I practiced blood magic but never with anyone but myself and my sexual partners who were willing to adhere to my demands. </p>

<p>I practiced divination, and would travel to other realms with the help of angels. (Angels are not what you think; they&#39;re more like cosmic cops). </p>

<p>I practiced divination, and would use the Goetia, the Lesser Key of Solomon to summon them and attack (psychologically) my enemies. I have some blood on my hands, I think, but I can&#39;t be sure. But I&#39;ll shed my own blood to make up for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re absolutely correct. The numbers could be skewed because you&#39;ll have to define &quot;Satanists&quot;</p>

<p>Just like with Christianity, there are different denominations and many of them are quite docile. Others are incredibly powerful, wicked, and secretive. Those are the ones to worry about. </p>

<p>However, of the Horned God returned tomorrow you can bet there would be 5-10 million people in this country alone who would, by default, be ready to collect the Beast&#39;s mark. </p>

<p>I believe Jesus was a wonderful character and probably sent from heaven or heavenly realms, like many before him and many acts him, but the religion built around his objectively false. </p>

Don&#39;t you find it a little off that we just traded one for the other? I feel the presence of God without going through anyone but my own conciousness. Full disclosure I was raised Christian then left the church at 14 and now at 35 I have built my own spiritual belief system that admits there is a creator however if I had to lean towards a &quot;religion&quot; it would be Gnosticism. I believe all religions have been corrupted over the years to serve the needs of man. Not god. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, my life fell apart because I didn&#39;t have the stomach to pursue my craft further. </p>

<p>Karma knocks on every door. </p>

<p>The elite who do these things must comtinually <em>pawn their karma off on others</em> </p>

<p>See Pizzagate </p>

<p>See Iraq War </p>

<p>See violence in TV and movies </p>

<p>It&#39;s all a ritual. </p>

<p>They are masters of manipulation. </p>

<p>Essentially, I learned certain secrets, and the goodness within me wouldn&#39;t allow me to use those secrets selfishly, as the elites do. </p>

<p>Their judgement is coming and booyyyyy will it be severe, but not in this life. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why celebrities and politicians live their lives to the fullest. They know the price they must pay for their crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more complex than I&#39;ve alluded to. The secret of heaven is the greatest yet simplest of truths. </p>

<p><em>Everything is one</em> </p>

<p>It might seem cliche, but it&#39;s true. </p>

<p>Meditate on that fact. </p>

<p>Every killer, every child, every, insect, every plant, every beast, every grain of sand, every mom, every tree, every molecule... </p>

<p>They are all connected and part of the same being. </p>

<p>In a way this imprisons us</p>

<p>It also liberates us</p>

<p>It&#39;s called <em>the divine paradox</em> </p>

<p>Science is proving it more and more everyday, that matter itself is simply an illusion. </p>

<p>If our enemies are just <em>us</em> looking back at us, it changes things. Try to sell a war in the Middle East when we have the knowledge that everyone of those children <em>is me</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats not really a secret people have been saying that for thousands of years. And i think most people who are spiritual as opposed to religious are aware that everything is one and reality is a projection of what we think. Atoms change and behave based on our expectations of them. Thus we create our own reality and collectivly also. None of this is a new concept or a secret.
If you were told this at 7 why would you proceed to act in deliberatly selfish ways? 
Why persue satanic ritualistic techings if you already knew the answer is light and you would recieve everything you need from a more enlightened path? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no that&#39;s not true. </p>

<p>Most people in history have been plagued by religious dogma and totalitarian states. Only the elite of ancient societies had access to these truths, and many of them abused them, as I did. </p>

<p>If everything is one, it makes justifying your evil actions easier. If you know that, than you can say, in your mind, &quot;oh I was just doing it to myself&quot; or &quot;there&#39;s no consequence&quot;</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s a paradox and much more difficult to understand than you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what youre talking about is esentially buddhism which originated 600 BC. So what you’re saying isnt true, unless you’re only focused on the west from like 1000AD onwards until about 100 years ago when eastern religions and philosophies became more accepted in the west.
And even before buddism there was Taoism, again a similar philosophy.
I dont think anyone who truely understands these philosophies or universal truths would misinterperate them to think it doesnt matter what i do because i’m just doing it to myself, thats solipsism. They would only beholding thwmselves back and they should understand that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could say that but it wouldn&#39;t be accurate. Buddhism and Taoism do not believe we exist <em>within any divine being</em> </p>

<p>Buddha may have taught that </p>

<p>Christ may have taught that </p>

<p>Zhang Jiao may have taught that </p>

<p>But their teachings were altered </p>

<p>Many Gnostic, Zoroastrian, and Hebrew groups taught these things and were persecuted by the Greco-Romans for centuries until the light of their gnosis nearly burned out. </p>

<p>Buddhism does not adhere to any deity. The religion is that, a religion. It in fact encourages the practitioner to stay away from any divine being. It does not teach of its existence. </p>

<p>Basically the truth is somewhere in the middle of Buddhism and Christianity but both religions were created to serve as half truths. The mystery religions that pre-date known civilizations had a much better understanding of the cosmos, but like I said, many of them abused their knowledge, which is why we&#39;re where we are today.  </p>

So in a sense their quest for knowledge may have taken a 1500 odd year hiatus for the masses. But it&#39;s coming back in full force.

<p>No, they don&#39;t. PROBABILITIES change into ELECTRONS based on BEING OBSERVED. You can&#39;t expect the world to behave a certain way and force it to do so based on your expectation.
