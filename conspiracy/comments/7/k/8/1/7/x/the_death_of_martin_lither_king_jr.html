        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s believed that he was murdered on the balcony of a hotel by James Earl Rae. However, after some research, I found his death really suspicious. I think he was honestly murdered by the government. After MLK started talking about corruption and war, and trying to expose truths, everything went downhill for him. I think the government was afraid of him and they framed a wanted criminal for his murder so someone else could take the downfall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun/fucked up fact, Jesse Jackson scooped up MLK&#39;s blood, whipped it on his shirt and ran to Good Morning American wearing the blood soaked shirt to grand stand.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/jesse/interviews/young.html">After they removed his body, Ralph Abernathy got a jar and started scraping up the blood and said, and crying it was Martin&#39;s precious blood. This blood was shed for us. It was weird. But people freaked out and did strange things. <strong>Jesse put his hands in the blood and wiped it on the front of his shirt.</strong></a></p>

But the court records documenting extensive evidence of a conspiracy with government involvement are publicly available. </p>

<p>Non-violent non-compliance. Get 15-25% of the population on board and that&#39;s all you need. Nobody goes to work. Nobody pays bills. We don&#39;t look at race or color. It&#39;s the only way. They&#39;d be ousted in a week if even 20% of the population did this.</p>
