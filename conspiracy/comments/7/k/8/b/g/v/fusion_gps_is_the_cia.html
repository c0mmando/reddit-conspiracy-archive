       Consider them a franchise or branch of a larger corporation. Trying to link Fusion to the CIA is not seeing the forest through the trees. They are one in the same.
The DOJ/FBI connection shouldnt be seen as
rogue elements or deep state actors acting outside of their authority. These werent random or mildly coordinated anti-Trumpers in various departments doing all they could to make waves for Trump. This was blackside interagency cooperation that went afoul. This was a joint effort, highly coordinated and deemed necessary by agency and bureaucratic heads to act as an insurance policy against an outside chance of a Trump win. When Trump won the green light was given to activate the project and have him out of office by the end of year one. When this is all revealed the FBI, CIA, DOJ and a variety of other bureaucratic institution's will need to be dismantled. They know this and Trump knows this and few people realize how dangerous this game is about to get. When he calls on citizens to come to the nations aid and participate many of you wont respond. Start reading between the lines, Anons. Trump is talking to you all.

       Trump is talking to the voices in his rapidly degenerating mind.

       Joan of Arc led an army with schizophrenic delusions, and Trump is leading a political movement with narcissistic lies.

       If you think Trump is on the common man's side after all that has happened you are a fool of fools. Money and greed are all he has ever known. It's all he will ever know. There is nothing he won't sell out to get his name ahead. Nothing. This government dick sucking does not belong in r/conspiracy. Fuck Off Op.

       There is nothing in OPs statement that said Trump is on the common mans side.  The OP asserted Trump and the deep state are not on the same side.  There is no logical conclusion to then include Trump's support for the common man.

       Op stated that Trump is talking to us all, and my response is he isn't talking to anyone because he cares nothing about anyone other than himself. Period. He will sell out to anyone and any country for the right price. Period.

       Some tinfoils have grown to love their hats. The notion that some
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       may exist is actually a frightening prospect that many refuse to consider. It's much easier to remain comfortable with your own opinions if the power structure is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       evil, because then, you're always right.

       Oh please. Trump is leaching millions of dollars from US tax payers so he can play golf at his own resorts. He forces the secret service to waste US tax payer money on golf carts and rooms and pockets the money. Name a time Obama pocketed tax payer dollars? You can't.
      </p>

       Trump had filled his cabinet with corrupt elites, so yeah we know he's not on the common persons side. He's a war monger siding with the Saudis and Israelis, he belittles our own officers and soldiers while praising hostile leaders like Putin. He doesn't give a shit about our allies and doesn't know shit about governmental policy. He's shown time and time again that he's a completely corrupt, stupid and malicious person who cares only for himself. He'll lie right to your face. Hell yeah he's not on our side

       I dunno much about all the Fusion stuff, but when they were interviewing Rod Rosenstein the other day his body language always drastically changed whenever it was brought up. Like he wants to distance himself from whatever is going on with... he was literally pushing it away from himself... I wonder if that chick with the sexy voice did a video of it, cause she'd pick up on that in a heartbeat.

       Just checked... she did a video on it... I'll give it a watch and see if she picked up on the same cues that I did. But, I get the vibe he knows whats up with Fusion GPS and doesn't want to be caught up in it at all.

       Yeah, too bad she didn't do the Fusion GPS part of the video cause I get the distinct vibe that he wants to distance himself from whatever is going on with that firm. He was really uncomfortable about it coming up for sure.

       Another Trump is a hero post. How many of these do we have to go through? Is he really that bad you gotta constantly push this on us?
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels like a social engineering piece written to enhance confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if Fusion is CIA. Does that fact alone make the information contained within untrue? If you think that fact makes it untrue you're bias already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why people think Trump couldn't win. Both sides always net about 60 million votes. Trump even won with less votes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When this is all revealed the FBI, CIA, DOJ and a variety of other bureaucratic institution's will need to be dismantled.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fuck no. This sub went crazy and so did other right wing radio talking heads when they believed Obama was using those institutions to become a dictator and now you're openly advocating for their dismantlement so Trump can become a dictator.

       Well no one has shot him yet. I'd say they are giving him a chance. He hasn't done shit but give rich people tax cuts, give Saudi Arabia guns and openly talks about militarizing the police some more.

       He's every president before him but even more so he's an asshole who wars on the first amendment. I would fucking kill to see Obama tweet snarky things at people and see the reaction from your account.

       So you don't believe the establishment needs to be called out? Couldn't obamas silence have more to do with the old adage about people in glass houses? The only people who would be upset about either president calling people out would be partisan hacks which I am not.

       If you want him to call people out look at his White House correspondents dinners. Conservative media constantly attacked him and referenced him trying to be a king.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even recently he said the "Thanks Obama" meme when he was making a speech and mentioned the economy.

       There's is but One establishment by definition. Obama signed legislation making it legal to label any information it deems as attacking the establishment as foreign propaganda. Whichever establishment needed that law is the one I'm against.
