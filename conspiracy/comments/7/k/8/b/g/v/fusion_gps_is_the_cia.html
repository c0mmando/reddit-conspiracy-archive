The DOJ/FBI connection shouldnt be seen as
rogue elements or deep state actors acting outside of their authority. These werent random or mildly coordinated anti-Trumpers in various departments doing all they could to make waves for Trump. This was blackside interagency cooperation that went afoul. This was a joint effort, highly coordinated and deemed necessary by agency and bureaucratic heads to act as an insurance policy against an outside chance of a Trump win. When Trump won the green light was given to activate the project and have him out of office by the end of year one. When this is all revealed the FBI, CIA, DOJ and a variety of other bureaucratic institution&#39;s will need to be dismantled. They know this and Trump knows this and few people realize how dangerous this game is about to get. When he calls on citizens to come to the nations aid and participate many of you wont respond. Start reading between the lines, Anons. Trump is talking to you all.</p>

He forces the secret service to waste US tax payer money on golf carts and rooms and pockets the money. Name a time Obama pocketed tax payer dollars? You can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Trump had filled his cabinet with corrupt elites, so yeah we know he&#39;s not on the common persons side. He&#39;s a war monger siding with the Saudis and Israelis, he belittles our own officers and soldiers while praising hostile leaders like Putin. He doesn&#39;t give a shit about our allies and doesn&#39;t know shit about governmental policy. He&#39;s shown time and time again that he&#39;s a completely corrupt, stupid and malicious person who cares only for himself. He&#39;ll lie right to your face.
