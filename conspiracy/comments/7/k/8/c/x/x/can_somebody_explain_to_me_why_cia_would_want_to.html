    <div class="md"><p>First of all, whats with the judgmental rude arrogance? for someone whos a fan of tupacs were all family mentality, youre a huge asshole. Beyond that, you just said yourself he wanted to START going against gangster rap. He did not get the opportunity. So your initial assholeish question was you thought he never listened to Pac or Biggie. Please explain to my poor ignorant soul how he could have listened to Pac that Pac never even made? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, stop trying to argue this before i have to put you to literally Reddiit shame. Maybe you should start reading his lyrics and writings when he attended acting school with Jada Pickett. The rose that grew from concrete is a good start. Secondly, you imbecile adamant leech, Tupac was bailed out of prison for being allegedly at the scene of a crime in “white” Marin County. Since he was black he was arrested and Suge came to his rescue but forced him to write gangster rap albums and pay back his bond. Before I go into the history and you continue to quote his commercial image, do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up so I don’t have the embarrass you and you family tree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it seems youve missed my point entirely. Tupac set the standard for the modern gangster rapper. The enigma of Tupac is his duality. you reference his poetry, again like i dont know it, but the point was his image. anyone whos a fan of tupac should know both sides and its just as ignorant to say he only had the poetic side. tupac music wasnt his poetry or acting or community work. his music and himself even was thugged the fuck. go ahead though put me to le epjc reddit shame you raging autist </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, stop trying to argue this before i have to put you to literally Reddiit shame. Maybe you should start reading his lyrics and writings when he attended acting school with Jada Pickett. The rose that grew from concrete is a good start. Secondly, you imbecile adamant leech, Tupac was bailed out of prison for being allegedly at the scene of a crime in “white” Marin County. Since he was black he was arrested and Suge came to his rescue but forced him to write gangster rap albums and pay back his bond. Before I go into the history and you continue to quote his commercial image, do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up so I don’t have the embarrass you and you family tree.</p>
