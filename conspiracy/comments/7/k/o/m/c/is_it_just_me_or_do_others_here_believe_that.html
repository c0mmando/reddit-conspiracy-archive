       That's why Facebook (an obvious CIA front as supported by the evidence) allows only actual people to get accounts and then only one each.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're very strict and for no good business reason. MySpace lets anyone make any account for any reason. This makes good business sense for many reasons. Facebook's strictness makes absolutely no sense unless you take into account it's a clandestine CIA front and they're trying to keep their database accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider also that the CIA has since its inception considered college students to be the future movers and shakers of the country and therefore the only segment worth spying on or recruiting.

       Rupert Murdoch basically admitted that's why he bought MySpace.  It allows him to determine what the youth are into, and how to market to them.  It's not like they're hiding it.

       Looks like a conspiracy by a company to overtake the government.  I think if you go back and look at the vast majority of "government" conspiracies, they really have a corporate backer for one reason or another.

       An advertising bot?  Who said anything about Ad bots?  We're not talking about a chat room, we're talking about targeted marketing through direct advertising, as well as a variety of other means.  And advertising doesn't exist solely for the sake of existing.  Advertising exists to sell products and services.  Garner more money, you garner more power.  It is a conspiracy to sell cheap crap at inflated prices.  It's a conspiracy to keep the top 1% in control of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, not just governments are out to do the things that you're associating with conspiracy theories.  I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're assumption that "intelligence gathering" only applies to governments IS wrong.

       No, it doesn't.  But it's obvious that this post title takes advantage of people that read it like I did.  It's sensationalist and misleading to at least a portion of it's audience.

       I never said anything about it making you lose your job, forget the stuff you learned in school, or being a Jewish conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly you're comments indicate a lack of comprehension, but I'm never surprised by dim-witted replies in these sorts of discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I never said Facebook or any of them take your money.  They all provide advertising and marketing services through a variety of mediums, whether it be peer recommendations, direct ads, or other means.  The advertising persuades us to buy the shit, persuades us to put it on credit, and persuades us to go deeper in debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure you're working out a psuedo-clever response, replete with spelling and grammar errors, to follow this right now, to which I won't reply, making you feel like you've won the interwebs.  Kudos to you!

       "Is it just me... Or Do Others Here Believe That Sites Such As Youtube, Facebook, MySpace (and many others) Are Part Of A Massive Intelligence Gathering Operation??"
      </p>
      <p>
       I made a facetious reply to the question, because when viewed in the context of some government program the idea is not worth more than my obviously hilarious reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       You replied to my humorous post with some sort of self righteous tangent (money as debt/zeitgeist inspired no doubt).  I kept continuity in my reply with again taking a poke at conspiracy theories that populate the internet in an attempt a humor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subtext of your point holds some merit. I do think the companies that own these site obviously use them to collect personal info, track trends, create trends, sell ads etc.  That is not something I deny, i applaud it...its good business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made and assumption (I know, I know) that you believed a mass conspiracy was behind these social sites (beyond the purely commercial interests of the shareholders).
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditionally I've found attempts to engage people with similar view points tend to degenerate into them telling me of a Jewish banking conspiracy, or some other nefarious plot. So I don't ususally provide serious responses to things I feel are preposterous. I am sorry this offends you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree the masses are restricted as far as social mobility goes, I however don't view it as a massive conspiracy against humanity, perpetrated by THEM etc.  This does not mean I condone or support the current system, but conspiracy fantasies aren't going to help anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETA: I don't downvote people who reply to my posts.  Not that it relevant to anything.

       Goes youtube, so goes google the parent company.  Need a new video and search engine site now. The 19th boycott is permanent for me, except for cases of telling people to steer clear.  Some people are working to setting up a "newtube" sans the ADL censorship.

       facebook seed money was nsa, cia, or some such. 
myspace owned by murdoch. youtube's recent new policy has them officially anti free speech, videos silenced as dictated by the ADL, others?  youtube being a part of google, so expect google to follow.  Things are clamping down, the pleebs learning too much, too much freedom.

       I agree.. however, social networking sites invite you to make a detailed dossier about yourself.  Even just on reddit... the amount of info we give out about ourselves by looking at what we submit, what we upvote, what we downvote... that's a lot of info about our psyches.

       Yeah the government set up all of these sites for information gathering. Because it's not like they, as the government, have any other way of currently tracking you. Not like birth certificates, license, tabs, passports, social security numbers are more important than what your "About Me" section says on Facebook.

       A site like Facebook has some value because it can be used to determine connections between individuals. The state has all the data on me that it needs, and taken on its own its next to worthless. What might interest an intelligence agent would be my known cohorts, photographs, opinions etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that data could be gathered, over time, and at a cost, from investigation and surveillance. Then again, it could be produced by me,
       <br/>
       made freely and instantly available and stored in a digital format that supports investigative search and analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state has our data, but it takes something like the social networking sites to turn that into useful information

       The only useful information on your Facebook is your address and your telephone number. Or do you actually think they are trending data, and at some point they are going to throw everyone who listens to Breaking Benjamin' into a concentration camp because their trends showed those people to be the most rebellious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a break. The government does not care about you that much, sorry to burst your bubble. You are not as special as you think you are. They don't give a fuck about you're psyche or opinions. They are not actively seeking out the chosen one that will bring their order down. They target keywords, and they monitor all traffic.

       Exactly. It's not like they don't have elections every couple of years where you explicitly tell the government which political party you support and then fill out a form specifically stating which candidates best represent your own views.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also that whole tax thing where the government requires you to account for every cent you made during the year and tell them where it all came from.

       But yeah. Myspace is a much better way to find out the most critical information about the most important and influential part of the population.

       Kind of like the iGoogle homepage. Yes, sign in. Sign in so that google knows who exactly is searching for everything. So that google can then store all that information on a barge off the coast in international waters.

       I agree.. however, social networking sites invite you to make a detailed dossier about yourself.  Even just on reddit... the amount of info we give out about ourselves by looking at what we submit, what we upvote, what we downvote... that's a lot of info about our psyches.

       Exactly. It's not like they don't have elections every couple of years where you explicitly tell the government which political party you support and then fill out a form specifically stating which candidates best represent your own views.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also that whole tax thing where the government requires you to account for every cent you made during the year and tell them where it all came from.

       A site like Facebook has some value because it can be used to determine connections between individuals. The state has all the data on me that it needs, and taken on its own its next to worthless. What might interest an intelligence agent would be my known cohorts, photographs, opinions etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that data could be gathered, over time, and at a cost, from investigation and surveillance. Then again, it could be produced by me,
       <br/>
       made freely and instantly available and stored in a digital format that supports investigative search and analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state has our data, but it takes something like the social networking sites to turn that into useful information

       Clearly you're comments indicate a lack of comprehension, but I'm never surprised by dim-witted replies in these sorts of discussions.

      <p>
       Additionally, I never said Facebook or any of them take your money.  They all provide advertising and marketing services through a variety of mediums, whether it be peer recommendations, direct ads, or other means.  The advertising persuades us to buy the shit, persuades us to put it on credit, and persuades us to go deeper in debt.

       Looks like a conspiracy by a company to overtake the government.  I think if you go back and look at the vast majority of "government" conspiracies, they really have a corporate backer for one reason or another.

       An advertising bot?  Who said anything about Ad bots?  We're not talking about a chat room, we're talking about targeted marketing through direct advertising, as well as a variety of other means.  And advertising doesn't exist solely for the sake of existing.  Advertising exists to sell products and services.  Garner more money, you garner more power.  It is a conspiracy to sell cheap crap at inflated prices.  It's a conspiracy to keep the top 1% in control of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, not just governments are out to do the things that you're associating with conspiracy theories.  I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're assumption that "intelligence gathering" only applies to governments IS wrong.

       "Is it just me... Or Do Others Here Believe That Sites Such As Youtube, Facebook, MySpace (and many others) Are Part Of A Massive Intelligence Gathering Operation??"
      </p>
      <p>
       I made a facetious reply to the question, because when viewed in the context of some government program the idea is not worth more than my obviously hilarious reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       You replied to my humorous post with some sort of self righteous tangent (money as debt/zeitgeist inspired no doubt).  I kept continuity in my reply with again taking a poke at conspiracy theories that populate the internet in an attempt a humor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subtext of your point holds some merit. I do think the companies that own these site obviously use them to collect personal info, track trends, create trends, sell ads etc.  That is not something I deny, i applaud it...its good business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made and assumption (I know, I know) that you believed a mass conspiracy was behind these social sites (beyond the purely commercial interests of the shareholders).
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditionally I've found attempts to engage people with similar view points tend to degenerate into them telling me of a Jewish banking conspiracy, or some other nefarious plot. So I don't ususally provide serious responses to things I feel are preposterous. I am sorry this offends you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree the masses are restricted as far as social mobility goes, I however don't view it as a massive conspiracy against humanity, perpetrated by THEM etc.  This does not mean I condone or support the current system, but conspiracy fantasies aren't going to help anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETA: I don't downvote people who reply to my posts.  Not that it relevant to anything.

       I was right, as goes youtube, so goes google: "Google this week admitted that its staff will pick and choose what appears in its search results."

       That's why Facebook (an obvious CIA front as supported by the evidence) allows only actual people to get accounts and then only one each.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're very strict and for no good business reason. MySpace lets anyone make any account for any reason. This makes good business sense for many reasons. Facebook's strictness makes absolutely no sense unless you take into account it's a clandestine CIA front and they're trying to keep their database accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider also that the CIA has since its inception considered college students to be the future movers and shakers of the country and therefore the only segment worth spying on or recruiting.

       The only useful information on your Facebook is your address and your telephone number. Or do you actually think they are trending data, and at some point they are going to throw everyone who listens to Breaking Benjamin' into a concentration camp because their trends showed those people to be the most rebellious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a break. The government does not care about you that much, sorry to burst your bubble. You are not as special as you think you are. They don't give a fuck about you're psyche or opinions. They are not actively seeking out the chosen one that will bring their order down. They target keywords, and they monitor all traffic.

       Like I said, I don't doubt that the government could pull information from social networking sites, I doubt why they would even need to. "Hey that kid seems like a real threat, Johnson, pull his most recent zombie application invites, we'll get to the bottom of this."
