        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the massive amounts of people talking about &quot;Shills&quot; for the FCC and telecommunications companies, I feel like we need to address the obvious shills for the Pro-Net Neutrality side as well. This post is <strong>NOT</strong> about our stance on NN, but on the greed and censorship that is happening on the Pro-NN side. </p>

<p>Most of the Pro-NN companies are social media platforms and streaming services, both of which consist of much younger companies than the telecommunications companies that are Anti-NN. These companies are obviously growing at a rapid rate, and would like to continue to do so, the question is: How far will they go to compete with these &quot;old&quot; giant companies?</p>

<p>One incredibly dangerous factor is that many of us use these &quot;new&quot; companies to get our news, search for our news, and talk about the news. Admittedly, a lot of times these same sites are my ONLY source for the news on current events (which i&#39;m sure many of you are in a similar boat). Additionally, Google, Facebook, and Reddit all have been <strong>CAUGHT</strong> filtering content that they do not &quot;approve&quot; of. Could this potentially hide/filter legitimate arguments on why NN should be repealed? </p>

<p>Net Neutrality is supposed to have MASSIVE affects on large corporations on both ends of the argument, and these &quot;good guy&quot; companies are a lot larger than most people realize. The article I linked it the bottom is from the same people that also helped produce/promote Ajit&#39;s video, so take it with a grain of salt. The bottom line is: Do you think these so called &quot;good guy&quot; companies really have our best interests at heart? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, let&#39;s talk about it. The Daily Caller uploaded a video containing a song they did not have the rights to use. One of the people involved in making that song filed an infringement claim, and as per usual Youtube removed the content.

<p>&quot;Unfortunately—as noted by Engadget—Pai’s video probably falls under the terms of fair use, so it’s unlikely the takedown will actually go through.&quot;</p>

<p>The part that concerns me is that so many people fine with censoring this video? This wasn&#39;t just some poor quality meme video some kid made on his mom&#39;s laptop, this is for a VERY important political issue directly from the FCC. Yes, I fully understand that it was stupid and poorly done, but it was a chance for the &quot;opposing&quot; side to use their voice in a non conventional way. It may not be the side you are on, but you need to respect the ability to share your political beliefs without being censored. I know I would want my parties to be heard, even if certain corporations don&#39;t approve of them? Isn&#39;t this what we are supposivly fighting for? </p>

<p>It obviously fucking was, because it happens all the time. People abuse the Youtube copyright infringement system to shut down videos.</p>

<p>Google / Youtube RESTORED the video after REVIEW.</p>

<p>You have absolutely no insight at all into any of this. You don&#39;t understand the systems you&#39;re referencing, you don&#39;t understand the history of these types of events, and you appear to have done no independent research into this topic.

    <div class="md"><p>We have already established Verizon is greedy and is pushing it to be repealed. Everyone on Reddit talks about that, it&#39;s old news.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the reports I&#39;ve read have indicated that the major ISPs have stated their stance is pro-NN. Here&#39;s an example:  <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/39445-verizon-att-comcast-fcc-net-neutrality">https://www.inverse.com/article/39445-verizon-att-comcast-fcc-net-neutrality</a></p>

<p>“Verizon fully supports the open Internet, and we will continue to do so. Our customers demand it and our business depends on it.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the lobbying money--I&#39;m aware of the amount of money the major ISPs have spent on NN lobbying but I haven&#39;t found information on whether it&#39;s pro-NN or anti-NN lobbying/spending. Furthermore, the companies that ISPs are just a part of are sprawling. It&#39;d be nice to get information on what specific division, individual or group of individuals at these companies engaged in the spending.</p>

<p>The two most important things that the media is intentionally overlooking in coverage on Net Neutrality are the internet&#39;s redefinition as a telecommunications service in reference to how the Telecommunications Act of 1996 subsequently became law for it, and Content Distribution Networks&#39;s explicit exclusion from the rules as stipulated by the FCC.</p>

<p>With that being said, the best things people can do to educate themselves are researching CDNs and the relationship between media cross-ownership and the 1996 act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you are being downvotes, op, because you are right to bring this up.</p>

<p>Censorship and information manipulation by Facebook, Google, reddit, and various others is much of a concern than Netflix being throttled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think that allowing Google to bribe ISPs to block competing sites will do anything to reverse the censorship Google engages in?</p>

<p>In fact now, they can not only censor their own search results, they can pay to ensure you can&#39;t use a competing site instead.</p>

<p>So much for an &quot;open internet&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree, the frustrating part (especially with reddit), is that everyone seems to be completely cool with censoring/downvoting something they don&#39;t agree with. </p>

<p>Why do you think we never even hear anything from the Pro-NN side? I&#39;m sure theres tons of thought out, fact based, unbiased posts from the Pro-NN side. We just never get to see them due to getting downvoted due to &quot;I don&#39;t agree with you, so you don&#39;t deserve a voice&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the simple truth...  repealing Net Neutrality <em>helps</em> corporations like Google.</p>

<p>What other search engine has the resources to pay ISPs to prioritise their traffic? In the case of YouTube, what other video site has the cash to pay to have their videos play at high speeds?</p>

<p>Same with Facebook or even Reddit. Do you think Voat has the resources to pay to have ISPs slow down Reddit in favour of Voat content?</p>

<p>The truth is, these companies would rather not have to pay either, but if push comes to shove (and it will) they will have the advantage that their competitors do not.</p>

<p>If you hate reddit censorship, at least you now have the option to use Voat instead. But now that ISPs can be bribed to slow down or even block Voat, you may not have that option for much longer.</p>
