        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>i guess what I mean, is yeah, we might all be expecting it, and we all may be ready to call bullshit...but here&#39;s the thing...</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried about what will come with it.  Obviously they can&#39;t just project holograms into the sky, use a frequency that penetrates our hearing/mind and speak to us.  It would have to be much more than that, and I&#39;m positive it WILL be much more than that.</p>

<p>Besides directed energy weapons, we aren&#39;t completely aware of every type of weaponry that has grown out of the technology they harnessed back in the 40s.  I mean yeah, we know Tesla had a death beam, could generate earthquakes with a small box using resonant frequencies, and several other things...but with 60+ years since Roswell under the military&#39;s belt, you have to know they&#39;ve got some crazy shit cooked up just going off the fact that they&#39;ve definitely refined the former mentioned technologies.</p>

<p>I guess what worries me, is how the fuck could we point out it&#39;s all a ruse, when they obliterate an entire city?  We will be the ones looking like complete idiots even if we point to all the evidence.  I mean, if they scrambled fighters and tried to shoot the holograms, and the missiles just went straight thru the UFOs, or they can&#39;t get a heat signature lock, they can just say their using some alien tech, and nobody would believe it&#39;s a hologram at that point.</p>

<p>I guess my point is we are all fucked no matter what, and it worries me, because even pointing out it&#39;s completely bullshit, and having the best evidence ever witnessed to mankind, it&#39;s going to get us nowhere.  </p>

<p>If you thought you looked bad pointing out 9/11 was a hoax/false flag, just wait until an entire city gets vaporized for real with technology nobody outside of this sub ever knew existed.</p>

<p>you oust them as being real just by addressing it, then you say they hate you because your against their evil ways. then you leak info like that, that they have been hiding and that could hurt them like jfk; all while saying if some BS story comes along as evidence for impeachment it was them or if there is a assassination attempt it was them.</p>

<p>they cant really do anything then with out looking super fucking guilty and risk losing control, and they have to protect you from others will ill intent because they would still look guilty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are good and bad E.T&#39;s and a lot of disinformation going around.</p>

<p>I think a false flag will be set up with the bad E.T&#39;s.</p>

<p>Check into Greer... he&#39;s not to be trusted. He is arrogant, he says all abductions are hoaxes or the government abducted people. He calls the internet garbage, refers to humans like monkeys/warlike behavior. He says humans are too ape like to be allowed in space. He says, &quot;if you think there&#39;s bad E.T.s, then wouldn&#39;t they have killed us already&quot;?
He says all E.T.s are good. In his desert meditations with his followers, they see lights and he says, &quot;open your heart chakra, let them in&quot;.</p>

<p>That all seems pretty suspicious to me. How does he know that they&#39;re all good? Letting random things into your &quot;heart chakra&quot; seems sketchy as hell. Like vampires, they can&#39;t come in unless you invite them.</p>

<p>He says anyone &quot;fear-mongering&quot; is disinformation, but I don&#39;t think that seems right. What&#39;s wrong with wanting to understand the fuller picture instead of just believing they&#39;re all good and not harmful.</p>

<p>As far as the, &quot;If there are E.T&#39;s wouldn&#39;t they have killed us already...&quot; I think that is pure manipulation. Imagine if there is a universe teaming with life, and we are like aboriginals, stuck on some island, with no contact with the outside universe. Then there would be rules. They couldn&#39;t just come kill us all, just like we wouldn&#39;t be allowed/or would face consequences for killing an uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. </p>

<p>If you really listen to his talks closely, you can tell he has some kind of hatred for humanity. 
Just my observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting points but let me offer some pushback.</p>

<p>There are definitely good humans out there, but for the most part western culture has gravitated towards greed and desire. We are a civilization driven by material possession and power. Conflict is always arising because we are tested by others that compete with us to achieve goals. </p>

<p>Look at the humans that somehow found their way into positions to lead the civilizations on Earth. Most are selfish and corrupt. They’d much rather put their own territory of land before the global community. Why? Because it’s a giant dick measuring contest where territories compete for resources and power.</p>

<p>Greer could possibly be speaking out about the ape like tendencies of humans because they are absolutely apparent if you are willing to look.</p>

<p>Some excerpts:</p>

<p>&quot;...the Russians are going to be considered to be the enemy.</p>

<p>&quot;Then terrorists would be identified, and that was soon to follow.</p>

<p>&quot;Then we were going to identify third-world country &quot;crazies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The next enemy was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it.</p>

<p>&quot;And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*&quot;The strategy that Wernher Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are going to be considered to be the enemy. In fact, in 1974, they were the enemy, the identified enemy. We were told that they had &quot;killer satellites&quot;. We were told that they were coming to get us and control us -- that they were &quot;Commies.&quot;</p>

<p>Then we were going to identify third-world country &quot;crazies.&quot; We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the third enemy against whom we would build space-based weapons.</p>

<p>The next enemy was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids-against asteroids we are going to build space-based weapons.</p>

<p>And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the* <strong>final scare</strong>.- Dr. Carol Rosin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But to get to the crux of the matter, I think there are other inhabited worlds that Christ made. I don’t think we can even imagine what they are like. “[God] hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, … by whom also he made the worlds” (Hebrews 1:2, emphasis mine; see also Hebrews 11:3).</p>

<p>All these other worlds are un-fallen and praise God. (See Revelation 5:13.) Perhaps this is why Jesus told this parable: “What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?” (Luke 15:4). Jesus left the adoration of sinless angels and worlds to come to this one lost world to save the wayward creatures made in His image. The Bible also speaks of an out-of-this-world council meeting in which the “Sons of God” gathered before the Lord—and Satan showed up to represent our planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the easiest way to combat this is to point out that the technology already exists, and is being held back.</p>

<p>I guess if this scenario plays out, and the government actually busts out the hidden technology, maybe they&#39;d come across as heroes...for a brief time, and then be busted out for hiding such advancements.  Which leads me to think they won&#39;t do that, and they will just eliminate a vast amount of us to pacify us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a bitch, but I don&#39;t know that if right when this happened I&#39;d jump right out there...sometimes the smartest thing to do is wait for an opening, rather than to try and martyr yourself and hope people take notice--especially in this day and age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, UFO&#39;s are more apart of our earth than we thing. Do you know how fuckin&#39; high tech they are if they&#39;re here?! Which they are, don&#39;t get me wrong, they are here. They have watched us evolve and become the human beings we know and love today. They will dominate if given the chance. If I were society as a whole I would chill tf out. What would they even do with us? The fact that they have the technology alone to find earth is astonishing. We are stupid and of no laborious use to them. They are beyond genius. 
We have the choice to compete or comply. 
COMPLY DAMMIT! Competing is legitimately setting yourself up for failure. Therefore why not comply offering peace and pray for it in return. You never know, they may end up saving us in return.
I believe in this so hard that I cry softly when thinking about it. It&#39;s a miraculous thing to me.</p>

<p>what&#39;s going on then, something must be happening? sure, starting in the late 50s and up to the 90s hundreds possibly thousands of deep underground bases and facilities were created in secret, planning for the worst possible nuclear conflict with the soviet state. for the past 20 years maintenance and basic upkeep on these bases has run up to over a trillion dollars per year, most of it hidden by the chaos after the 9/11/01 attacks and the fake accounting behind the wars in the middle east.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much if anything to it. Buzz Aldrin made some curious statement about &quot;going to the launch pad&quot; but that could just be him being quirky about the ship/plane to get there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the story about the Ark of Gabriel being transferred by the Russians at the same time the Russian Orthodox High Priest met with the Pope in Antarctica.  They were taking the Ark to Antarctica because it was rumored that it caused mass death when it was dug up from its original burial point in Saudi Arabia.  </p>

<p>That was in Feb 2016.  Since then, lots of VIPs, presidents and more have been going to Antarctica.  Remember when John Kerry visited recently?  Pepperidge Farm remembers...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The invasion, the wars, the segregation of ideas and people, the race wars and inequity is all just a big plan set in motion a very long time ago to break us in tiny little pieces, so they can come and pick the ones they want is put them in their little piles as they see fit.</p>

<p>When you really think about the whole scheme of things and reasons of humans being here today, not just in this country but in this world, the reality is that we have no natural purpose, there are no rules, no parameters or obligations, the system was put in place by other humans who got in power merely by chance and coincidence, there are no natural laws that say we can kill each other, that we can&#39;t eat each other, that live is indeed precious.
Also there are no rules or laws that say the government is for the people, or to help the people, the government is people.
I see people saying and thinking that the government is going to help them, that they have the best interest in their safety and security, but in reality, and sadly so, is that they&#39;re just humans who got hidden agendas to subjugate more humans, with stupid laws and money making schemes, to keep the people down and quiet.
 The end game is that we are all cattle, we are farmed for our labor, to make money and commodities for the top humans in this planet, for some end scenario we do not know yet.
And as any other livestock, a culling is somewhat necessary every once in a while.
Just keep making those payments for the car and the house and the bills they tell you again and again that you really need, get the student loan, buy their diamonds, plant their modified seeds, drink their polluted water, and when you realize all this is killing you and try to leave it all and fend for yourself, they will kill you for it, for the government is not your friend is not your lover and most certely does not want you to ask questions.
That&#39;s why education in this country costs so much, they want dumb people who can be manipulated and slow walked to the slaghter house and they check their phones to see that las notification.</p>

<p>We Humans were not meant to be this.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sry well said, honestly.</p>

<p>I would only dispute that schooling costing so much is one of those reverse psychology tactics.  They make university seem like it&#39;s for those who wish to expand their mind, and enforce that it comes at a premium (often one that leaves people stuck in student loan debt for a reasonable portion of their life), when in reality, they&#39;ve tricked people from realizing college is just that last line of endoctrination, and give the false sense of superiority over others for obtaining and finishing that tier of education.  </p>

<p>The ones that go to college and are completely oblivious to the real world, because they&#39;ve spent another 4-6--or sometimes even 8--years of the most important part of their adult life being trained, often end up being the ones that run our businesses, courtrooms, police precincts, and branches of government, which leads us directly into the position our country is in right now.  </p>

<p>I would definitely say that the reason those top tier jobs require college for that exact reason.  They know those that spent a significantly large portion of their most influential adulthood period being subjected to ideas and paradigms that support the century long status-quo that spreads across all collegiate disciplines.</p>

If any real nation posed s threat we could easily blow them back to the stone age.

<p>I think the thought is just scary because the people here that have studied blue beam, know it sounds ridiculous but is all based on real tech. Like voice to skull tech. Been a thing since Cuba. I would personally be concerned if say my daughter comes to me with &quot;voices in her head&quot; like how do you explain to the uninitiated?
