<p>RFK was allegedly assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan, just a few years after his brother was assassinated (by a completely unrelated political motivation).   Especially prior to a would-be Presidential run, this tells me that whoever killed JFK used the same techniques and misdirection to do the same to his brother.</p>

<p>I believe he was killed because he wanted to stop AIPAC and label Israeli informants as foreign agents, just like any other country.</p>

<p>Just a big ol&#39; coinkydink that his killer was a Palestinian who couldn&#39;t even remember his name after the fact. He still, to this day claims he was under mind control. </p>

<p>There are also credible witnesses and a lot of forensic analysis that proves Sirhan wasn&#39;t the only shooter.</p>

<p>if we accept your premise for the sake of argument, an obvious retort is that senator fulbright (he of the grant) -- who went on national tv and said that israel controlled the u.s. senate -- wasn&#39;t killed.</p>

<p>how does this fit into your hypothesis?</p>

<p>do all Christian denominations require tithing? which denominations define tithing as &quot;giving all of one&#39;s non-taxed income&quot;? (i&#39;m asking because i know the answers to these questions. can you guess what they are?)</p>

<p>you just cited a Biblical basis for tithing, and it is worthy of note that there is no Biblical basis for the doctrine that all Christian practices must have a Biblical basis.</p>

<p>might Jesus have been offering a vivid illustration of what truly charitable giving looks like in practice? why are you so upset about the financial acumen of a woman you more than likely regard as being entirely fictitious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nate Orlowek made an interesting video (I&#39;ve posted it numerous times) about the real-time government conspiracy to continue the coverup of the murder in Garrett&#39;s barn alleged to have ended the life of John Wilkes Booth.  This government &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is approved overwhelmingly by academics who claim to have a commitment to truthful history.  A DNA test (comparing known Booth DNA to  the autopsy sample of the fellow murdered in the barn) would either affirm or put to rest the claim that Booth was allowed to get away by probable Yankee accomplices (with Stanton mentioned most prominently).  Hardly new but definitely unique because Trump could simply order the test and we&#39;d have a history to digest instead of Doris Kearns Goodwin turds...hardly new but definitely unique because it screams that the present day real-time government is continuing the coverup that&#39;s over 150 years old (with everybody except mo-counts like me and Nate Orlowek on board with approving not running the DNA and disclosing the results perhaps because it could segue to non-government conspiracy theories getting also unwanted attention)...  Perhaps a mainstream person will give the other side for me; why not run the DNA?</p>

<p>Journalist Charles Pierce, author of Idiot America, adds another perspective: “The rise of idiot America today represents--for profit mainly, but also and more cynically, for political advantage in the pursuit of power--the breakdown of a consensus that the pursuit of knowledge is a good. It also represents the ascendancy of the notion that the people whom we should trust the least are the people who best know what they are talking about.

<p>it&#39;s a fun narrative, but your interpretation falls apart as soon as one starts looking into history in any detail. for starters, the assimilation of jews into the roman empire never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something not often talked about is the Lindbergh baby kidnapping.  The story is as mysterious as the Kennedy assassination, and as big a deal at the time . . . bigger really, as with the Kennedy assassination people were shut up pretty quickly once the Warren commission study was issued. The Lindbergh baby kidnapping mesmerized the population both when it happened in March 1932, for months afterwards, and then a couple of years later  when Bruno Hauptman was caught and convicted.  The case remains a huge mystery with dozens of theories.  There are active discussion boards discussing this today.  In my view Hauptmann could not have committed this on his own -- he may not even have been involved.  There seemed to be (according to some theories) police corruption, mafia involvement, and other things related to a cover-up.  It is very mysterious and has never been satisfactorily solved.  I believe the Lindbergh family was hit because corrupt political forces wanted to side-line Lindbergh so he would not run for office.  His father had been a major spokesman against the establishment of the Federal Reserve, and Lindbergh himself was outspoken and incorruptible.  He was an amazing person.  The first really big super-hero.   Read anything you can get your hands on as his is a fascinating story.  His legacy has been buried because he opposed US involvement in WWII.  Once they were involved, he was onside.  It was very political and Lindbergh was a founder of a group called America First.  People need to know more about him.  I doubt the mystery of the kidnapping will ever be solved.  I recommend a book by Noel Behn about the kidnapping.  Interestingly the prosecutor in the Hauptman case went on to become a big honcho in the Democratic Party.  </p>
