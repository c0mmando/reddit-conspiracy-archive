        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This new system will be put into effect on Tuesday, December 26.</p>

<p>This is being done on a <em>trial basis</em>...we&#39;re not the first sub to experiment with this idea, and results elsewhere have generally been very positive.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it should work:</p>

<p>When submitting a link, OP will be <em>required</em> to include a statement in the comment section. This statement should briefly summarize the article (or content) of the post, as well as explain OP&#39;s justification for sharing it with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: This does <em>not</em> have to include an explanation of an &quot;explicit&quot; conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>After all, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a &quot;forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination.&quot;</p>

<p>The submission statement should accomplish a number of different objectives, with reducing spam/troll posts at the top of the list.</p>

<p>The submission statement is decidedly <em>not</em> a test of grammar/reading comprehension. </p>

<p>As has always been the case, the merits of the post will be judged by its content, and poor or weak efforts will be downvoted accordingly.</p>

<p>Similarly, statements can&#39;t merely be direct quotes from the article...OP has to demonstrate that they are making <em>some</em> attempt to connect with the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community instead of simply reposting/spamming.</p>

<p>Self posts will be unaffected by this rule, as they (ideally) should be their own justification.</p>

<p>As for how this might be enforced, we may require OP to comment on link posts within 30 minutes or so after posting before they get automatically removed.</p>

<p>Ideally, this new policy will result in an increase in quality of content as well as discourse.</p>

<p>Comments/concerns welcome!</p>

<li><strong>Tip for quickly and easily adding a Submission Statement to your post</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a method that will allow you to submit a Link post, <em>and</em> add the required &quot;Submission Statement&quot; within a matter of seconds. I hope you find it helpful. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find the article that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AWMGsfQ.png">you&#39;d like to post.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Open r/Conspiracy, and click on the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5ylGYqm.png">&quot;<em>Submit a new link</em>&quot; button in the sidebar.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Copy and paste the article link in the URL box, and copy and paste the article title (or create your own) in the Title box, as usual. <strong><em>then</em></strong> (here&#39;s the trick) click on the shadow box beside the &quot;Link&quot; tab <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CA96Ylh.png"><strong>as shown in this image</strong></a>. </p></li>
<li><p>You will see that the post has (temporarily) switched from &quot;Submit Link&quot; mode to &quot;Submit Text&quot; mode, and that a &quot;Text Box&quot; has appeared. <em>Write your &quot;Submission Statement&quot; in the Text Box</em>, then highlight and COPY the Submission Statement. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Fs8tPJ0.png"><strong>See the image here.</strong></a></p></li>
<li><p>Having copied the text of your Submission Statement, simply scroll up and click the shadow tab next to the &quot;Text&quot; tab that is now visible (see above image). This will convert your post back to the &quot;Submit Link&quot; mode, and you&#39;ll see that both the title and the link you previously entered have been preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down and press the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZSLe8pR.png">&quot;<strong>Submit</strong>&quot; button.</a> Your post will be submitted as a &quot;Link Post&quot;, and a new screen, showing the thread, will appear.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>comment section</strong> of the new screen, simply PASTE the Submission Statement that you created and copied earlier, and hit &quot;Save&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Presto. You successfully created a new link post, and added the required Submission Statement within seconds of having posted the link.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kxr4x/more_motorists_die_on_a_full_moon_new_study_shows/">Here is the Link Post I created while testing and demonstrating this method.</a> [Thread now locked]</p>

<p>This may sound complicated, but try it once or twice, and I think you&#39;ll find that it is very simple, quick and convenient.</p>

<p>EDIT: Any ideas for improvement are welcome!</p>

<p>The only real difference is toggling between the &quot;Link Post&quot; and &quot;Text Post&quot; tabs, and jotting a brief statement as to why you feel the article is of interest to this sub.</p>

<p>The mod team enthusiastically agrees.</p>

<p>Yes, in fact you&#39;re encouraged to do so!</p>

<p><em>Consistent</em> violations of any rule should result in a perm ban...but certainly we need to seem how this new system works (or doesn&#39;t) for the sub before any further sweeping or drastic changes are made.</p>

<p>Not the user you were asking but I want to give my opinion on this too. There are a couple of users around here who only post links and don&#39;t have a single comment of their own in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. To me this seems to go against the spirit of the sub and really Reddit as a whole. They aren&#39;t here to discuss anything, just to push their preferred content to other people. With this new policy it will at least force them to say <em>something</em> in their own words for once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people come to Reddit for the headlines.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that.  I don&#39;t enjoy engaging in discussion and arguments with people in most of the threads.

<p>There should be places online where a userbase can aggregate news stories that the mainstream media doesn&#39;t highlight and this sub has always been that.

<p>When is the last <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/amas">quality AMA guest</a> you have brought us as moderators?  That would be a telling sign of how interested you are in serving us as a group.  When I was elected moderator I helped bring Bill Still, James Corbett, and Russ Baker.  I also encouraged the Kevin Ryan AMA.  </p>

<p>You guys have seemed to let that go by the wayside and the guests you did bring were less than quality in my opinion.  Do you have any guests in the line up or any you&#39;d like to see here to do an AMA?</p>

<p>Of course you want us discussing this stuff ad nauseam because we as a group have no influence over it.  Unlike the pizzagate investigation that got banned or the political action that can have an actual effect in our real lives.</p>

<p>Why does it matter what I &quot;want&quot;?  You can post all of the above, and more, you just need to provide a submission statement explaining why it&#39;s important/relevant/interesting/unique/etc.  Nothing is being restricted.

<p>The definition of a spammer is one who spams.  Someone who posts a dozen articles a day but never comments in any of the threads.  Many of these posts will all be from the same few blogs/websites or will focus on the same few topics (e.g. racial issues, Donald Trump, pizzagate, etc.)  Real people have varied interests and like to discuss different topics and respond to people in their posts.  Spammers don&#39;t do any of that.</p>

<p>Are you just thinking out loud now?  Maybe you can create your own self post where you put that suggestion forward and see how it&#39;s received by the other users.  You could also just ask any of us what questions you have and they&#39;d likely be answered.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had many conversations over the years, both public and private, and now you&#39;re acting like you&#39;ve never interacted with me before.  Pretty weird...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Popular conspiracy theories&quot;.  That&#39;s a new one.  I never knew that we were supposed to judge conspiracies by how popular they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope you will be more forthcoming on that in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forthcoming about what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any concerns that this subreddit will go the way the rest of reddit has gone with easy bans, stickied posts, stickied auto-bot comments, required submission statements and whatever else this user described?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really no.  This new rule is designed to combat some of the &quot;whatever else&quot; that user described.  Pretty vague question though, if you have one more specific I&#39;d be happy to answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I still don&#39;t think the threat of shills and spammers justify more power to the moderators of Reddit to ban things they don&#39;t like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what&#39;s happening at all.  It&#39;s as if you aren&#39;t listening to anything that&#39;s being said.  What is being banned?  What power?</p>

<p>Um... what? Have you EVER shown that there are brigades going on? I see this claim all the time by mods but NEVER has one of the mods shown it is happening. I normally see this claim on posts that obviously reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, which makes these claims dubious at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain something...when posts are rising organically (without being stickied), they actually <em>lose</em> views when they are stickied prematurely.</p>

<p>Many reddit users that are subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> don&#39;t <em>regularly</em> check the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> front page...they simply browse their reddit front pages.</p>

<p>This generally means that they only see the first handful of posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>...stickying any post <em>removes</em> it front the front pages of <em>all</em> users.</p>

<p>We use the sticky for the benefit of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars, and to keep things visible that otherwise would disappear over time.</p>

<p>We frequently let announcements and other discussion threads rise organically for several hours <em>before</em> stickying.</p>

<p>We had every intention of stickying this post (for an entire week), we just let it rise organically first.</p>

<p>Do you understand?</p>

<p>No, I dont. If you really wanted to make sure people saw this you would have done an auto mod message at the start of ever thread so you could reach those people that would miss the sticky or post that is rising &quot;organically&quot;. But that idea is now bad because people know to ignore automod stickies due to the weird archive bot you guys have. </p>

<p>My opinion update and properly enforce the rules instead of wasting time with submission posts at this time. Concise and evenly applied rules by all the mods would solve so many of the problems around here. Then move to make more changes if needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how I feel about this at all. I understand that brigading, spam, etc is annoying but this seems a bit over the top. Real users here can sift through things and organically down vote it themselves. What&#39;s to stop one mod from abusing this ability to bury something that they personally don&#39;t like. A mods job is to make sure users aren&#39;t being harassed, and civil discussion is allowed etc. This sounds more like &quot;parenting&quot;. Why would this be acceptable in a sub reddit about conspiracies, when this itself could be viewed as a conspiracy. It&#39;s like the patriot act in a sense, make it sound like it&#39;s about protecting us when in fact it&#39;s limiting our rights. Do you have no faith in the actual users of this sub????</p>

Now, with this rule, we&#39;ll get to see whether they actually are bots or not.  If they&#39;re real users who actually like the subreddit, then they shouldn&#39;t have any problem writing a few sentences to justify their posts.</p>

<p>Aside from that, the simple fact that each mod plays favorites with his/her pet users (and/or alt accounts) by selectively enforcing the rules really means nothing of value will happen and this is just another way to make sure real conspiracies are discredited by allowing dedicated spammers to continue posting hoaxes.</p>

<p>You think we would let people spam the same submission statements over and over again?  All of those users will certainly be banned if they&#39;re caught doing that.</p>

<p>What does this even mean?  How is requiring someone to explain why their post is interesting or valuable &quot;treating them like children&quot;?  If you can&#39;t be bothered to justify your post in any way then maybe you shouldn&#39;t be posting it at all.  Nothing childish about that, in fact it should raise the quality of submissions significantly which is the opposite of childishness.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been letting people spam the same links over and over again almost every day for the past year, so that&#39;s a big &#39;yes&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t ban the link spammers now so you&#39;ve already <em>proved</em> that you allow people to spam this sub. I know damn well that&#39;s not going to change.</p>

<p>And testing submitters to make sure they&#39;ve done their homework absolutely <em>is</em> treating them like children no matter how you try to spin it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe you shouldn&#39;t be posting</p>

<p>You might be right there. This sub has turned too far away from it&#39;s original purpose to hold my attention anymore anyway. Over the past couple years you&#39;ve also allowed all of the comment threads to degrade into constant immature arguments and name calling. Every other post and comment is someone bitching about how everybody that disagrees with them are shills. That&#39;s why I seldom comment anymore and another reason why I won&#39;t be submitting when your new testing procedure is implemented. I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be missed but, more importantly, I won&#39;t miss this kind of crap either.</p>

<p>This sub should now more rightly be called <a href="/r/politics_hoaxes_trolls">/r/politics_hoaxes_trolls</a>. And the mod in control (the infiltrator, the vote manipulator, the coup leader, and his alt accounts), is not about to let <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> get back to its roots. Yes, I&#39;ve seen enough images of your modmails to know exactly what&#39;s going on and who really controls this sub. For the time being you&#39;re still above him on the list but, rest assured, when the time comes he&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re eliminated too. Five down, seven to go.</p>

<p>We ban dozens of them per week and this rule will make them even easier to identify.  It should also limit the total amount of spam they can post in general too since every post needs a unique submission statement.  No one will be able to just spam a bunch of links every day.</p>

<p>Check the mod log man.  We ban those users every single day of the week, year round.  If you see comments like that, report them and they&#39;ll be dealt with.</p>

<p>No idea what this means.  Who do you think controls the sub and how do they control it?  We have public mod logs.</p>

<p>Besides, only a mod higher up in the list can remove one that&#39;s lower so there isn&#39;t any way for a mod below me to &quot;eliminate me&quot; even if they wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is kind of tough because we don&#39;t want to ban the entire discussion.  Most of the posts are crosslinks to /v/pizzagate but those aren&#39;t spam per se.  Personally I think pizzagate is a massive distraction and psy-op but it isn&#39;t our place as mods to decide that and delete all of those posts.  If the same user is spamming the same links then yeah that&#39;s an issue but usually that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If they&#39;re name calling and insults and personal attacks they can and do get removed and those users banned if they continue that behavior.  You can check the mod logs yourself, as can anyone else, since they&#39;re public.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s even possible.  However, it&#39;s fairly quick to see things like: &quot;hmm.. this guy called someone a fucking scumbag shill - that&#39;s a ban&quot; or &quot;hmm... this guy&#39;s comment was kind of argumentative but he did remain civil - I&#39;ll approve that&quot;.  Not everything in the queue requires a ton of time to look at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He got top mod Sarah_Connor removed, among others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much knowledge you have of that situation but S_C had agreed multiple times to step down from the top spot and accept one lower in the mod list.  Then he reneged on that and he and a couple of the other mods attempted to have the rest of us removed so that they could take over the sub themselves and make it into what they wanted it to be.  The admins honored the democratic vote we&#39;d agreed to among the mods to have S_C removed as active top mod, so they removed him and added us all back.  You&#39;re acting like AATA (since that&#39;s clearly who you mean) can just go to the admins any time he wants and have any of us removed for whatever reason but that&#39;s not the case.  I get that from an outside perspective you don&#39;t really know what went down and don&#39;t want to take my word for it but time will show you that AATA has no power whatsoever to remove me or any of the other mods - certainly not on his own at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say anything about &quot;coordinating&quot;. All it takes is to post a link there using an alt pointing at one of the mods here to instigate the harassment and then use more alts to help with the harassment. He has a hundred subs so it&#39;s not a stretch to think he has just as many alts. In fact, look carefully at his sub list. The top mod here (AP) is targeted in one of them (with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7lcujj/targetted_harassment/drlb7c0/">this result</a>?). This is nothing new. Just think about how many mods he&#39;s fought with who have ended up being gone. He had it in for SC after SC demodded him. And he <strong><em>led the charge</em></strong> to have the admins remove SC. Flytape and SovereignMan called him out for that all caps post and they&#39;re gone. Everybody also knows GhostOfDusty was an enemy and he disappeared too. These are not coincidences. His goal is to be top mod and, slowly but surely, he&#39;s getting there. Surely you have to be aware of his constant lying about anything or anyone who opposes him. We&#39;ve all seen it in his comments here.</p>

I really don&#39;t think he&#39;s behind or involved in any of these accounts harassing JCP.  And there&#39;s a lot more to the situations you described with the mods who left.</p>

<p>SovereignMan stepped down totally on his own and ghostofdusty was constantly arguing with the whole mod team about the application of the rules and then also stepped down on his own.  AATA also didn&#39;t &quot;lead the charge&quot; to have the admins remove SC, he&#39;s just the one who sent the message to them after the entire mod team got removed by SC.</p>

<p>Could be wrong of course considering this is reddit and no one ever really knows anyone, but I&#39;m just saying how it seems from where I&#39;m sitting.

<p>Yeah, what he says about sovereignman wanting to ban discussion of pizzagate is true (he thought the whole thing was a psy-op/hoax), but he stepped down on his own.  I think his stepping down was a result of some of the pizzagate drama and disagreement with the mod team, but I think the main reason is he&#39;s an older guy and didn&#39;t have the energy to keep modding and arguing anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect Flytape and have always gotten along with him pretty well myself but he and AATA have had <em>many</em> disagreements over the years so I&#39;m not surprised he said that.  Ultimately it&#39;s just more hearsay though, I really don&#39;t think he was behind this harassment or involved in any way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even AATA&#39;s biggest supporter and have never really felt the need to defend him in the past but in this case I have to say something when I see him being accused of running a bunch of TMOR alt accounts to harass another mod with no evidence.  I don&#39;t know him or anyone else on reddit personally, but from what I&#39;ve been able to glean over the years of interacting with him he isn&#39;t that type of person.</p>

<p>I obviously could be wrong, but I need more than people who don&#39;t like him simply slandering him without any proof.  The only piece of evidence presented so far of value is the thread you linked before (which I thank you for), but even that doesn&#39;t convince me he&#39;s involved in this harassment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re going to require a statement why require the OP to comment within 30 minutes of posting?  This part is terrible to me.  If it&#39;s a good post and produces organic discussion then OP has already done their job and aren&#39;t required to continue good discussion.  Besides, how often do people post then go to work, or get caught up with something, and not make it back to the post?  I see so many submissions on this sub of people complaining about the invasiveness of technology and now there is a chance of a rule that will require someone to go back unnecessarily, when they may have made a good post but for some IRL reason can&#39;t reengage immediately.  I think mods should rethink this one.</p>

We have been talking about the rules over the past couple of months though and are considering making a few changes so that they&#39;re more clear and so that there&#39;s less overlap between them since a few are a bit redundant.  We haven&#39;t finalized anything on that front though as of yet.</p>

<p>I think you should roll that out at the same time if not before you do submission links. Concise rules that are properly enforced would do much better in my opinion.</p>

<p>idk....in the end I am happy to see that the mod team is at least trying <em>something</em> to reign in some ,of the spam.</p>

<p>One of the problems I have seen in the /new queue from time to time is that good <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> stuff will be subject to queue sliding with shitposts, links and spam. It can get frustrating for those of us who work the new queue to upvote good conspiracy stuff and work to participate in the comment sections of the posts germane to the sub. It gets so frustrating that I have had to just stop trying and give myself a break from the frustration.</p>

<p>I am more than willing to support the efforts of the mods to try things, even if it is for a trial period like this policy is, to see if it can possibly work and be a positive change. </p>

<p>I wish this was the case, but the mods will be just as likely to ban users like myself, which they have in the past, as new users who spam.  If they dislike the content, they can find a way to ban.

There are users who come here and post dozens of political links per day or dozens of tweets per day yet never participate in any of the threads.

<p>Have you been paying attention to the content that gets posted to this sub every day?  There are hundreds of spam posts <em>per day</em>, many of which receive massive amounts of mysterious upvotes.  If you haven&#39;t noticed by now, a lot of the voting patterns on reddit haven&#39;t been organic for at least the last five years.  &quot;Downvote and move on&quot; really isn&#39;t a valid option anymore, as the current quality of posts to the subreddit blatantly shows.</p>

<p>Err... isn&#39;t the submission statement what this entire thread and our conversation here has been about?  I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re fine with the submission statement, that&#39;s all that&#39;s being asked of the OP: a few sentences of context/justification/explanation/elaboration/etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible I&#39;m mistaken, but I don&#39;t see this being a help any more than that long list of 12 rules on the right. I don&#39;t think another rule is going to solve the issue. I could be wrong, and I&#39;m glad you all are trying new stuff because the shilling is a serious problem, but I have my doubts about this being a good thing.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, when I discussed submission statements with CelineHagbard a while back on CST my exact thought train was - </p>

<p>If you could make people actually argument and analyse what they are posting then they themselves might gain some insight into the stuff they are posting and what they are doing.</p>

<p>Making people argument their points (and in this case, their links) can be a great way for them to realize that they may be spreading misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Of course this applies to paid shills much less, since they know what they are doing and are spreading misinformation on purpose, yet even they might get some insight into their own madness if they need to make a concise argument about what they are linking. </p>

I said it elsewhere in this thread but if we have trolls/shills/spammers/etc. &quot;pretending&quot; to be real users, then at a certain point they kind of become real users by default.  They&#39;re being forced to participate in their own threads at least to some small degree so the option to just spam dozens of political articles or tweets by Donald Trump simply won&#39;t be there anymore.

<p>Different rules for different subs.  At C_S_T we expect the posts to be thoughtful and some effort put into them in order to elevate the discussion (at least that&#39;s the hope).  That type of moderation style would never work on a larger sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and that isn&#39;t what we&#39;re aiming for here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it does nothing to solve the problem regarding paid accounts but rather stifles discussion here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does it stifle discussions?  If anything, having the OP explain why his post is interesting and valuable to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would only enhance the level of discourse imo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one of the most annoying questions is, what’s the conspiracy here aka I don’t like this post and we want to institutionalize this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, now users will be required to demonstrate that their posts actually do have some relevance or value to the subreddit.  The main point is to cut down on spammers who post dozens of links per day yet never comment in any of the threads and are basically just posting clickbait for upvotes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I agree, but not sure how that&#39;s relevant to this discussion or what you&#39;re asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you take it a step further. Instead of requiring something within 30 minutes of submitting a link, instead put link posts in an approval queue and if they are not submitted with a comment then don&#39;t approve them to even show up in the queue at all. </p>

<p>I do not know if there is a way to <em>only</em> queue submitted link posts while allowing self posts to bypass a mod approval queue, but that would reduce the spammy, repeat, political crap even further. </p>

<p>You could also  allow established/known members of the community, who have no track record of submitting junk to the sub  and/or abusing the no-censorship policy to bypass the link approval process completely. This would prevent these new and unknown accounts from submitting crap to the sub as we so often see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s more work for us.  In an ideal world, all link posts or almost all link posts will have submission statements and there will be no work required on our part.  We don&#39;t want to have to individually check every single link post for a statement - that&#39;s why we&#39;ll have automod just automatically remove them after a set amount of time if one hasn&#39;t been added.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know, you would probably have to do some coding and or make yet <em>another</em> mod tool or something.</p>

<p>I think that if you want to reduce your workload then perhaps consider forgetting about the 30 minute requirement and have automoderator just delete ALL of the link posts submitted without any content in the text box when they are submitted. </p>

<p>It really is not that hard nor is it an unreasonable amount of effort you are asking for. I have been in other very healthy subs such as r/gameofthrones/ that have much more stringent posting quirements. That sub seem to do just fine. You guys are really not asking for a lot as far as I am concerned. I am just glad to see something being <em>tried</em>.</p>

<p>Whenever a change occurs there are always complainers and doomsayers who think that <em>any</em> change is going to somehow &quot;destroy the sub&quot;. They are the ones who end up being wrong much more often than the moderators who are trying to address a known problem. History, and over 10 years on reddit, and shown me this over and over again.</p>

<p>I think this effort is going to improve the health and quality of this subreddit. I do not even feel like I am going out on a limb at all by predicting that this effort is going to work out just fine in the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the thing with link posts is that you aren&#39;t given a text box.  You only have the headline and the link (and an image if you want to include one).  So users will need to then go in and submit their statements within the thread itself as a reply to their own post.</p>

<p>Funny how a lot of those accounts tend to be under 6 months old isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>As far as the effects of this, I can&#39;t imagine that it will make the quality of the sub worse though, in my mind it can only improve things.  The question I have is <em>how much</em> it can/will improve things but time will tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That looks like a bug of some kind in your screenshot because it gives you the text for both a link post <em>and</em> a text post (i.e. &quot;you are submitting a text-based...&quot; &amp; &quot;you are submitting a link...&quot;).</p>

<p>You should only have one of those descriptions.  My guess is that if you attempted to create a link post with text added that it wouldn&#39;t work when you tried submitting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows up whenever I load the page to submit a link. I thought it might be a &quot;night mode&quot; thing, or something specific to this sub or when &quot;using subreddit style&quot;, but the optional text box briefly shows up at the very beginning whenever I load a page to submit a link. I see it in this sub, in reddit default, night mode, or subreddit style and it shows up in other subreddits whenever I load the link submission page in all instances. </p>

<p>That optional text box IS there. The example in my screenshot is typical of all link submission pages. You look closely and you can see that it IS the link tab being highlighted and the blue box underneath the tab even says I am submitting a LINK...I  thought maybe it&#39;s an issue unique to using Google Chromium with RES, but I can also see the text box, very briefly, even when I use Firefox and Google Chrome loading/re-loading the link submission page. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a reddit bug, not a screenshot bug.  I don&#39;t know what would be causing it but the fact that it shows the description of both a text post and a link post simultaneously, and the fact that it only shows for a few seconds, tells me that it&#39;s reddit not functioning the way it should.  It could be something as simple as you needing to clear your internet cache/cookies, who knows?  As I said though, I think if you did try to submit a link post with that text field filled in that it would give you some type of error or would simply not show the text you wrote in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s only one &quot;submit&quot; page. When you load the &quot;submit a new link&quot; page, it loads the text box element, then hides it with javascript/CSS. Then if you switch to &quot;new text post,&quot; it only has to switch over using javascript, instead of having to load a brand new page or make another request to reddit&#39;s servers.

So with all thats going on in the world its nice to be allowed access to developments more current. Unfortunately the root of the subject material PG involves is dependant on bieng enabled by public silence. 
Bullying in the form of removing any simple collective efforts by citizens to provide victims any empowerment. If you tell anyone noone will believe you should sound familiar here... </p>
