       Porn has become TPTB most accessible device for psychological manipulation.  There have been other posts detailing its negative effect on the brain.  I was doing some research into porn's relation to erectile dysfunction and I have come to the conclusion that it is being used as a population control weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found
       <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/879982">
        this
       </a>
       article on medscape which draws some frightening correlations  between porn and erectile dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A 2014 US armed forces health surveillance survey found that rates of erectile dysfunction had more than doubled during the preceding decade, from about 6 per 1000 person-years to about 13 per 1000 person-years, he reported. This increase was primarily accounted for by an increase in the incidence of psychogenic, rather than organic, erectile dysfunction, and coincided with the growth of pornography on the internet.
       </p>
       <p>
        To see whether there is a correlation between addiction to pornography and sexual dysfunction, Dr Christman and coauthor Jonathan Berger, MD, also from the Naval Medical Center San Diego, used an anonymous survey that included questions about sexual function, preferences, and pornography use, as well as the usual demographic and medical history questions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The survey was offered to 20- to 40-year-old patients who presented to their urology clinic.
       </p>
       <p>
        A total of 439 men received questionnaires, and 314 (71.5%) responded. In all, 71 women were given the surveys, and 48 (68%) responded. The majority of both male and female responders were active-duty military (96.8% and 58%, respectively).
       </p>
       <p>
        Men were evaluated for sexual function with the International Index of Erectile Function 15-item questionnaire, and women with the validated Female Sexual Function Index. Addiction to pornography was measured by two validated instruments: the Pornography Craving Questionnaire and the Obsessive Passion Scale.
       </p>
       <p>
        In all,
        <strong>
         27% of male respondents had sexual dysfunction
        </strong>
        , as defined by an International Index of Erectile Function score of 25 or less, and
        <strong>
         52% of females had sexual dysfunction
        </strong>
        , as defined by a Female Sexual Function Index score of 26.55 or less.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The numbers don't lie.  What's interesting is that porn's ability to cause sexual dysfunction is even greater among females.  Porn is not healthy and natural.  It can destroy a person's ability to have sex and intimacy with someone they love.  The fact that it is so accessible to everyone at a young age is cause for concern.

       Agreed.  I am planning on doing more research into this. Thank you for your help. I find the PIED numbers helpful because they are concrete evidence of porns negative effects.  It's much harder to prove a nefarious agenda such as controlling the population even though I know this to be true.

       I suspect some do, but that the "billions are made in porn" myths are often fueled by people
       <em>
        not wanting to admit
       </em>
       that what they're doing is
       <em>
        harming people
       </em>
       - that they're paid basically crap. It's much easier to imagine that they're all millionaires with no care in the world.

       What's worse is that it directly accesses the dopamine factory in the brain. That's about as close as you can get to the levers of control over human behavior. In a word, addiction.

       The problem is that most ordinary users cannot simply unhook themselves from this stuff. It's a hard-wired response.

       Very few groups have advocated for that solution; and ever since the Enlightenment people have a

       Who is going to jump into the middle of an obscene psychological freight train running off the rails, and tell us exactly where that line between art and porn, between freedom of speech and mind control of the masses, between legitimate aids to arousal that is pair-bonding and family-strengthening and soul-destructive satanic fetish?

       That battle is already on. The wars in the middle east have an implicit factor nobody on either side will state out loud: porn. The muslims rightly see it as an incredibly insidious attack on their culture and religion; the post-christian west sees it as a hallmark of enlightenment reason and tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big-C "Church" is hardly in the game at all, since making any sort of common cause with the militant middle eastern critique of Voltaire is out of the question.

       I think there's way more to that than people want to admit - the problems run deep and basically
       <em>

       Sure, I already mention hard-wired, addiction-level "want" involved in porn and the public. It's an age-old, humanity-level issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a political issue too. So far, the muslim masses appear to be willing to follow their religious leadership on the porn prohibition issue, as did Americans until the 1960's, and in both eras, porn constitutes a significant part of the reactionary vs. liberal political struggle.

       while it is true that all (with the exceptions of Our Lord and the Blessed Mother) have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, my comment was made in jest. criticisms of e. michael jones as an antisemite fail to adequately comprehend (let alone rebut) his arguments, and i regard the term "radtrad" as a loathsome neologism which is ironic in its hatefulness as it is notable for its lack of literary grace.

       If women stopped working tomorrow, you'd lose about 40% of labor productivity.  You'd get increased salaries but higher prices of goods and services to spend those higher salaries on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may get your wish, though.  A current worry among the chattering classes is what to do when automation removes all the jobs.  I read something that theorized that one way society might adapt is reverting back to more traditional family structures, since they are compatible with lower labor participation rates.

       I think it kind of depends on how automation deals with an economy driven by consumer consumption.  If you eliminate consumers by eliminating jobs for consumers, who buys your products?
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be that stuff gets really cheap and governments extend basic incomes to head off political crisis, offsetting producer automation efficiency, demand and job losses.  In that case I definitely see a highly local and ad-hoc local economic activity springing up, where people re-invent their own local economy to offset wage losses.  A spouse that stays home and does a lot of what traditional "at home wives" do starts to make economic sense again.  The marginal utility of domestic work goes back up above the marginal value of low-wage jobs.

       People who work for money produce even if it is not material output.  40% is a rough number approximation based on female labor participation.  Given the number of women in service industries I would expect those to be hit particularly hard.

       Wasn't it the conservative/capitalist system always trying to undermine and destroy workers unions to keep the wages low, and thus creating low income households?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as i remember from my childhood, here in the GDR (communist east Germany) we had no problem with too low fertility rates mostly because of free daycare and free schools, free universities. Until the end of the 80's the fertility rate in east Germany was mostly always 0,4-0,5 above the rate of west Germany.

       It's not to keep wages low.  It's to keep your own business, that you own, in your own hands without someone else having veto power on what you're going to or slowing down reaction time, or making simple decisions complex.

       Nah, Ordoliberalism/Ordoliberalism in Westdeutschland did foster other structures to stabilize wages, but then, curiously, they imported the Turks etc. exactly when the US did their thing, the civil rights movement and various legislative adaptations, meanwhile Britain/UK ... the islands did the same with their economy, the big Empire, block-like union based production held up to the end of the 70ies and then zack, Thatcher. Luckily they found oil afterwards, the Germans found free labor (Ossis) and the US found Greenspan and his secret Chinese "Schuldenquelle".

       The turks, italians, greeks and spaniards were bought to Germany because the industry needed a lot of workers,  in that exact time fell the so called "German Wirtschaftswunder".
It wasn't really a kind or instrument to keep wages low. Well Wages maybe would have risen to a certain degree when there isn't enough people for labour. But i think not that much. Also at this time the difference in wealth was way more smaller than it is now.
Societies will face the next problem with more automatisation of industry.
I for myself think that an idea of an unconditional basic income is a topic worth discussing. Also some managers in industry and academics see this an unavoidable step to keep the capitalist system in order/balance (well it was never balanced but not as much in unbalance as now).

       Wait no. Those coming over the Gotthard to work in Switzerland came into a country where in many regions shit still meant wealth, i.e. a mostly agricultural country. But living in Italy meant to do nothing, because the war killed the infrastructure of their South more than their North. The disparity was "more than 100%", because labor was then brought on top of the disparity elsewhere. Today migrating even from very afar means to earn in some ratio like six or seven times more as a simple, but learned worker. Back then the lot was to have nothing to do or earn 400 CHF per month. Not 200€ or 2000€ like today.
       <br/>
       It exactly
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       an instrument to keep wages slow, I can't recall the minutes of our parliament but my grand-father and other old folk remembered the cited discussion on national television, because the fear was after the war inflation could run away again (back then and because of the gold standard and in a capital inflow situation, labor was important in this regard, it changed in the 70ies abruptly when oil went up and Bretton Woods went down).
       <br/>
       In absolute numbers the Gastarbeiter weren't even that many, just certain parts and restricted to certain branches, but the effect was that giant, capital intensive stuff could be built like the late national highway system. This is what I meant. The US shoveled Blacks into service jobs to taper that kind of labor shortage. The last wave of stitches over those kind of problems were the Hispanics, which broke the Camels back and brought on Trump.

       he obviously implied that people are being "manipulated" into being homosexuals for the sake of population control.he implied the same about women being manipulated to work rather than raise children.seemed pretty clear cut to me.

       tell me one good reason we shouldnt evolve as a species, and remain at the same basic standards and ways we held 100 years ago, 500 years ago, 1000 years ago.if there truly were some people manipulating us out there, i would think thats what they would rather want, for us to stop evolving and keep quiet and docile.
      </p>
      <p>
       and above all that, depending on your pov, promoting women making children is very much population control as well.many babies, keep them dumb through the dogshit educational system, free votes, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree that throwing labels doesnt change anything, but thats not my purpose.many people here are beyond saving, they are too far deep their imaginary rabbit hole, so im not really keen on censoring myself.

       The "jewish control" was already mentioned. Curiously the very orthodox jews always had a high fertility rate and there the woman are the ones that work, while the men study their religious texts. The less or non-religious jewish population shows similar pattern in sinking fertility rate as other western countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's strange that nobody mentions pregnancy prevention, social status and lack of institutionial help to raise children, free daycare, free schools, free university.
In a Society were becoming a child includes a risk and burden you can'T except that the fertility rate is stable.
But still in most western countries the lower social classes almost have a higher fertility rate than the middle class. (perhaps i could imagine that more porn would be consumed in lower or non income households as in others)
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important factors plays the role of the anti-baby pills and how they are affordable for households, combined with the financial/social risks of a parenthood.
An example how both could be combined without having significant Drops in fertility rate is how the communist countries like the GDR handled the situation. First of all the women were emancipated from the beginning there, then the anti-baby pill was free but at the same time provided free daycare for children. As a result the fertility rate was always 0,4-0,5 higher as in western Germany, especially interesting when you take in count that in the 50's and early 60's it was very common in west Germany for the women to stay at home and don't go to work, while in east Germany they were involved in the working market from the beginning.

       If you drill down to it as a whole, but let's focus on developer positions. By 2020 we will have almost 1.5 million new developer jobs. But we only have 500k people expected to graduate and enter the workforce. That's why companies started hiring boot camp graduates like me. It also happens to be a male dominated field with little if any females in the average development shop

       Uh, giant problem. Then somebody else will do it. Maybe somebody abroad? Maybe somebody from a country where a bucket means incredible wealth? I find it hilarious how the left in the US screams for immigration, while what Trump does automatically means a very fast redistribution of wealth to the abject poor of this world.

       Is too late for that. Just because women stop working doesn't mean the cost of living would suddenly drop. Most families are duel income because of how expensive it is to live. The family unit had to adapt to tptb jacking up inflation.

       Many, oh god many. Being gay is probably something random and throughout history, the tale of the little bit off family is being told everywhere, across the world. Maybe they find out that the drive to have kids can be independent of being gay, I really don't know. Having offspring, family or "decent, organized" life has probably less to do with the organic factors of one's sex life.

       since the concept of "homosexuality" is less than two centuries old, i respectfully disagree. lest you think that my stance is one born of "homophobia" (whatever that is), i will point out that lgbt advocates/propagandists have made the same point.

       less savory than others). simply having children does not constitute creating a nuclear family. in addition to having children, high investment parenting and monogamy are both implied. how common is a desire for monogamy among self-identified male homosexuals? it's

       I agree somewhat with your interjections. Random can still include something not predetermined but fixed and what I meant with having children is founding a nuclear family for social safety reasons and acceptance within a community, but also because it somewhat feels right to them. Today the (urban) agenda is to almost nail them onto a different lifestyle/life path. My impression is that nobody knows what really is happening but some have a strong and very well delivered agenda to impress a specific group into how they should live their lives.

       is larry flynt jewish? were bob guccione or hugh hefner jewish? jewish overrepresentation in the pornography industry is a topic worthy of discussion, but the language you are using here paints with too broad of a brush. incidentally, it also leaves you open to the charge that you believe that all or most ethnic jews (irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack thereof) support the pornography industry.

       It's also not the fault of those jewish banking families to have experienced xenophobic behavior in 'ancient' human times and learned only to trust Familial/religious relations. There's a reason those families 'keep it in the family' and part is due to the persecution of the Jews.

       your assertions are dubious, in part because the "xenophobic behavior" you are referencing was often -- albeit not always -- provoked by the xenophobic behavior of jews themselves.

       I don't it's possible to find a 'who was right' in the scenario of the xenophobia exhibited by the jews and against the jews. I'm just saying I understand the larger 'families' attempting to keep money in the hands of people whom they can find a moral/ethics barometer similar to their own. whatever that may mean in today's society is a whole other story.

       It's actually a good point to bring up, as historically, and I mean for thousands of years, Jews have been financiers and bankers. And this isn't like a race or deroagatory thing, they just have always dealt with the money of societies, oftentimes because the rulers and other officials didn't want to. This was also a way for them to establish themselves within societies that would otherwise want them out of their country. So, they became good at finances and economics, and perhaps, today, this is more easily known because of the internet and knowledge being so easily available about litereally everything that goes on int he world, but in all actuality it has always been the case that jewish people run the money game, that's what they're often times good at --among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, with these industries, the porn industry, film industry, etc., they are widespread primarily because money allows them to be. If mr. jew person wasn't behind the scenes making all the financial decisions with regards to promotion and distribution, etc., then the porn industries and film industries would probably still exist but just on a more local and small scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not necessarily, a problem of "the jews run the industry," its a problem of people buying into. People have the choice to not watch porn or watch the movies at the theatre or on tv., that is entirely a persons choice, it just doesn't always seem that way.

       I have a hard part with the "they just have always dealt with the money of societies, oftentimes because the rulers and other officials didn't want to".  What ruler or society didn't want to deal with money.  The perk of being a ruler by definition is money control.

       Porn is an interesting one. I’ve seen some satanic symbolism in some porn videos which made me skeptical of pornography’s intentions. It can hear men towards being more submissive (female domination) and it can also destroy the typical family home (man and woman). Porn addiction is definitely a threat to the traditional marriage. Just ask

       Didn't the government encourage the sexual revolution in the late 1960s to prevent a real anti-government revolution? Who wants to overthrow the government when you can have sex instead? Maybe I'm oversimplifying it, but there was something i heard about this being the case.

       In an unironically anti-no-true-scotsman way I want to make a different case. The hidden plague AIDS introduced an opportunity to reign this freedom in. A true sexually liberated society (which sadly sounds like "true communism", but bear a little further), means there is no control via sex. By definition. One woman could manipulate two men into hating each other but teh state and teh church can't. Family and promised bonds could be separated from sexual confusion. Everything has to be completely transparent. Any double standards vanish. There are no sluts. There is no adultery. A women can't abandon the family "because he had an affair" etc.
       <br/>
       Unconventional disease and new burdens introduce another layer of conveniently "natural" control. It is natural, but the hideous delay between medicinal detection and societal acceptance seems to me a liiiitle bit to long back there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who wants to overthrow the gov. when you can have sex instead? Well, those who want it to have their way but the gov. still adheres to old power structures which are incompatible with said sexual structures. Timely there are "friendly" court cases flattening the legal landscape into a pan cake, but this is another can of worms.

       mmm never thought of that, also my theory is its promoting multiculturalism....destruction of western values, family values, degeneracy and with all that...u controls the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much interracial porn, portraiing white woman as whores for non whites to satified, sex meat, u DO NOT SEE this range of image to say latinas or asian, arabs...nope....just this complete degeneracy to white folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also white males are show as weak, pathetic and seeing how THEY are portraing males as weaklings, sissies, inferior.

      <p>
       All while praising blacks as superior, dominant and masters of whites, overrating their penises...

       kinda pathetic actually....and yes i watch porn, but recently i been reducing the views, weird i stop seeing it when i had a girlfriend...

       It's part of ending human sexual reproduction. With the advances of crisper and artificial wombs. Some people believe it is time humanity put itself in charge of it's own evolution. So random mixing of genetics in 25 years will seem archaic. Of course those who are geneticly engineered will see themselves as superior, and us as trash that needs to be taken out. Star trek predicts the future again.

       Who is behind the porn scene? Why do they push insest fantacies lately? Every attack at its core by them in on the family unit. First give women the vote and put them to work. Next create the divorce industry. In the media normalize blended families. 1 generation later blended families become normal, so step/incest porn starts to get pushed to destroy the already fractured family unit. Take care of your family have a big one. Red pill them.

       From testimonials of young men on 4chan who stuggle with porn addiction as well as the no fap community. This is like asking how does a doctor know the side effects of a substance if they never consumed that substance. How do you know what is real outside of your own experiences? How do you know Israel is commiting war crimes if you are not an Israeli commiting war crimes? Not very sound logic, especially for r/conspiracy. What is your motivation for browsing this sub?

       Not on me on the population and I will not play word games with you. There is a community of people that already agree with me so I dont really feel the need to address you, (especially on this sub). I have a comfy echo chamber on 4 chan. Come over and try this stuff over there.

       Well you proof it, there are millions of women intellectual superior to you and they earn the right vote more than someone who is following some caveman logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       C'mon little man, if you fail at women all the time because of how you look, at least try to be some kind of patient and smart. You don't have to be alone, you should improve on your social competence, which is lacking most of the fundamental Basics.
Then you finally don't have to rely on porn anymore. ;)

       Insults aside if the woman in the relationship is better poilitically versed than her husband or even her gay partner whatever the household situation is, she should should be able through discussion be able to convince the rest of the household on why they as a family unit should vote for candidate X. A household should make decisions as a unit on many things. What house to buy, what to eat, what entertainment to consume etc. Your hostile reaction only shows the wedge that politics place between people. Politics are already corrupt as they recieve donations from entities that fund all sides. Again, not really a porn watcher, and I am happy part of a family unit. These are just my findings from seeing how the world operates. Porn is a weapon on the mind. I see many young men struggle with thier sense of self worth and yes many of them have abhorent views of women. There was a stage in porn where there was lots of violent chocking and degredation. Now they have moved on to incenst fantacies. A quick check of pornhubs front page will show you this. You dont need to consume content to be aware of it. Adhominum attacks are not a great approach to discussion. This is a conspiracy community and we should be respectful to one another. I suspect you have been sent here to be disruptive by your tone and hostile nature. Please note this is not r/thedonald and we dont need to be brigaded and politically rededucated. You should actually open your mind up and accept that we all have different life experiences and opinions and not everyone who is different from you deserves to be personally attacked. I hope you find something here that sets you on a new spiritual and intellectual path. All the best.

       If you find degeneracy in any form, and you look to the creators, I have found that this pattern reemerges over, and over, and over. You get to where you get a feel for it, and almost know what is created by Jews before you even look it up. It's very sad.

      <p>
       It's not to keep wages low.  It's to keep your own business, that you own, in your own hands without someone else having veto power on what you're going to or slowing down reaction time, or making simple decisions complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really cutthroat companies actually try to encourage unions in their competitors, because it's a good way to eliminate the competition.

       Nah, Ordoliberalism/Ordoliberalism in Westdeutschland did foster other structures to stabilize wages, but then, curiously, they imported the Turks etc. exactly when the US did their thing, the civil rights movement and various legislative adaptations, meanwhile Britain/UK ... the islands did the same with their economy, the big Empire, block-like union based production held up to the end of the 70ies and then zack, Thatcher. Luckily they found oil afterwards, the Germans found free labor (Ossis) and the US found Greenspan and his secret Chinese "Schuldenquelle".

       is larry flynt jewish? were bob guccione or hugh hefner jewish? jewish overrepresentation in the pornography industry is a topic worthy of discussion, but the language you are using here paints with too broad of a brush. incidentally, it also leaves you open to the charge that you believe that all or most ethnic jews (irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack thereof) support the pornography industry.
