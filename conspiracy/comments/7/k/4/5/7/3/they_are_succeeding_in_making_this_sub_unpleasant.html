The other issue, and more to your point, the stuff in <em>new</em> gets fucking deleted! That&#39;s half the problem, right?? People spending time and energy to craft a thread, just to have it deleted for no good reason other than a reference to the pool rules. They know this. That NEW is the only bastion of hope. They delete shit ALL fucking day. Stuff that I am interested in reading. It&#39;s like burning books.</p>

<p>That was wild. All of a sudden users went from discussing conspiracies to actually watching one unfold first hand. It was like in a movie where all of the sudden “you’re in the game”.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what the actual fallout from that was? Were flytape and Sara Conner martyrs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno but they were OG mods and paid the ultimate price when they tried to get the rest of the mods off reddit modmail to be able to chat to each other away from reddit admin eyes and vet better. Kind of like what t_d does. It keeps a tighter ship. As far as I know they don&#39;t even allow mods who don&#39;t go into voice chat.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the argument that the two were planning to clean house and some mods below in power didn&#39;t appreciate it and went to the admins to prevent it before it could happen. </p>

<p>Now the debate is whether fly tape and Sarah Connor were being smart or destructive to the sub. The current mods would argue that they were up to no good.</p>

<p>I wish there was more discussion on this but it kinda got wrapped in in the same manner the LV conspiracy was shut the case after Campos showed up on Elen D. who had connections to the MGM and everyone blindly clapped. Kind of like in the same manner spez justified his massive breach of trust on this site by calling t_d trolls and that what he did wasn&#39;t &quot;cool&quot; and he wont do it again and the minions clapped.</p>

<p>Like really? We just witnessed the biggest breach of trust on this site ever and it was just downplayed so easily?</p>

<p>So to me this stinks a bit because it is reminiscent of those scenarios in terms of similar patterns.</p>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong conspiracy mods. I&#39;m just all for transparency especially in these turbulent times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would do it because I don&#39;t think you understand the magnitude behind those actions. You&#39;re missing the whole point here.</p>

<p>You&#39;re willing for a company to set precedence and to have that one day bite YOU in the ass when reddit doesn&#39;t agree with one of your view points? That&#39;s a very slippery slope. Remember, precedence was set and the community blindly embraced it so is very likely to happen again if we are going to be a realistic here.</p>

<p>Also saying because he was drunk is a completely irresponsible response and mentality on your part. Being drunk and angry does not warrant privacy breach does not justify it whatsoever.</p>

<p>Also although the accusations were excessive, he did shutdown the pizzagate sub which means he sold out to people who defend pedophila. It&#39;s common sense. I would be pissed too if someone impeded on an citizen&#39;s investigation if the authorities weren&#39;t willing to so anything about it because the people were too powerful. That&#39;s what spez did. He stopped an investigation from happening. This was not a partisan issue until it was engineered to become one.</p>

<p>From 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Penn state UP lies in a pretty conservative county, but has been gravitating to the left in the past 10 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2000: Bush 52%, Gore 43%
2008: Obama 55%, McCain 44%
2012: Obama 49%, Romney 49%. Actually, incredibly close in this county. 20 votes separate the two (Romney win) with 67000 votes tallied in Centre County.</p>

<p>I believe that the university itself is pretty liberal, but the immediate surrounding areas are pretty conservative.</p>

<p>How can a person answer that? hehe. I mean. What, do you want, 500 links to shit that&#39;s gone? All snideness aside, if you spend time here engaged in topics like, for example, all the fake or black-ops &quot;shootings&quot;, moon landing, 911, boston, aurora, sandy crooks, etc, and actually are engaged in threads where you see things wiped-out by a mod, it&#39;s mindboggling the tenacity. It&#39;s overwhelming the amount of content that gets removed.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that what they want, to push people from the front page where &quot;normal&quot; people will go? The only posts that will reach r/all are the posts that would be in r/conspiracy/hot. Telling regular conspiracy commenters to only comment in brand new posts means the shills will have total control of the comment sections of r/all posts, so that &quot;normal&quot; people will only see the shill comments. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what the top comment will be. If they have 1000 people/bots up-voting their own comments, what difference would it make if you, a regular commenter, gets to post a good comment on a breaking news post first? Your time would better be used countering whatever shill comment they vote to the top with 500 up-votes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the shills operate on both ends, but if we abandon /new it lets them determine what gets to the /hot tab in the first place. By fighting in /new, we have a better chance of determining what gets to the front page, and to set the tone of a post if it does reach the front page, because by the time it gets there its trajectory is already determined, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>The best discussion of this sub is to be found on /new, so are the best topics that don&#39;t get upvoted to the front page. It&#39;s not worth abandoning them so that &quot;normal people&quot; can be argued with. It is up to the &quot;normal&quot; people to make the jump and come to /new to see what this sub is about and to start contributing to it. I feel the real battle is in /new, and if we abandon it then we lose the sub completely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the two biggest problems are the following. A) No single user should have the ability to make five posts an hour. This is for a fact done on purpose. What&#39;s even worse, the mods make tons of posts linking us to MSM websites. In a better universe, mods would police the flooding out of the sub, or create a triple-column front page (hot) that has politics, and news links parsed out from self-posts. I mean, no offence to the mods, but many many of their posts are titled links to MSM sites with a matter-of-fact title that mirrors the freaking title at CNN or DailyMAIL, etc. What&#39;s the point of that? Once in a blue moon is fine, but not ten a day, from mods, that ALWAYS end up on the front page with like 104 upvotes in 3 hours, come on guys.</p>

<p>And B) the mods delete a <em>shit-ton</em> of comments and posts that ARE NOT worthy of being fucking deleted. I&#39;ve seen it done here for years. It sucks, because this is r/c, man. And they claim to &#39;live and let live&#39;, but actually the mods at r/c are SUPER lax about conspiracy-less posts, but when somebody asks a question about boston finger paint hoax, and some video somebody was looking for, the mods come along and fucking DELETE the post! And claim some &quot;RULE&quot;. Then, you check their history, and they don&#39;t even spend time in this sub! It&#39;s not good.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m curious, what exactly do you &quot;tag&quot; people as? If you tag every single account, do you tag by political affiliation, or if you don&#39;t know that about a certain person, do you tag them with something like &quot;likes kittens&quot; if they mention kittens?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the point he&#39;s making. </p>

<p>Tag everyone as whatever you want. I&#39;ll go through my process with this guy up there.</p>

<p>Well a quick look at his submitted posts and it looks like he&#39;s farming post karma in the uncensored news subreddit with the sexual assault news. Account is 18 days old but that&#39;s basically meaningless unless you have the context to tie it to. Possibly hates Jeff Bezos. Last comment before the one you replied to is telling people, Net neutrality is over and for them to &quot;go away&quot;. </p>

<p>Also </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hot damn, he keeps getting better! He&#39;ll probably smoke this thing with 20 points to spare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to a post titled this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Report: Roy Moore quoted Hitler, questioned 9/11 attacks in 2011 interviews</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Geeze, I&#39;m really hardpressed on what to tag that guy.</p>

<p>For you, your tag I&#39;mma go with &quot;I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, but... Fuck yeah Star Trek&quot; </p>

<p>I find tagging gives a better context to some people when they say strange things. I lot of people I don&#39;t tag because I have seen them over time or have them tagged because of browser RES extension. Others I forget to tag because I&#39;m on mobile sometimes.</p>

<p>Anyway, cool username.</p>

<p>Hah! I can understand that tag. I wish I didn&#39;t feel this weird need to pre-emptively defend myself, or to try and always explain the fact that not only Trump voters/supporters believe, support, or can defend something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very frustrating how many people lately are completely obsessed with the &quot;If you believe this thing, you must also believe this other unrelated thing!&quot; idea. Though I do get why the whole &quot;I&#39;m not a black man, but..&quot; thing can be annoying.</p>

<p>&quot;This sub was taken over at some point. I&#39;m positive of this. I can&#39;t provide much detail without getting banned but I believe I know what&#39;s going on. Certain shill accounts are actually either ran by certain mods, or just allowed all together. Squishyisbest is a good example. I got a permanent ban after commenting in one of his posts saying &quot;oh look it&#39;s squishy again doing what squishy does best&quot;. This comment banned me for rule 10 and &quot;harassment&quot;. The mod who banned me gave no reason and would not respond to me. I got my ban repealed because I posted proof, I even asked why squishy is still not banned despite breaking one of the rules everyday with spam and why I was banned for absolutely no reason by this mod. I can only conclude they either let this happen, or mods control some of the frequent ones such as squishy (which would explain my ban and not his, and why the particular mod would not respond). One of the older mods had unbanned me and was the only one responding to me. Squishy is still doing it and has been everyday and no ban. This is how I know this sub was taken over, just like r/politics and T_D. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the explanation! I appreciate it. It makes sense. Not sure why the concept of tagging people other than suspected shills, alts, etc escaped me, but I get it now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For you, your tag I&#39;mma go with &quot;I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, but... Fuck yeah Star Trek&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hah! I can understand that tag. I wish I didn&#39;t feel this weird need to pre-emptively defend myself, or to try and always explain the fact that not only Trump voters/supporters believe, support, or can defend something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very frustrating how many people lately are completely obsessed with the &quot;If you believe this thing, you must also believe this other unrelated thing!&quot; idea. Though I do get why the whole &quot;I&#39;m not a black man, but..&quot; thing can be annoying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, cool username.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And thanks! So far, you&#39;re the first to mention it. ❤</p>
