      <p>
       I’ve been interested in moral panic for some time as I think it describes what is happening socially on both sides of the political debate in some form or other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then today, when revisiting the wiki page about it, I noticed some huge changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to read pretty much identical to this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/moral-panic">
        https://www.britannica.com/topic/moral-panic
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it reads like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic?wprov=sfti1">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic?wprov=sfti1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Salem witch trials as an example of Moral Panic has been completely removed from Wikipedia and the amount of edits have really shot up, with many opinions on the changes made in the activity log on Wikipedia for the page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia looks like a war zone of information I’d not fully considered before.

       You can’t possibly be this dumb to understand what he/she means.

       You can’t understand how changing a Wikipedia page of information viewed by millions on the fly for work and references can be more effective than a book’s definition?

       Obnoxious comment section user probably: “Hmmm, yeah, ahhhh, inhales, but can you proooooove that millions view a wiki page”

       Well, I'm certainly willing to consider future threads by you to be weakly thought out and contain no proof. And such threads, when subjected to the barest whiff of intellectual rigor will get your pussy in a twist. Anyway, if you can't handle the questions maybe you should get out of the conspiracy kitchen (as you're not much of a chef).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no conspiracy. This is basically a manufactured moral panic over a page about moral panic.

       If all the comments and input were as bad as yours, I’d have lost hope. Luckily it’s spawned some great discussion.  Hopefully a few people have seen our interaction too and learned a thing or two about the people like you trying to derail convo.  You’re losing.

       Anyway, did you notice that you started your thread by mentioning that you've always been interested in moral panic and then manufactured a moral panic over the moral panic page? Was this done in a transparent attempt to buttress your first paragraph? Sort of a self-fulfilling paragraphecy?

       It does however amaze me when morons like you pop up and pretend to be so naive in not understanding the content posted in an attempt to derail.

       From reading the new description, I'd say the "bad guys." The segment on human trafficking is the giveaway.

       To my eyes, it's where the far right and far left converge. They don't wan't the Salem Witch Trials on that page because it suggests a "witch hunt" of men.

       And in the opening paragraph Salem witch trials have been replaced with things suggesting p’gate and possible Clinton ties to satanic rituals.

       The purity movement was also edited. When I first researched it named families such as the rockerfellers as making their wealth off of cheap child slave labor. A few years later I went back and that was gone and I could no longer the name of the families that were enriching themselves off of child labor. Another one was researching Caligula and Nero, apparently neither were lunatics and actually effective leaders all of a sudden.

       It’s not great to see.  It’s only by chance that I’m familiar with the Wikipedia for this so much to notice the change and then manage to find another credible source with the same wording i (as unfortunately the only source) can remember the wiki page having.

       It does raise the question of how much is changed and you can see in the edits for each page it really is a war zone of edits.

       I think you hit on something really good there, regarding the definition shift, itself. Thank you.

       It is, to me, a wonderful example of how terms have been coopted to flip the script on who is victim and who is villain.
      </p>
      <p>
       As most social scripts go, the villain is (as it turns out) the public, you and I. Believers of this script are made by sharing with them that it isn't the system's fault that it is destroying the world through industrious actions that serve multiple unpublished agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, according to the script, it is the people's faults for not recycling, or not caring, or for consuming irresponsibly. Says the pusher, to the addict.

       I’ll most certainly hold off until it releases and had an update after the inevitable issues on the pc version like with Mose multi platform releases these days.

       By the looks of things, it was supposed to be released June 16, so the fact it’s 2 years behind sounds like there has been some problems.

       From what I can see it shows clear edits changing things like references to the Salem witch trials in the opening part of the page.

      <p>
       Also shows edits adding pedo rings and satanic rituals to replace it.

       I'm looking through revisions and I don't even see the Salem Witch Trials, I'm hitting 2004 and 2008 to see if it was there in July of those years. When was the last time you saw it?
      </p>

       But the talk page doesn't say anything of revisions about the With Trials either. I'm not really seeing an flamewar in the talk page either, it's kinda bland, no insults or any real drama.

       The mention of witches under that first picture has thrown me off a little too.

       Regardless, it’s opened the door to what appears to be a lot of changes to the page and across Wikipedia in general, so I’m still interested where this goes and think it’s netted some interesting discussion.

       When any source of information is wide-open to revision or the information it provides can be altered or deleted due to legal threats or bullying without bothering to differentiate whether those complaints would actually stand up in court before deciding to edit or delete it or not, you're not going to have a very reliable or particularly accurate source of information, especially on any important and highly charged or contentious issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       What, pray tell, is the difference between "moral panic" and "moral outrage' or "moral indignation"?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this it seems that "moral panic" is something that has been deliberately cultivated by false, exaggerated, sensationalized, or misleading information to promote someone else's particular political or social agenda and goad the public into accepting or even insisting on it, when they otherwise wouldn't have. An agenda that actually isn't in their best interests, but rather based on exploiting them, instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       "moral indignation" or any public outrage that is based on and driven by very real, confirmed, and completely accurate and unvarnished facts that are absolutely true and genuinely horrific, deeply disturbing, and bound to outrage the sensibilities of any normal and well adjusted person that's informed about them?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the belief that there is a widespread abduction of children by predatory paedophiles, or that the ritual abuse of women and children by satanic cults actually exists and goes on, or that the War on Drugs and other public health issues don't actually serve the public's best interests but other and very different ones at their expense... who's agenda could sensationalizing or exaggerating any of the information related to those any more than it already and quite naturally possibly serve?
      </p>
      <p>
       And who would even make such a claim if it wasn't to actually shield pedophile rings and satanic cults from the public being more aware of the fact that they do exist and people have to be vigilant and remain conscious of conscious of that especially in regards to the safety of children and young adolescents.

       I have observed various edits on wiki myself..... either to romanticize certain stories, or more usually offering multiple versions or interpretations of something to blur the meaning. Lots of suggestive links to lead people on a narrative or "wikihole" intentionally... tho its usually fun and informative for me so I can't really say its a bad thing.

       I've seen stuff like this before and not just with Wikipedia.  Once a few years ago I was having an online debate about the history of midwifery.  I used wikipedia citations to make a lot of my side of the argument.  Within 2 days every reference I used was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another time I was having a debate about these girls only charities for African countries because they're supposedly left out of education.  I cited statistics from all the countries involved that showed that most African countries have better gender parity in their education systems than the US does (they're all roughly 50/50 with females actually getting more advanced degrees).  That info is now very difficult to find on the internet.
