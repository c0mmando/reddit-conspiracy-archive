<p>And that is just the start. I went through more than a few threads about Obama during his time as president here and people had no problem being critical of the president then.</p>

<p>Another one:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1svj66/there_are_too_many_leaders_who_claim_barack_obama/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1svj66/there_are_too_many_leaders_who_claim_barack_obama/</a></p>

<p>and so many more. </p>

<p>So when people tell you that attacking trump makes you a shill, or say you are from /politics, ask them what has changed in their life that make them suddenly support a president without question.</p>

<p>People complain about those in power, especially people with a conspiracy bent. The idea is to expose corruption and hypocrisy -at least it used to be. I complained about Obama, and Bush - now it seems we should promote our president and attack hillary (who never even made it to president).</p>

<p>Question authority in those in power.</p>

<p>It is what we (used to) do.</p>

<p>nevermind - if I don&#39;t answer it was because I was just banned.</p>

Anyways, if you go check r/politics from that time, they rarely criticized Obama, just like Trump supporters do now.  I personally think if you voted for someone and are a supporter, you probably should hold their feet to the fire closer than everyone else. </p>

<p>I consider it pragmatic and while distasteful not unwarranted. The families of terrorists aided terrorism; at best they&#39;re complicit. </p>

<p>Back in the 80&#39;s some Russian diplomats were kidnapped in Lebanon; it had been happening to other countries diplomats too, normally they&#39;d pay a ransom and get them back, Americans were killed because we don&#39;t pay ransoms. When it happened to Russia they went and grabbed the terrorist&#39;s families and started killing them one by one, leaving the corpse on the street to be found. They got their diplomats returned safely and weren&#39;t fucked with again. Terrorists might be willing to sacrifice themselves but are they willing to sacrifice their families? Are their families willing to be sacrificed? Seems to me if we had that policy less people would become terrorists and more people would turn their family in for terrorist activities.</p>

<p>No, if they started executing families of people involved with terrorism, I&#39;d steer clear of terrorists; more importantly, if I had a brother that was going to be a terrorist, knowing the risks he&#39;s putting everyone else in, I&#39;d rat him out and not even feel bad, he was about to volunteer me for the firing squad. As families turn against each other and the family unit breaks down, they&#39;d lose a huge advantage they currently have on their home soil. It&#39;s basically a more agressive sped up version of what the US government is doing to us, they started with black families and figured out what worked, now their turning to middle class whites, and it&#39;s working; birthrate is down, marriage is down, single people are less able to be successful so they&#39;re more stressed about money, living poorly, not eating well, stressed out. Another couple generations and they&#39;ll be able to revoke the 2nd Amendment without barely an outcry, with less people (automation will reduce the need for a large population), with more problems, the government will become a true ruling class sort of like how feudalism was.</p>

<p>Because thats what the public literally thinks by polling (from the bias of left doing the polling), its hysteria unhinged</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that and you&#39;re trying to move the goalposts. </p>

<p>Russia didn&#39;t fucking change the vote tallies, literally nobody with half a brain is claiming that. Russia did put a swarm of state funded bots online to make Trump look positive and divide our country even further, they also hacked Hilary&#39;s emails and leaked them to Wikileaks. </p>

<p>Now the question is did Trump&#39;s campaign know about this and did they actively cooperate with Russia to influence the election in a particular direction? Well that&#39;s what Mueller&#39;s investigation would probably tell us so we just have to wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I am pointing out the hysteria and one of the literal causes its having</p>

<p>and do you know whats worse, there is literally no evidence for the claim that Russia tried to influence the election. There is a lot of people in power saying it, but not a shred of evidence</p>

<p>What stopped WWI, women and children dying of starvation. What stoped WWII, women and Children dying of Firebombing and Nukes.</p>

<p>War requires complete societal demoralisation... If you dont have the appetite for that your not going to win. Full Stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever is necessary to stop the war with minimal resources and lifes lost.</p>

<p>I simply think your idea of what actually stops a war, will actually start it up rather than slow it down.</p>

<p>For instance, WWII stopped for Japan stopped due to the nukes. But in reality by the pentagons own calculations, the nukes werent necessary and they just wanted to test them. Which fine</p>

<p>WWII europe was stopped due to the Axis being destroyed and US troops placed on Hitlers literal doorstep. The social fabric of everyone in the region except germans was in tact but the world war! on both sides was stopped.</p>

<p>Ottoman WWII stopped when the region infrastructure was crushed and the monolith of the Ottomans was no more leaving a schism of power. So it only stopped due to infighting over resources. But if you would know thats exactly the plan all along</p>

<p>But it doesnt require it.</p>

<p>None of these required the complete decimiation of foreign countries. For instance US civil war</p>

<p>It didnt stop because the south was destroyed, the south was already destroyed economically by the north having industrialized and south&#39;s entire economy was based upon unreliable slow human slaves doing the work.</p>

<p>It stops because you transform the military into another form of political relationship. Whether this is installing a vassal state, splitting resources with the government etc...</p>

<p>Take the syrian conflict, its extremely likely it will end with unconditional surrender or a destroyed social fabric. Its actually happened due to the political and social collapse. So now that Syria is in the exact situation you observe, what do you expect? that it will be perfectly fine. </p>

<p>No, you have to both figure out the trends military is brining, and both work on a way to stop such consequences for other political constellations. The vast majority of the time, everyone loses in a war. EVERYONE</p>

<p>But do you know what would be the worst way to try and stop a war. By literally targetting your family, answer me this. When 911 happened were you calling for war, when random suicide bombings were happening were you calling for war. If so, which is extremely likely, imagine what you would say if your literal family was targetted and killed by the enemy and you have nothing left in this world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;re lying with the collusion story.  Clearly, people working with Trump wanted to collude with Russia, tried to collude with Russia.  The only defense is that they just failed to do so because they&#39;re too incompetent to cheat.  But I agree that the Russia shit is getting pushed way too hard by the left.  The fact is that Donald Trump won the election, regardless if he got a bump from facebook fake news bullshit, Americans decided that they wanted an orange narcissistic idiot as president.  If Democrats want to take back the government they have to do it by voting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wanted to pick up opposition research thus colluding, yes that seems likely/possible. Tried, sure.</p>

<p>Not at all, they simply didnt collude or go any further than collude</p>

<p>The best evidence we have is D jr going to the Russian lawyer. But if you were up to date with that, you would know that she literally went in before and after that meeting to FusionGPS. The same company which created the dossier funded by Hillary.</p>

<p>So it looks like Hillary was creating a sting operation while funding a Russian narrative hit piece. Trump JR wanting opposition research agreed to meet, when nothing was given or asked for, whatever reason. He left and nothing was exchanged or any evidence given to say he wanted to collude. As such whatever the lawyer witness cant be used against him otherwise we would of seen it in the Russian dossier she was directly working with</p>

I think a few other subs will do it too, I&#39;ve heard creepypms does, but I don&#39;t think they run a script. I think the mods occasionally peruse through a post and ban users.

    <div class="md"><p>I was skeptical because I have called out loads of people on this sub to provide proof who cry victim about being banned because they get banned on other subs because they post on the Donald and you&#39;re the first one to actually provide proof.</p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s a ridiculous practice and should not be practised, the mods should do what they volunteered to do instead of blindly banning people who may or may not cause trouble so they don&#39;t have to moderate individually.</p>

<p>Interesting story: I was actually a lurker on r/Republican and I posted there a bunch of times too but I got banned for not being you know a Republican and when I appealed the ban the mod actually went through my comments and linked a bunch of Anti-Trump posts I made on this subreddit as an excuse of why they&#39;re not going to repeal my ban so I can sorta relate to you? Not really but yeah I agree it&#39;s ridiculous that you got banned for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will let you in on the reason.</p>

<p>Anyone that remembers the past elections f.e. from Ron Paul also remembers how he was silenced ridiculed and cheated on, because the ruling class didn&#39;t want any change, comrade.</p>

<p>They tried everything until finally they just cheated him out of the primary. They did the same to the spineless unemployed Bernie Sanders. And they tried the same on Donald Motherfucking Trump. But to him unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life we had a candidate, that the establishment hated. The MSM attacked him 24/7 and the Deep State wiretapped him and leaked everything to the Biased Press.</p>

<p>So you understand that Trump is the ultimate man to bring some real change. And of course his enemies are plenty, they are well funded, and they are ready to lie, shill and cheat to deligitimize him.</p>

<p>Thus he is a real anti establishment candidate and this sub has always been anti establishment. He isn&#39;t just a random president. And the sub didn&#39;t change. Just the funding for shills trying to control the narrative.</p>

<p>You can clearly see the same ole right wing talking points mixed with some people who USED TO criticize the president. There are almost no people defending Obama in there. Now I can see why people are so angry making concern trolling posts about this sub is &quot;r/politics&quot; now.</p>

<p>In fact, I think maybe a large portion of the bad reactions towards Trump are because of the talking points in those threads. Which some still continue to this day going as far as wanting to get rid of NN after he finally got it.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t put much stock in it at the time, and I voted for him twice; now I&#39;m not so sure, the birth certificate was proved to be a forgery, he was absolutely unqualified based on the results of his presidency, and Michelle looks like a man... did I randomly turn into an anti-American racist?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It was Obama&#39;s economy in Trump&#39;s first quarter as president we had 1.4% growth. Then Trump&#39;s budget passed and in the following 3 quarters we grew 3.1%, 3.3%, and 3.9%, and we&#39;re currently projected for 4%. Obama never hit 3%. If you remember, Obama said Trump would need a &quot;magic wand&quot; to do what he was promising, Obama predicted a financial collapse in the event of a Trump presidency. So no, this isn&#39;t Obama&#39;s economy, the other day the market dropped 300 points when it appeared the news had evidence of &quot;Russian Collusion&quot;, which of course was fake. Again. To give Obama credit a year, 2,000,000 new jobs, and a market grown by 30% later is laughable, just like leftists.</p>

<p>Yes she does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... let&#39;s go over your logic here; Obama presides over the slowest economic recovery in US history, first president to never break 3% growth, the longest stretch since the Great Depression. <strong>Obama&#39;s &quot;booming economy&quot; is comparable to the Great Depression</strong>. Lol. The <a href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2016/02/01/barack_obamas_sad_record_on_economic_growth_101987.html#!">CBO</a> said in 2015 that the US WOULD NEVER SEE 3% GROWTH AGAIN, he doubled the national debt, had unprecedented interest rates for his entire presidency, set thousands of unnecessary new regulations (which act as an unofficial tax on businesses a lot of times), purposely killed the coal industry with those regulations, said this is the new normal and manufacturing jobs aren&#39;t coming back, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;amp;step=2#reqid=19&amp;amp;step=3&amp;amp;isuri=1&amp;amp;1910=x&amp;amp;0=-99&amp;amp;1921=survey&amp;amp;1903=1&amp;amp;1904=2008&amp;amp;1905=2016&amp;amp;1906=a&amp;amp;1911=0">averaged</a> 1.45% growth over his 8 year presidency, I could go on and on, Obama was a fucking disaster for us economically.</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile promised to cut those regulations, he signed an executive order shortly after taking office saying for every new regulation made, 2 have to be removed. As of yesterday he has removed over 800 regulations for a 21-1 regulations gone to regulations made. That undoubtedly did a ton to help but that&#39;s not all, Obama created ~11,500 jobs over 8 years (we lost a lot of jobs in the recession so that boosts his numbers a bit), the problem with his jobs is he was replacing full time jobs for the middle class with part time entry level jobs, this happened for a number of reasons such as taxes, Obamacare, regulations, low confidence in Obama and future policies he might make; so far Trump has created over 2 million jobs, extrapolated forward 8 years it beats Obama.</p>

<p>Anyways I&#39;m tired of typing so to recap: Obama was terrible economically, it&#39;s ridiculous to give him credit for this economy when it&#39;s so completely different than his entire presidency; also, the stock market took a dip election night, then the next day it started the surge it&#39;s on. That was a coincidence? Yeah right, it was industry showing it&#39;s confidence in President Trump and his policies; well placed confidence as it turns out, over 800 regulations cut, 2 million jobs added, market increased by 30%, and imminent tax cuts later, sitting pretty at 4% growth, over twice Obama&#39;s best year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I, knowing nothing about astronomy, hired Stephen Hawking to... do space stuff, would you say &quot;oh, that guy knows nothing about astronomy, that is not a credible source&quot;. No, you wouldn&#39;t, because I wouldn&#39;t be the one doing the work.</p>

<p>Likewise, Arpaio hired 2 different forgery experts from 2 seperate continents, who worked independently and found the same stuff. Do you have some information that they&#39;re not credible?</p>

<p>I was a democrat back when Arpaio got arrested so I didn&#39;t pay much attention, or care about the details of his case, I just assumed he deserved it. So it was for using racial profiling to catch illegal Mexican aliens... what the fuck else are you supposed to do?!? Say &quot;Oh, that guy&#39;s probably illegal but I can&#39;t stop him or then I&#39;d be profiling, I have to wait and see if he breaks a law&quot;. No, illegal aliens are breaking the law just by being here, that&#39;s the reason to stop them. I&#39;m sure legal immigrants don&#39;t mind that much, they don&#39;t like illegals either.</p>

<p>I think racial profiling is an issue if you&#39;re doing it because you&#39;re racist; one clear sign that that&#39;s the case is you don&#39;t make many arrests because you&#39;re just fishing. Arpaio was a sheriff in Arizona, he caught a <em>ton</em> of illegals this way. Reviewing the case now, I think that while he did violate some people&#39;s rights, his methods were effective and at most he should have been removed from office. I believe this is another instance of Obama politicizing federal law enforcement and Trump did the right thing in pardoning him.</p>

<p>id imagine you would have to go pretty far to find 2 different experts who would give you the result you wanted. for example, you couldnt go to any forensic expert in any major city (which of course there are), because they wouldnt support your preconceived conclusion</p>

<p>The most curious thing about it to me:</p>

<p>The health director who okayed Obama&#39;s birth records died in a plane crash where everyone else but her survived. </p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s not evidence but that, coupled with other various curious facts as least throws some kind of questioning on the whole situation. Maybe it&#39;s just all a set of coincidences, or maybe it&#39;s not. That&#39;s not for me to fight for right now, only consider the options. </p>

<p>Trump owes a lot to the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on now...</p>

<p>I keep hearing how trump is the worst president in history.</p>

<p>It&#39;s on the FP all day, every day. It is fact. We know it is fact, because it is repeated at us every day of the week. That&#39;s how we know it&#39;s fact. Because it is always repeated and smashed in our faces daily, because it is a fact. Otherwise why would they repeat it all day every day.</p>

<p>SO, if he&#39;s the worst president in history, one can argue he&#39;s  the worst candidate in history (stands to reason, ya?). Yet he beat out Hillary, so he&#39;s gotta be better than her, technically bumping DJT from the Worst Candidate spot all the way up to Second Worst Candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read the actual thread? People in this sub were pissed at Obama because in April 2014 (the date the thread was created) Obama had NOT kept his promise of enforcing net neutrality. That&#39;s right, EVERYONE IN THAT THREAD WAS PRO NET-NEUTRALITY. They were showing Obama was a hypocrite because in 2007 he campaigned in favor of net neutrality but in 2014 Comcast was throttling Netflix which showed everyone the problem of not having net neutrality.</p>

<p>In the end Obama and the FCC did push forward pro-NN legislation (largely thanks to the public backlash to what Comcast was doing)</p>

<p>But you didn&#39;t read that and assumed people were anti-NN because you&#39;re a really really stupid person. You don&#39;t know how to read, you have no idea what the issues are and only look at things through partisan lense. You&#39;re the very definition of a fucking braindead brainwashed moron.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that anyone ever dared to question or challenge the fact that Obama was the duly elected President <em>after he was elected</em>, like it or not, or was incessantly advocating his impeachment or pushing for a coup or a violent overthrow of him and his administration simply because they happened to disagree with or be critical of any of his decisions. </p>

<p>Nor did we see any signs of paid and organised groups actually taking to the streets and trying to stir up a frenzy directed towards that very end or any half-baked plots and schemes being hatched against him within government agencies still staffed by appointees and hirelings from the previous administration trying to accomplish it that way, or seeing those spurious claims actually being taken seriously and actively promoted and formally investigated by his most obvious political enemies in both the Senate and the Congress, as well as being endorsed by all of the MSM as if they actually had any real merit.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see the huge difference and immense danger in that, or why the general reaction is very different and tempered by comparison, you&#39;re clearly not paying attention to what else is going on and that has been directed at deliberately undermining and trying to de-legitimise and oust Trump from the very day he was elected.</p>

<p>Now everything that could be done to underhandedly fix and rig the election so he couldn&#39;t possibly be taken as a serious candidate with any hope of winning let alone win it was undertaken with the full complicity and co-operation of all of the same MSM that still hasn&#39;t given up trying to change the outcome that eluded all of their efforts to dictate an outcome they wanted and were sure was in the bag. We know that for a certainty. </p>

<p>We also know that HRC wasn&#39;t a fit or deserving candidate that was honestly and fairly chosen by the Democratic Party to run against him and that that too had all been underhandedly arranged by HRC herself and a few key insiders who put the fix in for her that media did it&#39;s fair share to present as being legitimate in the face of any number of irregularities that cast it in doubt.</p>

<p>The staggering degree of all that dishonesty and criminality coming to light before the election was quite simply more than any average person could take sitting down. </p>

<p>Now Trump may be something of a buffoon and a carnival barker prone to bending the facts to warm up the audience for the show but no one was ever at any time unaware of that, or that he didn&#39;t exactly have the most sterling and laudable reputation as a private businessman or citizen which is not to say that he hasn&#39;t also done some good and generous things of his own free will along the way that demonstrate that there is that lesser known and better side of him. Some small redeeming qualities compared to an avalanche of utterly reprehensible and unforgivable ones on the other side.  </p>

<p>He is simultaneously supported and under fire precisely because he isn&#39;t and never has been &quot;a politician&quot; and the support he got from that fact alone was enough to shoe-horn him into the Oval Office against any and all odds and no one was more surprised by that than those who angrily went out en-masse and voted for him to show just how fed-up they really were with the political status-quo that presently exists in the US.</p>

<p>Moreover, by simply getting elected, he&#39;s inadvertently exposed a degree and extent of political corruption and outright criminality that&#39;s even worse than all those who held their noses and voted for him already thought there was when they did, and which was why they did. So they were not only right about that but more right than knew they were.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no telling how any of this will ultimately play-out or ever be resolved or what the real consequences will be but it won&#39;t be business as usual nor will either of the major parties be able to count on the kind of blind and complacent public support they&#39;ve enjoyed up until now. </p>

<p>As for this forum there&#39;s been a veritable cornucopia of scandals i.e. criminal and deceitful things done that the perpetrators indeed &quot;conspired&quot; to keep hidden from the public that have all come to light for no other reason than that Trump&#39;s unplanned and completely unexpected election has seriously interfered with their ability to keep right on doing them.  </p>

<p>Trump hasn&#39;t exposed them, they&#39;ve exposed themselves in their eagerness and desperation to try and get rid of him. Things have unravelled and spun out of their control with only more and worse to come due to that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a pleasant spectacle from any perspective but it&#39;s a long overdue and vitally necessary one. </p>

<p>As critical as anyone might be of Trump himself there&#39;s a desire to not play into the hands of those trying to take him down before they go down themselves or give them any help to save themselves from a fate that&#39;s no more than any of them deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tea party was not cracking people over the heads with bike locks like Antifa and was not being infused with millions of dollars from McCain SuperPACs to see the duly elected president ousted. No one funded to the tune of 12 million dollars a dossier about Obamas Kenyan connections. No one decried him flip flopping on topics and issues like gay marriage. It wasn&#39;t a &#39;constitutional crisis&#39; when Obama went after whistle blowers or jailed members of the media. When over the Christmas holiday Obama signed the NDAA which effectively legalized government propaganda against American citizens the outrage was impotent. There is no comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the birther movement never got any traction, or was ever the subject of a full scale Congressional investigation cum witch-hunt seriously out for Obama&#39;s scalp or ever saw that claim taken seriously and milked for all it was worth by the MSM, now was it?</p>

<p>And the Tea Party wasn&#39;t treated any differently and was continually slagged and subjected to public ridicule at every opportunity. A small far right minority and a mixed bag of malcontents with wannabe&#39;s like Sara Palin speaking-out on behalf of them to pretty much ensure that no one would pay any real attention or give them the slightest bit of credibility.</p>

<p>And you call me a revisionist? Get real. There&#39;s never been a situation like this since Nixon&#39;s plumbers and key insiders that he knew and gave directions to undermine and spy on the Dems were arrested for it and he was subsequently forced to resign. Could have been criminally prosecuted for what was publicly known about his role in it too, if Ford hadn&#39;t made pardoning him of any wrongdoing while he was in office his first order of business when he replaced him.</p>

<p>The only one that resembles having done anything similar to what Nixon &amp; Co. did to try and ensure his second term is what Obama and HRC did trying to ensure her win, not anything Trump&#39;s did in the process.</p>

<p>Yes, I have my reservations about Trump, but if the balance is out of whack, and you must admit it is since 1913, they can and are doing the following:</p>

<p>Steal 21 trillion from us, probably using that money to create massive psyops and false flags on innocents, want to put hairy man beast trannies in our kid&#39;s reading time, and use Project Mockingbird to damage generations of X, Y and Z for decades. Oh yeah, pedogate and pizzagate, etc ....</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all you fence sitters like OP are just as guilty of staying on the sideline and watching kids getting their asses raped, then having their throats cut, from inaction. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the tribalism, but support Trump, let him kill the left sick agenda then call him out when he get&#39;s out of hand. What is the alternative, keep having kids getting sacrificed? </p>
