       It's ever apparent to anyone who hasn't chosen the blissful path of ignorance that trying to change the systems in place within the framework of those very systems isn't very efficient. Whatever progress that has been made seems to have been done under tedious, slow circumstances. The abuse of money, government, and corporate power are hindering public interest and progress. Thus the title. Will the millennial generation 'wake up' and realize we do not
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       have to settle for what's in place in order to reform? In your opinion, what's stopping a transition of power from lobbyists to the people?

       I agree, I'd like to know more about your views on how you see this happening. Do you think our generation will impose change so aggressively that we end up just perpetuating violence as opposed to setting an example of 'mature' change and transition?

       Let's do some simplified math. According to a quick bing search, approx. 1.7 billion people make up the millennial generation. Let's just say half of that is male. 850 Million millennial males.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say amongst the masses today. Let's say you were around 1 million millennial males. That equates to ~0.001% of Generation Y males.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't presume to know the range of humanity, it's capabilities, and especially a young, fired up generation- and I'll do the same. This argument, in a sense, could be a reason why

       Hm I see.. I wanna keep this conversation going though. I'd like to understand your view more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's odd isn't it? It indeed
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       to me that American millennials are more hopeless, or perhaps just simply more ignorant and distracted. In turn, I imagine this sense of powerlessness can equate to some males turning to an unmanly composure as opposed to it's traditional sense of what it means to be a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you say that perhaps men taking a less 'manly', 'in charge' role and instead exercising more empathy could actually be a positive thing? In a similar sense, how if women, who are more naturally empathetic, take on 'leader' roles can possibly equate to a more caring leader.

       I'm in favor of empathy. But I see a lot of self-hatred, doubt, effeminate movement, voice tonality, narcissism, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sexes have their positive and negative capacities. I've known deeply empathetic, sensual, intuitive, maternal women. I've also known psycho, sex-obsessed, vain, gold digger women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every woman I've known or see in culture who has ascended to leadership roles takes on the worst masculine tenets. I don't see a lot of nurturing female leaders.

       Very good points. Some [hopingly] constructive questions come to mind. Could the effeminate movement within the male populace possibly just be a result of an over-sexualized pornographic society? Regarding the science of how excessive porn use can result in the seeking of morphed sexual tastes, is it perhaps just an exploring of sexuality in a more open curiosity? Is this to say that traditionally unmanly men cannot be efficient or good leaders? Perhaps it's even just the old, general homophobic mindset of society that has us questioning if we can even take an unusual sexually oriented human professionally or seriously enough to make executive decisions.
       <strong>
        At this point, I feel like what I'm saying is just kind of going on a curious tangent. I digress back to your point on women leaders
       </strong>
       lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree that both sexes have their positives and negatives. I suppose it falls down to what we're defining leaders as- whether it be executive suite titles, management, political, or even just a leader to better oneself can shift the context greatly. Perhaps it's even a matter of questioning, are enough women leaders even being covered in the media? Perhaps the social stigma on women even affects word of mouth to the point that it's simply the reason why we can say
       <em>
        I don't see a lot of nurturing female leaders.
       </em>

       , unorthodox. Instead of looking at shifting this world from a gender specific approach, perhaps what's needed is for all humans to pay heed to their masculine

       feminine traits, and then to

       Finding a good, healthy church--I know it ain't easy. Better education and resources. Better diet. Men need to call out other men who are predatory, while not rejecting the masculine impulses from a gentleman's viewpoint. Women need to embrace the optimal feminine tendencies without becoming submissive abuse victims.

       It's a hard haul, because culturally all efforts seem to be honed towards combat between the sexes. When's the last time anybody made a good romance or romantic comedy out of Hollywood? The last healthy married couple on TV? Something that made sex feel exciting and fun and sensual, instead of dirty, nasty and animalistic?

       The entire human paradigm, at least as it is being shepherded along in the USA, needs to change. I can't speak for the world.

       While I agree that resistance to oppression is nothing new, what makes this generation special, in my opinion, falls down to two main factors:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Generation Y, or perhaps more effectively, Generation iY (which is classified as the latter half of millennials) have grown up with an increased massive awareness of local and global issues due to the TV and internet. Regardless of the bias of reporting, we all figured one thing: the world is not a peaceful place.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The internet. The internet (let's leave Net Neutrality out of this for the moment,
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       ) has given us the ability to build a more global sense of community
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       break down language barriers (to whatever extent we've 'perfected' that).
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, these factors add up to the single most important factor in changing at all. Whether it be personal, local, or global, it's of no doubt that
       <strong>
        awareness
       </strong>
       has to be the first step into intentionally changing or improving upon something. So it
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       that millennials have been born into a time ripe for innovation. However, I would also argue that whatever innovation that does happen would be in vain if it is not approached with a profound understanding of coexistence,
       <em>
        whether we like one another or not is irrelevant, millennials have grown up with an awareness of death at an early age. Subconsciously, you could argue that (assuming we don't continue to brainwash ourselves to resist our mortality) we understand death in a more profound sense, which in turn would result in an understanding that this is beyond us. So if to honor and 'love' our grandchildren as old humans always say they do, why wouldn't we unite as young adults?
       </em>
       <strong>
        Why wouldn't we take it upon ourselves to utilize the technological tools given to us and say we are special?

      <p>
       "they" kill people.  so what's stopping it is that we collectively don't have systems to ensure data isn't destroyed, nor systems to accurately alert others when actors contributing to those systems are under threat - so no way to really help them.  essentially why shit doesn't change is because people - us - haven't built ways to defend the health of our systems.  here's the kicker - it ain't that hard to do, and any progress made in this direction is cumulative.

       Lol! Dam was not expecting an answer like that. If any case, if you're serious, I'm sorry if I had made you or anyone feel down on our efforts. Definitely not my intentions, rather more like, "Hey, come on, we've been dealt a shitty hand and we're just not playing it yet because most of us don't know what to do with it. Little do we know that, because we all share that hand, we'd be a lot more wise to strategize our gameplan together"
