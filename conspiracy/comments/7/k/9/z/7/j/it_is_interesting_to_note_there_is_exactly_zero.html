       This is not to say that the NSA and such DIDN'T engage in illegal spying on American citizens, they absolutely fucking did.  What I am simply saying is there is no proof that Snowden's efforts in calling attention to that fact were noble in nature.  At the time there was no reason to doubt anybodies intent really, but in light of recent confirmed Russian cyberattacks designed to also destabilize the US and damage our reputation and Glenn Greenwald's active participation in that effort plus Snowden's choice of countries to run too definitely provides some compelling reasons to see his actions in a different light.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no proof either way, but that in and of itself is what troubles me. It should not be so difficult to determine that Snowden's intentions were pure, especially considering how damning the centerpiece of his leaks were.  Yet every single strange event required to question those motives has happened.  Snowden ran to Russia, Greenwald became a parrot for the Trump administration's efforts to discredit those investigating them and the Russians have stuck to a strategy of attempting to undercut our moral authority on the world stage in order to justify their own ambitions of empire.

       Actually... if Snowden was a Russian plant, he would not have gone public at all, so that the NSA did not know what had been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       By making his information public he not only told
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       what he knows, he told the NSA what he knows, which allows them to make changes to prevent further damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going public is very strong circumstantial evidence that Snowden had the best of intentions and was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a Russian plant.

       They are not.  We have stagnant wages since the 1970's.  Certain demographic sectors are experiencing a decline in life expectancy. There are academic papers coming out showing how the political system is only responsive to the concerns of the wealthy.  The political system is deeply broken.  We have an imperial foreign policy which justifies wars on lies. We are pursing oil extraction that is compromising our water tables. Our infrastructure is in shambles.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all real problems that the Russians have nothing to do with.  What is undermining 'our reputation', is that the reality is being shown behind the mask created through gatekeepers after WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       The move to blame this on a foreign power is  a way to justify cracking down on networks that share information that exposes this truth.

       This didn't happen.  There is no massive cyber-campaign.  That is a pretext that is politically useful for the factions that want to increase tensions with Russia,  and domestic political factions that can't deal with the fact that they lost and the reasons why they did so.

       It's even more ironic you are equally willing to declare me wrong, with zero evidence I might add, while screaming about my lack of evidence.

       Like I just finished explaining to skindoe in waaaaay too many comments.  The point here is the fact that this story fits the facts, better than Snowden's defense as it's the only theory that explains why he leaked info not related to the NSA's illegal actions.

       What was trying to point out is everybody assumes he is innocent, but his actions are actually rather damning when viewed in context with recent events by parties involved.  What looked innocent in 2013 looks a whole lot more suspect today.

       Confirmation bias says you demand proof of my theory, yet none to support the one you already believe.
