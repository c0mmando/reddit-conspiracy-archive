       Edit: My apologies, it's Michigan State University not University of Michigan. Also, here is a link to the documents the professor and his students archived and published. Look under "Key Documents/DoD &amp; HUD in navigation bar center of page.

       Now if you've watched the video -

        https://youtu.be/7CwpjIwwI9o
       </a>
       it is apparent that the DoD and the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs figure prominently in the trail of missing money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two important lists we should be aware of:
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Questions that need to be answered:
      </p>
      <p>
       When specifically, did the professor start making phone calls to the OIG?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - This may help in establishing a timeline at some point: On October 5, 2017 we discovered that the link to the report “Army General Fund Adjustments Not Adequately Documented or Supported” had been disabled. Within a several days, the links to other OIG documents we identified in our search were also disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Senator McCain made aware of his inquiries, and if so..when?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Senator Bob Corker made aware of the inquiries, and if so..when?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Another important question - Who directed who to disable the links to the information?
      </p>
      <p>
       Something for you Q enthusiasts to think about:
      </p>
      <p>
       Future proves the past...News is the map...Follow the money...What is the swamp? A place where things get "mired".

      </p>
      <p>
       And now...John McCain is back in the hospital and looking "very frail".
      </p>
      <p>
       Senator Corker announced in September (end of summer) that he would not seek reelection. He's on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's alot of work to be done as far as comparing the list of officials who have announced they won't be running again against the list of oversight committees involved in the majority of the "bookkeeping anomalies".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be working on it...and I'm sure others already are or will be soon enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the Federal Reserve finally be audited now? I'm thinking it will have to be, considering where the "incoming money" in these anomalies came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmmm...seems that some people at the Federal Reserve are retiring also.

       How would one go about this? Would the audits have to take place first? Or could a parallel investigation begin, in order to get key individuals testimonies "before" they have information that would aid them in avoiding prosecution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, will it be a significant factor if key officials "retire" before investigations begin?

       I was speaking of the clear spirit of the law, in that were there an active investigation by a sanctioned regulatory or judicial body, and an agency spoliated data, that would be criminal and actionable.

They've already addressed this on their website -

      <p>
       “Army General Fund Adjustments Not Adequately Documented or Supported” had been disabled. Within a several days, the links to other OIG documents we identified in our search were also disabled. The sequential non-random nature of this disabling process suggests a purposeful decision on the part of OIG to make key documents unavailable to the public via the website, as opposed to website reorganization, etc. We also revisited the website intermittently to see whether the documents had been reposted under different URLs—until very recently they had not been reposted.
      </p>
      <p>
       On December 11, 2017, we learned that key documents had been reposted on the OIG website, but with different URLs. Documents now appear to be reposted on new URLs. As we find the new URLs we are adding them in the footnotes entitled “new link” next to the original link.

       It happens all the time 
If I'm a brigade commander Ill request far more than needed for training purposes and next fiscal year big army assumes I need the same amount for training exercises or whatever, I would be a fool to turn funds away from my brigade because they will then allocate the funds to another brigade. So brigades and divisions sit on funds. Glad their is an audit going on its well needed.

TAB errors are abnormal conditions the ELECTRA application identifies using formulas 
that establish expected relationships between RDT records in the feeder files. For 
example, an abnormal condition exists when the RDT amount for the annual funding 
program is less than the RDT amount for funds received. The application generates a 
TAB error report that lists RDT records not matching these formulas. DFAS Indianapolis 
personnel were unable to provide us with a March 2010 ELECTRA TAB error report or 
any other documentation supporting the 256,359 ELECTRA adjustments. DFAS 
Indianapolis personnel explained that when they correct transactions, the application 
overlays the erroneous records with the corrected records; and, as a result, the 
March 2010 ELECTRA TAB error report has no data. The support for ELECTRA 
adjustments should be maintained to comply with DoD FMR, volume 6A, chapter 2, 
documentation requirements. 
ELECTRA error correction adjustments are included in ELECTRA output files loaded 
into DDRS-B. ELECTRA adjustments affect amounts reported on DDRS-B budget 
execution reports and in the export file. For example, the $3.7 billion reported on the 
March 2010 Army SF 133 for FY 2009 Operation and Maintenance, Obligations 
Incurred – Category A, included $66 billion (absolute value) or a net value of 
$125 million in ELECTRA adjustments. However, there was no audit trail because the 
ELECTRA TAB error report no longer contained data and DFAS Indianapolis personnel

       That's not what is happening. They are using baseline budgeting and spending every dime so they don't get cut next year.

      <p>
       If they were "sitting on funds" there would be an entry to reflect a positive balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is there yet another form of accounting wherein the bottom line is arbitrary?

       They sit on the funds, S-3 or whoever is in control of the books will make the money look like its spent. If you don't spend the money or "use it" more than likely won't get it back next fiscal year.

       Ive seen millions of dollars spent  on a "training" exercise that consisted of setting up tents so a General and the COL can fly over via chopper and give a thumbs up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to say the money was "spent" If the unit turned away the funds or didn't spend it on "training" next fiscal year they would be cut off from funds.

       Try looking at any set of accounts and pick 10% of the transactions. Add the amounts together. What does that number mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or look at your checking account statement. You have a deposit for $2,200, and you remember it's your paycheck plus some other check you had and deposited, but you can't remember what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there's check 389 for $150.57, but you didn't write down in the register what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's two "inadequately documented accounting entries". If you add them together, you get $2,350.57. What does that number mean? Or you could subtract them, and get $2,049.43. Does that number mean something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you decide to start a new checkbook register with the new year. You copy over your balance of $7,423.19. But you throw away the old register. So now the entry where you wrote the balance is an "inadequately documented accounting entry".
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you add that to the $2,049.43. You get $9,472.62. Does that number mean something? Clearly not, because the balance we copied forward already included those transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have N accounting entries (on many different accounts), there are 2
       <sup>
        N
       </sup>
       different ways of adding them together (not even counting the sign). Almost
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of those ways gives a meaningful number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I just being silly? No, that's how you get numbers like $2.3 trillion when the entire budget is only a fraction of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, in the $2.3 trillion that was being discussed in the year 2001, $1.4 trillion of that came from the Navy copying numbers from a Marine report onto their own report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each month they copied entries that included how much money the Marine Corps was appropriated by Congress for the whole year,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the total amount that the Marine Corps,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       how much the Marine Corps had already spent,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       how much the Marine Corps planned to spend for the rest of the year, etc. The total came to more than 4 times the Marine Corps budget. Then, each month, they reversed those entries. That's now 8 times the Marine Corps budget. Then they did that same thing for each of the 12 months. That's 12 × 8 = 96 times the annual budget. In fact, the total in "inadequately documented accounting entries" was, just for this alone, more than 100 times the Marines Corps' annual budget.

       I really do see your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I should have said was that
       <em>
        even if the methodology of deriving a sum was faulty
       </em>
       , the resultant number has meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means the books are wrong. That in itself is a meaningful conclusion supported by the sum X.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize I am no accountant, but I do not write checks and then in the interim between their generation and their posting, consider an ATM balance as an accurate accounting of my balance (which I have seen people do....)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are tax dollars being allocated to DOD accountants, if they cannot balance a ledger?

       I am under the impression that the "headline" is making the connection that there is direct correlation between discovery and obfuscation, not that the professor is a nitwit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is about the money. Not the investigation.

       It's
       <em>
