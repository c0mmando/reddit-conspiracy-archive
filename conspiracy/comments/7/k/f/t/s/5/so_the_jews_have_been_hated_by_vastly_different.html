       Maybe if there was some context i wouldnt have said that. However, if he werte to say this about blacks in the same context it would be racist. If he were to say this about women it would be sexist. Fuck zionism and fuck Israel. But theres a difference between "I dont trust jews" and "this specific jewish person did this specific crime"

       When they are discriminating simply based on semitism, yes, it does. So in some ways, yes, they are. The word has seperated in some ways from its original meaning, and antisemitism has been made to become more strictly about Jews than all semitic people, but thats just semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is, when you are distrusting of all black people because you heard a few black people have done some crimes, it's racist. When you are distrusting of all Jews because you heard some Jewish people have done some crimes, it's antisemitic.

       Pointing out that your thoughts are pre-programmed clichés is not "Ad hominen" [sic].  What I pointed out was for your own good so you can improve, because removing your lack of arguments and you've said nothing.

       I said, in short, that OP is an antisemite who's guilty of sloppy thinking. You may think I am as well, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he/she were to say "so the blacks have hated been by vast different groups (christians, muslims) but we are the weird ones for not trusting them? Makes you wonder who's ink charge" With absolutely no context or qualifying language it would be fucking racist.  Would it not be?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it would be a completely different thing if he were to point out specific crimes by specific Jewish people to show why we shouldnt trust those people.

       Well, one of the central tenets of Judaism is that the Jews are God's one and only chosen people, and that they are destined to rule over the lesser races.  This leads directly to Zionism, the proponents of which believe that the interests of Israel should take precedence over those of all other nations.

       Thing is though, I have a Jewish friend, and he's neither religious, nor is he pro Israel.

       Then isn't he really just a semite or an Arab and not a jew? From what I understand there's very little genetically different from Palestinians / Jewish people so wouldn't dropping the religion also drop the connection to Judaism?  For example I have Irish  catholic heritage, but I don't identify as a Catholic,  just Irish descent...

       When they are discriminating simply based on semitism, yes, it does. So in some ways, yes, they are. The word has seperated in some ways from its original meaning, and antisemitism has been made to become more strictly about Jews than all semitic people, but thats just semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is, when you are distrusting of all black people because you heard a few black people have done some crimes, it's racist. When you are distrusting of all Jews because you heard some Jewish people have done some crimes, it's antisemitic.
