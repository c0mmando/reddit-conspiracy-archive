    <div class="md"><p>I think there is definitely a true AI. If they are talking about it in the news it means the government is paving the way for people  to accept the techonolgy it already has. Just look at the history of the internet. In particular the creation of the internet or (ARPANET) . ARPANET was invented in 1969 the world wide wide was not invented till 1990. Military technology is at least 25 years ahead of commercial technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, you can&#39;t compare the 1969 &quot;internet&quot; to the 1990 Internet. The internet in 1969 consisted of two computers hooked together, with one transmitting the word &quot;login&quot;, which caused a crash halfway through.</p>

<p>By the 90s, millions were already connected and able to exchange messages, textual pages, and basic images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Most non-tech people don’t understand what’s needed to hook up millions of computers across the world in real-time. The late 69s, early 70s was when work on Unix was being done. This OS is still the backbone of the internet today, but in those days there was no TCP/IP (network protocol behind the internet services) and connections were done in batch via periodic point to point connections (UUCP, Unix to Unix connection protocol). Also, even then, most of the work being done on infrastructure was well known in academic and research areas. There was nothing secret about it, except maybe the uses the acronym agencies were putting it to. </p>

<p>Also, I don’t think we’re anywhere near a true AI. What we’ve seen as cutting edge is not a true AI. What we’ve seen is nothing more than parameter based decision trees. We don’t yet have the storage and /or processing power needs for a true AI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The point I was trying to make earlier is that, even with increased advances, the military itself doesn’t really do any research/development. They use the private sector for that. Think about it. From drugs, surveillance programs, vehicles, weapons, none have been developed by the military. Even with the most incredible things that have been brought to light so far, we have seen the tech behind them being written about in trade journals scientific RFIs, books, etc. Applications may be something secret, militarily speaking. Secrecy is the defense industry’s most valuable assets, not products or innovations. </p>

<p>In my opinion, things like captured UFO tech are made up to muddy the waters behind the real secrets. Keep us all, distracted. A fully functioning AI falls into that category, and it’s not just the hardware. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but nuclear has also made some strides since the 60s ad 70s when a lot of these units were built. Things like maintaining safe shutdown cooling with natural circulation even when all external power is lost. </p>

<p>There was a different nuke plant that was close to the epicenter than fukushima was, but they were fine because they had built their tsunami wall slightly higher than required. I really believe a lot of the issues with nuclear can be engineered away. Probably the biggest outstanding issue is what to do with spent fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spent fuel is the used up fuel rods that are no longer fissile enough to sustain criticality. They come out of the reactor and are typically put into the spent fuel pool for around 10 years to decay further. After that they pretty much get boxed up in concrete and steel casks and are stored on site at the particular reactor. There were plans to make a common waste site at Yuka Mountain but those plans were scraped by the Obama administration. The spent fuel, while not useful in the reactor anymore, remains incredibly radioactive and deadly to humans. So much so that I remember hearing if you tried to sprint towards unshielded spent fuel you would drop dead 10 yards away. Not sure how true that is but I sure wouldn&#39;t want to be around it without shielding. It remains that way for some obscene amount of time, like millions of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solar can be better or worse depending on where you live. A big issue with solar is how poorly it scales up for bulk power applications. Maybe instead of having one massive solar and battery farm, if every building had its own solar panels, batteries and inverters that fed loads in that building I think it would be better. Still dependant on where you live. Places like the UK and Seattle aren&#39;t going to get as much benefit as Nevada.</p>

Colds are &quot;exercise&quot; for our immune system, and getting rid of them would likely cause us to be more susceptible to dangerous diseases, and potentially autoimmune issues, which are more common in more developed countries, possibly because of fewer instances of pathogenic illness. Crohns Disease is much more common in the developed world, for instance.</p>

One was some herbs that could increase the height of people after their growth plates had fused. Another two involved hair growth, one which you rubbed on your skin and wherever you rubbed it, hair would grow. A different set of herbs would permanently eliminate hair growth wherever it was applied. Obviously I tried to learn more and he was unwilling to share. Faggot.</p>

The other is on my dad’s side (out of 7 males) and he did nothing. Of their male offspring only me (in my 40s) and one cousin (still in his mid 20s) still have a full head of hair.

    <div class="md"><p>Free energy, cold fusion, etc.</p>

<p>Money is ultimately a unit of energy, hence its value. If the quantity of money is equivalent to the total amount of energy/value in the system, then no inflation. Otherwise, inflation. Hence money&#39;s value. Hence why free energy is suppressed above everything else imaginable. It would dramatically upset the balance of power and redistribute it towards average people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the Government/world leaders know thousands of technological advances but harbors them for timed public release increasing profit and growth of the public. I’ll make a small list of ideas/advances I believe are kept from Americans; more so the globe to control the rate we progress spiritually and through the universe. </p>

<p>I started off looking into 100mpg conspiracies. That turned into carburetor patents as far back as 1920’s IIRC. From then into fuel vapor devices getting cars insane gas mileage compared to today. Furthermore into fuel comes water fueled cars by burning the hydrogen. There are stories of people being paid by companies for their inventions for increased fuel efficiency, and there are plenty of workshops being raided by MIB. Open your eyes people. We are killing ourselves being so inefficient but that’s what they want.</p>

<p>Furthermore my nighttime tangents of browsing, looking into free energy and magnetism. Free energy would benefit or destroy life as we know it. There have been stories of people making devices; but they emit a frequency that satellites can pin point. Expect MIB within 15 minutes of using one for extended time. Magnets are used from anti-gravity with electricity, Spacecraft, and free energy. Not just your fridge. </p>

<p>I’m unsure if you could classify health personally and medically as technology but I will for sake of my open mind. Pineal gland, meditation, astral projection/remote viewing. As far as tech, look at reptilian Rockefeller living so long. Confidence? </p>

<p>Also Hollow Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simularly to how just 100 years ago some one would call you crazy for talking about some now commonly accepted concepts, such as radio waves and electricity, I think there is at least one other &quot;demention&quot;, &quot;frequency&quot; or &quot;aspect&quot; that influences\ makes up our reality that is kept suppressed. This other layer to our reality is always beside us and around us and when taught how, one can manipulate it. I believe this is what so many people have tried to express via a nunber of religous, spiritual, occult, and mystic traditions. Maybe the pineal gland was\ is our sensory organ that we use to interpret\ interact with this other layer.</p>

<p>In the illuminated&#39;s mind if you don&#39;t believe it because we all have brainwashed, genetically and chemically damaged, or are just too stupid, whatever the reason you do not deserve to play in this space. What this really translates into is less players in the real game, more power, more &quot;control&quot;.</p>
