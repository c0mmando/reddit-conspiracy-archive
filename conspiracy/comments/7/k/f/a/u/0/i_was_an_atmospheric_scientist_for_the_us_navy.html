        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I began my time working with the Navy as an atmospheric scientist in Jan 2001. I held interim Secret clearance from 2001 to 2003, then Secret from 2003 to 2005. Then interim TS from 2005-2006, TS from 2006 to 2010.</p>

<p>My first few years was working with NLMOC and JSOC out of Norfolk Virginia, Mostly onboard a certain CVN-65 providing Tactical summary and AREPS/TAWS packages as well as PCIMAT and a few others that are in conjunction with FalconView.</p>

<p>In 2005 i was moved to NAS Fallon Nevada, where I supported NSAWC and its various N Departments.</p>

<p>I am posting here because I found this subreddit and would like to talk about some of the things that I worked with and some of the Climate briefings that I attended during my time. Mostly because I have been seeing some things coming out of the climate sector that indicate a soon to come unveiling of an ongoing program that began shortly before I started working for the Navy.</p>

<p>It is called Atmospheric engineering. In 2002 I attended a classified climate summary in Norfolk where we discussed the impacts of a diminishing ice presence in the Arctic as well as potential coastal impacts due to global warming.</p>

<p>In the summary the concern was the impending situation of a open and navigable coastal waterway along the northern border of canada and the need to prepare for maintenance of Naval superiority in the area as well as the impacts of having a new shipping route that could potentially shorten many shipping routes that would otherwise have to utilize either the Suez or Panama canal.</p>

<p>The other portion of the briefing was in regards to the global warming phenomenon itself, the impacts and some potential means to mitigate the effects of a planetary change.</p>

<p>This is the part that is the most important...</p>

<p>There were two main propositions outlined by the NRL at this time. one of which was already being implemented in a testing phase and the other was a proposed long term solar maintenance platform.</p>

<p>First, climate engineering. There had already been some research done in the later part of the 20th century in testing different aerosols and their effects on manipulating weather features by seeding clouds. For instance, they had tested cloud seeding the eye of a Hurricane to try and diminish the exhaust mechanism and inhibit growth to reduce coastal impacts of large tropical systems. (it was not successful for more than a brief period). The idea was that by injecting nanoaerosols into the upper tropopause or lower stratosphere we could create a thin ice layer that would increase the albedo of the planet and slow global warming. (At that time the metals being used were not the same as what is currently being used. From what i understand they have began using aluminols instead of silver)</p>

<p>This is what is called &quot;ChemTrails&quot;. Boeing and Lockheed martin as well as Raytheon polar services began implementing these devices in commercial jets about 150-20 years ago.</p>

<p>The second and most &quot;eco friendly sustainable solution&quot; was something called &quot;sunbrella&quot;. It was a plan to place a solar disc apparatus at a point between earth and the sun that would create a &quot;shade&quot; for the earth, with fins that could be opened or closed to help regulate solar radiation.</p>

<p>As far as I know, this was still in planning phase as of Dec 2010...</p>

<p>Now, here is something that I feel NEEDS to be said...</p>

<p>Part of the briefing was a discussion on the changing magnetosphere. NRL at that time DID NOT attribute global warming to anthropogenic sources. NOT man made...</p>

<p>NRL discussed how the weakening magnetic field and the migrating magnetic north was the reason that we were warming. As the magnetic field decreases, more shortwave radiation is injected into earth, especially at the poles. As the earth tries to adjust, the oceans take most of the brunt of the effects and warm, increasing surface gasification and increasing the CO2 that is introduced into the atmosphere. Our oceans are responsible for more than 96% of the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.</p>

<p>As an atmospheric physicist I have to say, the climate engineering that is taking place is irresponsible. There are no studies on nanized aluminols and the health effects. Sure it can take decades or longer for suspended particles in the stratosphere to settle into the lower atmosphere and eventually the surface, but they WILL eventually settle! Lithometers will not remain up for ever... AND we have yet to address the real root of the problem... and we likely NEVER WILL...</p>

<p>here is why...</p>

<p>our magnetosphere is weakening in part or whole due to the increased amount of EMF that is being produced on our earth and sent out into space, or being refracted and reflected off of the sheet of injected particles for comms. EMFs cause cancer for the same reason that we are seeing these changes. Interfering phase lengths of man made EMF with naturally occurring EMFs. And they will not admit to it because it will hinder military and government comms as well as other programs that use satellite link or programs that radiate strong EM waves into space. (HAARP).</p>

<p>I hope this finds some folks that can at the least look into the claims I make and independently verify my claims. I am happy to provide some additional details, although there are some things that I simply will not go into so... please respect that I did sign a nondisclosure upon leaving and individual radar capabilities or some crap like that is off the discussion table.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>Yea we&#39;re done here right?  This whole thread should be deleted.  It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>The military is like college in many ways.</p>

<p>You drink and do the same bull shit online.  It&#39;s the same as a dorm.  How in the fuck do you not know how to upload a pic?  I know people like to think of the military people as idiots, but it is the same kids who go to college.  Some can&#39;t wash clothes, but we all learn and definitely torrented the fuck out of everything possible.</p>

<p>That excuse was time for them to google what that shit was and find a blank document.  Then try to figure out how to fill it in with believable shit.</p>

<p>Fucking hell.</p>

<p>Kill this thread mods, we done.  I like conspiracies not fake weird shit.  Can&#39;t figure out how to upload a pic, my fucking Albanian mother can.  Mirupafshim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont have solid answers here. only a few ideas based on some of what is proposed. we know that our sun has several cycles that it exhibits. some are local, some are due to influence of extrasolar cyclic events. there is theory that our sun has a sibling and that they orbit each other. we travel through space heliocentrically with our sun. if our sun is in orbit (and it likely is) then as it travels through the orbit, the speed and motion of our sun does change, just as you feel extra force when accelerating in a car or taking a corner, our solar system also would feel the effects of an acceleration in its long cycle. (remember acceleration can be positive or negative... turning a corner while maintaining speed is technically an acceleration as the length of the path is increased due to the curve)</p>

<p>No. The Equivalence Principle in relativity shows that free falling in a gravitational field is indistinguishable from being a long way from any gravitational fields or other forces. i.e. in free fall you do not feel the force of gravity. This is why weightlessness exists on parabolic flights and for astronauts. Orbiting bodies are also in free fall. We don&#39;t feel the orbit of the Earth around the Sun for the same reason. I&#39;m quite sure someone claiming to be a physicist should know that.</p>

<p>if you want to understand the principals of EM propogation in the atmosphere then just PM me... it isnt classified. however,  it does take some time to understand.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve made many dozens of comments here but you cannot be bothered explaining the one thing of substance. If you were really a scientist you would be aware that your word isn&#39;t good enough. You have laid down massive claims but haven&#39;t offered a physical explanation of how this is possible or anything that could be scientific considered evidence. You haven&#39;t even tried to answer how this conclusion came about. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t even tried to explain the process in a physically meaningful way so don&#39;t pretend it&#39;s just too complicated. I want you to answer that person&#39;s questions. But I don&#39;t think you will, because I&#39;m quite sure your claims are invented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>electromagnetism IS the magnetosphere. that is like trying to explain why magnets affect magnets...</p>

<p>magnetism is not fully understood even to this day. we can describe the magnetic process and we can measure the strength of magnetism but a the very heart of it we are not certain as to the exact process. </p>

<p>when energy from a radar source is injected into the atmosphere it doesnt travel in a straight line. it spreads out and attenuates, and the signal loses strength as it goes out. this is why radars have ranges. the range of a radar is based upon the strength of the signal, the density or reflectivity of the target, and the atmospheric conditions of the propagated wave. </p>

<p>what about the rest of the em that is being produced? it goes out forever until it is absorbed by the medium that it travels through. unless its in space where there is no medium (technically) and it can travel indefinitely.</p>

<p>electromagnetism is a wave. so when two fields are influencing each other there is interference. it can be constructive or destructive. constructive interference is when waves are parallel and in phase. this will strengthen the EMF.
deconstructive interference is when waves are crossing or out of phase. this will negate or degrade the EMF.</p>

<p>Which is a perfectly valid physics question. In fact explaining how electromagnetism works has been an entire field in physics since it began. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t answered any of the questions, or even tried. None of what you said attempts to explain how EM radiation is degrading the magnetosphere. Instead you offer high school physics as if that will impress people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>certainly. everything that uses electricity produces an EM field. in fact, technically, everything from infrared to microwave and beyond is a form of EM. EM propogates through the atmosphere much the same way that sound does. so imagine trying to listen to music while there is a static station on across the room blasting white noise. this is unpleasant to the ear because of destructive interference. </p>

<p>much the same as electronics, your body also produces an EM field. Im no doctor so i dont know the specifics of how biological EM is created but if you look at how things like high lines, radar guns, cell tower, and even your cell phone causes cancer you will see that these EMFs are penetrating the tissue and interferes with you body and causes things to go awry. Just like XRay exposure can kill, XRays are ultra high frequency EM. </p>

<p>Our earth works much the same way. Think of our magnetic field as &quot;the music&quot; and our comms as the white noise. the interference is destructive and it hinders the strength of our planets magnetic shield. as we increase the amount of signals and the power, this effect is also increased</p>

<p>I really hope you are who you say you are, and are able to prove it somehow. And I hope you&#39;re able to stick around despite the ongoing issues that we&#39;ve been having in this sub. Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s just a (really long) phase! ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JSOC is far larger than you&#39;d suggest, for instance JIATF-NCR is also a Navy run command and DEVGRU is far more than SEAL Team Six. As for elements and their locations, public records alone would indicate facilities manned and owned by over a half-dozen different JSOC agencies up and down the Eastern seaboard, Midwest, and West coast.</p>

<p>Simply put, I certainly wouldn&#39;t say that looked knowledge of JSOC in anyway process or disproves anything said by OP.</p>

<p>I can say that I entered into service Jan 2001 and ended my employment Dec 2010. I received my first certification in NTTU Keesler AFB in Apr 2001 and specialty school of 156 hours in 2007. I am an AMS Certified meteorologist, I am recognized as an atmospheric specialist with the Dept of Commerce and I am certified through the Department of Defense. I am listed in JFAS as holding the clearance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, the thousands of techs that service commercial airliners in countries all over the world and no one noticed extra tanks and 100 of kegs of equipment?? Tech supposedly implemented on Boeing, airbus, bombardier, embraer jets meaning global involvement? </p>

<p>And somehow no independent scientist or aero asro companies have noticed a weakening magnetosphere? </p>

<p>Just cause you through it some agency acronyms and pretended to be st Norfolk and sat in on a class does not bake for any proof. Published literature, NOAA studies and press releases, NASA studies and press releases, aside, I have also hung out with many a climate scientist and all of them back anthropogenic climate change secondary to CO2 levels... even when drunk and among friends.</p>

<p>Now we know airplane contrails have an affect on local temperatures resulting in temperature elevations based on studies that looked at. Among other things, temperatures on 9/11 when most commercial air traffic was grounded.the contrails act to seed cloud formation and raise temps.</p>

<p>Similiarly a recent study looked at increased lighting strikes along shipping lanes because of particulates released from ship funnels. </p>

<p>Modern shipping and airplane travel and likely cars all affect the environment both from a carbon footprint stand point to affects of particulates in local weather patterns.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is large corporations and advocacy groups like the Koch’s funding lobbyists, and Astro turfing and buying politicians to surprise pllicy and awareness of anthropogenic climate change.</p>

<p>Trumps EPA Chief has stacked the EPA with people who think mercury isn’t dangerous and our air is too clean. They also replaced scientists with industry lobbyist. </p>

<p>Humans are responsible for less than 0.6% of all carbon emissions on the planet. The gasification of ocean water is responsible for over 96%. deforestation of rain forests would have a greater impact than industry. </p>

<p>now dont get me wrong, industry causes pollution. but it is not warming our planet. period. Until you actually put your head into the data and understand what the numbers mean, you will just have to keep on thinking AGW is an issue, and there is nothing I nor anyone can say to change your mind. </p>

<p>but if you take a quick look at the patent registry you will find hundreds of patents for aerosol delivery systems held by the US Gov. </p>

<p>take a quick look at nanized aluminol and climate engineering and you will see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you know what contrails are? contrails are ice crystals that are formed by turbulent exhaust of airplanes. did you know that contrails are a phenomenon that only persist in the right atmospheric conditions, very cold air, and very stable air. this is associated with certain atmospheric conditions.  contrails = condensation trails. </p>

<p>see exhaust contains lithometers. clouds cannot form with out some form of condensation nuclei. also necessary is water vapor. as you go up in the atmosphere, the amount of space between water vapor molecules increases as the density of air decreases. in order to have sustained contrails you have to have all the ingredients. this is why normal contrails will sometimes appear intermittent  as a plane crosses the sky, only producing contrails where the conditions are right. the atmosphere is not a smooth and homogenous beast. take a look at any water vapor satellite pic and you will see there are vastly varying conditions across relatively small distances.</p>

<p>the climate engineering trails that you see will disperse and settle. this is NOT how contrails work. contrails are vortices. they will fold over on themselves and dissipate.</p>

<p>chemtrails sette and flatten. this is because of the very stable nature of the upper atmosphere. vertical temperature gradients are much looser as you go up. its the reason that cirrus couds are flat and thin and cirrocumulus clouds are a much less common feature of the sky </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I see this as bunk is economical, as well as the actual mechanics of it. Commercial airlines are run on razor thin profit margins, with fuel being the largest contributor of costs. Weight comes at an absolute premium on a jet. You add spraying equipment and areosol, that means you have to carry more fuel. Only you can&#39;t, because that&#39;s maxed out already, jets are flying fuel tanks. </p>

<p>I see no way it would be remotely feasible to install spraying equipment and spray, and not have that be absolutely and immediately obvious from literally everyone involved in the airline, from the maintenance crews all the way up to the bookkeepers. It would have a drastic and unavoidable effect on the one thing the entire airline is structured around, as it is their biggest cost and logistical challenge: the  carrying capacity and consumption of jet fuel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I deeply respect the honesty of this reply. The ability to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; is one of the hallmarks of an educated and open mind, thank you.</p>

<p>What is your degree of certainty that geoengineering was ever associated with the civilian aviation industry? From where I stand, it just makes so much more sense to do it entirely within the military apparatus. They fly plenty of jets, and it&#39;s just so much easier to hide it all, from the funding to the actual physical systems. The degree of risk of doing it through the aviation industry makes little to no sense. Particularly when you fold in other elements that you introduce, such as the space-based sunshade. This indicates that the MIC has access to tech far outside what is divulged, making geoengineering through the civilian aviation industry make even less sense. </p>

<p>One additional point. You characterize constant, even contrail formation as unlikely, as it requires specific atmospheric conditions.  However, later in that same post, you characterize the upper atmosphere as very stable. Wouldn&#39;t these stable conditions be consistent with steady contrail formation?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no degree of certainty with the civilian sector here. i have only been involved with military avionics aside from a very select few civilian flight briefings which was mostly military pilots flying in a civilian craft.</p>

<p>the sunbrella project as far as i know was still in planning stages when i exited my service. that was dec 2010. </p>

<p>when i say stable atmosphere i am talking about an atmosphere that warms with height. the reason the atmosphere aloft is stable is because there is simply not very much mass aloft. </p>

<p>the atmosphere is layered. we exist in the (almost) lowest portion of the atmosphere called the troposphere. (the lowest is the planetary boundary layer and that can be anywhere from a few hundred feet thick to only a few inches. it depends on terrain and soil type)</p>

<p>in the troposphere, temperatures and pressures decrease with height. once you enter the tropopause this generally changes. the tropopause is the transition between the troposphere and the stratosphere and temperatures are relatively unchanged until you break into the stratosphere. </p>

<p>once you get into the stratosphere the temperatures actually increase in height.</p>

<p>contrail formation is highly dependent upon the water content at that height. water vapor is supercooled at that height and under the right conditions with available CCN the contrails form but most of the time they quickly dissipate as the air returns to an undisturbed state</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. If I&#39;m parsing what you&#39;re saying correctly, it isn&#39;t abnormal for a jet flying at a constant altitude in the upper atmosphere to produce a steady contrail, as the conditions are relatively unchanging. It&#39;s the persistence of that contrail that is abnormal. Could you back that up with any technical literature? Until now, I&#39;ve consistently found material that states contrail persistence high in the atmosphere is to be expected, due to the relatively steady sate which you describe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing that came to my mind when thinking about economics of how extra weight would affect how many passengers, luggage, etc...</p>

<p>He said this happened about 15-20 years ago.  </p>

<p>My family used to go to Florida every year, from the time i was 3 years old, up until i was 13, and then vacations started to be only once a year, instead of twice a year.  We had 3 relatives die within a span of 5 months in the year 2000, and i remember my mom freaking out about how expensive airline tickets had become over the past few years, and she specifically mentioned to me, that that was why we were not going to Florida in the spring, and Arizona in the fall anymore (we live in Ohio).</p>

<p>Anyways, my mom was always the one to look up airfares to see if we could find decent tickets during our normal times of vacationing...there eventually became a time that we just stopped going every single year, even though my dads salary continually increased.</p>

<p>I guess what im saying, is that it is possible that prices for travel were adjusted over time to make up for this.  This is extreme coincidence that we stopped travelling due to ticket costs around the exact time this shit was implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe rising fuel costs during this time better and more simply explain this. </p>

<p>In any case, my point wasn&#39;t that it would be impossible to obscure the addition from the economic end, but that to do so <em>and</em> maintain compartmentalization would be extremely difficult. You&#39;d have to have all the airlines cooking their books, and they&#39;d have to know why they were doing so. </p>

<p>Now, if you could get an additive into the jet fuel supply before it ever reached the airlines, and it didn&#39;t require any additional parts in order to be ejected in the exhaust and nucleate clouds, yeah then that would do it. But that doesn&#39;t seem to be what this purported insider is claiming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the grand scheme of the universe we are nothing. In the ability that collectively through the combined actions of 7+ billion we are quite capable of disturbing the delicate balance of earths ecosystemes and climate. </p>

<p>Remember, the earth itself is agnostic to its own state.it doesn’t have to be the way it is. Millions of years of life have shoes it into its current state and in turn the ecosystem has shaped life back. Sure there were changes in the earths weather from a variety of factors from volcanism to asteroids to plate tectonics to solar activity. But I. The recent stretch of human existence these changes have been relatively gradual.</p>

<p>It is we who evolved  to function within a certain ecological range and it us we who in our short time of city building have built our major metropolises exposed to weather related sequalae. Furthermore, we have also come to realize that other animals have evolved to live in a certain set of conditions and too rapid change will not give many the time to further adapt. Furthermore, our clearing of vast tracts of forest have changed the face of the earth itself. </p>

<p>There are almost 0 old growth trees in the entire eastern US. Fly over the Midwest and it’s literally all fields of corn and soy. Elsewhere, the amazon is beaing rapidly logged and Indonesian rainforest is converted to palm oil on an industrial scale. Millions of trees burned and clear cut and replaced with monoculture. 1000s of ships the size of cities burn the dirtiest fuel plying the oceans. 100s of millions of cars, 100s of thousands of planes, billions of homes, not to mention the never ending amount of other crap we consume... 500 million drinking straws consumed daily in the US! When looking at things at sci scales, it is not hard to believe that we can tip the scales but on earths ecological balance. </p>

<p>To disagree is not to troll. To take my disagreement as trolling is to let your feelings cloud your thoughts.</p>

<p>It feels like there is a cannon of conspiracies that are just rehashed over and over... must I subscribe to a certain set of these? </p>

<p>Just because MSM does not support something does it make it true. One cannot trust the MSM but yet see alternative news claims with some healthy skepticism. Someone who is awake, or skeptic should question all claims, including claims contrary to the narrative. </p>

<p>If one is to view things empirically one should way the evidence, not subscribe to one specific set of beliefs or another.</p>

<p>You are a sheep with a different master simply because you think someone who questions has not place here... looking to engage in an inward debate with the like minded is exactly what you accuse the other side of doing. </p>

<p>The Trump conspiracy is pretty compelling. </p>

<p>We have evidence that Erik Prince (founder blackwater, brother Betsy Davos) met Russian agents in the Seychelles to open a back communication channel. Then him and Flynn and Oliver North (Iran Contra fame) pitched a private intelligence force for hire to Trump...</p>

<p>This was likely payment for establishing a back communication channel because kushner, bannon and flynn were looking to raise sanctions because they were going to get payouts on saudi-Russian nuclear deal that needed sanctions to be raised. That why he was likely caught making those promises to Russia and that why Kushner was likely talking to VEB. VEB is a Putin affiliated bank, previously involved in running spies in the West and run by an intelligence trained Putin associate who speaks Arabic and has heavily invested in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Flynn was also getting paid of by Turkey. Manafort was clearly operating for the Russians working for free for Trump while offering private briefings to Russian officials and changing the republican platform.</p>

<p>It also unclear if there was a carrot and stick where Russian isn&#39;t using prior Kushner/ Trump murky Russia investments and deals as a stick and the nuclear deal as a possible carrot. </p>

<p>In any case, Papadopolous was likely small fry, unsure of where Sessions sits in this. Trump Jr might also be a peripheral actor. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Trump is independently compromised or directly involved but created a pro russia stance and power vaccuum (no establishment republicans wanted to work for him), that created the conditions for this situation. </p>

<p>for instance, and im being intentionally discreet....</p>

<p>when radar attenuates through the atmosphere it doesnt travel in a straight line nor is it homogeneous. We love it when operations are influenced by the eastern side of high pressures. this is because the radar energies can be &quot;trapped&quot; in subrefractive layers near the surface due to temperature inversions, so radar can  take advantage of these &quot;surface ducting layers&quot; and experience vastly extended ranges.</p>

<p>also, we can &quot;bounce&quot; signals off of parts of the atmosphere. its like  bouncing sound of the ocean floor when the ocean bottom is rocky. ASW guys know this well.</p>

<p>so... say there was a reflective layer of some sort in the upper atmosphere... we could bounce comms signals and utilize this for extended ranges. but we also saturate a portion of the atmosphere with the signal.</p>

<p>Yes, of course a magnetic shift has happened before. It&#39;s a NATURAL cycle which we might have been boosting. Scientists thought the shift would happen over the span of a few thousand years which they are saying now was a VERY optimistic statement.</p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s natural doesn&#39;t mean that it wouldn&#39;t be devastating to the inhabitants of earth. 1000&#39;s of species have already gone extinct. </p>

<p>our magnetosphere is weakening in part or whole due to the increased amount of EMF that is being produced on our earth and sent out into space</p>

<p>That is ridiculous.</p>

<p>If you were a &quot;scientist&quot; you would know that Earth&#39;s magnetic field has reduced to ZERO and recovered, NUMEROUS TIMES throughout history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that, from the polarity figure, at a time 0.94 million years ago (940,000 years ago) the magnetic field reverse itself by going nearly to &#39;zero&#39; but then after a few thousand years it recovered and began to increase in strength. During the next 150,000 years it rose to a maximum strength and then began to decline. Notice, also, how fast the magnetic field recovers after it reaches &#39;zero&#39;, in some cases much less than 10,000 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presently, Earth&#39;s magnetic field is weakening in strength by 5% every 100 years. It may be near zero in another few thousand years at this rate.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have to look it up, but NASA did some tests on women (astronauts) with regards to sun light and fertility.  The women were six-feet under for several months and their periods had stopped.  Here is another story of a woman who lived in a cave for 130 days and her menstrual cycle stopped: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/us/after-130-days-of-cave-life-a-return-to-glare-of-the-sun.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/us/after-130-days-of-cave-life-a-return-to-glare-of-the-sun.html</a></p>

<p>It is believed that the Sun (whether it&#39;s Vitamin D deficiency or Solar Radiation etc) is key to fertility.  The human race cannot live absolutely underground, as women will become infertile and with it, mankind would perish. </p>

<p>The concept and hopes of space flight to far reaching places (sans cryostasis etc) by having generations being born aboard is an impossibility.  The entire science fiction branch of Humans reaching out into space and colonizing new planets is also most likely an impossibility (unless we clone?).  We need the Sun to procreate currently.. a concept most don&#39;t even acknowledge or are aware of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the reasons they won&#39;t stop spraying: people are getting paid. There are many layers to the operations. One is the hazardous waste industries, manufacturing, refining, coal. Most of the stuff is <strong>coal fly ash</strong> wherein it is found that regional spraying reflects the composition of the various sources; more or less barium, aluminum, radioactive, trace elements show up regionally. If they can&#39;t mix it into cement, they go via train tankers to the selected airports.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been postulated that an investigative journalist (if any are left) could track the train car numbers to and from using trainspotters or hobbyists.</p>

<p>As I said <em>people are getting paid</em> much like the &quot;proprietary&quot; list of chemicals in fracking fluids (declared proprietary because it&#39;s getting in your water tables). </p>

<p>So we&#39;re fucked from the air and from the ground and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>The preceding was just a sampling of one side industry. Imagine what could be done with advance knowledge of climate engineering on things like futures speculation on weather, insurance, even real estate. Example: if a mythical investigative journalist could see what happened, who had foreknowledge of, say, the flattening of Joplin by tornado ie. who was there with ready cash, like happened after Katrina, like carpet bagger carrion birds. More money. </p>

<p>My main beef is the continued suppression of the experimental fucking about at the cost of our health, it demonstrates none of these manipulators respect the people or the Constitution let alone <em>human</em> values.</p>

<p>&quot;High levels of Silver (Ag), Barium (Ba) and Strontium (Sr) and low levels of copper (Cu) have been measured in the antlers, soils and pastures of the deer that are thriving in the chronic wasting disease (CWD) cluster zones in North America in relation to the areas where CWD and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have not been reported. The elevations of Ag, Ba and Sr were thought to originate from both natural geochemical and artificial pollutant sources--stemming from the common practise of aerial spraying with &#39;cloud seeding&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how they are actually implementing this? Are they putting it in the fuel so that the pilots are unaware? I believe that would be the best option as eventually people talk.</p>

<p>Also, I realize the dangers of EMF as I used to work on and near cell phone towers. Some microwave antennae were so powerful if you stayed near them for more than 1 minute your testicles were basically fried and you would have visible EMF burns.

<p>Do you know if they are doing the weather manipulation on purpose as a form of eugenics? Or is it just new unstudied science that they are just testing on the public without care of safety?

    <div class="md"><p>I contacted the guy in charge of that class, and he disagrees with your conclusion. The total alkalinity equation you cite is not the same as pH. TA is more like buffering capacity. If you look at page 10, figure 15.7, CO2 exchange between ocean and atmosphere doesn&#39;t affect TA. TA is affected by formation or dissolution of CaCO3, a process affected by pH, but does not change the pH. Page 12 states that anthropogenic carbon is being added to the atmosphere and oceans, with about 26% of CO2 emissions becoming absorbed into the ocean.</p>

<p>But to address your point about pressure, it is true that high pressures increase ocean pH, but not by much. The chart on page 14 was produced by a boat moving north from Hawaii to Alaska while measuring pH at several depths. The pH at the surface near Hawaii was about 8.1, but the pH at the bottom of the ocean, at maximum pressure, was only 7.5. As the boat moved north, surface pH changed from 8.1 to about 7.7. The surface pressures at Hawaii and Alaska aren&#39;t anywhere near different enough to explain the pH difference. Anyway, if we look at the map on Page 15, we can see a map of CO2 flux, where positive values (red) indicate CO2 escaping the ocean, and negative values (blue) indicating CO2 entering the ocean. As the boat moved from Hawaii to Alaska, it would have started in a green zone (zero net flux) and moved up through dark blue zones (CO2 into the ocean). As it moved north, the surface pH became more acidic. So areas where CO2 moves into the ocean become more acidic than areas with no net CO2 change.</p>

<p>Additionally, that map shows that the north atlantic has large patches of purple, indicating strong CO2 movement into the ocean. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification#/media/File:WOA05_GLODAP_del_pH_AYool.png">This map</a> shows that the north atlantic also has a large negative shift in pH.</p>

<p>Ultimately it all comes down to equilibrium processes. If you put more CO2 into the atmosphere, you push more CO2 into the oceans. As that CO2 becomes carbonate, it creates two hydronium ions, decreasing the pH. To drive the process in the other direction, it requires converting hydronium to water, increasing the pH. This is why you make baking soda volcanoes with vinegar instead of sodium hydroxide. So if the oceans were releasing more CO2 than they were absorbing, the pH would increase.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, So let&#39;s start with your statement about Boeing using devices that release aerosols into the atmosphere.<br/>
For that Boeing planes would have to have a separate container with the aerosols, that would have to be refilled after X flights.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t the device/container AND the pipe actually releasing these materials be visible? At least on blueprints.<br/>
Also, the aerosols would have to be refilled. By employees. I doubt the CIA/NASA/Navy whatever has employees at that many airports, for that many flights, who kept shut about this. Not a chance.<br/>
If it&#39;s in the fuel that is also out of question, as the engine simply wouldn&#39;t be able to process those extra materials. And if it could, again, we could see it from the engine blueprints.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% certain this is a LARP.<br/>
If the person actually wanted to get info out he would&#39;ve gotten material. Documents, tapes, anything to back up his  gigantic claims. And he would&#39;ve sent them to news agencies and/or Wikileaks.<br/>
That&#39;s what a rational person would&#39;ve done in his position, and not larp on a subreddit full of people who circlejerk about this topic.<br/>
I don&#39;t deny the possibility for such operations. I have documents myself showing that it might exist. But this person doesn&#39;t seem legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for verifying.</p>

<p>Some of your claims are... amazing. And provocative...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Global warming seems to have decelerated. Did you ever hear anybody imply that these programs had a measurable effect on the rate of global warming?</p></li>
<li><p>Somebody must be paying for the chemicals in the trails, if you&#39;re right. Did you ever get a sense for whether the government was paying, it if it mandated airlines to buy and deploy chemicals, or if it was third party?</p></li>
<li><p>NRL didn&#39;t attribute global warming to man made sources?!? Obama was President at the time. Was NRL somehow insulated from the political forces and scientific evidence that had persuaded all the other agencies and departments to blame man? Or do you have the sense that NRL was working with more information?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you aware of any other Navy or Air Force efforts to engineer the climate? For example, dumping iron into the ocean?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you answer these, I will likely have additional, more technical questions. I appreciate your time.</p>

<p>Your claims are hard to believe, but I do believe that you believe in the veracity of your claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i sincerely appreciate the delivery of your questions. in science, doubt is the method of scrutiny, and scrutiny is the method of maintaining accountability of claims.</p>

<p>yes, these methods do have an appreciable impact on the solar &quot;budget&quot; of our atmosphere. when i departed my service in 2010, the global trend was still rising. I know that in recent observations there has indeed been a trend downward. this only makes sense. anytime you increase the albedo you decrease the absorption of the system. I do not have any sort of correlating evidence other than the basic concept of increasing reflectivity decreases absorption.</p>

<p>I was never privy to any information as to the source of the metals being used. In 2002 when i took part of the conference we were focused on silver based metals and as I was leaving they were focusing more on aluminols. to be honest, i think it was to do with cost but i cant say i know for certain. I do know that nanosilvers lacked the ability to sustain long term changes...</p>

<p>No AGW was never mentioned during any time. The focus was on solar radiation management. no matter how much carbon you put into the atmosphere, it cannot sway the sun to introduce more or less radiation. we can only influence the efficiency of the earths ability to absorb and re-emit</p>

<p>I am not privy to any iron dumping by anyone. there was a brief talk on the influence of trash in the doldrums of the atlantic and pacific and its influence on shipping routes, but it was brief. the US Navy has very poor trash habits in international waters... seriously.</p>

<p>I am open to any and all questions. i appreciate them. I know what i have witnessed and these claims are in deed based upon my experiences. this is just an effort to help people understand what is going on. The more aware people are, the less room people whom would see this continue have. </p>

<p>thank you again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the answers. They help to clarify what areas of information you knew about. It sounds like your area focused on radiation.</p>

<p>IDK if you&#39;re still here, but here are a few more questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There has been some recent discussion about the effects of cosmic rays on cloud formation, which of course affect effective albedo. Do you feel that the cosmic ray effect on our warming is significant, and if so, what scientific papers would you recommend that we read, as being most reputable?</p></li>
<li><p>To what extent does the natural energy emission of the sun vary? Has it increased or decreased? Did your models take this into account and, if so, do solar changes account for a significant proportion of global warming since the mid-1900&#39;s?</p></li>
<li><p>(Bringing the two questions above together) How do solar sunspots affect the solar wind, and how does the solar wind affect our planet&#39;s protection from cosmic rays? Has the reduction in sunspots over the past few cycles affected the influx of cosmic rays at Earth sea level and, if so, what are the effects on global warming?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is lying. The first post in their history says they weren&#39;t in the military. Now they are a Navy &quot;atmospheric physicist&quot;, whatever the fuck that is.</p>

<p>As an aside, they are also a complete shit writer, which make me doubt his &quot;atmospheric physicist&quot; credentials. No one is going to have you do &quot;atmospheric physics&quot; unless you have some college. No one smart enough to do physics writing sucks that bad. Not that we need that to know he&#39;s lying because he provides that proof himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not lying. i posted  the proof of my time spent in the navy as an atmospheric physicist.
the air is an atmosphere... if you only work in the air, then you are a meteorologist...
the ocean is an atmosphere... if you work only with the ocean you are an oceanographer</p>

<p>an atmospheric physicist works with all atmospheres.</p>

<p>I am a college graduate. i graduated high school at 17 years old, completed an associates of science at NWACC at 18 and went directly into  the navy where i received an additional 156 hours of collegiate credit.</p>

<p>if you think i am lying, dont listen. as i have said i provided my credentials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>like many others here, i am a long-term backer of the solar influence approach to climate, and have been completely thrown by the global warming scientific meltdown over human influence.</p>

<p>your defense of authenticity on an anonymous board is most impressive, as is the technical information you are providing.</p>

<p>but i have to be wondering if you are a limited hangout - that is, you are doing this with some level of permission and guidance to get this information out, much like some of us suspect the 4chan Larping of being insider info embedded in a lot of disinfo. </p>

<p>so obviously you would not claim or admit to be a limited hangout, even if that&#39;s essentially the mission (which i assure you will get discussed in the aftermath). but you could make some revealing comments on questions like ...</p>

<p>how many other insiders are you aware of that share your knowledge and viewpoint? what percentage in the total field as far as you can tell?</p>

<p>do you believe that other insiders are ready to come out with their perspective on this issue?</p>

<p>do you personally know any other whistle-blowers that might come out, and could you encourage that?</p>

<p>is the top management of the program ready for a soft disclosure of the solar and EMF problem - which you have advanced - in opposition to the man-made carbon problem?</p>

<p>how much do you think the psychological shock to the majority who believe in the climate propaganda is a factor in making them understand whatever is happening is not human generated?</p>

<p>thanks very much from someone who has puzzled on this issue 20 years!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure. there are several of my coworkers that are aware of what i speak. </p>

<p>I initially started this thinking it would be discredited immediately and i could just let it go at that and hope that some folks might take a look into what i am saying and see.</p>

<p>i am only taking this time to speak because of all the positive propoganda that exists. Pumping aluminols into the tropopause/lower strat is irresponsble and in my personal opinion it should be a transparent issue for all. I have heard that reddit was a place to voice such things and was given direction to post here by a very close friend. this is actually getting to be much more than i bargained for.</p>

<p>i do not mind verifying my credentials.  i do not mind decribing the experience that i had. but there are those that think that if i am not intimately involved with every aspect then i am somehow just here to be a mouth piece. the truth is i could have just kept to myself.</p>

<p>i took this time (and continue to) because i BELIEVE it is the right thing to do. i have kids. its not like it was when i was 25. </p>

<p>i do not claim to know every thing about every single aspect. the things i describe are exactly what i have witnessed and what i experienced.  it is what i was taught. the individuals that read this and see what is here can take it or leave it. in my eyes i have done what i felt was the right thing to do and if it doesnt get anywhere.... well. like my dad used to say....</p>

<p>the truth will prevail. all things come to light in time and the truth does not need an airplane to track you down</p>

<p>I am a &#39;chemtrail debunker&#39; here.... and I absolutely agree with that statement. Geoengineering is a clear and soon-to-be present danger. It needs exposing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>remember that my last experience in person was years ago so any info i would have would likely be out dated at this point. the tropopause is a relatively stable portion of the atmosphere where temperature profiles go from positive to negative. </p>

<p>that means that temps decrease through the troposphere up to 30-55k feet or so (depending on your latitude) and then there is a thin layer where atmopheric temperatures are relatively unchanged in height called the troposphere and then as you enter the stratosphere temperatures become more increased. </p>

<p>this means that near the upper troposphere / lower stratospher there is a layer where the air below it is more dense and colder and the air above is less dense and warmer. this means that aerosols that are in this layer here are likely to be suspended for very long periods of time so long as there are no orographic influences or thermal disturbances to physically disturb the strata there.</p>

<p>again i have no technical information on delivery methods other than very basic concepts. </p>

<p>when i last was involved aluminols were not the forefront choice of metals that were being discussed. It was recently when i watched a recording of a presentation from Harvard where aluminum alloy particles were discussed that i realized that this metal was the primary and forefront candidate.</p>

<p>its interesting that aluminum is one of those metal types that really really hate to be influenced by a moving or changing magnetic flux... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This for me is not even a question.</p>

<p>When shit like this gets out, it gets out waaay late in the game, when its already taken its toll, nobody cares, because there are way bigger and badder problems occuring at the moment.</p>

<p>But, if something about our government got out, that they did not even consult the public about, and just began dumping chemicals into the upper atmosphere because &#39;&#39;we&#39;re the military industrial complex, we&#39;re ahead of our time, and we&#39;re doing it for the right reasons&#39;&#39; people would literally shit their pants.</p>

<p>I just was pointing out to several friends about the net neutrality thing, that we as public persons literally have no say what happens to this country, even as a collective, voting all together.  Its clearly the interests of the very few that are the most important, NN has made that painstakingly clear in the past week.</p>

<p>Furthermore, talking about compartmentalization of information--this very well could be compartmentalization at its very finest.  OP could be duped in the aspect that everything the navy told him and all the research they did was completely bogus, and subjective in nature...with the real reason for spraying the aerosols into the air to eventually settle over the next 20 years so that top secret military plans for mind control, or mass population control--or what the fuck ever could be executed.</p>

<p>This is exactly how compartmentalization works.  Each department works independent of eachother, thinking there is a common goal, but each part executes a piece of a plan for the whole, to which the parts of the whole have no idea that any other parts even exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ironic that conspiracy theorists are also the most gullible people in the world. If you believe any of this post you are gullible as a 2 year old. What chem trails really are is planes that use water/hydrogen for fuel. Duh. Losers. Why else would it leave a long trail of what appears to be water vapor? Because it is water vapor. They won&#39;t tell us the plane&#39;s fuel is water because then we&#39;d all demand water fuel cars which would devastate the oil industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>they had tested cloud seeding the eye of a Hurricane to try and diminish the exhaust mechanism and inhibit growth to reduce coastal impacts of large tropical systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, it was in the outer rain bands, not the eye. The idea is to precipitate out all the moisture from the air <em>before</em> it converged into the eye, thus starving the storm of a source of energy (in laymen&#39;s terms, as the moist air rises up the eyewall and water precipitates out, it generates heat that keeps the storm going).</p>

<p>It is well-document, but of questionable success. (In some cases, stroms weakened after seeding, but maybe it would have anyway...)</p>

<p>The biggest drawbacks is: Let&#39;s say you <em>did</em> manage to knock a storm down from cat 5 to cat 2, and instead of hitting Norfolk VA, it hits DC instead (or vice-versa). Who is responsible? It is no longer an act of God. It is a very thorny political issue. Especially if your grandma was killed in NC to save some resort properties in the Hamptons. </p>

<p>The rest of this is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read the OP? Also the climate changes on earth. It always has and always will, it&#39;s not a fix temperature. You&#39;d be crazy to think that an active planet in just stagnant. Also yes you did the carbon tax is in gas prices and the smog tests and vehicle registration. Which all would have gone up if we were part of the Paris climate Accord. Such as Canada where gas is $5 a gallon or Denmark where it&#39;s so expensive to pay all the taxes of having a combustion engine car that almost everyone has an electric car or no car at all if you aren&#39;t part of the middle class.</p>

<p>At any rate all I said is that Man Make climate change is a bunch of bullshit, there simply isn&#39;t enough CO2 in the atmosphere to cause a significant the greenhouse effect. It&#39;s only at 0.02% for fuck sake. How crazy strong do you think CO2 is that 1/100 of 1 percent is going to heat the planet...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your claim about the EMF causing the weakening magnetic field is interesting, I hadn&#39;t thought about that. In general our means of generating electricity involve magnetic induction to pull charge from the Earth, then we are transforming that into electromagnetic signals. Some of these signals are not being reabsorbed by the atmosphere and simply radiate into space, thus decreasing the electromagnetic energy available to power the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. </p>

<p>I wonder, though, if it is the primary cause or if there are natural cycles that we happen to be in the middle of which can cause such phenomena. We have recorded temperatures on other planets in the solar system also increasing. <a href="http://www.blazelabs.com/f-u-massvariation.asp">Xavier Borg</a> has some interesting theories about this. Basically the Earth&#39;s velocity relative to a hypothetical &quot;absolute&quot; rest frame would determine the local cosmic ray flux (and, in Xavier Borg&#39;s model, the gravitational strength since gravity in this model is the shadow of planck length radiation). This absolute rest frame would measure a uniform cosmic microwave background in all directions. The Earth is rotating around the sun which is rotating around the galaxy which is rotating around the supercluster, etc. The alignment or antialignment of these rotational cycles would cause variations in Earth&#39;s &quot;absolute&quot; velocity, changing the cosmic ray flux and gravitational strength, explaining why the Earth&#39;s physical axis wobbles and large scale cycles of species die offs occur. However, the ice age cycle is much shorter than the galactic rotation cycle which makes me think it could be related to our solar system&#39;s rotation around our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster">local stellar cluster.</a> Perhaps our rotation around our the local cluster is moving into alignment with the galactic rotation, causing the increasing temperatures and weakening field. I&#39;m not sure how this would cause the field to weaken, though; perhaps as the physical rotational axis of the Earth changes this causes instabilities which tend to weaken the magnetic field over time. Or perhaps there is a spin spin interaction between the Earth&#39;s spin and galactic center&#39;s which causes the weakening and eventual reversal as Earth&#39;s relative orientation rotates. </p>

<p>i do not claim to know every thing about every single aspect. the things i describe are exactly what i have witnessed and what i experienced.  it is what i was taught. the individuals that read this and see what is here can take it or leave it. in my eyes i have done what i felt was the right thing to do and if it doesnt get anywhere.... well. like my dad used to say....</p>

<p>the truth will prevail. all things come to light in time and the truth does not need an airplane to track you down</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thread and other chem trail allegations alleges chemtrais from civilian airliners not exclusively military flights. Also who are you to decide what is a valid conspiracy. Must one take everything presented here as valid? Not all conspiracies theories are valid. </p>

<p>I just happen to believe that real conspiracies are how Russian likely compromised key members of the trump staff or trump himself, or how Kushner and Flynn likely were trying to sell our country out for a stake in a nuclear deal or how climate science has been buried or astroturfed by corporations or how we went to Iraq on false pretenses and Cheney outed a cia spy to get back at people who saw through the falls claims etc. </p>

<p>Or must I subscribe to some canon of theories? Is flat earth in this canon? Or must I believe we never went to the moon? Or must I believe we never went to space? Do I have to believe chem trails or anti vaccines theories? Who decides what I just believe? If you are against being a sheep why must I be your sheep and accept your dictums? You seek to shutdown debate and criticism... is that not what you allege the powers that be are doing to others.</p>

<p>Here you show your dogmatic and authoritarian stripes.You are just a sheep of another color trying to repaint the other sheep.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Inhibits plant growth, could possibly be used as a means of population control/food control by selling GMO crops that are capable of growing in soil with high aluminum content, allowing a huge monopoly on agriculture and food production.&quot;</p>

<p>Why go thru all that trouble? Why not just corner the market on ag? Think Monsanto or ADM. Don&#39;t have to create an entire new plant type to gain a monopoly.</p>
