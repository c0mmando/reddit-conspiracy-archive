       For a CEO and Stockholders, it makes sense. Bring in foreigners to work for 1/3rd the Pay, increasing your bottom line making those at the top of each company richer and the stockholders happier.
      </p>
      <p>
       This in turn fucks over the U.S. citizens and those who have the skills, education, and qualifications and should be paid in full what they deserve to be paid for their skills.

       <p>
        Over the last decade it became clear to most of us that there is a systemic reason behind companies firing veteran tech workers who are 40+ and replacing them with imported cheaper workers. While tech companies continued to cry wolf, about shortage of qualified employees, they did not hesitate to get rid of a growing number of such employees out of their ranks and replace them with foreign workers who were willing to accept low compensation.

       I didnt realize this was a conspiracy or hidden. I thought everyone knew it was SOP.

       From 2000 to 2003 I sat next to an Indian guy here on H1B. Same exact job, similar skill levels, and I was surprised to later learn he made half what I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       At another job in 2009, guy came from corporate to tell us our office was being shut down and all the jobs were being given in H1B workers at the company HQ in another state. To my face, he told me "I can get three of those guys for what each of you cost."

       It was, I can assure you.  I did, however, know his effort would fail.  I'd been through it several times, and it always failed.  So, I told him, right back to his face, "You better hope your job doesn't depend on this being a success, because it won't."
      </p>
      <p>
       We worked on software which served the American Railroad (Freight, not passengers) industry.  We were THE software that did what we did, no one else did it.  ALL the railroads used our software because it was something that connected them all together (long story).  I made sure all of our customers knew what was coming, and they were not happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when he brought it a few guys from India for us to train (literally, training them to take our jobs), I basically showed them both nonsense and whenever they asked a question, I answered whatever happened to come into my head at that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last day of our office was a Dec 31.  The new guys were taking over Jan 1.  The first day of each quarter, all of our software's information was updated (this included things like rates charged for rail car repairs, etc.), and they failed to do that properly.  Something that was trivial for us took them a week to sort out.  But, as you would imagine, things went downhill from there, and within the year, they closed that software division, lawsuits started flying, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last I heard, the guy I told would fail had pinned the entire debacle on his second-in-command, who was fired.

       I blows my mind how little people think things through when they get the idea of saving money. The rule I always refer to as, you pay shit, you get shit. 
 I’m sure you got a nice laugh after it all went to pieces, I know I would’ve.

       My last day was Dec 31, I started a new job on Feb 1.  It was just a few minutes from my house.   I was at that place for five years before the "eliminated my job" by hiring someone younger to do it cheaper. They forgot that, as someone over 40, I'm age protected from exactly that, so they wound up forking over a tidy sums for age discrimination. And I started a new job 6 weeks later, that I'm still at, and it's the best job I ever had.

       That’s great, I love it when a company gets what they deserve. Things always have a way of working out for the better. It’s hard to recognize it while your in the thick of it, but I always remind myself that everything happens for a reason. Glad you are in a better spot now.

       This is happening big time in the nursing field at hospitals. Bringing in people that have their BSN and working for less with out health insurance. It's cheaper for hospitals to do this.

       What do you mean? The original standard for being an RN was an Associates degree, but now more and more hospitals are requiring their nurses to have BSNs, meaning they generally get paid more.

       RN and BSNs make the same where I am at least but hospitals here in st.louis require the BSN. What I meant was that hospitals are hiring more of these contracting nursing companies that hire people with these visas to cut the cost of paying an America nurse.

       Not only an increase in the numbers of skilled H1B workers but unskilled H2B workers.

       This is what the Republicans men when they say they are going to bring the jobs home.  They will also bring in the cheap labor.

      <p>
       This was last year's Republican majority Congress, it is very hard to find out what is in this year's legislation.

       Where I worked - it was a German company who brought in Indian H1Bs.  Eventually the American manager retired and an India got in there, then they used that to get rid of all of the rest of the Americans under him.  He felt he was able to be more abusive and demanding of Indians, so he preferred them over Americans.  What I thought was fucked up was, why are all these foreigners able to use our country and citizens like a cum sponge and get away with it?

       Because we now have a P.C. culture, Tech Industry is majority liberal so there is a strong virtue signaling element, if you mix this in with unbridled capitalism which seeks to find every possible way to lower the bottom line so that those at the top BANK (and they will do so without any regards to fairness, ethics, morals) then this is what we have as a result.
