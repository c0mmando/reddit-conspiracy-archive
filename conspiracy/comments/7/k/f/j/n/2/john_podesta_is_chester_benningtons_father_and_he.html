       Lead singer to Linkin Park, Chester Bennington has recently passed away on July 20, 2017 from a suicide. I believe the death scene was staged to look like a suicide and Bennington's death is related to his close friend, Chris Cornell's alleged suicide, which I also believe was staged as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, if you don't already know who John Podesta is, he's a columnist and former chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and was the Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton and Counselor to President Barack Obama. Essentially, he's an important public figure related to the Clinton's and Obama's. To save you and I the headache of re-iterating what hundreds of others have conspired against Podesta
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html">
        this article
       </a>
       explains everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I start, my inspiration for this post came from this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2HgrCSK0gs">
        YouTube video.
       </a>
       As a warning now,
       <strong>
        VERY GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING AUDIO OF
        <em>
         REAL CHILD ABUSE
        </em>
        IS HEARD AT 10:56-12:56 AND SPORADICALLY REFERENCED THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE VIDEO PAST 10:56 TO GET THE POINT ACROSS THAT PEDOPHILIA IS WRONG! VIEW AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!
       </strong>
       The only compelling piece of evidence shown in the video is the similarity of voice tone in the audio to John Podesta. Otherwise, the other claims aren't backed up by evidence and can't be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       To begin, the most obvious point to make is that John Podesta and Chris Bennington look alike from
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/nuWKS">
        these images.
       </a>
       Podesta's genes are very dominant in Bennington. They have very similar wide, elephant-like ears, eye shape + color, hairline, wrinkles in the under-eyes, laugh lines, chiseled chin, defined/square jaw line, and they both have impaired vision, just to name a few physical commonalities. According to the public, Chester's "real father" is supposed to be
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LSmv553.jpg">
        Lee Russell Bennington
       </a>
       . Compared next to each other, Bennington looks more like Podesta. However, the photos I used to compare Podesta and Bennington are only of Podesta as an old man. In his younger years,
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/exLrM49.png">
        Podesta looks nothing like Bennington.
       </a>
       And from a side angle of
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KGz01ax.jpg">
        Lee Russell
       </a>
       , Chester seems to have Lee's eyes. Take that as you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a
       <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2009242">
        VOAT post
       </a>
       , a user explains the timeline of John Podesta and Susan Elaine Johnson (Chester's Mom) hooking up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chester was born in 1976, John Podesta's political career started in 1972, '76 was an election year and his wiki states that he worked on George McGovern's unsuccessful campaign, so he likely would have been campaigning around the US the prior year. We know how these politicians are, it's not improbable that he may have had a tryst with Chester's mother, she may have been a McGovern supporter. I'm purely speculating here so don't attack me, but the timeline matches just as much as their faces do.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The public narrative that is common knowledge is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        by Chester's own admission that he was sexually abused by an older man when he was young. He was born in Arizona and his father was a police Detective who worked against childhood sexual abuse. His mother was a nurse. They divorced when he was 11. He was 41.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Secondly, Bennington has admitted to sexual abuse in his childhood from a family friend. He admitted this in a
       <a href="http://www.tom-bryant.com/linkin-park-kerrang--tom-bryant.html">
        2008 interview
       </a>
       with Kerrang, a published magazine.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I started getting molested when I was about seven or eight,” says Bennington, now. “It was by a family friend who was older than me. It escalated from a touchy, curious, ‘what does this thing do’ into full-on, crazy violations. I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didn’t want to do. It destroyed my self-confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like most people, I was too afraid to say anything. I didn’t want people to think I was gay or that I was lying. It was a horrible experience. The sexual assaults continued until I was 13.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It was an awful time. I hated everybody in my family: I felt abandoned by my mom, my dad was not very emotionally stable then, and there was no-one I could turn to – at least that’s how my young mind felt. The only thing I wanted to do was kill everybody and run away.”
       </p>
       <p>
        "The problem was, I also found a good way to escape the abuse of my past. Getting high, drinking a lot and having sex with a lot of great girls is a pretty good escape.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because of his sexual past, Bennington and Chris Cornell were on the verge of exposing infamous pedophile rings in the entertainment industry. The
       <a href="http://chrisandvickycornellfoundation.org/">
        <em>
         Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation
        </em>
       </a>
       joined with
       <em>
        If Only
       </em>
       to protect vulnerable children from predators. Cornell had acquired evidence connecting the Clinton's to human trafficking when he worked with the Clinton Administration on a CPP (Clinton Preferred Pediatrics) services in Haiti.  Unfortunately, Cornell conveniently died along with several other journalists attempting to expose pedo rings like Comet Ping Pong. News sources like
       <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chris-cornells-widow-breaks-silence-on-singers-death-w490165">
        The Rolling Stone
       </a>
       and other
       <a href="http://people.com/music/chris-cornell-widow-speaks-he-didnt-want-to-die/">
        mainstream media
       </a>
       tried to push the narrative Cornell's substance abuse and mental illness was responsible for his alleged suicide.
       <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chester-bennington-linkin-park-singer-dead-at-41-w493387">
        Same goes for Bennington.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bennington mysteriously tweeted
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wc6cVOH.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       on the morning of his death.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I have evidence that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       but it's really easy to forge a tweet these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Linkin Park, as a band, is also connected to the Clinton's when Mike Shinoda had overestimated the funds for a Haitian recycling project. Shinoda invested in a recycling center in Haiti to give back to the environment and the surrounding communities. Similar to other recycling centers, Shinoda bought recyclable materials from individuals, but after a while, Shinoda didn't anticipate the popularity of his vision and was soon struggling to pay the people back. Right when Shinoda was on the brink of shutting down the organization, Bill Clinton stepped in with a grant. Rumors speculate that because Chester Bennington might be the bastard child of John Podesta, he asked Clinton to save Linkin Park's asses with the Haitian recycling center. Honestly, I think that's a stretch because their isn't any facts to prove so and no one needs to sleep with Podesta for that to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Bennington's death, TMZ got ahold of Bennington's autopsy report and claimed his blood turned out "presumptive positive" for MDMA (ecstasy) on one test, but they failed to explain that two other tests resulted negative for ecstasy, proving that no drugs were in his system. As soon as the article was posted, it was retracted from the backlash. I found an article that perfectly explains the
       <a href="https://themighty.com/2017/12/tmz-chester-bennington-autopsy-report/">
        TMZ drama
       </a>
       , but I'll paraphrase. The backlash consisted of a series of Tweets from
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Kx36J">
        Talinda Bennington
       </a>
       (Chester's wife),
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LnW4B">
        Mike Shinoda
       </a>
       , the
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VJAxh">
        Linkin Park Offical Twitter
       </a>
       , and lots of concerned fans. Talinda's main argument is the violation of privacy from TMZ. Due to the false public allegations that Chester's death was a suicide, she had to take her kids out of school so they wouldn't be consumed with fallacies from their peers. As someone who's surrounded by close relatives with mental illnesses, she is well aware of the signs of suicide and Chester didn't give off any clues said in
       <a href="https://twitter.com/talindab/status/909079832700518402?lang=en">
        this tweet.
       </a>
       Especially when you've been married to someone for a long time, you'd know if they were having a bad day and sense any bad mood, but Chester wasn't. She claimed he was perfectly fine. Reports speculate that he was killed before he was hung and I'd believe it in a heartbeat because the facts are adding up. Officially, his case is closed and deemed a suicide, but many fans like myself, Talinda, and Mike are unsatisfied with the investigation and medical examinations.

       Love the work put into this, but that fatherhood video by worldcorp is something I have argued against so many times. Worldcorp is bogus, have made many videos similar to this as art projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were posting that video on 4chan, claiming it was one of their projects that they made, a long time before pizzagate. Then pizzagate happened, and they claimed it was Podesta (after previously claiming it was another edgy art project they made) and everyone lost their mind.

       thanks for reading. i'd agree that i'm also not entirely sure it is Podesta either, but the audio is so heartbreaking, i needed to share it regardless if it was Podesta or not. i couldn't finish the video because i felt so much empathy and compassion for the poor child.

       Do you think there is a possibility it could be Podesta in the video, given the voice? And that there is actually a screaming child in that video who is experiencing fear and torment?

       definitely a possibility. it could go either way. i'd have to know how the video footage was obtained other outside factors to truly determine it, but from what was said in the video, it seems likely. ugh, that poor child's screams will haunt me in my nightmares. i can't understand why anyone would want to hurt an innocent, pure child like that.

       Worldcorp is not just "art projects." Take a look at the website and see the other videos and there's some real, genuine abuse and fucked up shit posted there. You can't write it off as an art project. Whether or not it's podesta though, now that's the question...

       But that's usually how suicides happen. You could take a poll of 100 people who lost a close loved one to suicide, and 90 of them will tell you that they had no idea that the deceased was going to off themselves.

       TBH, I have a friend that has struggled with deep depression his whole life, I can always tell if he gets a little too dark. I can sense if he is thinking about it. But we are very close, so maybe I’m just more intuitive with him.

       Yet I have a friend who killed him self this year and that was a huge shock to everyone.

       So...how do you link to Mike Shinoda's Twitter, but consistently call him "Mark Shinona"?  For claiming in a separate comment that this took you three days to write, that seems like a pretty stupid mistake to miss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, this theory is just way too out there.  Your only "evidence" is that John Podesta and Chester have some similar facial structures.  Here's the thing...there are these crazy things called ethnicities.  Ethnicities usually have some physical traits associated with them.  So, all you really proved is that somewhere, going back who knows how long, Chester and Podesta probably came from a similar part of the world.  Shocking.  Truly shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a shit theory.

       Alright look, straight up with no negativity, they aren't bots. People are trolling you. It's probably because you've been linked to r/drama. This entire conversation is linked there.

       oh no i was getting the same comments way before that. within seconds of hitting the send button, comments questioned my sanity and that's weird because it doesn't take seconds to read the paragraphs i wrote and one account even had a conversation with itself downsizing the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       but i'm not saying what i wrote was the best because it sucked. it was my first time writing an informal piece for the interwebs, but i just gotta keep writing more and i'll get better over time.

       If it was a real tweet, and also with the amount of followers Bennington has, surely, someone would have post notifications on and would of seen the tweet. Even not, it would've been reported before the 771 retweets and 2104 likes.

       Come on now. John Podesta was going nationwide campaigning so his chances of randomly hooking up with Chester's mom whilst working nonstop on a political campaign, using no protection and her getting pregnant must be at least 1 in 750,000,000.

       "We know how these politicians are, it's not improbable that he may have had a tryst with Chester's mother" this statement is ridiculous. However, I feel like I read something that provided a little more evidence of the connection between JP &amp; CB's Mom.

       No. Did this on another post too and I got the same exact response. Just curious how many people on here are quick to screenshot and actually think I am a shill. It's quite funny. I see the behavioral patterns on daily basis on how people assume everything and nothing is based on hard evidence anymore.

       That's why I asked, because it does happen.  This subreddit is notorious on both sides of fishy behavior actually happening and miscommunication or paranoia between users.

       Your responses with Immaculate_Ejaculate were pretty close together though tho:P  I just wasn't sure.  Have a good day sir/ma'am .

       This sounds similar to the "9/11 Truthers", in that something terrible happened and people refuse to believe it happened the way it did, so they make up ridiculous claims.

       Here's the thing; I've had clinical depression my whole life, as have others in my faimly, since it's genetic. I've had a handful of suicide attempts in my life and nobody knew I was even feeling depressed, not even my closest family members. A step-uncle was travelling with his girlfriend in Italy over a decade ago in his late 20s and she said that right up until the moment she found his body hanging from a bridge near their campsite, he'd been nothing but happy and excited about the rest of the trip.

       This all does seem to be a bit of a stretch. I agree with you in that depression is very easy to hide, I get depressed easily, but I'm able to hide it when I'm out with family or friends, I'll laugh and have a good ole time, but waking up the next day it can be in full affect. Being alone, and possibly under the influence of alcohol or drugs, can worsen the state of depression and probably cause someone to make a decision to end it all.

       I want to believe, but the narrative of Cornell and Bennington exposing Pedogate doesn't make any sense. There's no evidence for such a belief. These guys are puppets of the music industry and had to pay a certain toll to get to their level of fame. If anything, they are probably abusers themselves. Their double suicides are still very suspicious. However, the white hat Illuminati-insider cliche has never been true. There is no such thing.

       You're totally going to have to source where they "debunked" a video that shows absolutely nothing of value. There are no faces. There are no visible people. There is no physical location visible. All there is is what sounds like a child screaming, and a man yelling at said child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm super curious to see how this was debunked. Once again, please source it.

       i agree that the video is fishy and worldcorp is even more shady.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, nobody asked you to prove it’s not Podesta. They just asked how you know the video has been debunked. if you know for a 100% fact that it’s bullshit, that’d be a good piece of evidence to share with the community. Since you said it is an “infamous” debunked video, it shouldn’t be too hard to point him in the direction of the infamous debunking.

       Do some research on Worldcorp and see how you feel about it, and I mean that in a totally serious and non condescending way
      </p>
      <p>
       They release videos like that all the time and have been for awhile. They post videos that they've created (like this one) on 4chan and act creeped out about it until members of the discord group they have advertised on their site show up in the thread and start calling out OP on the bullshit. They claimed they made this video and were posting this video on 4chan a long time before pizzagate happened and never once said a word about John Podesta. Then the emails came out, suddenly they're claiming it's John Podesta (after previously claiming they made it). They've never once offered any sort of evidence linking it to John Podesta, and 30 minutes of research on Worldcorp will show you they aren't exactly pioneers of justice and truth. They're literally /x/ shitposters

       There is enough of a conspiracy with the Clinton thing that I'm not sure why we have to throw in him being the bastard of Podesta. This will be the talking point that discredits the whole thing.

       Everything is well put together but You shot your self in the foot by claiming Chester is Podesta’s father.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connection you wrote about with McGovern campaign is basically, Podesta travels a lot at this time so he might of hook up with Chester’s Mom somewhere. This followed by you saying that they don’t really look a like at the same age blows your other extremely convincing arguments away Early.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not leave it out? Along with your argument that his account could of been hacked. If the tweet happened before his death then it would be extremely unlikely for various reasons. I fact it would be more believable to say the whole tweet was a typo.

       This holds no ground, it just makes me feel bad for Chester real dad! If anything it was David Geffen that had Chris and Chester's passing.
