<p>Could you imagine if we lived in a world where you had to pay for a subscription to view a certain website with out restriction.</p>

<p>The only reason Internet companies want net neutrality isnt because they care about the rights of the citizens gaining full access to free and open Internet. It&#39;s because they don&#39;t want to lose traffic they don&#39;t want to lose money and they really really don&#39;t want to lose the control of the Internet space they have..</p>

<p>They are lying about the reasons why they want it, and that&#39;s well what companies do, they are never straightforward, and Isp&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be stupid enough to cause a subscription model because there would be always atleast one isp who will give unthrottled access and everyone would sign up to them.</p>

<p>At the end of the day nn or no nn the Internet will stay the same. And if it did change, then tor and the dark Web would become the popular choice </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing. People don&#39;t act rationally when they&#39;re upset and angry (Charlottesville for example) people can rise up, and be methodical and organized. Pissing people off has alienated people who would have otherwise supported burning it all down, metaphorically speaking. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t really say, I know Bernie supporters were prepared to hold her feet to the fire, and if anything, she wouldn&#39;t want to alienate the people who voted for her. People really did vote for her base on the fact it&#39;d be a vote against Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to have seen some major changes in the whole redistricting that serves to benefit the Republicans. I really don&#39;t agree with gerrymandering, but my opinion isn&#39;t gonna change that. </p>

<p>Flipping shit is no way to go about change, imo. I really don&#39;t like the idea that pissing off your fellow countrymen is an achievement. His son has called democrats unamerican or inhuman. We really can&#39;t afford that divisiveness right now. </p>

It would be insulting if it was some portmanteau where people combine liberal with retard to make &quot;libtard&quot; or conservative with, whatever would be an insult to go along with it.

<p>If your entire ISP drastically slows down at prime time, their nodes are extremely oversold and they need to expand their local infrastructure. They do not have enough bandwidth to keep up with customer demand, and it would slow down the same if everyone was on Netflix, or if everyone split their traffic to Twitch, Hulu, YouTube, pornhub, Pandora, Spotify, and the near-infinite list of other content. Your slowed connection is perfectly acceptable to your ISP, and is covered in your ToS or contract as &quot;up to&quot; X speed.</p>

<p>The free market solution here is for you to change ISPs. Why would anyone want to pay an ISP that doesn&#39;t have enough bandwidth to support all their customers?  Obviously a competing ISP will provide a solution to this, they&#39;ll be sure to have enough bandwidth, just like a competing ISP is the answer if your ISP started blocking sites or charging tiered plans. If you don&#39;t vote with your dollar and use a different ISP, you acknowledge that you&#39;re okay with an ISP that promises more than they can deliver and this didn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that? Your local competition isn&#39;t a very good answer? The DSL gets advertised speed 24/7 but is an order of magnitude slower than your ISP at its worst? The LTE provider only gets half signal in your house? Your apartment building has an exclusive contract with your ISP? Don&#39;t worry, repealing NN is going to spark more competition any day now, because it&#39;s what was stopping new ISPs from competing right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t true at all.  Netflix wasn&#39;t throttled, the ISP just stopped opening new nodes for them when their traffic spiked because they were unwilling/unable to reciprocate with upstream traffic.  You honestly don&#39;t seem to know what you are talking about.  </p>

<p>Companies are already charged for their use of bandwidth... Did you mean to use a different word here? I&#39;m trying to think of a replacement that fits, but nothing comes to mind, which makes me think that you have the concept of Net Neutrality wrong.</p>

<p>Net Neutrality limits things so that ISP&#39;s can&#39;t charge based off of what type of content you are viewing, only based off of bandwidth and pipe speed. In the same way that an electricity company can&#39;t charge you more for using a Samsung refrigerator over a GE one.</p>

<p>Net Neutrality was the status quo for much of the internet&#39;s existence, but it was just a hazy general agreement, which is why people pushed to get it codified into a standard. Net Neutrality advocates want to make sure the internet stays how it always was. As for ISP&#39;s never doing something like this, you may want to look at ISP&#39;s in a country that <a href="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5a1471fa3dbef4a7748b711a-1400/screen%20shot%202017-11-21%20at%20103429.png">doesn&#39;t have net neutrality</a>. It&#39;s absolutely a possibility. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are incredibly few areas in the U.S. with any sort of competition in the broadband sector. Most people aren&#39;t exactly able to just stop using a given ISP. As well, you may want to look in the mirror about corporate boot licking when you want to give service providers the ability to hold internet access hostage on their direct competitors. Comcast is in the video over IP business, they shouldn&#39;t also have control over their customers&#39; ability to view competitors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Net Neutrality and net neutrality are two different things.  It&#39;s like the difference between Affordable Care and actually affordable care.  I think we agree on what the internet should be, we just don&#39;t agree on how to get there.  There is a power struggle happening between content providers and service providers.  I think that the market needs to more forcefully inject itself into this struggle.  The idea that &quot;we can&#39;t change service providers&quot; entirely undermines our strength as the driving force behind the market.  I <strong>hope</strong> by allowing ISPs more freedom with how they deal with data new and innovative services will be offered which can help create competition that is very lacking.  The debate should also not stop at the ISPs.  The content providers are GIANTS and their practices are <strong>just as shady</strong> as what people fear the ISPs will do.  A <strong>lot</strong> of what we are seeing in regards to NN is propaganda put out by the content providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and even Reddit) because they are trying to protect their own bad business practices.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a simple debate.  The internet <em>should</em> be &quot;neutral&quot; but Net Neutrality isn&#39;t (in my opinion) the path to that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are still a ton of regional laws that stifle competition. This affects WISPs less, but they have their own issues too. Both point to point fixed wireless and cellular data have major issues in metro areas. Cell towers don&#39;t have enough bandwidth/coverage for existing cell traffic, let alone a large expansion to home traffic. Buildings and interference give point to point troubles, vastly limiting coverage.</p>

<p>Rural areas don&#39;t have these issues, but already suffer much more from a lack of hard line options, meaning new WISPs have less competition to worry about. Hard line ISPs typically avoided rural areas because the infrastructure cost was too high compared to subscriber density, and the data freedom change you mention isn&#39;t going to make infrastructure suddenly cost less.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s definitely not a simple debate, and I think virtually everyone can agree the internet should be neutral. Personally, I think NN was helping in that regard, but don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the ultimate solution. Repealing it entirely doesn&#39;t make competition instantly spring into place, and leaves customers with no guarantee of neutrality while we wait to see what competition comes from it. IMO, a better solution would be to address the specific aspects of NN that you (or others) feel were stifling competition, changing or removing them while leaving some of the consumer protections in place.</p>

<p>As competition increases these regulations can be revisited, and if competition renders them moot remove them then.</p>

<p>Well, technically the FCC could&#39;ve issued an order that amends it, or repealed it and instituted a new order at the same time if too much needed changed. It&#39;s the same authority that let them repeal it without involving congress.</p>

<p>From a practical standpoint, <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/114/BILLS-114hr-PIH-OpenInternet.pdf">this bill</a> was passed around congress by Republicans in early 2015, and could&#39;ve served as a basis for a revised FCC order. It had regulations to ensure neutrality with clear limits on the FCC&#39;s authority.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say a regulatory vacuum is a good thing, personally. NN codified the guidelines that have been behind a neutral internet for years. I find it hard to believe that every single aspect of NN was stifling ISPs, and repealing any that weren&#39;t only serves to potentially hurt consumers. The mere announcement of an FCC vote on NN was enough to bring discussion to the forefront, which would&#39;ve been an excellent time to have meaningful discussion on it. </p>

<p>Some did, it just wasn&#39;t very common. An example would be AT&amp;T blocking facetime over their cell network unless you had the more expensive Mobile Share plan. Another example was Comcast around 2009 blocking VPNs unless you had the @Home Pro or a business plan. Of course, those policies went over like a lead balloon and would catch even more scorn in the current climate.</p>

<p>The horror story of ISPs following Portugal&#39;s tiered pricing isn&#39;t something that would just pop up. It&#39;s theoretically possible with NN repealed, but it&#39;s a scary bogeyman that&#39;s only a distant possibility. Realistically, one of the first steps we might actually see is for an ISP to start traffic shaping specific protocols and domains. These wouldn&#39;t be a sudden block or even a crippling throttle, they would be a gradual slowdown with plausible deniability to not raise public fury.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, Comcast could do this to Netflix to drive business to Hulu. Do a little sketchy routing to increase the latency and navigating the site gets less and less responsive. Deprioritize bandwidth, and now during peak hours 4k drops to 1080p. Nothing severe enough to make people question whether it might be intentional instead of just normal internet hiccups.</p>

<p>Of course, a big reason that&#39;s a potential problem is vertical integration. With Comcast owning a portion of Hulu, they would directly benefit from hurting Netflix. If ISPs had no stake in a specific content provider, they&#39;d have little reason to go after competing content providers. That&#39;s another discussion entirely, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last mile specifically refers to the final portion of the network that connects to your house. Netflix owns zero networks that connect to your house. The scope of the rules pretty clearly lays it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scope of the Rules</p>

<p>25 - The open Internet rules described above apply to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access service. Consistent with the 2010 Order, today’s Order applies its rules to the consumer-facing service that broadband networks provide, which is known as “broadband Internet access service (BIAS) and is defined to be:</p>

<p>A mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service, but excluding dial-up Internet access service. This term also encompasses any service that the Commission finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described in the previous sentence, or that is used to evade the protections set forth in this Part.</p>

<p>26 - As in 2010, BIAS does not include enterprise services, virtual private network services, hosting, or data storage services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The connection between ISPs and content providers isn&#39;t consumer-facing, so it clearly isn&#39;t considered a BIAS and is outside the scope of the rules. 26 then excludes content providers again, as a hosting or data storage service.</p>

<p>The only regulation that does concern the connection between ISPs and content providers is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>28 - Interconnection. BIAS involves the exchange of traffic between a broadband Internet access provider and connecting networks. The representation to retail customers that they will be able to reach “all or substantially all Internet endpoints” necessarily includes the promise to make the interconnection arrangements necessary to allow that access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That says that an ISP has to let customers reach the entire internet, through peering agreements, interconnects, and general transit. It doesn&#39;t put any maximum price or lack of price on these agreements, and it doesn&#39;t force the terms to be the same for all agreements. It doesn&#39;t specify the speed/latency/priority of those connections either, just that ISP customers should expect to have access to the entire internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Netflix the service isn&#39;t a retail customer. Neither is Facebook, Twitter, or the Google empire. The full text of 30 makes this abundantly clear, specifically citing Netflix and Google as examples of content providers involved in interconnect disputes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three factors are critical in informing this approach to interconnection. First, the nature of Internet traffic, driven by massive consumption of video, has challenged traditional arrangements—placing more emphasis on the use of CDNs or even direct connections between content providers (like Netflix or Google) and last-mile broadband providers. Second, it is clear that consumers have been subject to degradation resulting from commercial disagreements, perhaps most notably in a series of disputes between Netflix and large last-mile broadband providers. But, third, the causes of past disruption and—just as importantly—the potential for future degradation through interconnection disputes—are reflected in very different narratives in the record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the individual offices for Google/Netflix/Etc may be retail customers of whatever ISP provides their office with internet access. Their ISP had to abide by NN rules like any other ISP. This only applies to their specific ISP and their retail relationship, so it doesn&#39;t mean all ISPs are subject to the NN rules when dealing with any aspect of Netflix.</p>

<p>I mean, obviously... Put an individual in that place, and it really shows why. You are a retail customer of your ISP, and that connection was subject to NN rules. A different ISP from another state isn&#39;t required to follow NN rules for your connection, how could they be? They don&#39;t operate the last mile connection to your house and you&#39;re not their customer, and they have no control over how your ISP manages its network.</p>

<p>Additionally, their service isn&#39;t hosted on their office last mile network, and their ISP&#39;s NN rules only apply to that connection. For example, Netflix&#39;s services are hosted on their CDNs, which have their own ASN. An autonomous system must have transit agreements with other AS&#39;s in order to route traffic to and from the rest of the internet, they don&#39;t rely on an ISP to handle their routing. These agreements consist of peering and interconnects, which again are clearly, specifically excluded from the NN rules.</p>

<p>The same is true for small businesses. Local mom&#39;n&#39;pop is a retail customer of, say, Verizon&#39;s fiber and Verizon had to provide them internet access that followed NN rules. Mom&#39;n&#39;pop also has a website, which can go a few different ways. One, they pay for AWS or another provider to host their website for them, on AWS servers. As a hosting service, it&#39;s specifically excluded from NN&#39;s scope. Two, they pay Verizon for a static IP and a ToS that allows them to host their own server on this connection. This is again a hosting service, much like paying a data center to colocate a server, and is still excluded. Three, they pay a 3rd party to handle hosting the site and all maintenance.  Seeing a trend here? Another hosting service that is still outside of NN&#39;s scope.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just say &quot;well businesses have an ISP too so every US ISP has to follow NN rules for them.&quot; There&#39;s no ambiguity on this in the order.</p>

<p>I find it hard to imagine that these companies are really bothered about net neutrality, beyond the bad press they would get if they didn&#39;t publicly support it.

    <div class="md"><p>You have an odd take on this, and your suspicion is looking at the wrong parties, at least related to NN.</p>

<p>I pay for my bandwidth... I pay extra to get a fast connection. Facebook and Google pay for theirs... massive amounts for massive, fast connections. Thus, when I access Google or Facebook, I have a good experience.  Everyone has paid for the resources they are using, and the system works. Net Neutrality protects this arrangement.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you know what a protection racket is. Mafia loved to run these scams on business owners. Pay us a &quot;protection fee&quot;, and we guarantee nothing will happen to your store. Of course, if you failed to pay, it was mafia goons that would come in and bust stuff up.</p>

<p>This is exactly what certain ISPs have been doing to content providers. They demand a fee, and if the content providers don&#39;t pay, they &quot;bust up the store&quot;... they throttle the traffic from THAT provider, so the service sucks, and they start to lose customers. Its a protection racket.</p>

<p>Comcast was doing this to Netflix. It absolutely sucked for me as a consumer, because Comcast is the ONLY choice for fast bandwidth I have. I knew what they were doing, but they are the only provider that services my area.</p>

<p>So of course Google and Facebook don&#39;t want to pay protection money. Protection rackets are illegal in real life, and WERE illegal online until Net Neutrality was repealed. </p>
