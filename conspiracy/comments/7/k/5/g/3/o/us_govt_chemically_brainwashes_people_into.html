    <div class="md"><p>Well I moved from St. Petersburg Russia to AZ, USA when I was 9. Over time I felt like I could no longer concentrate on my thoughts and began to lose focus. My energy levels began to decline and as I got into my late teens I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, I just never felt &quot;right&quot; in USA. Most of the people that I have ever met in USA just felt like they were all wearing masks and instead of having their own thoughts would just parrot things they heard on tv or that is said by other people. </p>

<p>As I grew older I realized I had certain inclination for sensing energy in people after going on several spiritual journeys with dmt/mushrooms. I have always been able to feel peoples emotions and auras/energy (all people feel it to a certain degree) since I was very young I just did not know what I felt or how to utilize it. Well after traveling around Russia and Europe during my college years I had realized that the energy that people put off in EU and other countries was completely different than USA. People here feel like they are being drained of positive energy and negative ego energy fills this void. None of this is esoteric or new age bs, when a person is around different people he/she feels different inside eg; more energetic around some people, uncomfortable and distressed around others. Some people like myself have this feeling but greatly amplified. The hardest part is knowing what you feel exactly and how to control it or use it. Anyways back to the story, the difference between how people think and act is very noticeable. </p>

<p>I started doing a lot of research, I am 27 now, so for the last 7 or so years. Half of the chemicals in our food and water are completely toxic to the body, brain, and mind. Some of them destroy good gut bacteria, some mess with the hormonal levels, some affect neurotransmitters negatively, and some calcify parts of your brain and other glands around your body. All of these things throw your body of its natural equilibrium states and your body has to fully adapt to these changes. This creates constant chaos which kills energy, memory declines, emotional states become erratic - some days you feel angry, depressed, uncomfortable, apathetic, distraught for barely any reason at all. The mind&#39;s ability to exert free will decreases, it takes A LOT more motivation to do things. Fear about life becomes more debilitating so you take less risks, are afraid to step up to authority like a revolution in USA is very improbable because of fear of feeling even worse than most people do now. So the government or our boss at a job just uses is and sticks it to us daily and we accept it because our minds are a mess and we cannot think clearly. </p>

<p>A lot of the chemicals that were introduced into our food and water were done right after ww1 and ww2. There are theories saying that most of what has happened in the last 300 years have been mainly experiments conducted by the elite rulers. They introduce different chemicals and look for ways to control the population with more ease. The scary and sad part is that a lot of the damage caused by the food and water is irreversible or can only be decreased. You will never get back your prime and ideal health unless people with secret healing powers actually exist, but I would not put my money on that. Also many of the medications and drugs the pharmaceutical industry gives out also have irreversible damage and mess up our health even more, while treating some of the symptoms so we convince ourselves its ok to take them. Il add more if I think of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have learned that as well. I was very sad to find out on a recent trip to Russia that a lot of the same chemicals are being used in food now there as well, and possibly in many other places in the world. I think its the number one reason mental illness is becoming rampant in the world. Sub consciously we all feel like there is something very wrong with this world and how we feel. It is why I decided not to have kids, the future of this planet is looking very bleak. Feeling miserable while having to work 50+ hours a week in a shitty job to buy things you do not even care about, while living in a state of thought control and surveillance. The only escape is to move somewhere like a village where the community supports itself. Grows natural food, natural water, away from pollution, away from people that are manipulative sociopaths. No one cares about anybody else in the western world except very few. Even most marriages are done because of money and status, followed by divorce and alimony payments/miserable lawyer meet ups. Modern day slavery is a very real thing that we are experiencing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i totally feel similar. one thing that made things better for me is when i moved to a more rural place after living in Los Angeles. its so much better and calmer here, i would highly suggest doing this.</p>

<p>other than that, i am trying to leave US - possibly go to Australia or any other place. Was looking at Canada but the more I learn about it the more it seems its quite similar to US (altho still much better)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my friends moved to japan and has been trying to get me to move with him. I was considering Canada or New Zealand as well. It is a very tough decision though, and the amount of effort I would have to put in to all of this is enormous. Ideally I would like to sell everything I have(or rent out) and move somewhere where I could live off of that money so I wouldn&#39;t have to get a full time job. Maybe even a village or community somewhere where I would just grow my own crops and live with family/friends.
Also talking to Americans about this is tough because they were born into this and think this is normal. Many are convinced food and water right now are the highest quality and most pure it has ever been. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol it&#39;s LA that explains everything. </p>

<p>Seriously though I&#39;m starting to wonder if Cali has more of whatever creates this behavior than in other areas of the country. I went to elementary school in the bay area and people were generally somewhat assholes. Later on I moved to PA and people seemed so much nicer there. It took me a while to adjust because my base instinct was to be an asshole as self defense.</p>

<p>Also both areas I lived in were relatively wealthy so it probably had nothing to do with socio-economic factors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;d said on another thread that it amazed me for people to see the shit going on in this world and they&#39;re still talking about having a family. Why the fuck would anybody drag innocent lives into this shithole if they know even half of the stuff going on?! </p>

<p>I never wanted kids and I&#39;m happy of that. But I&#39;m also not having kids because I&#39;m not passing down my health problems to a kid and I&#39;m also not dragging kids into a world I fucking despise more and more with each passing day. I&#39;m thankful for who/what I have in my life. But outside of that, damn, I&#39;m fucking miserable. This existence is just a nightmare. I&#39;m putting all my energies into not coming back here. That&#39;s what I&#39;m ready to fight tooth and nail over because this world&#39;s never gonna be a paradise. That hope died a long time ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am happy you understand my reasoning and viewpoint although it kills me inside knowing that more and more people are experiencing only misery and suffering from this human life. Most people have lost the ability to see the big picture or to look far ahead, and it seems like another few generations of children will have to live through this hell. Deep down I can feel that if things took a different path than they did, this life could have been actually worth living and fighting for. When you separate from this diseased human ego/mind, the world really is a majestic place. If consciousness really is infinite maybe one day we will wake up to a life opposite of this one, being fulfilled and blissful all of the time. At least one can hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is becoming worse, also as an example, the areas that are fluoridated (google a map of areas that have fluoride in the water) and sprayed with chemicals more are the more populated areas. Almost all other countries do not allow fluoride in water because they think it is too dangerous. Food is also genetically altered and injected with countless chemicals, pesticides, hormones, and whatever else. So areas where a lot of people have to be fed or areas where people cannot grow their own food end up having to eat only this mass produced &quot;food&quot;. Humans also pick up on energy they are surrounded with and become more like it. In bigger cities there is more sociopathy, more misery, more manipulation, less love and trust between people. You feel all of that and that influences how you feel, act, and behave. It subconsciously changes you into experiencing a different reality than if you lived in a small town or a village. </p>

But I would highly suggest asking a guru (a god if you&#39;d like, find one associated with healing) for help healing whatever has been fucked up in your system if you feel that way. You can do this through a very deep meditation and binaural audio beats in the 0-2 beats per second range. </p>

<p>You can use an app I created to do this: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.productions.dz.brainwaver&amp;amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.productions.dz.brainwaver&amp;amp;hl=en</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe this idea of end times was created by the ruling elite to subconsciously change us and kill off hopes for the future and to manipulate us. Just a thought though because the world does look very bleak right now, most people have lost all good reasons to live and now live just for power, money, drugs, and all things material. Constantly worried about paying off debts, being in line so police or government does not see them as an enemy, worried about getting fired from their miserable job where they spend nearly all of their time.

<p>The data analysis provided fresh evidence of suffering among white Americans. Recent research has highlighted the plight of less educated whites, showing surges in deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, liver disease and alcohol poisoning, particularly among those with a high school education or less. The new report did not break down suicide rates by education, but researchers who reviewed the analysis said the patterns in age and race were consistent with that recent research and painted a picture of desperation for many in American society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have seen a few similar articles. You would think with us having so much knowledge about life, nature, survival, and having such advanced technology we would be able to create a life worth living for all people... At least in 1st world countries that claim to be leading humanity forward. Instead we get more sociopaths that manipulate each other and humanity than ever. People eating things that should not even be classified as food, and 70%+ of the country living paycheck to paycheck in misery and debt. Fun times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one wanted to increase it, as the human body and mind was altered this was the adaptation that it made to survive. Also its not full on sociopathy but sociopath-like behavior as in having no empathy. Bosses treating workers like crap, insurance being denied and the hospital no longer does the procedure for the person, someone asks for money on the street and we ignore them because we do not actually care what happens and assume it will not even go to helping them. Greed is a sociopathic trait, making a living off of others&#39; slave labor and not caring. Fathers or mothers neglecting or abandoning their children. People wanting to kill or imprison Edward Snowden for releasing info that the government has been overreaching even though it was for those peoples&#39; benefit. There are very many examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen it happen in workplaces. Not saying that my employer was increasing sociopathy, but they encouraged distrust and infighting amongst co-workers. It was particularly Orwellian. We had mandatory training meetings instructing us to rat out our co-workers for any small discretion especially where it might affect or interfere with management. They paid people doing the same job with the same levels of experience different rates. They isolated workers as much as possible from the way tasks were assigned to the actual layout of workspaces. They would pass around memos reminding of us how expendable we were by providing a list of violations that would result in termination, and reminding us they were an at-will employer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically many crusades against drugs and alcohol have been by industrialists concerned about worker shortages or lost productivity.  They worry that workers would rather be drunk or high and poor than work in their factories (and of course still be poor).</p>

<p>In fact, I had a conversation with someone who knew a business owner in Colorado that was complaining that his workers now were all lazy and unproductive because they smoked pot all the time.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there was a manufactured backlash at some point where businesses started arguing for re-criminalizing pot because the rewards of employment (even good employment) -- money for consumerism -- on balance is less rewarding than a subsistence income and getting high.</p>

<p>I generally think this is less about the appeal of drugs than the nature of work, workplaces and power imbalances in working, and probably the lack of wage growth and barely-make-ends-meet pay levels.</p>

<p>Generally I think the corporate/employer class wants workers who <em>aren&#39;t</em> crazy, sick or high because they&#39;re not productive.  It&#39;s why offices are filled with free coffee and the super high achievers are snorting coke in the bathroom.</p>

<p>I mean, they&#39;re good at dumping junk bonds or selling crap, not in choosing pharmaceuticals.  Coke is good enough as a drug at least in the short term, and its popularity and status among their peer group gives it added value.</p>

The people who started adding such chemicals to food, water, and convincing people that big pharma drugs are the cures they need really deserve the worst punishments imaginable.

<p>You are what you eat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Couldn&#39;t agree more! </p>

<p>I have a bad stomach, runs in the family. 3 years ago I decided to eat clean/healthy (high protein, good fats[nuts/eggs] and low carbs), exercise and lose weight. I lost 60lbs, and put on a good few lbs of muscle. My stomach issues almost completely disappeared. The issues will never go away completely, but a few days a month sure beats several days a week. My energy went up considerably too. A year ago I stopped sticking to my diet. My stomach issues have returned and are arguably worse, I&#39;ve put on 30lbs and my have far less energy.</p>

<p>Two days ago I returned to my healthy diet. In two days my stomach issues have improved noticeably and my energy has increased considerably. Didn&#39;t even know what to do with myself when I came home from work today, normally I nap for 2-3 hours. Today I went to the store, sorted the dishes, cleared snow, made dinner and visited my parents, all before 8PM. </p>

<p>That said, 5 years ago I moved from Scotland to Canada. As far as I can recall my stomach issues weren&#39;t nearly as bad in Scotland, while my diet was arguably even worse and my stress levels were higher. Further, I&#39;ve noticed an odd number of people seem to have stomach/gastrointestinal issues here, more than I ever encountered in Scotland. Maybe I&#39;m just imagining things but it makes me wonder if perhaps it&#39;s something to do with the food in North America. </p>

<p>Diet for anyone interested: Eggs, nuts (I like cashews personally), chicken, rice, asparagus (really nice friend in balsamic vinegar and ground black pepper), leafy greens, fruit salad, protein shakes, sushi, seaweed salad and yogurt. Mostly anyway. Sometimes I&#39;ll throw in some pork and some different vegetables. I usually avoid beef, for some reason beef seems to exacerbate my stomach issues, as does bread/other wheat products. </p>

There&#39;s no explanation I can give. I wasn&#39;t attractive, I was the quiet bookworm stereotype. Yet I&#39;d meet these people that seemed to have an axe to grind for no reason. </p>

<p>There was one bitch in a class of mine in high school, I tried my damndest to be nice to her and her friends. It was a wasted effort. Anyway, one day she had offered me a piece of candy. THANKFULLY I turned it down. The bitch laughs and says it was a piece she had dropped on the floor. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO SOMEBODY?! My fucking goodness, I still wonder to this day what she would&#39;ve done if I had taken the piece and put it in my mouth. Just laugh with her friends about it and keep quiet about? Announce to the whole class I&#39;d just eaten a piece of candy off the floor and how gross I am for doing so? Would she still boldy tell me she had dropped it on the floor? Idk</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just a one story. I could write a book on why I&#39;m a misanthrope as an adult. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been depressed since I was 11. My anxiety has kicked in majorly over the last few years. Artificial sweeteners were making an already bad situation worse. I know what I&#39;m talking about. I didn&#39;t pull that off of a youtube video. I went through it. I&#39;d practically jump out of my skin if I heard the slightest noise. That wasn&#39;t me. I&#39;d never done that before. That stopped once I stopped using the shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had stomach problems practically my whole life. I&#39;d get these really awful burps and end up barfing. Needless to say, I&#39;m rather OCD with my foods these days. I honestly eat practically the same things every single day of my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. I was much happier in relative poverty (by Western standards) in Soviet Union than I EVER was in USA. Why? USA doctrine brainwashes you to think the only way to measure happiness is money/achievement. BULLSHIT! That&#39;s only true in American society.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons that make a person happy are PEOPLE. People in Russia are simpler, nicer, genuine. Americans are cunts, pure and simple. Nation of people who treat each other like SHIT.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man here&#39;s just a few things to consider that I think will really help:
-yea, Americans can be mean, especially in area&#39;s of high inequality and with diverse populations. Both of these are proven to increase violence. It wasn&#39;t you, and many, many North Americans really love Russians. 
As you get older and expand your social circles you&#39;ll realize people are a lot less mean than high-schoolers.
-Beinf treated bad and being kicked down on the social hiarchy is known as Social Defeat. We can only hand so much social defeat and it&#39;s proven to cause significant psychological distress.
-Yea the food can be bad, buts it&#39;s not the Govt. There&#39;s no evidence the government is out to get you and even if there was what use is it to blame your problems on someone else? 
-Also think of it this way, the Median income and the financial mobility rates are much much higher in the U.S than they are currently in Russia. So that&#39;s something you can be thankful for, and seeing as how you&#39;ll get more money and advancement for your work here that means you are likely to be able to afford much better food than somewhere else. It&#39;s likely your access to good food would be even worse somewhere else.
-Mental health problems tend lay dormant in childhood and tend to only manifest in teenage years. It&#39;s likely it wasn&#39;t the food in the U.S but just something latent in you that you became more susceptible to do to the distress you experienced after moving here causing symptoms to manifest. 
-Healthy eating, heavy weight training &amp; high intensity cardio &amp; breathing exercises ala Yoga do wonder to reduce your symptoms and increase mental clarity. It&#39;s a must if you&#39;re experiencing problems. The brain is highly plastic and can repair itself.
-If even after trying everything, like really everything you can do, and you really can&#39;t handle it anymore: Don&#39;t be afraid to try pharmaceutical intervention. We&#39;re rather you alive than dead. You can always stop taking it if it doesn&#39;t help and there&#39;s been some quite effective advancements in the pharmacology as of recent and they have really helped me people. I would again still recommend it as a last resort.
-Don&#39;t be afraid to move back to Russia or even somewhere else if you&#39;re not happy in the U.S. 
-Don&#39;t be afraid to see a mental health professional, get some counseling. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been shown to be quite effective.</p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;re starting to figure things out here in your adulthood, getting a handle on your diet and noticing major improvements is common but not easy. You should be proud.</p>

<p>Really I think you should try to reconsider your hypothesis that govts are trying to poison us on purpose. Think of Hanlon&#39;s razor:  &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot;</p>

<p>Resenting and blaming society and the government is really really counter-productive. You have to take ownership of your life and do what needs to be done to make you happy and well.</p>

<p>Btw: I experienced the same thing in highschool, I changed to a new school, (this was in Canada though, and I had a pretty decent diet) started having problems with focus and motivation, and for awhile in my early adulthood I thought the same thing. I started to do the things I outlined and worked on my perspective and my health, well being, and happiness just went through the roof. People started noticing and I slowly moved up the social ladder and it was awesome. I still sometimes have bad dreams about highschool but most of the time I couldn&#39;t even be bothered. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hey also I was thinking that with the stomach problems, etc, maybe it&#39;s your gut microbiome. You should try traveling back home to where you grew up and eat some dirt (lol seriously)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents were always really good at feeding us home-cooked meals, and for some reason other kids in school were always asshole-ish. </p>

<p>I also lived in the country where we drank well water as opposed to the water that was in the city. City water always tasted weird to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it is exactly, but there is some weird shit that happens in the cities. I&#39;m not exactly sure what&#39;s up with this place, but there are many of us out here who are aware of how bad some shit is (and we&#39;re not dicks).</p>

<p>Also, I observed that anyone perceived as &quot;different&quot; in the US is treated fucking terribly. One of my classmates was a slavic immigrant and everyone was really terrible to him. I wish I had gone out of my way more to tell him to not worry about them, but I also worried about the mean kids being dicks to me in school because that&#39;s kinda the way high school seemed to work.</p>

<p>Within a couple of months of moving to US I noticed there was something weird with my mental state - I didn&#39;t feel &quot;all there&quot; or like &quot;myself&quot; - which was scary and frightening. Never felt like that in Russia - there I felt pretty crystal clear throughout my whole life and had a happy childhood. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I go through phases where I feel very similar to that, just very disconnected and hazy. I used to be able to read a book and could remember quite accurately what page number a certain event took place. I&#39;m looking forward to leaving the country to see how it effects my health and behavior. Being bombarded by EMF all day, drinking fluoridated water, and ingesting pesticide/herbicide ridden food has a substantial effect on our health, that coupled with constant propaganda and advertising makes it very difficult to think clearly and independently.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think America has been pounded by malicious conspiracies for decades, as those who hang out in this sub become aware about.  It’s difficult to detect something when it’s all you have ever known, though. </p>

<p>I grew up near the Mexican border and visited occasionally.  Even with the poverty and corruption, ppl seemed much more engaged with each other socially just a few miles away. I remember a family that moved and moved back bec the kids did not like it at all. One thing that stood out was how ppl lived their daily lives. In Mexico ppl would be outdoors on their porches talking up neighbors or walking to corner shops for their dinner ingredients in the evenings.  In America ppl would come home and watch tv. ‘Very boring,’ was the complaint of the kids that made their parents move back to Mexico.  </p>

<p>It’s really a clever trick to seduce ppl with material success and the appearance of ‘a better life’, while robbing them of intangible riches such friendship, compassion, simple joy of living.  It takes a long time to see through the dazzle when you are being programmed to value things that will leave us cold and empty.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mexico is very cool and the middle class has been growing over the decades that US has been declining.  Ppl work to meet daily needs, more than as a goal in itself for meaning and success.  Family is much more important and dependent on each other, even to extended relatives, there’s a sense of responsibility for each other. I think all these things are protective; whereas US had ‘rugged individualism’, which is more self centered and ppl are on their own, more vulnerable  in my opinion. </p>

<p>I think you underestimate poverty in other countries to say Americans ‘aren’t even that rich,’ particularly poorer countries.  It’s an attractive package, but is missing some parts. </p>

<p>The price is definitely higher than anyone really realizes until it’s too late. Here we are n our lovely homes with multiple cars but our kids were raised by others in their tender years, schools wasted them and betrayed parents not only in education but indoctrinating in the same false values.  But, I must say I’m glad millennials are sticking it to capitalism.   Maybe there hope. </p>
