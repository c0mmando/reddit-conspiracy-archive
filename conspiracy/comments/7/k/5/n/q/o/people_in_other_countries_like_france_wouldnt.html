       Walmart came to Germany, treated the German workers same as American workers, German Unions raised hell and kicked them out! Walmart had to leave Germany!

      <p>
       Only explanation for Americans quietly taking all the shit pulled on them like scam education, healthcare, prisons is because they are chemically treated and half-brain dead!

       I agree, and am from the US. The French kick ass (although, I do not agree with Socialism). If you piss the common French off, they show you hell. We could learn a thing or two here. We are taught the French are week, though. By design... I always give this example between Euros, and Americans. Euros kick the canister back at the police, while Americans, scatter like cockroaches. We are a young nation/people. Halp....

       right. thats because punishments for any actions against the Gestapo police in USA are absolutely draconian, so the American population is terrified of them, while in Europe they are NOT.

       European police are only carrying batons and gas into riots. In America our police have M-16 machine guns with rubber bullets and a magazine of real bullets should things get too out of hand.

       In France, you can be seriously harmed during a riot by the police, it doesn't prevent people to go on the street. Believe me, they can have M-16 machine, french would continue to go in the street.

       Half of the population believes that you should unequivocally listen to what police say. The president just said he wants to militarize the police and people are like, yaaaaasssss kween.

       Maybe the socialism is what makes the French tough. I assume they are healthier, have a better quality of living and there’s a sense of community there.

       No, they are far older, and have dealt with true tyranny (Socialism is another form of tyranny)... Then again, Communism makes people dead inside, and not care. We should institute Communism!!!

       Yes. What I mean was that I'm sure France overall is wonderful and I hope to visit some day, but that doesn't mean a major city like Paris doesn't have some issues.

       And I assume while you were there on business you explored the city and went into the bad areas that even locals avoid, much less tourists. You could go spend a week in Detroit and as long as you stayed in the area of your downtown hotel and the convention center/wherever you're doing business you'd think it was great. Every city has nice areas no matter how bad the worst areas are.

       I don't get how people are always denying the refugees in Europe aren't a problem; I saw a video of a woman in Paris walking down a street with all the Muslims staring and acting hostile, then she went into a cafe and was told to leave, she wasn't welcome without a male escort. That might be OK in Saudi Arabia, not in Paris. I saw a video of a couple white guys going into a "no go zone" in London and they got attacked simply for being present and white. But then people on here flat out deny that those things happened.

       Those videos are bullshit.  You don't see what happens before the camera is rolling.  These assholes do shit like go into musim neighborhoods and call them names, drive on the wrong side of the road, throw things at them etc, THEN they turn the cameras on and play the victim.  And stupid people fall for not every time.  Ask yourself if a video is painting someone as too cartoonishly evil and stereotypical, of they are, it was almost certainly faked.  Also, consider the sources of these videos.  These people have an agenda just like the liberals, just like the zionists, and just like the kkk.  You're feeding yourself fake facts and it's brainwashing you.

       It's easy to make that conclusion when you make a few comparisons but that is not a complete examination. France has many of its own problems that in turn don't apply in the US and wouldn't fly. They also have a lot of similar problem as does every country.

       I can tell you that if a similar Trump, as Le Pen, would have been elected in France, people would have been in the street making a revolution, seriously. When Le Pen finished second ar the first round, many high schools, universities and people started riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time our government proposed a law that people didn't approved, thousands people went on the streets during an entire year, unions blocked our oil refineries depriving the whole country of oil, they reduced the activity of our nuclear power plants. I've never seen such riots in the US, even against Trump, the riots last some weeks, with some placards.

       Australia is becoming like the usa where somehow the union is the bad guy and business is trying to help the avg person . Strong union means strong middle class .the death of unions is death of equity. I work Austin government and in middle of pay negotiation and this time had been different .every couple days a work email from management that looks like it has been written by a Fox news executive .the proganda for business against the union is huge . If I did not know better I would think that management was on our side and the union where against us .lucky I've been around long enough to know who is looking after me (drink post finish :) )

       Union have lost a lot of pwer over my 20 years but are still great at pay negotiation time and we have always done well. But I can see the weeker the union is the less rights the acg worker has. But area where union have no power they are seen as bad corrupt groups . A bit like trickle down economy bullshit

       Union only work if members work together against one or two employers for equal benefits (police ,nurse ).

       And this is why these nations in Western Europe are ultimately doomed. America has lots of problems but we aren’t an entitlement or nanny state yet. Once unions and government get their hooks in every aspect of life, you are slaves to government. They provide you the service and you vote to make sure said service is never cut or limited. Those same people are letting in an unending immigrant wave that will see Europe disappear as we know it within 100 years. These people will break your social welfare systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was the case in America, we would be an uncompetitive basket case. People already vote purely on handouts from the government and the continuation of the welfare state. If America had universal healthcare, it would be the only political issue. You could never limit government ever again or else ‘you are sentencing people to death!’. We would cease to be a superpower and the Puritan working spirit of the county would be gone forever.

       No, not at all. Most of America believes in this Puritan work ethic where we must toil for our keep, not expect handouts for merely being born here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entitlement does exist and it’s getting worse but the average American still expects to pay for their education and healthcare. Once we don’t have any skin in the game, I expect the situation here to get ugly. Entitlement brings out the worst in America.

       Chemically dociled is right. France and Germany stopped putting Fluoride in their water 30 years ago. They also don't take as many vaccines as Americans. All that poison addles the brain and makes people into obedient slaves.

       True, but the monarchy was ruling since like 500, and the country was populated and more concentrated. Native American tribes tended to keep to themselves. There's ancient history in Europe, while the US really has no ancient ruins. I just meant France has actually been a country since before the US and Great Britain. French monarchy was also older than the monarchy of Great Britain where the US founders came from. I think the history of both should be considered when you compare the reasons that caused the 2 revolutions and the events that boiled over to cause both.

       But the Government is older definitely, but the foundings are very far in age.

       If you look at Vietnam, the people has no guns........but every policemen and government officials realize they can't fuck with them. You know why?

       More like because things haven't gotten bad enough for an armed rebellion. There are lines that if crossed, there would be mass revolt. Crossing those lines usually involve violating our fundamental rights; so far that hasn't happened, the government pushes it but they know not to push to far, and what they've done hasn't called for going out and killing/getting killed yet. The quickest and easiest ways for us to get to that point would be trying to confiscate firearms; the other things I can think of aren't really realistic and would probably never happen outside of a dystopian movie.

       Man America is indeed particularly poisoned, but you must visit Europe, Australia, Asia and other regions to realize that the entire world is docile like that. America is actually a little unique, or once was, when people once believed in freedom there.. Most people are disarmed, all over the world. The whole world is like this

       In Australia I believe we have psychological and physical freedom whilst America just has physical freedom. Sure, in Australia, you can't own a gun (which many will argue is good as that limits the streets criminals from owning guns too, which it does, majority of their crimes are committed with knives). But in Australia, you also don't have to worry about going bankrupt because you got sick or going to jail for carrying weed. So America has physical freedom but they are still slaves in the mind.

       Australians are enslaved mentally by all kinds of things, just like Americans, Europeans, pretty much everyone. In China they are REALLY slaves in the mind. I see what you mean, in Australia I think people are free of
       <em>
        paranoia
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        fear of being unsafe

       but there are downsides to that as well. People have a tendency of becoming docile, weak, or lazy or even scared of nothing when they are that safe

       As an Australian myself what I've noticed is a kind of "comfortably numb."  There's an undercurrent of discontentment but not quite enough of it vs drive/energy to do anything about it.  People are generally quite docile and while they'll talk until the cows come home about certain issues, other ones are completely taboo and peer/social pressured off the discussion block.

       I believe that fluoride has a big part to do with making people docile.  The new legislation to make vaccines mandatory for kindergarten and primary school in Victoria is just going to make things worse and that's going to expand to high school, university and as many occupations as they can get into.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this propaganda about "herd mentality."  Most of us born before the 90s only had a few of the vaccines that are available now and the ones we had would have worn off.  So theoretically (probably more like literally) none of us have any "immunity."
      </p>
      <p>
       So for pre-90s people there is no "herd immunity" and yet I don't see any epidemic.

       There are 2 reasons for this imo.  1.  America is much more divided country.  And the government and corporations play to this division.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Amerians live too spread out.  While Europeans live mostly in densely populated cities.  Americans live so far out in the suburbs, and commute in cars.  So it becomes much harder to organize with each other.  If you look at NYC, they have thriving unions that don't put up with shit.

       The French? Tough? What?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many ways to describe the French but I don’t think tough is one of them. They are letting their country get overrun with migrants in the name of diversity. The implications of this are going to be very extreme if they don’t wake up and do something soon. I am all for helping people but it’s clear the intentions behind this massive migration wave isn’t for diversity, it’s for destabilization of the current society model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the French have extremely high tax rates. Didn’t they have problems with people leaving their country because they didn’t want to pay the taxes?

I saw a while back a politician suggested splitting the country in half and giving one half to the migrants lol, another one wanted to make the schools teach in Arabic, making French the 2nd language.

       Those are ethnically white homogeneous states. We are a divided people, it is harder to agree and get stuff done, constantly comparing the US to Denmark or similar countries is disingenuous. Plus reddit is always saying we should be even more diverse country like India or Africa. You either get homogeneous where we all look alike and understand and trust each other, or you get America where a 13% minority commits more than 50% of homocides. Diversified America is already easy to control since 1960 they have been shilling it hard and you ppl ate it up.

       But at least it's not in a national scale. US is a confederation. Some states go their own ways. In korea we're all gping through the exact same shit in every corner of the nation XD

       Exactly. There's a few countries where people are active in their resistance, demand rights, and have control over the things they feel sacred.  But the rest are just as corrupt, if not more corrupt than America.  It's the new world order coming to fruition

       In Australia I believe we have psychological and physical freedom whilst America just has physical freedom. Sure, in Australia, you can't own a gun (which many will argue is good as that limits the streets criminals from owning guns too, which it does, majority of their crimes are committed with knives). But in Australia, you also don't have to worry about going bankrupt because you got sick or going to jail for carrying weed. So America has physical freedom but they are still slaves in the mind.

       In France, you can be seriously harmed during a riot by the police, it doesn't prevent people to go on the street. Believe me, they can have M-16 machine, french would continue to go in the street.

       I believe that fluoride has a big part to do with making people docile.  The new legislation to make vaccines mandatory for kindergarten and primary school in Victoria is just going to make things worse and that's going to expand to high school, university and as many occupations as they can get into.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this propaganda about "herd mentality."  Most of us born before the 90s only had a few of the vaccines that are available now and the ones we had would have worn off.  So theoretically (probably more like literally) none of us have any "immunity."
      </p>
      <p>
       So for pre-90s people there is no "herd immunity" and yet I don't see any epidemic.
