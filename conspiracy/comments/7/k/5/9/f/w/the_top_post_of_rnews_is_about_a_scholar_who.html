    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t help the conspiracy community generally comes up with some of the most unrealistic ideas based off little to no evidence. </p>

<p>A lot of normal people will at least hear you out on 911 because we have a lot of evidence to back up the claim. Free falling building defying physics. Jet fuel making steel molten liquid...defying physics. (this one really gets to me bc I&#39;m a jeweler on the side and melt gold and silver for pouring and rolling out like once a week so I see heat on metal regularly)</p>

<p>But you have random people just saying things like oh the government is missing money but they don&#39;t really have any way to prove it.</p>

<p>I mean sure we have the missing money rumsfeld announced right before 911. But that&#39;s not something that&#39;s really common knowledge a lot of people don&#39;t remember the few days before 911 but they all remember 911. </p>

<p>Title is misleading. The $21 Trillion value is made up of accounting records, not actual spending. U.S. Money goes through treasury, and they&#39;re not going to write $21 Trillion in checks on the sly. What&#39;s really going on is shit-level bookkeeping. That could be due to mistakes like bad recording &amp; rounding. Or it could be blatant fraud on the public.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s as ridiculous as saying that chlorine gas is essentially the same chemical as table salt. Fluoride salts can be toxic at too high of a dose, yes, and we see that happening often from natural sources of fluoride minerals in wells or rivers, or from concentrated brick tea drunk by Central Asians. But the mechanism of fluoride toxicity is mostly from too many fluoride ions binding to calcium in bones and teeth. This is a <em>completely</em> separate issue from organofluorine chemistry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organofluorine_chemistry#Biological_role">and the bio-activity and/or toxicicty of a few certain organofluorine compounds</a>.</p>

<p>Sodium fluoride (NaF) and hexafluorosilicate salts (H3O)2SiF6 are inorganic compounds, and you can see from diagrams of their molecules that they are small and simple. Fluoxetine (C17H18F3NO) is an organic compound, with a big-ass, complicated molecule which can be classed as a phenol ether and a trifluoromethyl compound. It&#39;s been years since I took chemistry, but I can assure you, you have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Yes, I totally agree with you as well. Ever since we are born we are told there is always an authority on one subject or another. That their opinion is correct and the right opinion. There is always someone above you to tell you you&#39;re wrong. It is how our society has been structured.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s ridiculous to be too hard on them IMO. Most people at some point try to conform and fit in, typically by disparaging unconventional ideas; it&#39;s quite natural I think while one is still developping a personality. You can&#39;t expect all teenagers to <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/aristotle_100584">quote Aristotle.</a></p>

<p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t consider myself superior, as I&#39;ve had more time and opportunity to understand the world around me.</p>

<p>9/11
Sandy hook
Okc bombing 
Moon landing
Earth being flat
Jfk shooting
Fluoride in water 
Weather control
Mind control
London terror bombing
Boston marathon bombing
Madrid terror attack
Pulse shooting

Russia hacking election
Wikileaks 
Living in a 4th dimension
Government destroying economy on purpose
Nsa spying on citizens
Lizard people 
Aliens/area 51
Mind control (mk ultra)
Kim jong UN being a plant 
Chemtrails 
Elite/rich controlling government </p>

<p>And the list can go on.  Yes some of those things in the list turned out to be true, but not all of them.. Scepticism is healthy, and I love a good conspiracy theory as much as he next person, but if you find a conspiracy in every single event/disaster/attack with &#39;evidence&#39; to prove it then eventually people will stop paying attention due to the fact that it is statistically impossible for every single thing to be a conspiracy.. </p>

<p>You can always find &#39;evidence&#39; to support a view, flat earthers have relied on this for years.. Cherry pick studies and experiments that &#39;could&#39; cast some doubt and then hammer that home..</p>

<p>You can&#39;t throw 10 000 darts at a  board and then celebrate when you get a bull&#39;s-eye.   You guys may have been right about this and mk ultra and whatever else, but you aren&#39;t right all the time.. And that&#39;s why people don&#39;t take these things seriously..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree.. Some of them are clearly created and or true such as this missing money or mk ultra or whatever else.. My point remains though that if claims are made about every single event being scripted/created by the government or whatever,  it removed any legitimacy from the arguments because it is lumped in with everything else..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is anyone surprised?  I feel like the government is so huge and its finances are so complicated that it would surprise me if it was even possible to know how much money any one department has/spends, let alone the entire Federal government.  It&#39;s not like there&#39;s one bank account and somebody just forgot to write down a couple of checks or lost track of petty cash after buying the office pizza on Friday.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just doing basic math of dollars in - dollars out, once you get into the strange world of accounting it makes even less sense.  Tiny example -- I had a client who sold punch cards for their business.  The cards were $100 for 10 punches.  But the money only &quot;counted&quot; as income when someone used a punch.  They sold like 200 cards, so what do they do with $20,000 in real money while they wait for the cards to be punched?  Apparently the cards became a problem for time because about 1/3 of the cards were lost, leaving them with $6000 on the books somehow.</p>

<p>Anyway, this kind of shit plus the scale of the government -- what size of unaccounted spending is <em>actually</em> surprising?  Billions?  Trillions?  The federal budget is pushing $2 trillion, an error rate of +/- 10% is $200 billion dollars.</p>

<p>Honestly it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if some department had been mailing out thousands of checks a month for decades without realizing that there was no budget or actual money behind them, but because the checks said &quot;US Government&quot; the banks honored them and at the Federal Reserve check clearing center they just bundled them with all the other government checks and nobody realized that some department was basically printing money.</p>

<p>Someone with a nice suit, years in academia, and good communication skills can get away with a lot because &quot;they&#39;re the expert.&quot; And they usually are correct. It&#39;s the stuff they won&#39;t even mention systematically I worry about as much as the occasional lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Catherine Austin Fitts is definitely one of us.. she has stated openly that a lot of this money has gone into the SSP (Secret Space Program) and has called attention to concerns of this group creating their own breakaway civilization.
In answer to your main question though, I think that went up Friday night, right? Beginning of the weekend, that&#39;s why. That&#39;s the only time this kind of info goes to r/all. The shills clock out for the weekend, and the weekend staff is much smaller. Maybe there is a limit to their funds after all lol.. either way, that&#39;s something we need to keep in mind &amp; use as an advantage.</p>

I think a lot of the $$ is spent on tunnels below the Earth that connect large cities on continents. Just my opinion though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s as ridiculous as saying that chlorine gas is essentially the same chemical as table salt. Fluoride salts can be toxic at too high of a dose, yes, and we see that happening often from natural sources of fluoride minerals in wells or rivers, or from concentrated brick tea drunk by Central Asians. But the mechanism of fluoride toxicity is mostly from too many fluoride ions binding to calcium in bones and teeth. This is a <em>completely</em> separate issue from organofluorine chemistry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organofluorine_chemistry#Biological_role">and the bio-activity and/or toxicicty of a few certain organofluorine compounds</a>.</p>

<p>Sodium fluoride (NaF) and hexafluorosilicate salts (H3O)2SiF6 are inorganic compounds, and you can see from diagrams of their molecules that they are small and simple. Fluoxetine (C17H18F3NO) is an organic compound, with a big-ass, complicated molecule which can be classed as a phenol ether and a trifluoromethyl compound. It&#39;s been years since I took chemistry, but I can assure you, you have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>
