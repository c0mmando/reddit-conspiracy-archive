       I have come to the conclusion that people are generally dismissive due to a lack of education and that lack of education causes a further lack of attention span, most of these people are the type that go to homeopathic treatments when they get sick.

       Listen. I may get some hate for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a recent thread that I replied to providing information on how Marijuana has anti-tumor properties but many people within the thread keep saying "cancer".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tumors in the body, benign, malignant. Malignant means its a cancerous tumor, a cancerous tumor is NOT cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer is a whole different beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you 2 different cures for malignant tumors: Sodium dichloroacetate (Reactivates mitochondria in tumors causing the cells to go into apoptosis because mito knows the cell is compromised), and ELF generators (During Mitosis specifically, as the daughter cell is forming from the parent cell, spindles from both the daughter and parent cell try to rip the parent cell's replicated chromosomes, if they do this properly, they repair the other side of the chromosome and can continue to replicate, with that daughter going on to become a parent cell. An ELF generator being used during a tumor's growth stage would cause apoptosis, due to the polarity during spindle formation + chromosome splitting getting all fucked, ripping the chromosome improperly, forcing the parent cell to die (apoptosis) due to not being able to reconstruct its chromosome, and the daughter cell is unable to form because it never received a proper copy of the chromosome, death to both cells. 
o
Guess what, this isn't going to work on Multiple Myeloma, its not going to work on advanced testicular cancer, kidney cancer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now monoclonal antibodies, are a whole different thing, they can carry radioactive isotopes or cancer medicine directly to a target location/cell.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get a serious condition, go directly to a doctor. Everyone thinks the cure for cancer is hiding around the corner, it is: fire, but that won't save any lives. We have no current 100% cure for cancer, no matter what ANYONE tells you.

       Oh, also, If you'd like to know a third anti-tumor substance, ceramide, THC/CBD activates cb1 receptor, leading to sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase leading to the production of Ceramide,

       "Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Due to genetic and epigenetic alterations, malignant gliomas are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Mainstream therapeutic strategies for the management of these tumors are still mostly palliative, known to leave survivors with devastating neurological deficits, and frequently with a high risk of the disease recurrence. Significant alterations of a balance in the cannabinoid system between the levels of endogenous ligands and their receptors occur during malignant transformation in various types of cancer, including gliomas. Cannabinoids exert antiproliferative action in tumors. Induction of cell death by cannabinoid treatment relies on the generation of a proapoptotic sphingolipid ceramide, and disruption of signaling pathways crucial for regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. Increased ceramide levels also lead to ER-stress and autophagy in drug-treated glioma cells. Beyond inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, cannabinoids impair tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, and even gliomagenesis."

       So, I have been thinking. Who the real enemy is. And lets be real, the enemy to humanity, to the people ona global scale at this very time is a greedy capitalist. The 1% who control all the wealth. They successfully built a prison industrial complex, and are ready to automate everything, without social implications or planning. Meaning the people, everyone, humanity will face a dark time. Unless we band together and work on it, but thats filthy commie talk ay, noway should humans help each other. No, just the wealthy elite, everyone else can rot in the slum because they weren't born into money....

       I use scholar.google.ca and look for my own research immediately. You have access to all databases, maybe not all the papers, but if its peer reviewed its there.
