<p>An alleged 33rd degree mason talking about a major happening in the next few months possibly regarding aliens.  Someone posts a picture of a Mossad stamped handgun, and the thread 404&#39;s shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Picture:  <a href="https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1513/58/1513581194133.jpg">https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1513/58/1513581194133.jpg</a></p>

<p>/pol/ has way more threads than usual currently, users are saying in threads something weird is happening shortly before those get 404&#39;ed.  I&#39;m not saying this is real or not, but just how any mention of it is getting scrubbed and how there&#39;s a large spike in active threads may be indicative of this being looked at further in front of more eyes.</p>

I asked my recruiter if it was possible if they could move up my ship out date and he said more than likely since they&#39;ve been bumping people up to ship early all this month. From what i know, the Navy doesn&#39;t rush anything... Just my two cents.</p>

<p>Another point, many in Europe have access to guns, it&#39;s the ammo that&#39;s highly regulated, as well as specialized. Today, ballistics are incredibly specialized and take know-how to put together, whereas in 1776 you could practically melt down metal into a pellet by using a hole in the ground as a cast, and put enough black powder in the chamber to fire it the opposite way.</p>

<p>(3) The low-intensity conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan is ongoing, as it is designed to be.</p>

<p>(4) The U.S.-led operations in those countries are successful.</p>

<p>(5) Similar operations would work much better, from the armed forces&#39; perspective, with the battlefield being in North America. And they are planned to so stick around a few decades and you&#39;ll see it happen.</p>

<p>(2)  I don&#39;t understand what you mean.  The forces in Iraq and Afghanistan included a coalition of forces from Western countries.  There were even troops from Germany there.  </p>

<p>(3)  Low-intensity?  Over 1M Iraqis were killed because of the 2003 invasion.  It was not low-intensity to them...  </p>

<p>(4)  In what way were the operations successful?  The U.S. is still fighting in both countries after having spent trillions of dollars, and what has been accomplished?   The U.S. has created more terrorists than there were before 9/11.    </p>

<p>(5)  In North America, the cities and homes of the bankers responsible for waging war are at risk.  This alone will change things.  I doubt the cowardly bankers will be motivated to have war when they can hear the battlefield.  </p>

<p>(3) It wouldn&#39;t be low intensity to you either if your embarrassing fantasy of fighting the government with your deer-hunting rifle came true.</p>

<p>(4) Those operations are to ruin those countries and keep them in chaos, as well as to terrorise the Western populations, crack down on their civil liberities, jack up their taxes, rip them off for defence contracts and grab the natural resources, pipelines, opium fields etc in those countries and to make blood sacrifices to Satan. Success. Almost all of these &#39;terror attacks&#39; are false flags or perpetrated by CIA/MOSSAD/MI6 puppets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(1) The constitutional right says &#39;arms&#39; so by a lot of the arguments that gun nuts employ that should mean all military technology not just some small arms. The idea of rising up against the government at least would make more sense then.</p>

<p>(2) U.S. Americans&#39; gun rights are being eroded on the daily as well as all of their civil liberties, the same as everywhere else.</p>

<p>(3) As I said there are massive abuses of power today and all the small arms don&#39;t seem to be helping. In fact using force against someone who is much more forceful than you is obviously likely to be counterproductive. Perhaps civil disobedience and political means could be employed. Certainly even if you want a (lightly) armed revolution you would need huge numbers of people so you&#39;d have to at least start with spreading the message.</p>

<p>(4) Correct, our police are going the same way yours and everyone else&#39;s are.</p>

<p>(5) 99% of the British people are subhuman imbeciles who are not only not defending themselves from the betrayal of the government but are eagerly cooperating with it. The 1% who are trying to take action are doing so peacefully as I said above. The same goes for all 1st world countries. Having small arms does give you an extra option of course I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s very relevant.</p>

Anyway, minutes after the post was made the thread was nuked and 4chan went down entirely. When it came back up people were trying to find the original photo so they described it: &quot;alien photo, selfie with alien on the left, background was desert with a tree/cactus in the middle&quot;. Most people posted memes, but there were people piecing the original photo together <a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/cs58b14770.png">like this</a> if they had some of the original saved or screenshotted (the original image was apparently super large) or just mimicking it <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fjbz6uN.png">like this</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep it up mate. People have seemed to forgotten that were a theory sub. They come in here demanding proof and then when OP can&#39;t deliver they gatekeep with what you&#39;ve seen a thousand time. &quot;No proof, nothing to see here. Move along&quot;. Well how many theories with tidbits of truth have been stifled from discovery because of this tactic. Once you become aware of it you can shine a light and make people aware. Our best mode of attack is to just ignore them or pick apart their flimsy argument. The blanket denials of &quot;proof&quot; are just attempts to derail conversation. Keep up the good work. If something interests you there&#39;s a good chance it interests others as well and I for one refuse to allow the trolls to dictate whether I enjoy this sub or not. Just my two cents on your post. I absolutely think that you&#39;ve got something to it. The &quot;test bed&quot; theory is interesting. Thanks or providing that perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that you have to be a third degree mason to enter one of the other bodies, Scottish, York, or even Shriner. 33rd degree usually refers to Scottish rite, which the LARPer there doesn&#39;t seem to realize.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is anything &quot;more&quot; to masonry other than perhaps a few lodges with expensive dues and hoity-toity cliques (which is against what masonry is about). There are lodges that seem to practice esotericism but most seem to be a social club with charity work. I have a friend who is a mason and I&#39;ve heard stories of masons with rings made out of abraxas stones and rituals atop one of the pyramids in Egypt (authorities there didn&#39;t like that one). As for it being evil and conspiratorial though, that&#39;s nonsense conspiracy &quot;theorist&quot; shit.</p>

<p>Then why did you later claim that proper masonry has only 3 degrees when it&#39;s completely irrelevant here? It looked like you were trying to prove the 4chan poster wrong by showing that he couldn&#39;t be a 33rd degree mason because he wasn&#39;t in the scottish rite.</p>

<p>Because the OP never mentioned being in the Scottish Rite other than some paperwork he found -- typical of someone who had an idea for a prank but only did a cursory google of the facts.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re filling in extra &quot;facts&quot; in that remarkably tiny brain of yours.</p>

<p>I have a friend who is a mason who was invited to the Bohemian grove (didn&#39;t go because, like Nixon, thought it would be &quot;faggy&quot;). That said masonry is not centralized and lodges do differ, though irregular lodges are not considered masonry by other masons.</p>

<p>...So that&#39;s your whole point? He must be a LARP because he didn&#39;t specify being in the Scottish Rite even though it&#39;s completely irrelevant? Great work detective.</p>

<p>He could very well be a LARP but your argument is laughable.</p>

It got a large spike in activity at a seeminly non-peak time (1am Monday CST).  One way to quantify that is to see the spike in threads around that time:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/</a></p>

<p>Historically, that has happened whenever threads like this have ran; to keep it off the first page, and so it 404&#39;s faster naturally (not to mention whatever influence the mods have in the thread).</p>

<p>Just the fact the board acted in this way after the thread, as well as deleting mentions of it afterwards is what grabbed my attention.  Furthermore, the content in which the thread&#39;s OP posted was pretty interesting to say the least.  The archive link I posted in OP will take you there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, from being on /pol/ almost everyday for a few years now, OP is pretty new to /pol/.  Threads like that are pretty much always LARP&#39;s The big give away, aside from the vague info of which has been talked about for a while now, he just rehashed it but acted as someone &quot;in the know&quot; like what Mega Anon does(LARP)  When the thread gets very popular with a lot of &quot;shills&quot; and people fighting about who is or isn&#39;t a shill, etc. it&#39;s usually a LARP. </p>

<p>The real threads usually get close to zero shills, maybe one or two who post once &amp; never come back. They don&#39;t want to bring attention to the actual important threads so they don&#39;t reply(so it doesn&#39;t get bumped) and they have threads like what OP posted to push the good threads off the front page.</p>

<p>Just my observation of course. &quot;Happening&quot; threads &amp; investigation threads are what I go there for. I&#39;ve seen some shit.</p>

<p>See just above the hand-grip on the right side of the image:</p>

<p>&quot;CAI &lt;something&gt; VT&quot;</p>

<p>This is the import (to the US) stamp of Century Arms International.  They stamp that on the gun when they return one from overseas TO the United States, not FROM.  Thus, this gun is in the United States.  And it wasn&#39;t brought here by a Mossad agent -- because if it was, that CAI stamp wouldn&#39;t be there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>these were marketing ploys to Israeli civilians. Does anyone actually think a Mossad agent would carry around a gun with Mossad stamped on it? The gun in the OP is a Tanfoglio TZ-75 Witness, an Italian CZ-75 clone. </p>

<p>I have one of the guns these were supposed to mimic, a CZ-75 SC MASSADA (notice the slight difference in spelling). They were Israeli police surplus. Here&#39;s a close-up of mine&#39;s slide with the funny markings. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/WwqkAwJ.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/WwqkAwJ.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/I4ErPyH.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/I4ErPyH.jpg</a></p>

<p>Israel had a huge contract from CZ for police, which is why they did custom markings on the slides. CZ did the same thing for police in Mexico when they got a huge order of CZ P-07s. Eventually Israel would use tanfoglio to supply parts for the IWI Jericho 941, which is basically a CZ-75 clone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is anything &quot;more&quot; to masonry other than perhaps a few lodges with expensive dues and hoity-toity cliques (which is against what masonry is about). There are lodges that seem to practice esotericism but most seem to be a social club with charity work. I have a friend who is a mason and I&#39;ve heard stories of masons with rings made out of abraxas stones and rituals atop one of the pyramids in Egypt (authorities there didn&#39;t like that one). As for it being evil and conspiratorial though, that&#39;s nonsense conspiracy &quot;theorist&quot; shit.</p>

I&#39;ve seen that specific image of a humanoid/reptilian years ago (definitely on a Top Trump, but also I&#39;m pretty certain on some TV show) as a representation of what an intelligently evolved dinosaur would look like if they were not wiped out (which to be honest they may not have been in Agartha!).
