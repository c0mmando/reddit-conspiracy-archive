       An alleged 33rd degree mason talking about a major happening in the next few months possibly regarding aliens.  Someone posts a picture of a Mossad stamped handgun, and the thread 404's shortly afterwards.

       /pol/ has way more threads than usual currently, users are saying in threads something weird is happening shortly before those get 404'ed.  I'm not saying this is real or not, but just how any mention of it is getting scrubbed and how there's a large spike in active threads may be indicative of this being looked at further in front of more eyes.

       Friend's neighbor is USAF mechanic being deployed March to Kuwait. Other neighbor USAF deployed unknown location next week. Other neighbor National Guard told to be mission ready for next 6 months... She lives in am apt complex near large Midwest air air base.
      </p>

       All this was in the last few weeks. Anyone else here of recent deployments? Could be related...

       I don't know if it's truly relevant, but I'm in the DEP program for yhe Navy waiting to ship out in April. I asked my recruiter if it was possible if they could move up my ship out date and he said more than likely since they've been bumping people up to ship early all this month. From what i know, the Navy doesn't rush anything... Just my two cents.

       Thanks for your input and service friend. Be safe where ever and whatever you do. Live you for what you do and also for being a person... They both mean a lot but one is a choice. Either way I digress and thank you.

       Kinda weird, my brother is going to Kuwait in January, he works with comms but that's all I really know nothing special but another family friend is also going to Kuwait who's an officer been in a long time. I'm not saying there's any coincidence or weird being stationed there I'm just curious how many people they are sending there?

       Those mossad stamped guns and Israeli civi training pistol stock have been imported a lot lately, FYI. Just in case people think that proves anything, it more likely points to a /weekendgunnit poster than a spy.

       The MADE IN ITALY stamp matches the C.A.I. Georgia, VT stamp. That was put there by the Century Arms to comply with US law.

       From the ATF...

      <p>
       "Country of Origin
      </p>
      <p>
       Must be conspicuously engraved, cast or stamped (impressed) on the firearm frame, receiver, barrel or slide
      </p>
      <p>
       For firearms imported after January 30, 2002, the engraving, casting or stamping (impressing) of the country of origin must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch"

       It really looks like shit there, looks much better on the grip.

       And also, gun control is the partisan issue because they made it that way. It's called a wedge issue, like abortion. One way the ruling class stays in control. Identity poltics and wedge issues. At the same time, unless your in the top, your votes are worthless. Money buys policy.

       This is what is happening in Europe. Be prepared to have your mind blown at what the EU 'leaders' and global elite are intentionally doing with the terrorists. They are soon to try the same here in the US. This is no joke, your lives are in danger. It will take time, but it is happening because this is what the global elite want.

       This may have been true back in 1776, but now the military is more than just having guns, and a lot of those aspects are outside the realm of availability for civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point, many in Europe have access to guns, it's the ammo that's highly regulated, as well as specialized. Today, ballistics are incredibly specialized and take know-how to put together, whereas in 1776 you could practically melt down metal into a pellet by using a hole in the ground as a cast, and put enough black powder in the chamber to fire it the opposite way.

       The Western military got their asses handed to them in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The same would happen in North America, only it would be much worse for them.

       I don't disagree with most of what you said, but I don't see too much limitations considering the obliteration of the middle class. Impoverished people's worry too much about food and shelter to actually take much action and the class warfare that's happening is virtually unadulterated. Trillions missing, The Pentagon has been saying it would do an audit for 20 years without doing one. The tax rate for this making under 40,000 USD is virtually 1/4. Every dollar is only .75, Guns don't really make much difference unless you happen to find yourself in a mass shooting and bankrupted by hospital bills. Lol.

       Correct. 'Oh no the government will oppress me if I don't have my guns', what do you think this sub is for lol? You seen how many people the police are killing? Doesn't seem to be working very well. Then again what your chances are of taking out M1 main battle tanks with your deer hunting rifle might not be as good as you think they are.

       Don't take out the M1 tank.  Take out the supply line instead.  They do use a lot of fuel...

       The Western military got their asses handed to them in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It would be much the same with the battlefield being in North America.  It would actually be worse for them because their "home base" is more easily accessible.

       (1) The idea that a posse of gun nuts could take down the U.S. military is a religious dogma akin to the world was made 6000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) The U.S.-led forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are not 'the Western military'.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) The low-intensity conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan is ongoing, as it is designed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) The U.S.-led operations in those countries are successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5) Similar operations would work much better, from the armed forces' perspective, with the battlefield being in North America. And they are planned to so stick around a few decades and you'll see it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       (6) When I click on that 4chan post it gives me a security warning unfortunately.

       (1)  If the Iraqis and Afghanis can defeat the U.S. military, then why can't the American people do the same?  I do not follow your logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2)  I don't understand what you mean.  The forces in Iraq and Afghanistan included a coalition of forces from Western countries.  There were even troops from Germany there.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3)  Low-intensity?  Over 1M Iraqis were killed because of the 2003 invasion.  It was not low-intensity to them...
      </p>
      <p>
       (4)  In what way were the operations successful?  The U.S. is still fighting in both countries after having spent trillions of dollars, and what has been accomplished?   The U.S. has created more terrorists than there were before 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5)  In North America, the cities and homes of the bankers responsible for waging war are at risk.  This alone will change things.  I doubt the cowardly bankers will be motivated to have war when they can hear the battlefield.

      </p>
      <p>
       (2) The armed forces sent to Iraq and Afghanistan is maybe 3% of the Western military and that 3% was/is not operating at full whack.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) It wouldn't be low intensity to you either if your embarrassing fantasy of fighting the government with your deer-hunting rifle came true.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) Those operations are to ruin those countries and keep them in chaos, as well as to terrorise the Western populations, crack down on their civil liberities, jack up their taxes, rip them off for defence contracts and grab the natural resources, pipelines, opium fields etc in those countries and to make blood sacrifices to Satan. Success. Almost all of these 'terror attacks' are false flags or perpetrated by CIA/MOSSAD/MI6 puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5) It will change things alright you will disappear in a cloud of red mist when you get jdammed from 40,000'. By the way they will use foreign troops as well as U.S. Americans or whatever the local nationality is.

       (6) People in the U.K. are not blocked from 4chan and I am using international proxies anyway. Still can't get the full size version of that picture but I zoomed in and was able to read it. It's largely cringy 13 year old nonsense. Americans are just kind of retarded, sorry.

       Sure, and that is why they destroyed the American middle class.  It is the biggest obstacle to their plans.

       Yes, it will not be easy, but I cannot see the bankers taking up arms to defend themselves.   They have to rely on others for such things, and that is their biggest weakness.

       I mean, there is a reason we have the Constitutional right to own guns.  It will not be taken away from us.  If the U.S. military and law enforcement can have guns, then so can the citizens.  How else will we defend ourselves from the abuses of power?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed that the police in the UK are much better armed then they  were several years ago.  It seems like this is going backwards, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       How are the British people defending themselves from the betrayal of your government?  I wonder the same thing about the France, Germany, Sweden, etc.  It seems like the people are less able to defend their interests.

       (1) The constitutional right says 'arms' so by a lot of the arguments that gun nuts employ that should mean all military technology not just some small arms. The idea of rising up against the government at least would make more sense then.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) U.S. Americans' gun rights are being eroded on the daily as well as all of their civil liberties, the same as everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) As I said there are massive abuses of power today and all the small arms don't seem to be helping. In fact using force against someone who is much more forceful than you is obviously likely to be counterproductive. Perhaps civil disobedience and political means could be employed. Certainly even if you want a (lightly) armed revolution you would need huge numbers of people so you'd have to at least start with spreading the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) Correct, our police are going the same way yours and everyone else's are.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5) 99% of the British people are subhuman imbeciles who are not only not defending themselves from the betrayal of the government but are eagerly cooperating with it. The 1% who are trying to take action are doing so peacefully as I said above. The same goes for all 1st world countries. Having small arms does give you an extra option of course I just don't think it's very relevant.

        This photo

       was posted on 4chan with the user claiming to be the alien (I'm like 75% sure that's the story). Anyway, minutes after the post was made the thread was nuked and 4chan went down entirely. When it came back up people were trying to find the original photo so they described it: "alien photo, selfie with alien on the left, background was desert with a tree/cactus in the middle". Most people posted memes, but there were people piecing the original photo together

       I think that is a fake. I've seen that specific image of a humanoid/reptilian years ago (definitely on a Top Trump, but also I'm pretty certain on some TV show) as a representation of what an intelligently evolved dinosaur would look like if they were not wiped out (which to be honest they may not have been in Agartha!). But yeah, I'm very skeptical of that one.

       I mean yes we shouldn't dismiss this, but isn't bringing in something that isn't speculation or fear mothering useful? If anything, by calling him a Jew you're making the entire conversation more divisive and polarizing instead of trying to analyze the situation and some up with the most logical conclusion.

       Keep it up mate. People have seemed to forgotten that were a theory sub. They come in here demanding proof and then when OP can't deliver they gatekeep with what you've seen a thousand time. "No proof, nothing to see here. Move along". Well how many theories with tidbits of truth have been stifled from discovery because of this tactic. Once you become aware of it you can shine a light and make people aware. Our best mode of attack is to just ignore them or pick apart their flimsy argument. The blanket denials of "proof" are just attempts to derail conversation. Keep up the good work. If something interests you there's a good chance it interests others as well and I for one refuse to allow the trolls to dictate whether I enjoy this sub or not. Just my two cents on your post. I absolutely think that you've got something to it. The "test bed" theory is interesting. Thanks or providing that perspective.

       I think it is better to know even if this guy is bullshitting everyone. What if there is a slim chance he’s not. So just keep it in the back of you’re mind. If nothing happens great. Who cares. If something does, well then you had this foreknowledge. Nothing should be completely shoved off.

       I believe that you have to be a third degree mason to enter one of the other bodies, Scottish, York, or even Shriner. 33rd degree usually refers to Scottish rite, which the LARPer there doesn't seem to realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is anything "more" to masonry other than perhaps a few lodges with expensive dues and hoity-toity cliques (which is against what masonry is about). There are lodges that seem to practice esotericism but most seem to be a social club with charity work. I have a friend who is a mason and I've heard stories of masons with rings made out of abraxas stones and rituals atop one of the pyramids in Egypt (authorities there didn't like that one). As for it being evil and conspiratorial though, that's nonsense conspiracy "theorist" shit.

       There was a Mason that was in /conspiracy that said similar shit but he'd heard of certain shady groups within the Masons that worshipped out of skulls and other shady shit. I forget what thread but the username had "skyrim" in it.

       Yes, obviously. Doesn't mean the document is even his. It's sad that people believe this LARP, the writing style even matches someone in his early 20s which a 33rd degree SR mason isn't going to be.

       Then why did you later claim that proper masonry has only 3 degrees when it's completely irrelevant here? It looked like you were trying to prove the 4chan poster wrong by showing that he couldn't be a 33rd degree mason because he wasn't in the scottish rite.

       Because the OP never mentioned being in the Scottish Rite other than some paperwork he found -- typical of someone who had an idea for a prank but only did a cursory google of the facts.

       I have a friend who is a mason who was invited to the Bohemian grove (didn't go because, like Nixon, thought it would be "faggy"). That said masonry is not centralized and lodges do differ, though irregular lodges are not considered masonry by other masons.

       I think you mean Bluebeam, unless you're referencing the continuance of the DoD investigating UFO sightings as recently revealed by NYT?
      </p>
      <p>
       Blue Book was a UFO study that took place in the 60s iirc, and was "shut down," by the USAF, whereas Bluebeam is an alleged hoaxed alien invasion that incorporates some pretty wild theories.  The strange thing is that parts of the purported Project Bluebeam line-up with other operations planned by our government, including projecting a holographic image of Allah over Baghdad in the First Gulf War (never implemented obviously), and faking the return of Jesus Christ in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs.

       Is this the one where there's a loud voice over the sky? My friend mentioned that a few years back. He went to MIT and said there's a ton of technology like it that the government uses. I thought it was interesting.

       Voice-to-Skull technology, which is indeed a real thing and I think used sparingly these days in advertising (think billboards with audio hotspots playing an ad when you walk within a certain range), was probably what he was referencing.

      <p>
       And if VTS tech is available to the public, I can only imagine what sort of more advanced version the military has.

       This is interesting. What exactly happened to the thread? I see it ends at around 1:30 AM? I saw in the comments below you can buy these handguns pretty readily for a low price. What evidence do we have to suggest something out of the ordinary here?

       The Mossad gun was just a seemingly interesting post in the thread; Subsequent strange activity on /pol/ during and after the thread is what intrigued me.  It got a large spike in activity at a seeminly non-peak time (1am Monday CST).  One way to quantify that is to see the spike in threads around that time:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/">
        https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, that has happened whenever threads like this have ran; to keep it off the first page, and so it 404's faster naturally (not to mention whatever influence the mods have in the thread).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the fact the board acted in this way after the thread, as well as deleting mentions of it afterwards is what grabbed my attention.  Furthermore, the content in which the thread's OP posted was pretty interesting to say the least.  The archive link I posted in OP will take you there.

       In my opinion, from being on /pol/ almost everyday for a few years now, OP is pretty new to /pol/.  Threads like that are pretty much always LARP's The big give away, aside from the vague info of which has been talked about for a while now, he just rehashed it but acted as someone "in the know" like what Mega Anon does(LARP)  When the thread gets very popular with a lot of "shills" and people fighting about who is or isn't a shill, etc. it's usually a LARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real threads usually get close to zero shills, maybe one or two who post once &amp; never come back. They don't want to bring attention to the actual important threads so they don't reply(so it doesn't get bumped) and they have threads like what OP posted to push the good threads off the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my observation of course. "Happening" threads &amp; investigation threads are what I go there for. I've seen some shit.

       This is the import (to the US) stamp of Century Arms International.  They stamp that on the gun when they return one from overseas TO the United States, not FROM.  Thus, this gun is in the United States.  And it wasn't brought here by a Mossad agent -- because if it was, that CAI stamp wouldn't be there.

       these were marketing ploys to Israeli civilians. Does anyone actually think a Mossad agent would carry around a gun with Mossad stamped on it? The gun in the OP is a Tanfoglio TZ-75 Witness, an Italian CZ-75 clone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have one of the guns these were supposed to mimic, a CZ-75 SC MASSADA (notice the slight difference in spelling). They were Israeli police surplus. Here's a close-up of mine's slide with the funny markings.

      <p>
       Israel had a huge contract from CZ for police, which is why they did custom markings on the slides. CZ did the same thing for police in Mexico when they got a huge order of CZ P-07s. Eventually Israel would use tanfoglio to supply parts for the IWI Jericho 941, which is basically a CZ-75 clone.

       I like the fact that for thousands of years, Jews were kicked out of Jerusalem and barred from entering Israel, which was renamed by the Christian/Muslim conquerors who kept them out from the 1st century BC until 1948AD. Yet somehow, those Jews who spent 2,000 years struggling to even be allowed to live and worship in their lands are somehow running the world in the modern day.

       I believe that you have to be a third degree mason to enter one of the other bodies, Scottish, York, or even Shriner. 33rd degree usually refers to Scottish rite, which the LARPer there doesn't seem to realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is anything "more" to masonry other than perhaps a few lodges with expensive dues and hoity-toity cliques (which is against what masonry is about). There are lodges that seem to practice esotericism but most seem to be a social club with charity work. I have a friend who is a mason and I've heard stories of masons with rings made out of abraxas stones and rituals atop one of the pyramids in Egypt (authorities there didn't like that one). As for it being evil and conspiratorial though, that's nonsense conspiracy "theorist" shit.

       I think that is a fake. I've seen that specific image of a humanoid/reptilian years ago (definitely on a Top Trump, but also I'm pretty certain on some TV show) as a representation of what an intelligently evolved dinosaur would look like if they were not wiped out (which to be honest they may not have been in Agartha!). But yeah, I'm very skeptical of that one.
