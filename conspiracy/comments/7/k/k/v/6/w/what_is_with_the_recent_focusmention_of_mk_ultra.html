        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On netflix alone there are 4 brand new series (that I know of) that make reference to mind control: Stranger Things, Manhunt: Unabomber, Mindhunter, and Wormwood.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are more series out there that discuss this kind of thing. But I guess my question is why is there this sudden popularity with government mind control programs? I guess this has always been an interest for documentaries and sci fi&#39;s, but it seems interesting to me. Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that some series mentioned it and it got a response. So now it&#39;s the hot new trope. But this is the conspiracy forum. So maybe the government wants us to think that they do have these abilities so that we will fall in line and cooperate. Just like the UFOs are there to hide the stealth planes. They let us think one thing because it covers up the other. They probably want us to think that they have mind control programs so that they can conduct false flag operations and propaganda. Anyone questioning something about them is accused of being a conspiracist. But putting the farfetch Notions in people&#39;s heads and fiction people will ignore what&#39;s really going on. </p>

<p>Check out the breakdown of Stranger Things on a blog called The Secret Sun. Some real deep maybes in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about &quot;being perfect&quot; it&#39;s about just knowing what your talking about lmao. And no, it&#39;s about FBI agents interviewing convicted serial killers and the beginnings of criminal profiling.
