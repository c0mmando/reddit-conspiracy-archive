       For those that haven't already connected these dots, pol has been essentially dominated and controlled by disinformation and controlled opposition. Much of this has been bought and paid for, from organizations we've heard about (ShareBlue, CTR, JIDF), and several we haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increasingly, though, AI is the force turning pol into a toxic mental-conditioning slush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind certain most-powerful-in-the-world corporations now have enough information on you, gleaned from browsing habits, purchasing habits, emails and forum submissions, travel habits, and every other quantifiable element of your life, to create
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       accurate personality profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, based on these personality profiles and quantifications of
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       , these same structures can learn how to best manipulate and control you. We're all aware of marketing/advertising manipulation... if anyone thinks the power brokers in this world are as interested in your few extra bucks as they are in controlling the way you approach and process the world at large, you're being extremely naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explosion in computing power, paired with the immense corruption in our nation and the runaway deep-state and intel organizations, combined with the mass of personal data existing on each and every one of us (the extent of which would boggle the mind), should lead any thinking individual to a logical conclusion: We're being mentally conditioned, on a mass-scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It started with the Frankfurt School, and Freud's philosophy, and his nephew Edward Bernays' 'Propaganda'. The same individuals who speak of us as useless cattle in their holy books are literally treating us as such, as we speak. . . with remarkable success, efficiency
      </p>
      <p>
       We're at a crossroads. If we can't find a way to win this battle for hearts and minds, the zombie mass of unconscious humanity that'll inevitably result will be unstoppable. Perhaps this is the Jewish Golem prophesied: "In Modern Hebrew, golem is used to mean "dumb" or "helpless". Similarly, it is often used today as a metaphor for a brainless lunk or entity who serves a man under controlled conditions but is hostile to him under others.[2] "Golem" passed into Yiddish as goylem to mean someone who is clumsy or slow."
      </p>
      <p>
       Others know this, and its the reason pol is targeted so aggressively. The divide and conquer tactics ('amerimutts', 'why are nords/meds/brits so X', 'Why is this Jordan Peterson guy making money', etc), the desire to paint pol'ers as the detritus of humanity, to derail threads, to confuse, to destroy morale, to muddy the waters, to mislead and misinform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of this is now fully automated. Text, sentences, paragraphs, thoughts and ideas, can all be parsed and analyzed with ease, and responded to accordingly. Furthermore, any decent AI can engage in trial-and-error testing, to determine with statistical precision how to best run a thread into the ground, or get posters to turn on one another, or tar and feather the main idea being posited.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting this to say 'be aware', but even more importantly to suggest that we need a
       <em>
        solution
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone were to build a forum that were invite-only, with a reputation-based user-scoring mechanism, with each user being responsible for the actions of all they invite, we could eliminate virtually all of the toxic swill that floods this environment, and create a pure stream, the ramifications of which could be incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand its a big step, but if things continue as-is, theres no way pol wins in the long run against an AI that watches, learns, adapts, and manipulates and confuses and demoralizes with brutal efficiency. This isn't tenable, in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern world doesn't allow us to take up spear and man the pass at Thermopylae, thorttling our foes face to face as nature intended. Battles are waged differently today. . . and far more more important than what takes place on the battlefield is what takes place beforehand in the hearts and minds of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're faced with two choices: either win them over and detox them, or wait for the Golem to destroy our species as we know it, stamping out all thats great, exceptional, creative, beautiful. This IS our Thermopylae, in a very real way. Truly free speech essentially doesn't exist anymore, outside these bounds. . . and, depressingly, free speech only exists in a crippled and deformed manner
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       these bounds, due to the prevalence of those seeking to destroy it. I think its time to start thinking about how to most efficiently use our collective talents. . how to most efficiently destroy this monster, and prevent the creation of the Golem.
      </p>

       This is a discussion that needs to be had.

       Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer engineering, designed to create machines that behave like humans. Although AI has come so far in recent years, it is still missing essential pieces of human behavior such as emotional behavior, identifying objects and handling them smoothly like a human.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of areas where AI can be applied, including the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Expert systems, where computers can be programmed to make decisions in real-life situations. The integration of machines, software, and specific information allows the system to impart reasoning, explanation, and advice to the end user.
       </li>
       <li>
        Natural Language, where chatbots can recognize natural human language if communicating directly with a user or a customer.
       </li>
       <li>
        Neural Systems, simulate intelligence by attempting to reproduce the types of physical connections that occur in human brains. For example, neural systems can predict future events based on historical data.
       </li>
       <li>
        Robotics, are programmed computers which see, hear and react to sensory stimuli, such as light, heat, temperature, sound and pressure.
       </li>
       <li>
        Gaming Systems can manipulate strategic games, such as chess or poker, where the machine can think of an exponential number of possible positions to play effectively against a human opponent.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are also different levels of AI. For example, some AI systems align more closely with human behavior. The closer a system relates to actual human behavior, the stronger the AI.
       </li>
      </ul>

       Pro-Trump astroturfers are probably the most dominant group on /pol/ next to JIDF. E-celebs like Jordan Peterson and Lauren Southern have plenty of people shilling for them, so criticism of the YouTube/Patreon cottage industry is understandable. Although many popular memes like "amerimutts" were likely created by a think tank like Tavistock. It's difficult to say how much of /pol/ content is organic users, but just look at what is allowed to rise to the top of the catalog and what threads get mysteriously deleted.

        Text, sentences, paragraphs, thoughts and ideas, can all be parsed and analyzed with ease, and responded to accordingly. Furthermore, any decent AI can engage in trial-and-error testing, to determine with statistical precision how to best run a thread into the ground, or get posters to turn on one another, or tar and feather the main idea being posited.

       Not even close, really. You could use AI for sentiment analysis, and perhaps to identify posts that could be targeted with a set of replies written by humans. That's about the extent of it.
