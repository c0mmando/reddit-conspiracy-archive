       I’m not really sure they are embracing it. I mean, for a collective of neoliberals, they are seeming pretty woke. I’m sure that this won’t go over very well here, but they are talking about suing because of the surveillance state. Please, correct me if I’m wrong.

       You're giving them too much credit...they are largely outraged because of "Russia" etc.

       The surveillance state has been encroaching rather dramatically for the last 25 years...and the fact that they appear up in arms only now is as misguided as it is suspicious.

       Why wouldn’t they be outraged because of Russia? Or Cambridge? Seems to be well within their rights, considering CA has helped elect Trump and push Brexit and they stand to benefit. Russia also stands to benefit from both things happening.

       Are all people on r conspiracy crazy? No. Do people say they are and generalize the entire sub? Yes. Does that bother you? I would imagine so. Now, on the other hand, you’re putting all these politricks in the same basket saying that they are just now up in arms about surveillance, but some, if not most have probably been against it.

       Well, judging from the Flynn indictment, it seemed like any sanctions would be ignored (which, afaik, they are being ignored), which would benefit them. Plus, destabilizing the two most powerful alleged democracies creates a channel where Russia can make a power grab, a money grab or both.

       Again, do you think conspiracy is immune to this kind of thinking, because it isn’t. At all. Left/right paradigm aside, this place has several different hive minds going at once. Depends on the day, really.

        Well, judging from the Flynn indictment, it seemed like any sanctions would be ignored (which, afaik, they are being ignored), which would benefit them. Plus, destabilizing the two most powerful alleged democracies creates a channel where Russia can make a power grab, a money grab or both

       Russia influenced our election like we do to other countries. I don't agree with it when we do it, so I don't take kindly to it happening to me. Flynn has been indicted. Manafort has as well. Both have major ties to shady Russia, eastern European finances, so I don't think this stops at them.

       Wow. Having read this thread down: they're trolling you hard, including a mod. Didn't know discussion of a potentially vast international conspiracy involving the President was something to be immediately shot down in such a free sub as this.  The 2016 election has ruined this sub and any sort of civil discourse.

       Russia's goal for a long time has been to disrupt or break up NATO and drive a wedge between the US and its allies.  I would say that have succeeded in that front with the election of a populist, isolationist (or is he?) president.

       The title seems to be a skewed, biased interpretation on the overall attitude there.  Don't get me wrong: there's certainly some jealousy that they aren't the ones in control of such data and anger that only exists when they think it impacts them.  However, it's at least a start to get people on the same page against this type of surveillance, rather than keeping us divided and squabbling (as this misleading headline seems to be aiming to do).

       My friends and family are probably 80% Democrat if I had to guess and I’ve literally never once heard someone say something like that. I have one friend that is super out there on the whole race issue in the way that is commonly lambasted on the right, and I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t think he’s a little off his rocker.

       If this was instead about Clinton's data mining it would be immediately buried on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .  That's what I have noticed on that sub is things are only bad when Trump does it.  Doesn't matter when democrats do the same thing it's just trumpets doing whataboutism trying to distract.  I just hope these people realize that the Trump team wasn't the only entity doing all this data farming on people and they should also be outraged at the non-Trump entities farming their data to profile.

       Anyone who disagrees with me is a shill or robot? Sorry, but I would say it's safe to say that most people there are upset at how the DNC treated Berie. But they are not fanitical about it. They also accept the the DNC was broke and made a deal with the devil in exchange for helping Hillary. Shitty, but not illegal.

       The US is psy-oping itself as well.   It's a ridiculous game that presumes the US government is good intentioned despite history.

       They're not. I wonder what OPs source is on this? 4chan maybe?

       How else do you explain that
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ktuif/rpolitics_embraces_the_surveillance_stateif_it/drh2wow/">
        the comment he

       is referencing is from a 14 day old account, and all the replies contradict the narrative OP is pushing.

       This makes me more suspicious of his push to give the mods more power to censor "political" posts.

       This is going to sound pretentious AF, but content creators for fake news have been interviewed since the election and said that by and large fake narratives geared towards liberals were debunked rather than spread around. Also, there isn’t a lot of money to be made by old rich people when endorsing demand side economics, more consumer protections, and a more progressive tax curve so there are fewer billionaires willing to put up money to push those ideas.

       I'm just alerting everyone that gets linked so that they are aware. I could care less of context it's the fact they are linking and voting in subs that they aren't participants of, shilling. Everyone should be made aware of the linking abuse that is going on.
