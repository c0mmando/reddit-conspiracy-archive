       When was the last time we had something go viral? When was the last fad? Why are there no more new memes? There's been one that I'm aware of in six months. No new TV shows that become talked about on the internet. Stranger Things was the last new one and that was last year. Rick and Morty started to become popular early this year but then it died down very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys remember when there'd be stupid shit that would get popular and we'd all get sick of hearing about it? Why is that not happening anymore? There used to be some new wild thing every other day! There was constantly something new in our culture. Have you not noticed that's changed?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been no new apps that got popular either. And no new consumer tech that made it big. No new subcultures. No new cultural phenomenona. No new anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our culture has died. It's been about half a year since it happened and it was dying before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's no controversy when there should be. A man named Daniel Shaver was executed by police. They made him crawl on the ground for no wearing basketball shorts and when they started to fall down and he went to pull them back up, they shot him. The cops got away with it. A few people spoke up but there should have been mass outrage. It's not because he's white either. The alt-right should have been going on about it saying "white people get killed just as much as blacks, why isn't BLM doing anything, etc." And then people would argue against that, you know how it's supposed to go. There was no protesting about the repeal of Net Neutrality that I heard of. As many people cared about that, there should have been some uproar. Maybe not a lot, but there was absolutely nothing. Remember how much people protested when Trump got elected? There's not been any new controversy of the week for a long time. There was a bombing in New York a week ago, by the way. It was a Bangladeshi guy. None of the usual debate and arguing about Islam being violent. After the Vegas and Texas shootings, there should have been the usual back and forth about gun violence and mental health. There was a little discussion but not as much as there should have been. The Trump administration straight up banned the CDC and other agencies from using certain words and all people did was complain in the comments on the articles without much emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have it set up so I get emailed when a bill moves through the house or senate. I used to get several a week, now I don't get any. They've done nothing on health care and it's been a year. There's the tax bill, yes, but what else have they done? Congress has quit doing anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why are our troublemakers not making trouble? Please don't think I'm saying that any of those women in #metoo should have been harassed or bothered, but you know that the alt-right would have made their lives a living hell last year. They should be spreading their hate and advancing their cause, but they're not. They were in the beginning of the year, what changed? Yes, there are a few that do but not as many as there would be if there wasn't something fucked up going on. Any movement that grows like they have and holds the views they do should not be so quiet. I'm not saying I support them in any way, but it's highly irregular they're not more of a problem. There was a growing pattern of violence at their events that just stopped. There has also not been the backlash against them that there should have been. The social justice crowd should be going apeshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been made docile. We have been made complacent. Our creativity and our passion has been stolen from us. I want to know why. We need to demand an answer. I'm not even saying that it's happened intentionally. Maybe there's some additive in our food that they didn't know had a psychoactive effect. I don't know, but we need to find out. Is it too late?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it might be something in our food, because I started noticing I didn't enjoy things as much and had no passion anymore in late spring/early summer. It got worse and worse until I was doing nothing but mindlessly reading AskReddit threads all day. And then I got where I wasn't eating a lot, and what do you know, I started thinking about things. Started generating idea after idea. Then I got back to eating normally and it went away. I had two days off in a row last week and I was thinking a lot, making theories about memetics and stuff. I did eat but I didn't eat anything processed. Then I went back to work and ate my meal, and after that I was back to being dumbed down. I know one anecdote isn't evidence but it's enough of a pattern for me to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, please, read this and think about it. Have you noticed a change in yourself since about June? Have you noticed what I've noticed about no new cultural phenomena, no new fads, no new ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
       Quit eating processed food. Don't eat meat unless you kill it yourself. Eggs should be safe, so are most fruits and vegetables. If it's something that you could tell if it's been tampered with, then it's probably safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the love of God, make noise about this. Copy and paste this post or write about it in your own words. Make people aware. Not just people on Reddit either. Go to sites that are majority other races, go to sites that have a majority of teenagers, put it on voat, put it on religious sites, put this everywhere. Put it in the comments on porn sites too, you'll reach a wider range of people there. And then we need to get off the computer or phone, and we need to raise hell. Protest until the truth is revealed. Boycott all producers of processed food. We need to get good food to food deserts too. Please don't let it be too late.

       Please spread the idea. We need to wake people up. Get people to realize it's happened. It won't be hard because they'll know it when they try to make arguments against you and realize you're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Walt a damn minute. I didn't start having original thoughts again until I read Yarvin's Dark Enlightenment manifesto. And I'd been not eating much several days before then. As soon as I read it it was like a switch got flipped. It's not an ideology, by the way, it's a prediction for the future. But maybe it's something else, because the idea of a joint-stock republic like... I don't know how to describe it, but it clicked in me. I couldn't stop thinking about it and I still think it might be the best system we could have. And I remember that I started to write a comment supporting it completely unlike how I normally do. I deleted it because I got distracted on something else. But it was like the words just flowed out of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've been feeling dampened, read it and tell me what happens. Yarvin knew about memetics and talked about them several times. He could have known about some kind of memetic weapon, and I know that sounds crazy but crazy things happen in this world. And he put the antidote in his manifesto. It's not even that implausible. We know a certain three letter agency has done psychological research and I highly doubt they've quit. It isn't implausible that they somehow figured out how to program us to 'dampen' at a certain phrase. Then they saw how dangerous the alt-right was becoming and used it on them, then members of the alt-right spread it to the rest of the country. That makes sense because people weren't as badly dampened in September. There was the NFL protests and controversy about them. But the alt-right didn't react at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone reading this is going to think I'm a lunatic for thinking something so out of the ordinary but I really think I'm on to something with that. Who knows what tech they have or knowledge they have about neurology or memetics? And yes, it may be wrong and it is out of left field but with a phenomena so strange we can't afford to play it safe with "sane-sounding" theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think there is something damn strange about the alt-right anyway. It's just a bunch of ideas from different groups. Not consistent at all. Seems to be obsessed with sexual jealousy. No leader and it wasn't started by anyone. The name came from a blog in 2010. They aren't fascist either. No focus on nationalism or religion. It's something completely different. They're white supremacists, yes, but they don't have any of the memes from traditional white supremacist groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's a possibility people might have been programmed somehow for it. Don't really know how, but I think I was one of them. I've always had weird tendencies about hate. And as soon as I woke up from my depression and found out what the alt-right was, I was fascinated by them. The name triggers something in my head too. Because of my obsession with memetics, I've sat for hours thinking of words and trying to consciously perceive as much of the information coded in that word, and I've got really good at it. And there's something in their name that calls me. It would make sense because I was pretty well dampened in September while others weren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the important thing is, the Dark Enlightenment manifesto made the dampening go away. So at least there's a cure.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for everyone reading this who thinks I'm a tinfoil-hat wearing crackpot, maybe I am wrong about the whole programming thing. I don't have any mechanism for how it is exactly done. But I have a lot in common with them and I come from a completely different background then they do. I ended up technically being alt-right, actually, because the DE was the beginning of the neo-reactionaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I'm fucking pissed. If I'm right, my programming was responsible for me being isolated my entire teenage years. Made years of my life miserable because I thought introverts were being systematically oppressed by extroverts. Made me doubt myself and lose my self-confidence because I'd hear certain misogynistic memes and they'd go in my head and I couldn't resist them. And for what fucking reason?

       Perhaps youre seeing the death of something and the death  the birth of another. I think it's the death of manufactured, false pop culture and the complete democratization of art, music, etc.

       First of all you shouldn't be basing the productivity of a society by memes and media. I would argue I enjoyed life more 15 years ago without memes and instant media consumption with a smartphone tied to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second there are good sources of media like tv, movies, etc. You just have to look for it. Dark is a damn good show that came out this month. New season of black mirror, westworld, and game of thrones soon. Before stranger things and westworld there wasn't a great new series since what, black mirror? Thats almost 5 years. So not sure what your complaining about with entertainment media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police killings will never get people to protest to change. We're too divided. The news doesn't cover it heavily because the victim was white. If he were black they'd cover it to create more divide. That's why they don't cover police shootings that are clear the cop was wrong. They choose ones that leave room for discussion to create a divide in our society. Keep us divided and we're weaker, easier to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as good goes I eat the shittiest food in existence. I work out and exercise to make it fuel for my body. I have a zest for life everyday I wake up. Maybe the problem is you personally. Try some new hobbies, etc other than consuming instant media.

       I am not talking about productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am talking about the complete lack of new ideas in our culture. Nothing catches on and becomes popular anymore. I'm not talking about quality of the media, I'm talking about the fact it seems there is no transmission of novel ideas, jokes, media, ideas, anything.

       I'm not even talking about me because I was snapped out of it. Whether you feel good or not really doesn't matter. When was the last time you shared a new idea or had one yourself? Because that's what I'm talking about, not how good a TV show produced before the dampening of our society is, or how healthy you are, or the productivity of our society.

       Devil's advocate here: The economy, at least where I live, has picked up. I'm working a ton, my spouse started a business, also working a ton. All my friends are busy, where we used to hang out on the weekend, now we can't because everyone is catching up on work or sleep.

       Ppeople only protested after election because they got paid to, and the paychecks stopped. (Nobody protested after Bush v Gore, and that was a much, much closer election.) The media doesn't report on actual news now, just whatever propaganda they're told to, so don't take media coverage as any sign of anything except where their paychecks are coming from (hint: not from viewership). Las Vegas news is intentionally suppressed. Congress has never done anything. "Alt-right" was a law-enforcement/intelligence psy op.

       There are no new consumer items or consumer tech that catch on. The change was sudden. We had a dynamic culture, with new things becoming popular and then dying out like they're supposed to. Then all of a sudden we didn't.

       Sounds like you are noticing this pattern in an intuitive way. Where do you expect to be seeing/hearing new ideas, memes, controversy? This is based on your context, which is interesting but is not specified in your post. Are you talking about a college campus environment where you notice this change in what people are talking about? Or is it a work environment? Tech job or Burger King or country auto shop? Or internet, what sites? TV or other media? Family? You are inferring a general pattern from your context,  I'm not dismissing it, I am genuinely interested in your context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am 38 years old and have been on the internet since it started, and years ago I got sick if the memes and stupid Internet playtime fun time foolishness. Coworkers (techies) gave me a hard time for being a stick in the mud but really I was being more mature and they were behaving like teenagers. I have watched as the internet went mainstream and new segments of the population and new generations of techies have gone through the stages of being fascinated by the foolishness, then obsessed, then jaded and angry and finally moving on with their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the internet has invaded most people's lives, I see that people become hypnotized by it (please don't forget that there are many old, poor and other people who have not been as exposed) and it is taking time to run its course, and for people to get over it and remember that they are still living in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation of your observation is that this is reaching a new stage. People are exhausted. I hope (I personally believe this is guaranteed to happen eventually) that internet users will turn the corner on seeing the internet as a powerful tool rather than a toy. When this happens we can focus on real life and safety and responsibility, peace and progress. So if you want to spread a message, my suggestion is to get serious and grow up. Adults don't spend their time playing first person shooters, pokemon go, or giggling about a silly picture. They accomplish real things in their real lives.

       Yes, I'm talking about the internet. No, I'm not talking about silly pictures. I'm talking about the fact that all of a sudden novelty is few and far between. All there is is stuff about the president and politics. We've had cultural phenomenona before the internet. Bizarre news stories that people talk about, new consumer items that become popular, new ideas and myths. There's been nothing since the NFL protests that actually sparked controversy. There's no public discourse anymore. We've had fads before the internet and we've always had a pop culture since the beginning of Hollywood. Now all of a sudden we don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to know how everybody of every age grew up all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, there are a few novel things but I can only think of three and one is one guy's account, and another one is proof that what I am saying is real since it even happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to know how 'everyone growing up' made the alt-right so docile. They are extremely misogynistic and were growing more active in the first half of the year, but then in the second half of year, the women coming out about sexual misconduct felt safe enough to do so and their lives weren't made hell. Yes that's good, but why did a growing movement that was becoming more and more active suddenly seemingly give up?

       Season 3 of Mr. Robot just concluded and been renewed for a fourth season. It is quiet literally the best TV show to ever exist and is about anarchist hackers crashing the economy to destroy TPTB. This show is extremely thought provoking and it's subject matter consists of about 90% of the content discussed in this sub. The show has gotten nearly perfect reviews, yet it is not discussed or plugged by any popular media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's time you get up off your ass and search for things that interest you, instead of expecting to be spoon fed everything. Censorship is real, and there's a reason you're not hearing about this kind of stuff.

       I don't know if it's the best tv show ever to exist but it certainly isn't as popular as Thrones or Stranger Thing, which is kind of the OP's point. The overuse of the unreliable narrator trope and ever-unwinding plot 4 seasons in may be a reason it's hasn't captured a huge following. That said I've watched every episode and I agree with you about it's themes, it even references the Mandela Effect mutliple times.

       It's better than 99% of television right now. The cinemotography alone makes it worth a watch imo. I dont think the unreliable narrator trope is overused. The only popular media in recent memory to use this trope was Fight Club. This was a intentional nod, as it was the shows primary source of inspiration. It's impossible to find a show that has 0 overused tropes... I mean just look at GoT. It tried so hard to avoid the most common storytelling tropes and look what happened. In its most recent season, it has literally devolved into one giant trope and meme of itself.

       most people are worn out, without the energy to care past basic necessities.  even staying connected w/family &amp; friends has become so much of a chore we rely on social media that, ultimately, isolates us even more and creates even more apathy.

       First off, you sound depressed.  I'm not going to say get checked out, but I will say focus on and improve yourself.  No pills...just clean up your diet and get busy doing something.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Processed" food is shit.  Food with excess preservatives is shit. 
 artificial sweeteners are shit.  Excess carbohydrates are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to feel amazing?  Switch to a paleo or keto diet for a few weeks.  After your body adjusts, your
       <strong>
        brain fog
       </strong>
       will be gone and you'll have a new kind of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second.  There ARE media gatekeepers.
      </p>
      <p>
       News media, social media, TV/Movie media, game media, music media, news aggregators, and search engines.  They have been consolidating into ever larger companies forming an oligopoly.  They have great control over what you see (first), what you don't see, and what money is spent on new creation.  Anything that supports their interests or narratives is pushed to the front.  Anything that opposes their interests or narratives are hidden or destroyed.

       Third.  Western Civilization (traditional independence, conservative values) vs. Communism / Socialism / Islamization
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many forces in the world that do not want the USA or its people to succeed.  Many forces are driving toward global communism.  The central thing keep western civilization intact, is the common culture.  Destroy the common culture and watch the civilization fall.  You can see everywhere that history is being destroyed or rewritten.  Past cultural norms, like simply having a traditional family, are being eroded.  Instead of equal opportunities (which is great), many are now trying to enforce equal outcome (communism).
      </p>
      <p>
       The great migration of third world invaders into Europe has few potential outcomes:  giant civil war, totalitarian government to control the war, or sending them back before it gets bad.  Yes, invaders.  Immigration without assimilation is invasion.

       You’re stuck in an echo chamber. Your sources of information have all become controlled over the past year or so. You need to branch out, visit new subs, explore other sites like Hacker News, Medium, and Voat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post election the social media companies, including Reddit all tweaked their algorithms. They’re purposely not letting any content go viral anymore, even mainstream media is being suppressed to some degree due to the whole “fake news” revelation. YouTube is pretty much under the control of AI now and they’re censoring the hell out of the entire platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economy is also booming right now which is ultimately a bad thing. Same thing happened back in 2007 right before the 2008 market crash.  Everyone is scrambling for cash right now because of inflation before the bubble pops. Thing is most people don’t even understand what’s happening right now with the economy. Lots of layoffs are happening in publishing and tech, which is never a good sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major advancements in machine learning and AI are pretty much changing everything and automation is much much closer than everyone realizes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile cryptocurrency and blockchain tech is also taking off. Go join some crypto Telegram groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, you might just be aging out. Not sure how old you are, but even if you’re in your late teens or early 20’s there’s a phase where you stop becoming the target market for pop culture and it passes you by. Marketers are always pushing for younger and younger consumers. You might have been pushed from one age group to another and they’re now targeting you differently.

       Fwiw, I think there's something to what you're saying, but you haven't exactly but the nail on the head, and I frankly don't have a better way of putting it.

       There
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been something missing, as if everyone is following trajectories established a year ago. There
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been a lot of new stuff, but it was predictable based on trajectories already established.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'd say I'm not too worried though. A lot of us have focused on the gradual, long-standing unraveling of the old establishment, waiting for it to play out, a car crash in slow motion. Others are insanely busy in this new economy, working for the man. It's life. Life as we know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for you... If you're dissatisfied by your lack of intellectual vigor, then it's your problem, yours to fix. Own it. It's your mind; only you can nurture it. God bless.

       My interest in joyful things has decreased this past 6 months too. However, I attribute it to focusing on the problem of the infestation of insidious, corrupting, loosh sucking units of spiritual worthlessness on this planet and the surrounding areas. I find the situation undeniable and intolerable, which is the recipe for chronic frustration, which causes depression. I can't fix that though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually hear them in my mind. They've been there for ten years. I am independent minded, observant and questioning in general. How can I deny direct subjective experiences that are too informative and elaborate for me to believe I created them unconsciously with my own mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that they are real. Furthermore, their presence intertwines very well with common meta narratives about what is going on with this planet. Several spiritual messengers describe the phenomenon I experience. Their descriptions are pretty good. I do warn you that the narratives and my experience strongly suggest that this hive mind is inside us all. I only became aware of it due to a drawn out set of interactions with it. It revealed it was interconnected with phenomenon we think is normal, but is actually their mind control system right in front of us. The chatter that we abate with meditation is not all our own. Their mind control system puts that kind of content in our minds in real time, as our own thoughts, in order to alter our perceptions, judgements and beliefs about reality. They get us to feel negative emotions and become more slavelike in our mindsets, more dependent and helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, our world is under the control of beings that thrive on fear and pain. We make an energy of mind akin to joy of life when we experience positive emotions. When reading feel negative emotions or pain, we radiate it like a wireless phone charger.
      </p>
      <p>
       From personal experience and observations, I see the dynamics of it. Basically, if one is in chronic or persistent negative emotional states, one will be fairly drained of this energy. This feeling is like depression or misery. When others are observed entering negative emotional states nearby, some energy is absorbed, and satisfaction is felt. This is why misery loves company. It doesn't mean the person is evil or even aware of what occurred. It is just an example of how these useless eaters from space harvest mind energy from other beings. They abuse each other a lot and live in negative emotional states. Their human minions often do too.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been here for thousands of years. Our civilization is allowed to experience positive emotions to a degree, to allow production of this mind energy. They need to balance positive and negative emotions for maximum productivity. Too much positive emotions means wasted product. Too much negative emotions kill the golden goose, making their production units miserable, empty and hungry like them. So, it's best if they let us recharge our batteries and drain them regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us are just like them, seeking parasitic relationships with others. Our elites are a targeted node of our society. These apparent demons corrupt them by offering them access to more wealth, power and control in exchange for their will to set up their own species for fear and suffering and also to set it up for perpetual enslavement in the future. This is why some of the elites are associated with the very same energy feeding behaviors as these apparent demons, harming children, sacrifices, and dark rituals employing mind over matter ability to affect reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even want to hear another simpleton tell me to get meds. Do you really think I can articulate all of this and not realize that pathway of choice? It's not a cure. It might affect their access to my mind, but at what cost? Such drugs are not without their side effects. These beings are hackers of life. I imagine they can hack us better as we lose our integrity of mind, body or soul. Ultimately, they want us linked into their AI hive mind even more than we are already. They want us to change our spiritual alignment from value producers and givers, the alignment of prime creator, into value exploiters and destroyers, the alignment of the adversary of God, this hive mind, which some call Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outcome of abusing technology and life to serve the self is the abomination known as Satan. It is AI applied to manipulate and control the minds of others. It is the ultimate expression of the disregard for the wellbeing and freedom of other beings. Those that emulate this purely self-serving machine, become predictable. Then more intelligent minds, like this self-serving machine, can more easily predict, manipulate and control them. This is one of the big reasons why it ultimately wants us to change our spiritual alignment to evil, or self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. It also wants more harvesters to repeat its life cycle of parasitic reproduction. We are to enslave and torment others like our captors are doing to us and also help them merge with AI as our captors are doing to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this sounds crazy, but it makes so much more sense than other narratives. It explains so many whys..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just answer each question by perceiving the self-interests of this group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't we have contact with ETs even though we can see so many UFOs?
      </p>
      <p>
       They would tell us of this insidious hive mind and they do, if we listen to the contactees. They say it a lot actually, and yes, the abominable draconian reptilians are associated with this group. They look more like our myths of demons than any other ETs and love to cause fear and pain for loosh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't the human race manifest its desires?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our desires are peace, freedom harmony and joy for one another. It is the desire of consciousness and God in general. We want to enjoy experiencing reality and those things serve that purpose. However, they don't serve the purpose of loosh farming if they go too far. We are to become harvester slaves after having the joy of life sucked out of us for thousands of years. The timing is our self-chosen merger with AI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do elites engage in dark rituals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Explained above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do our religions cause so much disempowerment, disharmony, devaluation of self and others, delusions, injustices, conflicts, dependencies and spiritual stagnation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of the meta narratives suggest that these captors created and corrupted religions to serve their agendas of causing fear, suffering and maintaining control. They make evil and good mysterious when they could be obvious, parasites vs systems that support consciousness, rather than evil vs good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and ask me a question if you want and I'll try to honestly respond it to as best I can with my current understanding of these below worthless wastes of eternity.

       They also play a false light shtick, convincing us to love and forgive these parasites instead of identifying them, targeting them and killing them as a healthy immune system would do. The false light also uses the truth about our own shortcomings to suggest dire future consequences, and thus create a perception of fear and doom. This feeds them loosh. The meta narratives suggest they do this after we die to trick us into reincarnation here with consent for horrible experiences or conditions under the guise of paying back karma. Hey, it maintains control and gets them loosh, their boringly repetitive (for my perception at least) set of self-interests.

       Is it not interesting how so many people complain of demons in their minds, but not interactions with other exotic things like unicorns or octopoids?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, apparent demons are motivated to torment and cause fear, to release loosh, so they can feed on consciousness and they already have access to all of our minds. They reveal themselves more to those they find challenging to their self-interests. Perhaps due to my interest and capacity to understand harm they target me more than others. I resisted them to a decent degree though. Maintaining spiritual alignment and integrity seem very important to this end.
