       This is mostly in regards to North America. It almost seems like modern society is completely disconnected to human biology. The fact that our bodies evolved to walk long distances and eat certain foods. All of it is completely ignored by the structure of our society.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Longs commutes
       </li>
       <li>
        Inactive meaningless work or active works that destroys your body
       </li>
       <li>
        Lack of family or tribe
       </li>
       <li>
        No walking
       </li>
       <li>
        High sugar diet
       </li>
       <li>
        Promotion of vegan diets (humans are omnivores)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So much of human biology is ignored or suppressed in our society. If you're poor you're unable to live a normal human life. People live in isolation, commuting 2 hours a day to sit at a desk for 8 hours and they live off of kraft macaroni.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then other parts of society exploit our biological weaknesses for things like sugar and social contact. Social media, soda pop, and everything else is just bad for you.

       Sort of true, but people ignore the fact that there's an entire generation of younger people trying desperately to move to dense urban areas. They want 15 minute commutes, easy access to peer groups, and collaborative jobs. They care about health, eat paleo, work out, and eschew car ownership.

       on the topic of diets - raw diets seem to be so incredibly popular.  all i can think about is how humans supposedly were able to grow their brains by cooking foods - which increased nutrients and the amount that can be absorbed by the body

       Alienation from the product of your labour is a result of the capitalist system comrade! When you only feel as if you were a cog in the machine that doesn't care about you then you begin to feel as if you're not in control of your own life. That totally sucks, to feel like a faceless drone who never sees the benefits of their work, you need some way to reunite the value of your labour with how it helps your community.

       You should seize the means of production, redistribute the wealth from its function to the workers, you will be able to live a better life, provide for your family more, make decisions about reinvesting in the workplace and as a horizontally-organized syndicate you can find out how your work helps other people!
      </p>
      <p>
       Educate your comrades on why they feel work sucks, agitate them on changing their lives, and

       It takes discipline, but you can do it. When people really decide to get into shape it's
       <em>
        On New Years Eve
       </em>
       of all times, usually a time of snow and staying inside (unless you live on the Southern Half of the World). But what really gets your discipline strict is a Workout Buddy, a comrade who will count reps, who can spot for you, who will SWEAT WITH YOU. Most people make the mistake of thinking they can discipline themselves starting a new year. Then they put too much weight on that decision, and one missed day means the next missed day. NO, the time is right NOW to exercise, the person who motivates you is your friend!
      </p>
      <p>
       Educate yourself on good workouts to do with friends, agitate your buds to show up, organize a party at the milestones!

       Join a pick up soccer game, find a group of common interests. There are tons of ways to find new friends, people are afraid to use them because we fear rejection. What if these strangers don't like me? Well the worst they can say is no, but you always lose if you don't try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Educate your pals on what you're missing, Agitate them to grow your group, Organize a mixer for everyone to bring new friends to!

       I work for a native non-profit community centre in Ottawa. But my contract is ending in January, I've already gotten it extended quite a bit. It started out as a placement for natives who had trouble getting jobs, mine was a lack of references since I had been out of the workforce for a few years so I needed reliable workplace references when I get a real job. It's generally cleaning up, some light labour when they get deliveries.

       He shouldn't need to if you were actually informed you'd know that dairy products cause huge spikes in iGF-1 causing massive amounts of growth in the body that has been directly linked to cancer growth. (for the layman, you body stays in 'growth mode' rather than 'repair mode' resulting in uncontrollable growth in cells)

       Meat that festers in our 'frugivore' gut, increases inflammation in the gut and the production of bad cholesterol in an attempt to clear the inflammation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-biotics in meat damage our microbiome resulting in an increase in 'toxins' crossing the gut lining into the blood stream resulting in allergies etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meat has been consistently found to be the number one cause of Heart Disease. There are very compelling arguments that it is the cause of diabetes (not sugar - do your research) and a major component of Alzheimers.

       Vegans across the board have the lowest rates of all cause mortality than any other diet type.

       I take one pill for vitamin B12 which is required since it's only found in animal products. I'm not bothered in the least by it, they are very cheap and the health benefits way overweigh that small inconvenience.

       Itâ€™s not designed to kill you, thatâ€™s just the byproduct. It is designed to use you, your work and labor, to be a consumer. Make money, spend money, spend more money, pay interest on the debt youâ€™re collecting, make more money to pay debt and interest. Youâ€™re being used to make those at the very top tons of money, while you make just enough to keep going. We were supposed to work 3 day weeks by the year 2000, but what would people do with all that free time, think? We donâ€™t want that, so instead they have made you a slave to work and money, so you canâ€™t retire until much later, at which point your stress, poor diet, no exercise etc have left you in a state where youâ€™ll probably die before you can actually enjoy your retirement. They need us to be their worker bees, their worker ants, they need us docile and tired.. too tired to think, too tired to protest, too tired to realize that a shitty deal we have. Drive to work, work, eat fast food, drive home, watch propaganda or programming, sleep, repeat. The side product is an early grave, but that is not the goal, the goal is too use you to make those at the top more money, so they can better control your children.

       All great points except the vegan thing. Factory farming is huge and will never go away. Think about it, cows being trucked down the highway going 75 miles an hour. That seems insane to me. It is what it is, but I'd rather get my meat down the street at the local butcher.
It isn't a matter of needing meat more than just needing protein. Beans, tofu, etc all have high protein. I admire vegans. The ones who recognize that animals have feelings. I say this while I'll be eating a whole pork tenderloin tonight, by myself. I'm no better.
