        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is mostly in regards to North America. It almost seems like modern society is completely disconnected to human biology. The fact that our bodies evolved to walk long distances and eat certain foods. All of it is completely ignored by the structure of our society.</p>

<ul>
<li>Longs commutes</li>
<li>Inactive meaningless work or active works that destroys your body</li>
<li>Lack of family or tribe</li>
<li>No walking</li>
<li>High sugar diet</li>
<li>Promotion of vegan diets (humans are omnivores)</li>
</ul>

<p>So much of human biology is ignored or suppressed in our society. If you&#39;re poor you&#39;re unable to live a normal human life. People live in isolation, commuting 2 hours a day to sit at a desk for 8 hours and they live off of kraft macaroni. </p>

<p>Then other parts of society exploit our biological weaknesses for things like sugar and social contact. Social media, soda pop, and everything else is just bad for you. </p>

<p>Promotion of vegan diets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not seeing this one OP, I see vegans and vegetarians made fun of more than I see them promoting their lifestyle. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inactive meaningless work or active works that destroys your body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alienation from the product of your labour is a result of the capitalist system comrade! When you only feel as if you were a cog in the machine that doesn&#39;t care about you then you begin to feel as if you&#39;re not in control of your own life. That totally sucks, to feel like a faceless drone who never sees the benefits of their work, you need some way to reunite the value of your labour with how it helps your community. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx&#x27;s_theory_of_alienation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx&#39;s_theory_of_alienation</a></p>

<p>You should seize the means of production, redistribute the wealth from its function to the workers, you will be able to live a better life, provide for your family more, make decisions about reinvesting in the workplace and as a horizontally-organized syndicate you can find out how your work helps other people! </p>

<p>Educate your comrades on why they feel work sucks, agitate them on changing their lives, and <code>O R G A N I Z E</code>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No walking</p>

<p>High sugar diet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes discipline, but you can do it. When people really decide to get into shape it&#39;s <em>On New Years Eve</em> of all times, usually a time of snow and staying inside (unless you live on the Southern Half of the World). But what really gets your discipline strict is a Workout Buddy, a comrade who will count reps, who can spot for you, who will SWEAT WITH YOU. Most people make the mistake of thinking they can discipline themselves starting a new year. Then they put too much weight on that decision, and one missed day means the next missed day. NO, the time is right NOW to exercise, the person who motivates you is your friend! </p>

<p>Educate yourself on good workouts to do with friends, agitate your buds to show up, organize a party at the milestones!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lack of family or tribe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Join a pick up soccer game, find a group of common interests. There are tons of ways to find new friends, people are afraid to use them because we fear rejection. What if these strangers don&#39;t like me? Well the worst they can say is no, but you always lose if you don&#39;t try. </p>

<p>Educate your pals on what you&#39;re missing, Agitate them to grow your group, Organize a mixer for everyone to bring new friends to!</p>

<p>Humans are not baby cows... </p>

<p>Meat that festers in our &#39;frugivore&#39; gut, increases inflammation in the gut and the production of bad cholesterol in an attempt to clear the inflammation. </p>

<p>The anti-biotics in meat damage our microbiome resulting in an increase in &#39;toxins&#39; crossing the gut lining into the blood stream resulting in allergies etc.</p>

<p>Meat has been consistently found to be the number one cause of Heart Disease. There are very compelling arguments that it is the cause of diabetes (not sugar - do your research) and a major component of Alzheimers.</p>

Youâ€™re being used to make those at the very top tons of money, while you make just enough to keep going. We were supposed to work 3 day weeks by the year 2000, but what would people do with all that free time, think? We donâ€™t want that, so instead they have made you a slave to work and money, so you canâ€™t retire until much later, at which point your stress, poor diet, no exercise etc have left you in a state where youâ€™ll probably die before you can actually enjoy your retirement. They need us to be their worker bees, their worker ants, they need us docile and tired.. too tired to think, too tired to protest, too tired to realize that a shitty deal we have. Drive to work, work, eat fast food, drive home, watch propaganda or programming, sleep, repeat. The side product is an early grave, but that is not the goal, the goal is too use you to make those at the top more money, so they can better control your children. </p>

It isn&#39;t a matter of needing meat more than just needing protein. Beans, tofu, etc all have high protein. I admire vegans. The ones who recognize that animals have feelings. I say this while I&#39;ll be eating a whole pork tenderloin tonight, by myself. I&#39;m no better.  </p>
