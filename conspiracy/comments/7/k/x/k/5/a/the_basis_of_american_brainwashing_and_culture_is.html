       Putting wealth, profiteering above ALL OTHER VALUES is a horrible critical mistake of American society and is the basis of whats wrong with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychologically, this has RUINED American HAPPINESS.
      </p>
      <p>
       While money/material posessions ARE important, so is original culture, personal relations, friendships. None of those really exist in US - all that matters to them here is class divide/wealth/personal achievement - that has produced a COUNTRY OF MISERABLE PEOPLE

       Money is unimportant but it is also necessary to get by in this world.

      <p>
       However it does destroy. I mean the fiat system of course. The barter system has a currency of true value attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm lucky that i sometimes get to use the barter system in my work. I happen to have a client base that i also rely on for services at times. I really mean it when i say that barter transactions are the soothest, hassle free contracts that i ever enter into.

       Yeah but lets be honest, miserable with money is easier than miserable with none.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i agree with you, wealth is not something to be jealous of.  Jealousy in itself is not a good state for us. People's achievments should drive our competitive nature instead.

       the bottom line is you are miserable EITHER WAY in US. I've been living here for 20+ years and I am MISERABLE and UNHAPPY.
      </p>

       this is while i had a very happy childhood growing up in soviet union where we were not rich. things that made me happy was the environment, nice people, friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       here in US, people are shitty and mean and I've never been happy even if i had millions. i think i lost the ability to even be happy.

       You say you've looked at Canada, trying looking harder at Montreal. I honestly believe its one of the few cities i could feel comfortable in... but the winters are harsh.

       I hear what you are saying. It's depressing that financial success is considered the measure of a person's value.  The US has a decent score on the world happiness index. So, I'm not this phenomenon is destroying the culture of the US or any other Western country. Still, it is an unhealthy way of thinking. I have hope younger generation will redefine how success is measures. Where practices like helping others and giving back to the community is given more weight than simply how much money you earn.
