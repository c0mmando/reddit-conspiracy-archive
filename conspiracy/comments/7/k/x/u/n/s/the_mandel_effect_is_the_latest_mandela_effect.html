       Ok folks I keep having my mind blown uncovering things I Should have seen before regarding the effect and the keywords of the effect. Like sophia the AI who was booted up on 9-23-2015 .  I searched so many paths regarding Sophia and AI and did not stumble across her until a couple months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I went to retconned and saw a couple posts on flipflops
      </p>
      <p>
       Fruit loops in now froot loops and flinstones is now flintstones. I went searching for back posts of people declaring fruit loops or fruit loops, because all it would take is one post saying omg look at this its FRUIT LOOPS and then have people in the thread be like oh yeah it is that's wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they only go back 10 months.... im pretty sure its been mentioned before then. So I went to the Mandela effect board to check its backlogs as its older. But for some odd reason instead of searching in reddit I searched in google........
      </p>
      <p>
       I misspelled the word MANDEL EFFECT. Boom

       Ok folks this is some wild stuff. NONE of the research I have seen on the mandela effect and quantum computing mentions the mandel effect. ALTHOUGH there are MANY typos in articles talking about dwave

       How is it that no one stumbled across this before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it be hilarious to say the Mandel effect is a Mandela effect. Kinda like those animals you've never seen before that you find out about.

       So its apparently about the duality of light and that over lap between the 1 and 0 in a superposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm......

      </p>
      <p>
       The 1 and 0 in the circles with the overlap being the eye shaped “both states at the same time” mode. The mandorla is about duality and the unified balance point of the overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all put together so beautifully. As the double slit experiment was the precursor to this and this is the foundational discovery that brought quantum computing into being. Its all about the interaction between light and matter!!!

       This number is key to many things. But why is it that this number is in the bible? Encoded directly into the tetragrammaton.

       What does it look like too you? Pi 7 pi 7? Now what happens when we do these simple equations......
      </p>
      <p>
       (π7)/(π
       <sup>
        7)
       </sup>
       and (π
       <sup>
        7)/(π7)
       </sup>
       (π
       <sup>
        7)
       </sup>
       / (π7) = 137.3413133 
(π7) / (π
       <sup>
        7)
       </sup>
       = 0.007281
      </p>
      <p>
       Hot Damn! Both the FSC and its reciprocal. So lets add gravity to the mix for the Trinity of Gravity Light and Matter
      </p>
      <p>
       ((7
       <sup>
        π)
       </sup>
       / (7π)) * 6.67 OR ((7π) / (7
       <sup>
        π))
       </sup>
       / 6.67
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets look at the first one ((7
       <sup>
        π)
       </sup>
       / (7π)) * 6.67 = 137.0350666 
The FSC is 137.035999 and what we see is a 0 after the 035 which is like a pause and then you have a flipped 999 in the form of 666
      </p>
      <p>
       ((7π) / (7
       <sup>
        π))
       </sup>
       / 6.67 = 0.007297 which is yet closer to the accurate FSC reciprocal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the math but its important to show the potency of this stuff.  The FSC is a lower case greek alpha symbol

       which looks like a Jesus fish/mandorla.

       And of course the first appearance of the tetragrammeton was.EXODUS  3. 14 and 15 3.1415 is PI

       This is a lovely breakdown of Dark souls and symbology in general... the cycles loops and recursive fractals they are talking about echoes some of my previous writings. Even if you don't like dark souls a good read. And not just about the game but about the game as a cultural..... thing.... just read it, and the only reason I found it was he separated the words mandel and brot.

       I'll be honest, I'm not even ready to read this whole thing, but I can assure you it has always been FROOT LOOPS and FLINTSTONES. Just like all that other Mandela hooplah - they are just a bunch of common misquoted things. Memory isn't perfect and the brain fills in gaps (it's like those things where you can take out a bunch of random letters in a paragraph but still read it perfectly). Regardless, I will humor you and actually read all this at some point since it looks like you at least put some work in.

       Thank you I appreciate your honesty..... I wouldn't believe it if i hadn't experienced it for myself. but yeah when i first found out about the effect I saw every search engine and picture spelled fruit loops... it was shocking and alarming.... then a couple months later it is as it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing i like most about the mandela effect is it is an interesting study on humans. Like how culturally and collectively we can missremember something the same way. The fact that certain facets of inane pop culture are brought to attention of the cultural gestalt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mandela effect exists as a cultural phenominon weather you think things are changing or universes or colliding or whatever source you apply it too. I see the effect as a type of dream where you can analyze the components and learn things about society and your self.

       Similarly it's alwats been the Flintstones. Flint is a kind of stone, you see. There's no word "flin."
      </p>
      <p>
       You were just a dumb kid, there's no parallel world where Flintstones is misspelled and Froot Loops doesn't have the rings.

       Thank you for sharing your perspective. A perspective i shared until i saw a flip flop.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It has always been Froot Loops, with the O's made of pictures of cereal."
      </p>
      <p>
       I know right the O's were in froot! which was why is so freaking shocking about a year and a half ago when i heard that it had changed to fruit. I went to Google/bing/yahoo image search and popped it in. Froot loops.... "Did you mean fruit loops"
      </p>
      <p>
       No i typed froot loops but ok......
      </p>
      <p>
       I then saw pages of fruit loop boxes, on shelves, screencapped in commercials, all spelled with fruit!
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash forward a couple months and i hear about the term "Flip flop "for the first time. i initiate the same searches and boom back to froot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flintstones is how i remember it and can see how it could be confused. I don't think your getting the gist of what im getting across here. I did not say there are different universes that have the other spellings that people have collectively missremembered. People experiancing the effect have reported this theory, along with 100's of other theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that the mandela effect at a base level weather it is happening or not is still the most incredible study of human memory/language and cultural "Filling in the blanks"
      </p>
      <p>
       "You were just a dumb kid,"
      </p>
      <p>
       exactly and the prevalence of so many "Dumb kids"  and the cultural collective consciousness helps to highlight these inane pop culture things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just marvel in the synchronicity that Mandela effect researchers were looking at Cern, Ai and Quantum computing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet NOONE notice the Mandel effect?! and that it is the key discovery that allowed for quantum computing to exist in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That this was stumbled across due too a mistyping or misspelling has all the irony in the world! Lighten up man It doesn't matter what the spelling is, im just pointing out the things that are highlighted by the cultural spotlights. The Mandela effect just happens to be the most creative in its metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many effects have you looked into? you gotta catch yourself when you get hung up on a single point of contention. Let go and then trey and follow the rest and come back to it later.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your point of view is safe and comfortable the same way people are sure of the religion. If you close all the doors you don't have to worry about exploring those dark and unknown paths. When you receive data you also want the how and why of it.  But with this type of research the how and why is constantly shifting and settling on a point. If you already determine the how and why of a thing you are giving your final answer and closing the door.

       Challenge your belief.  Only one of two things can happen. 1. You either strengthen that belief through analysis. or 2. You realize the belief wasn't accurate and thus it wasn't needed. Growth is the goal.

       I always challenge my beliefs, but the thing is, there is no evidence of the Mandela effect. That's why it's funny you say my beliefs are a religion. I have evidence it's always been called Froot Loops, I have evidence it's the Flintstones. I have seen it with my own eyes, and also all historical evidence points to that.

       You are saying your consciousness has moved between different universes. So what happened to the original consciousness here? Did you swap places?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all unproveable. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but I have no evidence to suggest you aren't just a crazy person. Look back over your posts, it looks like the Timecube person. I mean, Jesus Christ, you are saying that the tetragrammaton (יהוה) looks like "pi 7 pi 7" despite the fact that Arabic numerals hadn't even been invented at the time the Bible was written, and the letter pi was only used starting a few hundred years ago. ‬

       The "evidence" of the Mandela effect are the thousand of people who have experienced facets of it. There are dozens of subreddits and blogs around the internet. You are saying it doesn't exist because its a bunch of confused people, but the fact these confused people are synchronizing is a peculiar phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said the evidence was your own eyes. All i have are thousands of accounts that are similar to mine regarding froot loops being fruit and the returning to froot.

       I am not suggesting this but many people have suggested this hypothesis due to the experience they were having. based on the information and level of effects they had experienced this theory became a popular explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect is not limited to the stuff under the name "Mandela effect" Synchronicity and collective consciousness is a key component. there have been many synchronistic experience with fellow redditors and people in my life that i have brought this up too.

       An episcopal church in 1868 acknowledged the similarities.

       This is my point precisely pi and 7 weren't actually things that were around when Hebrew was written. This increases the improbability by a huge factor. As if Pi and 7 were around then you could just say well they planned it that way. but then you have to contend with them not knowing the FSC.... so what are you left with?

       I don't think he was being serious.... His research didn't show any connective tissue or explanation of his theories. Also with no other researchers to contribute..... That appears to be a parody..... Including the clintons at that time in history was a wink that he was pulling everyone's leg.

       These are similar yet cohesive and when viewed in totallum has a solid foundation. All of these types of thought process require a stepping back and observing the whole thing.
      </p>

       "A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear."

        This doesn't even make sense, you're interpreting the number in base 10, but there is nothing about base 10 that is fundamental to physics.

       its simple.... a 666 is a reverse 999. and how many fingers do you have, how many toes. Base 10 is tied to mankind thus why we use it.

       The point of the post in not to talk about flintstones and froot loops, it is about the coincidences, step back and throw aside anger and just think about it. What a damn good story.

       you are 100% correct.  Before Bergson vs Einstein there was Binet vs Mach.  The whole quantum paradox is a byproduct born from refusal to acknowledge the so-called "brain wave".  At least that's what the inventor of The IQ test called it.   By 1908 "relativity" as concept had begun to slough it's psycho-social meaning in favor of a strictly physical one: and so a million froot mysteries were born. At the time this debate was so important that it splintered the czarist opposition in Russia, forestalling revolution .... until Lenin had a brainwave of his own to write epistemology so thick even Newt Gingrich can get off on it.
