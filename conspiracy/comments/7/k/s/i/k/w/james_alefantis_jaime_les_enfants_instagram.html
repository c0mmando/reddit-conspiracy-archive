        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday I made two posts regarding pedogate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kdwaq/the_evidence_is_right_in_front_of_our_eyes_folks/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kdwaq/the_evidence_is_right_in_front_of_our_eyes_folks/</a></p>

<p>From those two posts a debate on the lifestyle and art preferences of the Podesta&#39;s and James Alefantis came up.</p>

<p>A photo was presented to the users in the post:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/I4zrA">https://imgur.com/a/I4zrA</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> linked my posts and came to brigade to try to control the narrative. They tried to get me to post more pictures as if they haven&#39;t seen the uncovered photos before. I wanted to see where the convo would go in regards to this particular photo.</p>

<p>With the photo that was presented, they tried to downplay any connection that it might have to pedophilia and said that the photos are representations of war by the artist. They also said that because Podesta only owns two of those paintings, that the creepiness of the rest shouldn&#39;t be considered. They further tried to put words in my mouth and accused me of being aroused by these photos and said that I apperently find them sexual, implying that there&#39;s nothing sexual about them. Well OK...</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a look here shall we?</p>

<p>I will be tagging the users that participated in the post yesterday and I would like them to try justify these photos in the same manner that they did yesterday with the other. I mean they did technically ask for more photos.</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of justification they will have for normalizing these ones.</p>

<p>edit: well this is getting interesting<br/>

<p>If there is something pedo in nature about them then we can establish that James and Podesta share a pedo lifestyle, a fact many are still trying to deny. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s so artistic about the photos on Instagram for you. That&#39;s what I want to know. Could you tell me what&#39;s artistic in the photos in the link that I provided? Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were actually three Djurdjevic paintings that Podesta displayed on his walls:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/h2dY2sy.png">Biljana Djurdjevic, &quot;School Girl&quot;, 2005, Paradise Lost series</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lTK0UBH.png">Biljana Djurdjevic, &quot;Synchronized Swimming&quot;, 2007/2008, Living in Oblivion Series</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0vekdCZ.png">Biljana Djurdjevic, &quot;Moor&quot;, 2010, Hotbed series</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The art in Tony Podesta&#39;s home was featured in <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">this June 2015 article</a>. I&#39;ve collected the images from that in <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2enor">this imgur album</a>. There&#39;s quite a range of art, including the three paintings by Djurdjevic.</p>

<p>Tony Podesta and his then-wife Heather had a vast collection of art, numbering more than 2000 museum-quality works at its peak, before they divorced.</p>

<p>Here are some works from their collection:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/a/mbNkA">Album 1</a> - Many from the <a href="https://nmwa.org/">National Museum of Women in the Arts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Gdlol">Album 2</a> - From the <a href="http://hirshhorn.si.edu/search-results/?edan_search_value=podesta&amp;amp;edan_search_button=Search+Collection">Hirshhorn Museum</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/zOujY">Album 3</a> - From the <a href="http://www.phillipscollection.org/search?i=1&amp;amp;tpc_q=Podesta&amp;amp;q1=Collection&amp;amp;x1=tpc_type">Phillips Collection</a> (Many more at that link.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/collection-search-result.html?donorList=23184&amp;amp;donorObj=150546&amp;amp;artobj_imagesonly=Images_online&amp;amp;pageNumber=1&amp;amp;lastFacet=artobj_imagesonly">National Gallery Art pieces from the Podesta Collection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s a wide variety of art. A few pieces in his collection have disturbing themes, but I dare anybody to explain in complete sentences what&#39;s wrong with that. Some of the most popular art has disturbing themes.</p>

<p>Literally about the same level of logic you put into connecting the dots of this &#39;conspiracy&#39; don&#39;t know why I&#39;m surprised.</p>

<p>And no, it doesn&#39;t make it look pretty bad. They have a creepy room in their workplace, they refer to it as kill-room as a joke, someone drew a coffin on it and labelled it as a joke. You can&#39;t present that evidence &quot;in combination&quot; with the allegations, because they&#39;re not allegations from victims, authority figures, or anyone who knows this guy. They&#39;re coming from your bullshit. They don&#39;t make an innocuous drawing more suspicious. </p>

<p>Look... if you&#39;re really not the same person I apologize, sincerely. I didn&#39;t have time to read through all the comments. I had reason to believe so due to a) the name obviously, and b) the way you replied to me. Pretty similar, for someone with totally different views from OP.</p>

<p>And some people just want to watch the world burn, by playing multiple roles. I&#39;ve seen it all. OP strikes me as this kind of person.</p>

I mean, because I dissented with you and had fart in my username you immediately made the connection that I must be an alt of OP and tried to call me out for it.

<p>Just take a step back and look at your comments, you need to think more about logic and reason than what you think must be right. Just because a connection between two things can be made doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a connection (i.e. my username being similar to OP does not make me an alt. Someone liking art you find creepy does not make them a pedo)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said down below, Antinous was Hadrians lover when he was a teenager as was common at the time.</p>

<p>He&#39;s one of the earliest gay icons because Hadrian made him a God after he died, which was rather unusual. I don&#39;t think using one image of a statue as an avatar is indicative of child abuse. </p>

<p>Furthermore the bottom image in that meme with John Podesta with &quot;cultish symbology&quot; was actually for a campaign to protect the oceans.</p>

<p>Podesta even mentions GG14 as being his favorite of the goals in one of the emails. </p>

I see the big picture too, I just don’t see these goodballs in it (with the evidence presented so far), and I think it hinders the cause to continue to true defend pizzagate so vehemently (as the evidence currently stands) because it distracts from other more plausible (based on the evidence presented so far) cases out there. Basically pizzagate sucks up all the oxygen in the room. If people talked about the Franklin Coverup to anywhere near the degree they did pizzagate you would convince a lot more people that your cause is serious (which it is, I just think pizzagate isn’t convincing, to me). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are The False Accusations?  Listen to the interview of The Hacker, who found the Heaps of Childporn, as well as Other disgusting stuff, in a super protected area of the Comet Ping Pong website.  The guy who hacked it, dropped it in the laps of the DC Police, Nothing happened.  Dropped it in the laps of the Fbi, they did nothing.  Then, shortly after he checks in, to offer help in how to access the disgusting shit, An Obvious false flag happens, wherein a &quot;gunman&quot; walks in with an assault rifle, fires a single shot that somehow penetrates through the office door, at  an impossible angle, ultimately landing in the hard drive of the server/computer that was the host to the CP.  Then, the hacker  starts having ops run against him, people breaking into his house, and other crazy shit starting to happen.  If you think The Comet PingPong/Pizza Gate thing is a bust, then you A.) haven&#39;t done your due diligence, or B.) are a shill paid to ridicule it out of the public eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, but the hacker in question conveyed that there were hundreds of pictures/videos, so much so that he was reluctant to showcase any of it, and was extremely careful in how he brought it forth to Law Enforcement.  </p>

<p>Also, were it simply the situation as you&#39;ve described, I would question why they (alefantis &amp; the others implicated) didn&#39;t use that as their defense and shine more light on that .  </p>

<p>The repercussions that were experienced by the Hacker, At least in my opinion, certainly point to a coordinated effort by a  professional organization, seeking to scare someone off from continuing any further.  </p>

<p>Highly unlikely, and has no evidence other than some guy on 4chan saying it happened.</p>

<p>What&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; about the angle of the shot? Also, there is no evidence that the round hit the hard drive, and the point of entry seen in the photos is not where the hard drive would be located.</p>

<p>Clinton emails on the &#39;Orphan rescue missions&#39; by Silsby: 
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776</a></p>

<p>So they were allegedly &#39;rescuing&#39; orphans, right? Ok. 
If your argument that Silsby was &#39;trying to save them&#39;, why was she caught smuggling them across borders? Didn&#39;t the Clinton Foundation raise funds to set up orphanages and schools IN HAITI for orphans? 
Allegedly, yes. 
But it&#39;s well known that these were never built: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation">http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation</a></p>

<p>Why? 
So they could be smuggled out and sold off. That&#39;s why. </p>

<p>It is also known that sex trafficking was a big problem in Haiti after the 2010 quake:

<blockquote>
<p>Children are also trafficked out of Haiti by organizations claiming to be adoption agencies, into countries including the US—but some are actually kidnapped from their families.[98] This practice was particularly widespread in the chaos following the 2010 earthquake.[98] While women migrants were vulnerable during this time, the situation of children was underscored because of the phenomenon of irregular adoptions (one facet of human trafficking) of supposed “orphans” through the Dominican Republic.[99] International outcry arose when on January 29, 2010, ten members of the American New Life Children&#39;s Refuge were arrested trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country to an orphanage—but the children were not orphans.[85] Traffickers pretending to be workers from legitimate charitable organizations have been known to trick refugee families, convincing them that their children would be taken to safety and cared for.[100] In some cases, traffickers run &quot;orphanages&quot; or &quot;care facilities&quot; for children that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate organizations.[101]  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Haiti#Children">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Haiti#Children</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a well researched and referenced Harvard paper on the Laura Silsby, Clinton connected trafficking scandal in Haiti:

Notice that the first page of results shows basically NO MAINSTREAM SOURCES covering it. Conspiracy of silence. </p>

<p>So yeah, when you say </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge case was not ignored by the media; it was a big diplomatic incident at the time, and one that US and Haitian politicians wanted sorted. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was kept informed about it, which is only to be expected, and one journalist reported that Bill Clinton may have helped broker a diplomatic solution. No one has ever provided a shred of evidence that Silsby wasn&#39;t actually trying to help those children, in a misguided, do-gooder Christian way.</p>

<p>That is complete and utter bullshit. And when I link you to this image - <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram_files/12461e4276e4328ec96d4184df457283a8dbb33c.png">https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram_files/12461e4276e4328ec96d4184df457283a8dbb33c.png</a>
...and indicate to you that dr.nwo&#39;s &quot;Whip up a Haitian special, extra cheese&quot; shows that this individual was aware of the children being shipped out of Haiti and trafficked into the US - I AM FUCKING RIGHT. YOU ARE WRONG. Okay? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>But we keep seeing the same rehased debunked claims thrown around as &quot;isn&#39;t this <em>weird</em>?&quot; without context that explains it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis (J&#39;aime les enfants)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very title of this thread references the similarities between his name and &quot;j&#39;aime les enfants&quot; which literally means NOTHING.  It&#39;s nothing.  Obviously his parents didn&#39;t name him after his adult perversion translated to French. </p>

<p>Then people show that picture from his instagram where he&#39;s wearing the shirt that says &quot;J&#39;[pink heart image] L&#39;Enfants&quot; or &quot;J&#39;[love] L&#39;Enfants&quot; and say &quot;Well isn&#39;t this <em>weird</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>But they leave out the context, that the picture was tagged at a literal Cafe called L&#39;Enfant Cafe, a French cafe that presumably didn&#39;t think giving out shirts that say, &quot;I love [this cafe]&quot; was a bad idea.</p>

<p>And even if all of that wasn&#39;t true, and he is actually a POS child sex criminal, WHY WOULD HE WEAR THAT SHIRT?  Jared Fogel never wore any well fitting new smaller jeans that said, &quot;I wanna touch kids&quot; on them.  Criminals don&#39;t just put their crimes on their shirts and upload them to Instagram.  </p>

<p>But every single time Pizzagate and Alefantis is mentioned, someone will mention this connection and it is debunked bullshit.  </p>

<p>So why keep mentioning it and getting annoyed when people call out bullshit information?  If he&#39;s so obviously guilty, why the need to make this shit up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually when someone thinks something is &quot;complete bullshit&quot;, they don&#39;t spend all of their time on reddit arguing against it. </p>

<p>I think the flat earth theory is complete bullshit. I have never once wasted my thought, time, or energy trying to &quot;debunk&quot; it. It&#39;s not worth it. If people want to believe the earth is flat, they can go ahead and do so. If they are stupid enough to buy into that, there&#39;s no hope for them anyway.</p>

<p>So the real question is; Why do you care so much about whether or not people believe pizza gate? You seem to waste an awful lot of time and effort arguing against this. </p>

<p>Well, I do. Or at least, I have been for the past week or so.</p>

<p>Why do you care why I care? Why I care doesn&#39;t matter. What does matter is that Pizzagate is demonstrably false, and I&#39;m tired of seeing it constantly pushed to the front page of a subreddit that should be giving more attention to things that are potentially real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to go all crazy, but these pizzagate kids cannot ever have seen an instagram account before. I went back and looked at a compilation of pics from Alefantis&#39; account, and I started feeling disgusted with myself because it felt like I was creeping on some guy I didn&#39;t know. Nothing out of the ordinary for a gay/gay-friendly pizza shop owner. Nothing.</p>

<p>How this dude&#39;s life has been twisted to try and represent some sort of vast conspiracy to rape and murder children is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>My favorite example is the girl taped to the table. The instant I saw it, I chuckled, because I&#39;ve been in restaurants with over-exuberant toddlers, and I know what a nightmare it can be for parents to try and control them. Somehow, this light-hearted joke about taking a &#39;break&#39; from your kids is some sort of pedophile symbol for bondage rape.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking sick, and it&#39;s behavior that should be ridiculed resoundingly from every direction until they slink back into the cesspool of paranoia from whence they came.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gay and I would never dream of putting so many pictures of sex right alongside so many pictures of kids, some of them taped to tables, to say nothing of the amount of pizza references. </p>

<p>You know why I wouldn&#39;t do any of that? Because though I&#39;m gay, I&#39;m not a fucking pedophile. That much sex does not reasonably belong in the vicinity of so many kids. Also, the Alefantis instagram had many, MANY different children on it. I&#39;ve been around plenty of my friends&#39; kids but I would never in a million years dream of taking pictures of them and putting them on my instagram alongside pictures of dicks cumming pizzas into the air and &#39;art&#39; hanging in galleries that is simply porn masquerading as art. 
Nor would I tend to have friends commenting on my pictures with KNOWN pedophile code words like chickenlovers. I highly doubt anyone would ask me to &#39;whip up&#39; a &#39;Haitian special&#39;. </p>

<p>Have you looked at what &quot;#Chickenlovers&quot; goes to on Instagram? Pictures of chicken and people eating chicken.

<p>And no, it isn&#39;t &#39;sad&#39;. Here&#39;s a piece of reality you seem to blatantly ignore: THE INTERNET IS FULL OF PEDOPHILES. 
How is it appropriate for some random gay dude to post dozens of pictures of other peoples&#39; kids onto platform riddled with pedophiles? Even if you assume that Alefantis isn&#39;t one (which he is, he even fucking ADMITTED IT ON CAMERA) -- it is STILL NOT APPROPRIATE for him to be distributing pictures of other peoples&#39; kids. 
I have never even taken a picture of a friends child. Not appropriate for anyone to do that. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t give a rats ass what #chickenlovers goes to on instagram.  It&#39;s a known pedophile code word for people who like to fuck INFANTS. Funny that it would be used as a hashtag on a picture of a guy clutching an INFANT to his chest.  </p>

<p>I mean, how the hell can you defend an image like this? <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram_files/12461e4276e4328ec96d4184df457283a8dbb33c.png">https://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/james-alefantis-instagram_files/12461e4276e4328ec96d4184df457283a8dbb33c.png</a></p>

<p>It is abundantly clear to anyone who is not a mouth breathing troglodyte moron of gargantuan proportions that there is a child sex trafficking ring operating in Hollywood. Clinton&#39;s and Podesta&#39;s are UNDOUBTEDLY involved. James Alefantis&#39; connections to both of them make him HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS. </p>

<p>Hell, even ping pong is a known pedo code for passing kids around. </p>

<p>Look, you&#39;re either someone who does the research and learns about all the connections and the many, MANY LAYERS of sick shit to Alefantis, or you&#39;re a dumb ass who reads the Washington Post&#39;s &#39;debunk&#39; - which blatantly ignored all of the information - and Hillary&#39;s tragic and seemingly ENDLESS book tour commentaries on it and parrots the bullshit narrative of propaganda that the fake news media and GUILTY PARTIES endless spew.

<p>The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge case was not ignored by the media; it was a big diplomatic incident at the time, and one that US and Haitian politicians wanted sorted. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was kept informed about it, which is only to be expected, and one journalist reported that Bill Clinton <em>may</em> have helped broker a diplomatic solution. No one has ever provided a shred of evidence that Silsby wasn&#39;t actually trying to help those children, in a misguided, do-gooder Christian way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it though?  Are these types of people &#39;entertaining for you&#39;?  Is it entertaining for you that they believe in pederasty?  </p>

<p>Someone like you is going to make a case that you &#39;stand for change&#39; while defending their rights to predation in your society and upon your children?  </p>

<p>You know, recently there was a case involving 7 jewish men of different nationalities (supposedly &#39;Italian&#39; and &#39;Russian&#39;) who ran a snuff/porn ring out of Italy.  They found 2-3 yo Indo-European children, either in orphanages or stole them from their parents in public spaces and videotaped themselves raping and then murdering them in ways that were so awful that the police investigating the pedo ring wanted to quit their jobs because they had viewed the films...I am paraphrasing but one of them said that &#39;the screaming seemed to go on forever&#39;.  The (((Associated Press))) decided not to run the story in the US because it, in their words, &#39;might bias Americans against the Jews&#39;...I will let you think on that one for a while and your RIDICULOUS self righteous BULLSHIT.</p>

<p>I am NOT &#39;comforted&#39; by your &#39;inability to tell right from wrong&#39; in this situation and also your &#39;inability to stand up for child victims&#39; or even what is BASICALLY MORAL BEHAVIOR.  </p>

<p>These pedophile FREAKS want to say that this behavior is part of their culture...THEN THEY NEED TO GO HOME WHERE THEY CAN PRACTICE IT ON THEIR OWN CHILDREN; NOT ON OURS.</p>

<h1>According to the Babylonian Talmudic Encyclopedia:</h1>

<p>&#39;He who has carnal knowledge of the wife of a Gentile is not liable to the death penalty, for it is written: &quot;thy fellow&#39;s wife&quot; rather than the alien&#39;s wife; and even the precept that a man &quot;shall cleave unto his wife&quot; which is addressed to the Gentiles does not apply to a Jew, just there is no matrimony for a heathen; and although a married Gentile woman is forbidden to the Gentiles, <strong>in any case a Jew is exempted</strong>.&#39; This does not imply that sexual inter-course between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman is permitted - quite the contrary.</p>

<p><strong>But the main punishment is inflicted on the Gentile woman; she must be executed, even if she was raped by the Jew: &#39;If a Jew has coitus with a Gentile woman, whether she be a child of three...</strong></p>

<p><em>(why are they [RAPING] &#39;having sex&#39; with three year old gentiles and then murdering them...hmmm, IDK perhaps because they are POS cocksucking murderers in our midst? Maybe?)</em></p>

<p>...or an adult, whether married or unmarried, and even if he is a minor aged only nine years and one day - because <strong>he had willful coitus with her, she must be killed, as is the case with a beast, because through her a Jew got into trouble.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Another worthy email from the Podesta leaks saying “do not forward” where it had Hillary’s Logo in the attachment with a pizza slice in it with Comet Ping Pong’s name. Here is the imagePNG</p>

<p>&quot;The family friendly&quot; Restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, is owned by, James AlefantisJPG AKA Jimmy Comet. His instagram has unusual pictures such as a child taped to a ping pong tablePNG, Joking about a kill room, calling a baby a hotardPNG, a baby picture with chicken lover commentPNG, child with money in their mouthPNG , baby doll for sale with comments saying it’s overpricedPNG.

<p>Jimmy Comet also posted a picture on his instagram of Podesta’s Arch of hysteria sculpture on from when he visted his house, a picture of satan, and spiritcooking queen herself (marina abramovic)PNG.</p>

<p>His instagram profile picture is a sculpture of Antinous, which resembles erotic love for adolescent boys.</p>

<p>The last known sighting of this child is the picture of her taped down whilst Pizzaboy photographs her.</p>

<p>The only places I&#39;ve seen discuss it are Youtube and Reddit. They are discussed in really niche places that most people don&#39;t go to even if they visit the sites.</p>

<p>Facebook may spread it if you&#39;re friends with someone who happens to visit one of the niche places.</p>

<p>You are incredibly overestimating the amount of exposure pizzagate has gotten. I doubt many people outside of the US at all know about it and I would shocked if more than 20% of the US population really knows about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Millions of people is a lot of people. However, when I think of the term &quot;mainstream&quot; I think of more than half the populace knowing it.</p>

<p>For example, a mainstream musician is a pop artist that most people hear on the radio, online, in movies, or own the album.</p>

<p>A mainstream TV show is one even your grandma knows about like Big Bang Theory or 2 1/2 men.</p>

<p>A mainstream movie is a marvel movie or star wars where even if you don&#39;t watch it you at least know aspects of it.</p>

<p>Debunking pizzagate is the journalistic equivalent of debunking reptilian satanists from the center of the earth. It&#39;s journalistic suicide to even touch the subject.</p>

<p>Not because (((they))) don&#39;t want you to, but because you might as well sit down and debunk the schizophrenic ramblings of a homeless bum, for all the good it&#39;d do you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence that the little girl taped to the table whilst Alefantis photographs her is a) actually his god daughter like he claims , b) safe a well.</p>

<p>What if I rephrased it as a statement instead of a question?</p>

<p>Would that be ok?</p>

<p>I’ll delete if you don’t want me to discuss it at all.</p>

<p>This photo has been seen by millions of people and as far as I know no one has come out and said &quot; oh that&#39;s so and so,she goes to my kids school&quot; or &quot; that&#39;s so and so she lives on my street&quot;</p>

<p>No one,no teachers ,no doctors,no friends,no friends parents,no neighbours,no one.</p>

<p>The average child comes into contact with hundreds of people in the course of a week. Pizzaboy can&#39;t control them all.Someone must have seen her.</p>

<p>The last known sighting of this child is the picture of her taped down whilst Pizzaboy photographs her.</p>

Some people think there is evidence of this based on some circumstantial evidence centered around emails, art collections, and Instagram accounts, but far too many people spread it as fact rather than theory or speculation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this tactic used here in every discussion involving PG.  It never works, but they persist anyway </p>

<p>I personally believe that they use this deflection tactic in an attempt to silence those that speak out to bring attention to the topic.  They believe that if they can manage to flip-the-script and turn the accusers into the accused people will be too scared to bring it up anymore (out of fear of being called a pedo themselves).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s a pizzagate claim that &quot;James Alefantis&quot; is French for &quot;I love children&quot;. Of course, anyone with a basic knowledge of French knows that it doesn&#39;t mean this, nor does it sound the same. And are they really suggesting that his parents named him James because they knew he&#39;d grow up to be a child abuser and they wanted to leave a clue for armchair internet detectives? The whole things is beyond preposterous.</p>

<p>The &quot;I heart L&#39;Enfant&quot; teeshirt was also seized upon by pizzagaters and they&#39;ve continued to claim it refers to children despite it being a reference to <a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lenfant-cafe-outside2.jpg">L&#39;Enfant Cafe</a>, which itself refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L&#x27;Enfant">Pierre L&#39;Enfant</a>, who did the early layout of Washington.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedantry is substanceless.</p>

<p>It&#39;s his Instagram, I&#39;m not too worried about you doubting that having conversed with him. You&#39;re confusing incrimination with admission.</p>

<p>He state&#39;s he has no interest in pedophilia yet he spends part of the conversation justifying it and being excited by it. The disparity between his public and private persona is incriminating. Anyone who says they aren&#39;t a pedophile but then defends the practice and shows they are interested in imagery of the subject matter certainly is incriminating themselves.</p>

<p>Never said he raped or murdered anyone. Said he was a creep and is bullshitting about not being into young boys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All it does for me is highlight how people can’t handle a different point of view and will call people shills because of it. I can find the evidence for pizzagate VERY lacking and I am in absolutely no way defending pedophiles. The fact is no one here KNOWS that these guys are pedos. Some people think there is evidence of this based on some circumstantial evidence centered around emails, art collections, and Instagram accounts, but far too many people spread it as fact rather than theory or speculation.  </p>

It&#39;s all possible, and should be investigated.

<p>Yet, the comment you posted didn&#39;t use the term &quot;cheese pizza&quot;. Are you now saying that everyone who orders extra cheese on a pizza is a paedophile?
They are talking about pizza. Pizza + extra cheese = A CHEESE PIZZA</p>

<p>No one has ever provided a shred of evidence that Silsby wasn&#39;t actually trying to help those children, in a misguided, do-gooder Christian way.
You&#39;re taking lack of intelligence to an epic low, buddy. </p>

<p>Research is checking the veracity of those claims, looking for any evidence that corroborates or discounts them, and seeing if they stack up. And, yes, I&#39;ve done that research and, no, the claims don&#39;t stack up.
Demonstrably false. </p>
