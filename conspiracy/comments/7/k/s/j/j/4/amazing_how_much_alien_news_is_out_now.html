    <div class="md"><p>Someone brought this up yesterday.  It&#39;s really unclear, although this video lays some good groundwork for w hat&#39;s actually going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9686CJRpUIM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9686CJRpUIM</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a time investment, but this guy brings up great points especially in regards to previous cases similar to this.  My initial opinion is that DeLonge actually knows it&#39;s bullshit and he&#39;s in on the scam.  That&#39;s why this is being unveiled as a private organization.  It&#39;s all about the money.</p>

<p>I recommend watching the documentary Mirage Men as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I actually watched this video earlier today. I&#39;m glad I did - gives a completely different perspective on the whole thing. But I was left with some questions - the guy in this video pointed out that there were previous incarnations of Tom Delonge-type guys, but he didn&#39;t say that they were spewing information that was necessarily false, or that each time the whole thing is on giant false flag. The one guy from the 80&#39;s he refers to was telling the truth, or so he believes.</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, it seems he disagrees with Delonge on - that there are evil aliens out there, whereas he believes that all aliens are inherently good.</p>

<p>Although this is a significant detail, it still means ALIENS!!! And it would be groundbreaking if DeLonge were to usher in a new age of disclosure, even though his flavor of disclosure does have this nasty detail.</p>

<p>So is it all bullshit? Or is it just the &quot;there are some bad aliens&quot; thing bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tom is no doubt a true believer. But with his &quot;to the stars academy&quot; corporation he started he still gets a hefty salary of $100,000 per annum. I do think he&#39;s being controlled though. I think some of the people working with him and leaking info to him are deep state operatives, and through him they&#39;re controlling the release of info and therefore painting a specific narrative with how they choose to release, or not release, certain information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>$100,000 a year is pennies compared to what he was likely making for years with Blink. According to the internets, his net worth is around $60 Million. So $100,000 to quit his band and do this is not worth it from a financial perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It absolutely amazes me that people are so blinded by the little things that they will never see it coming.</p>

<p>Ill try to say this without sounding batshit crazy,
they arent just trying to distract people from &quot;alien&quot; stuff, there really are aliens, or aliens will be brought to us in the form of cgi/illusion, or even and i hope to god this isnt true, aliens is what they will call the demons flying around during the endtimes. To me aliens(even inter-dimensional ones!) are way more believable to me than heaven/hell god/devil angel/demon. </p>

<p>You guys are really that short sighted that you think this newest thing is their entire game? Nah these guys have been crafting their plans for decades, if not century&#39;s, and millennia.
Id say really the whole alien thing started back in the 60/70&#39;s right around the time they started releasing &quot;star wars&quot;, &quot;star trek&quot;, &quot;space odyssey&quot;, brainwashing the masses takes time, and systematic effort.  This latest stuff? I feel like its more predictive programming, no one is batting a eye on this, but when operation bluebeam happens, the aliens invade, the bible comes true and jesus returns, etc, when/if it does happen, do you think anyone will fall over dead from a heart attack?</p>

<p>More than likely no, everyone on this planet has accepted the idea that life more than likely exists elsewhere besides this planet. 
Afterall, do any of you really feel like earth is &quot;special&quot; and the only place like it in the universe, more than likely not. We are in a pretty old part of the galaxy, and I would be surprised that life doesnt exist in a star system or two over. This is the month they were supposed to find planet 9, and the month isnt quite over yet. </p>

<p>In the video below, Maxwell makes the case that those who made us are coming back. I THINK (but I am not sure) that this is the video where someone asks if it will be a hoax or false flag and he says, no  -- it&#39;s the real thing.</p>

<p>Could be a question from someone at the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you a clue. Religions are their signature tool. They get us to trust unaccountable external authority rather than the authority inside of us. We can know truth by seeking to <em>know ourselves.</em> Their corrupted religious belief systems tell us to trust not in ourselves, that it is folly.</p>

<p>It confuses us about good and evil. They can be understood easily, but probably not with religion. Religion makes them esoteric, mysterious, out of reach of understanding. </p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance. Demons are just very good at this path of manipulation of others to serve themselves. They even suck the very joy out of the minds of others by causing them to release it in fear and pain. That&#39;s where they get their reputation, but they can be ANY race even human. IRS a spiritual alignment coupled with expertise, not mysterious. Demons are the ultimate useless eaters, consuming much, destroying much, producing virtually nothing of value.</p>

<p>Evil feeds on consciousness. Good is what supports consciousness. Instead of being selfish, good is about being in balance with the self-interests of other beings. Angels are the same deal as demons. They are adepts on the path of service to others even at the expense of the self. Humans can be Angela too.</p>

<p>The crap about hierarchies, authority, God and whatnot is propaganda from demons to obfuscate the simple reality I described. If you truly understand it, you don&#39;t need priests, holy books or religions to feel comfortable with your creator. You know how to serve him. </p>

<p>God is all things. When we support others we support God. When we support ourselves, we support God. When we support ourselves at the expense of others, we are working against the interests of God, of consciousness, which are peace, freedom, harmony and joy. Parasites are opposed to balance, truth and freedom, because they prevent feeding on others, which is what defines parasites. They cannot see the reflection of their own behavior inside their own minds, lest they be compelled to change. They reject it every time it is presented. They know they want to be useless eaters. </p>

The MSM ran pieces on this, and you can find old YouTube vids of Podesta talking publicly about the need for UFO disclosure. </p>

<p>Is it a distraction and predictive programming for BlueBeam, though? Yes, it probably is. They need some way to explain away all those missing Pentagon trillions. And they need something to distract our attention, so we&#39;re not too focused on Pedogate and the like. </p>

Unless this is a very clever psyop, then why would they let this guy waste millions of dollars researching this issue FROM A PENTAGON office if it was really just our own craft all along? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a perfectly suiting post to be in this sub. In regards to the users who plagued the comment section  of this post, saying things like &#39; we want alians&#39; &#39;when did this become a political sub&#39; yada, yada,.. this is exactly what the puppet master of this whole charade wants. Our perceptions are being skewed with and it shows on levels how it&#39;s affecting us when, people come on to a sub called r/conspiracy and say they don&#39;t want to get political, cunt,has anyone ever thought about, that most of the truly beneficial-to-humanity conspiracies are that which are of people in power aka politics, celebrities, the &#39;elites&#39;, the list continues. But once they are out in the open and defabricated-decoded / the  truth  unleashed into the hands of the respective people may BENEFIT humanity on levels ubiquitous and equal our souls  also... I saw, Tom Deshlong, mentioned in the comments also, okay, he has had a nice firm injection of bullshit serum and is now a rat caught up in a maze far to complex for his understanding, nevertheless, what he thinks to be his biggest break yet a.k.a the three sources( possibly more idk)  in which they have ever so graciously stepped forward to offer their &#39;wisdom&#39; of this so called Alian technology which will change man and the way we traverse time space, you know the story. Bullshit. they Are just utilising their oath of secrecy to its fullest, because what if Tom DeLong actually was starting to crack on to something.. something which the powerful sure enough  started to catch on to. Thus swooping in as prompt as possible, to ensure they control the strings now firmly set upon him. Anyways, the point is all this &#39;alian&#39; news is not all it seems, like people have pointed out the evidence has ALREADY stacked up to undeniable credence that UFO&#39;s exist and have existed. Why is it is only now that they need let&#39;s call it a good talking point, one so obscure and ominous that it completely overshadows the billions of $$$ completely flushed down the toilet to fuel whatever power hungry addictions they holster, and it&#39;s not sweat for them, after all it&#39;s our money so to them, like us in a way I guess ( sarcasm) they go by the motto learn from your mistakes. so.. to smokescreen whatever fuckup caused billions of our dollars to go Bai bai we get shitty footage of outdated classified intel, and a penis shaped asteroid to awe over while they embark to make more expensive mistakes which dehumanize us using our own $$$/time/soul.
 in my opinion this is the biggest conspiracy because the more time we spend just gazing ( even worse so playing part of ) into the void of whatever illusion is being cloaked over us   then the further we are from knowing the truth, which by the look&#39;s of it happens to be very dangerous for us to even ponder about or crack the surface of as talked about above with Tom DeLong.  Remember the real conspiracy guys, and what&#39;s on the cards once it&#39;s no longer a conspiracy, but a issue in which we have addressed and utilised the truth on a collective level based on serving the whole world and not just a few power poyous cunts here and there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Alien life, real or not? I can&#39;t prove it, but can&#39;t disprove it either. I&#39;d need to see something more than regression hypnosis.</p></li>
<li><p>Abduction and UFO phenomenon? I think there&#39;s something real to it. I lean in the direction of Martin Cannon&#39;s hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Tom DeLonge: He&#39;s a believer - this is what puts him in such a vulnerable situation. We&#39;ve seen this story&#39;s tragic ending before, his name was Paul Bennewtiz.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>4A. UFO disclosure: The UFO community has long held that Intelligence and Military have been lying all this time. But they&#39;re getting excited now that their proxy organizations are talking about disclosure. Are they expecting something besides more lies?</p>

<p>4B: UFO groups: MUFON has(had?) Rockefeller connections, NICAP had ex CIA Roscoe Hillenkoeter as a director. Shadow government agencies masquerading as pursuers of truth? I&#39;m at least a little skeptical.</p>

<p>5: Medical examinations, alien mind control, implants/probes: Look up the stimoceiver. The tech described by the UFO community didn&#39;t have to come from beyond the stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really that amazing. You follow SSP whistle blower Corey Goode? 
A lot of people shit on his testimony because of the &#39;blue birds&#39;, drawing connections to MK Ultra Project Bluebird. </p>

<p>However, much of Goode&#39;s testimony is pretty consistent with other whistle blowers, to say nothing of how it relates to things like The Law of One channelings and various ancient texts, etc. </p>

<p>But what astounds me most about Goode is that so many of his predictions have come true more or less. </p>

<p>-a &#39;shock&#39; outcome to the US election, basically - happened. Trump. </p>

<p>-that elite pedophile &amp; human trafficking rings would start to be majorly exposed (even before pizzagate, from my recollection) - clearly this is happening </p>

<p>-that over the course of the last year or so you would see more and more seeds being sewn in a push towards disclosure. This is happening on numerous fronts - they began seeding public consciousness with new information about Antarctica, various sciences, ufos/aliens - and all things Goode has discussed in great detail. </p>

<p>-new technologies, especially aerial transportation technologies - throughout this year there has been a few announcements of new technologies in that vein. </p>

<p>-the blue spheres that Goode talks of often have been caught on camera and witnessed en masse</p>

<p>-above all, he said that disclosure would be used as a means to distract the population while the shit storm of elite pedo and cabal take down via mass arrests and forced surrenders happened, and it certainly seems to be gearing up to that lately. </p>

<p>Many claim Goode is a charlatan but from where I&#39;m sitting his predictions have been fairly accurate. All year I&#39;ve been watching revelation after revelation come out which support his claims. There have been many things covered on by secureteam10 on youtube which support it as well. </p>

<p>So overall, I&#39;m not that amazed. I&#39;ll be amazed if they finally come out with more of a full disclosure and if the cabal actually does get taken down. A lot of Trump&#39;s decisions, especially on foreign policy, so far scream out to me as Cabal agendas. A lot of the &#39;drain the swamp&#39; / &#39;cabal takedown&#39; type information is based solely on anon leaks and, again, Goode&#39;s testimony. </p>
