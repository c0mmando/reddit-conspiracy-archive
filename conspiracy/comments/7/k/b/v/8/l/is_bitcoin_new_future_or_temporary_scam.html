       I'm honestly surprised Bitcoin came to this far, when it was first introduced I kinda laughed. Now one Bitcoin is what...thousands of dollars? 10 thousands?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well... I don't know what is going on... Bitcoin miners bought all the computers, local computer parts stores don't have good graphic cards right now...
      </p>

       what's going on? Is Bitcoin really new future?

       No questions allowed. Get out...

       The blockchain is an innovative and useful way to program a network for a host of reasons. Its basically just a useful technology that will be used for a bunch of things because it works better than previous methods. You should look in to what it exactly is and why its useful... you will then understand bitcoin much more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is one example of a blockchain technology. Its valuable because (1) blockchain technology is an efficient way to form a decentralized ledger over a network, and (2) it is the first and most widely adopted blockchain system used in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin could end up being like the myspace of of social media platforms. Being first doesn't mean you will be the best version.
      </p>
      <p>
       The social media analogy is actually a good one because you can think of the idea of the blockchain as similar to the idea of the social media network. Different platforms like bitcoin and myspace may come and go but the underlying idea will not because it is efficent and useful all on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal belief is that bitcoin will probably rise for a month or two (20-25k) and then suddenly crash... then it will rise to even greater heights within the next year or two (50-100k) then probably crash again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't take my word for it. Go research it yourself. Its interesting stuff for sure.

       Anyway, thx for the explanation. I heard of blockchain but I couldn't understand how's gonna Bitcoin work in real economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's already too expensive I can't even touch it. Maybe I'll buy the next Bitcoin if new one comes out in much lower price to test.

      <p>
       Right now governments are eyeing on it. If governments embrace it as real currency, not just financial options, I don't know what'll happen in entire world.

       Miners keep buying all the good computers out there, I might open graphic cards import store and grab some money.

       A new future for what? Any commodity that fluctuates in value like bitcoin is  can't be a currency.  It would make no sense to purchase any item if the currency itself would  increase in value like bitcoin has.  Most bitcoin is purchased to be hoarded.   Secondly, the energy expenditures to keep on mining bitcoin keep on increasing, that eventually physical limits are ran into.

       Money can be gold, but gold is not money. Physical constraints of gold led to its abandonment as a currency, especially limitations of velocity needed in a modern economy.  It's limitations are somewhat analogous to the limitations of bitcoin, like how it took more and more energy to find and mine gold.  It is really not clear what bitcoin really is.  I mean it certainly is some kind of financial instrument  - but a currency?

       Satoshi Nakamoto said it. He invented Bitcoin and knows more about economics and maths than most anyone I've ever heard talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it makes sense intuitively. You can't have slow, steady growth forever with a new, globally accessibly digital currency. At a certain point the mainstream will rush in a cause a fomo-run. Then a sell-off. Etcetera. And the next wave always gets bigger.

       There is so much incorrect information circulating about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash it is not even funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second biggest one is that about non-mining nodes. Non-mining nodes slow down the network and do not increase security. They are not only useless, they are a burden on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decentralisation is a tool to achieve censhorship resistance. Both BTC and BCH are already highly, highly censorship resistant. It costs $68,000 to execute a double-spend on BCH on the 0-conf level. That's already insane. If you're making a big purchase, just wait ten minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moore's Law is going to continue until at least 2600. That's when we hit the speed of light. Though I doubt even then will be the limit. Look at storage capacity and prices five or ten years ago. Sure, the progress hasn't advanced as rapidly, still storage capacity has gone insanely fast. So 1gb blocks in 2025 won't be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       To achieve censorship resistance / decentralisation all the network needs is a couple of thousand of full nodes. If only half the banks in the world run a full node, boom mission accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the Wall-marts and other retailers who can also fork over 10 or 20K USD to run a full node. The future will be highly, highly censorship resistant. If you think all these corporations are going to globally conspire with each other to mess with Bitcoin after the globe has adopted it as money is highly, highly implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest lie about BTC is that it can survive long-term as a store of value. If the coin has no liquidity, there is no value to store. The value comes from being able to instantly send and receive any sum of money globally for almost zero fee. That's the value of Bitcoin, that's the stuff you store. BTC right now is close to a ponzi-scheme, because its utility has been crippled and I do not think the Core devs are ever going to change that.

       I can't figure out which is the good one, which is the bad one. But the fact that they have been pitched against each other makes it sounds like one of them is definitely a bad one. Because if it were two good guys simply going their own way, there would be all this politics and infighting. it would just be two alt coins with different strategies!

       By 2021 Bitcoin Cash will have brought economic freedom to billions of currently unbanked individuals. It will continue to feature instant transactions for sub-penny fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a transnational payment system that is already fully function
       <strong>
        today
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference with other coins is that they promise to offer solutions
       <em>
        some time in the future
       </em>
       , but today they have very long confirmation times and very large transaction fees (average fee for BTC is $14, for BCH it's around $0,05 but one can also send for 1 penny today).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is little direct evidence of a banker take-over of Bitcoin, but there enough indirect evidence and conjecture to any doubt in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply consider this. This is a fact: Core devs get paid by Blockstream with $76,000,000. Blockstream gets its funding from AXA bank. AXA bank CEO for the longest time was and up until very recently was Henri De Castries. Henri De Castries is
       <strong>
        chairman of the Bilderburg group
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks have infiltrated Bitcoin and have succesfully crippled it, because it greatly undermines its business model of theft by the printing of money and the messing around with the interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter Bitcoin Cash, the hard-fork that is essentially Bitcoin from 2009-2015. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

       Bitcoin Cash has 5 or 6 independent dev teams working on it. So you instantly lose some credibility there. Source:
       <a href="http://whatisbcash.com/">
        http://whatisbcash.com/
       </a>
       (bottom right). Off the top of my head, some dev names: Amaury Séchet (ABC) Peter Rizun, Andrew Stone (Bitcoin Unlimited). You also have Bitprim, Bitcrust, nChain,... All running implementations and creating code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-mining lower the security model. Satoshi himself said this. You know, the man who invented Bitcoin. In the whitepaper itself he doesn't even distinguish between mining nodes and non-mining nodes. Never anywhere does he distinguish between the two, because it's even ridiculous to think this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Core tells you this lie because they don't want to increase the blocksize because they want to force users onto patented side-chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       LN is cool tech, but not for global scaling. Even with LN you would need to increase the blocksize to about 100mb.
      </p>
      <p>
       LN has been "18 months away" since 2015. It's not going to happen. LN in itself is flawed tech for scaling only, it's only good for establishing channels for microtransactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously dude, you've been lied to. You know r/bitcoin is heavily censored, right? r/btc is not censored. If that information alone doesn't set off red flags, you know what with the fact that we're dealing with a censorship resistant form of money, I don't know what will.

        Seriously dude, you've been lied to. You know r/bitcoin is heavily censored, right? r/btc is not censored. If that information alone doesn't set off red flags, you know what with the fact that we're dealing with a censorship resistant form of money, I don't know what will.

       Im not lied to. I'm a network engineer who also knows how bitcoin works down to the stack. I know which coin is better for scaling. as a network engineer, i know about scaling. And increasing block size is NOT HOW YOU DO IT.  If i had to scale bitcoin myself, id setup some sort of LN solution. It has nothing to do with  "them telling me anything". lol  Also, FUCK YOU. i can only reply in
       <a href="/r/btc">
        /r/btc
       </a>
       once every 8 minutes! talk about censored. If I was in charge of bitcoin, id delete all BCASH threads also, because it's the retarded altcoin cousin and
       <a href="/r/bitcoin">
        /r/bitcoin

       is about bitcoin and not some altcoin, specially the most retarded one of all.

       If you run shit UASF node and it connects to shit USAF nodes and it connects to shit UASF nodes, how many shit UASF nodes does it have to send your transaction through to get it relayed to mining nodes?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the link to the network portion of his presentation at Future of Bitcoin
      </p>
      <p>
       Node count is irrelevant.  It's the edges not the vertices that count.  RPi node is shitter because it is connected to fewer other nodes, and is cut off because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Distance between nodes is 1.32
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2.3 seconds once your transaction has hit the network, 99% of the hash power has your transaction
      </p>
      <p>
       In 25 seconds 99% of the network has your transaction
Here's the math to the node argument:

       Shit uasf?  Lol. We don't have shit uasf nodes anymore.  You mean core nodes?  Sigh.  The point is to be able to relay transactions.  Censorship resistance.  You want gig block nodes ran by companies.  Lol. 👌 back to square one. Maybe they go to a meeting and decide to introduce inflation.  Have fun running a node with gig blocks.

       Looks like normal market variance on top of an exponentially increasing (for now) function. I don't know how you can extrapolate to say it will end up as an s-curve, or jumping s-curve, or exponential bacterial-like growth followed by an extinction or near-extinction phase. I don't know myself.

       There can only be 21 million bitcoins. The value is based upon the amount of people that convert their cash into bitcoin. The market cannot be taken over as it would require at least 51% of the compute power involved. Bitcoin is the largest single focus of compute power in history. The more money that goes in, the more stable it becomes. It's already too big for any single entity to dump the coins and destroy the currency including the initial 1000 coins.

       Can't wait for Jihan to dump his 5 million btc and crush Segwitcoin in 2018. You know it's coming. They're both highly centralized, but the little Chinese man loves his own project more ahaha

       it has value because it's the only secure database ever created by man kind that has been up and running for 9 years with 99.9999999% uptime.  Data goes in, and after about an hour, it becomes immutable. Meaning nobody,  not even Moses himself can change it. Any other database can be change by someone with root access. The first use case for that is a ledger for money and ownership. The useless are unless and unimaginable. just like no one could see Facebook in 1993.

       imho, its the beginning of a new world. i think Bitcoin is a bubble that is controlled by the USG (post silk road seizure) and they are just letting it surge so they can off load the 200k -ish bitcoins they seized for a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that alone means bitcoin is going to blow up and wipe out a shit ton of peoples money.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said, the idea of bitcoin and its structure is a big future market.
governments are going to hate it until they can figure out how to tax it and its profits.

       basically this will blaze the path then fail spectacularly and we will see improved versions using the same technology rise out of the ashes of that.
