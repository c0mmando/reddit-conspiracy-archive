       but could there be a connection between interstellar asteroid that was supposed to be checked for alien technology

       No, itâ€™s most likely a distraction from whatâ€™s going on with the recent fbi text leaks. Now the msm can use up air time talking about ufoâ€™s instead of addressing the concerns congress has with these texts.

       Tweets from "GalacticRedPill" are not a source. Furthermore, the idea that "they" would release information about UFOs to distract from a truly minor scandal that has already more or less gone away is absurd. Are you so far gone that you believe this? Pull your head out of the rabbit hole.

       there is a connection for sure. 
what you need to realize is the pentagon video is released by Tom delongs group above the stars. pretty much a bunch of  officals from the military who will slowly disclose the info that aliens are out there and here on earth. 
have you noticed all the new info being released about aliens? even on MSM i see an article weekly about aliens now. project blue beam is in full effect. I believe within the next year or two officially alien life will be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only thing i can tell you is not to believe in everything they tell u. some of its true but 90% of its false.

       OK, fair enough, but how does a person differentiate between the truth and the falsehoods?  What helps with the discernment between what's right and what's false?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you do it, what information are you privy to that allows you to make such a specific statement about the ratio of truth to lies?

       I suspect that you already know that we can't determine what is true.  Since childhood we are told a series of stories. They may be true but not factual.  They may be factual but inconsequential. Those who tell us stories consider us to be children. Why should they change their opinion of us? The tactic has worked well. So long as we behave and remain good children, nothing will change.

       There's a collection of sci-fi stories called "the great ship." In it the author talks about how the cheapest vehicles for interstellar travel are hollowed out asteroids. To paraphrase: "find a reasonable sized asteroid, hollow the interior rear but leave the front solid and reinforce it, slap some huge engines on it and there you go"
      </p>

       When i heard about this thing it's the first thought that came to mind.

       This was an element at the end of Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy.  Hollowed out asteroid used as a ship for the first interstellar human voyage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes a lot of sense, a lot of room for reaction mass, supplies and of course a solid front end so when you do constant-g acceleration and get going really fast the first bit of space dust doesn't hole your ship.

       Pure speculation. I'm guessing we get a painfully slow disclosure, chalk full of bullshit probably, with a few nice or interesting surprises here and there. The purpose will likely be to divert and distract, and maybe gradually roll out some new technology to help stave off full societal collapse, as well as bring us even further into an unavoidable dependency on the state and the system. The real questions for me are, are the aliens still around right now (I have very little doubt that's how we got here in the first place) and what the hell direction is AI going to take. This is of course assuming the world really is what it appears to be. Trust no one. Okay off topic now, that is all.

       It would be cool, and change the world over night, but I just can't see it. Aliens are hard for me to buy into. Given the lifespan of our universe in comparison to us a species, and the conditions needed for sentient life to flourish; the chances of two intelligent civilisations existing at the same time, and then meeting, are basically zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, we imagine aliens through our own perspective. If extraterrestrial life did exsist it's probably something beyond our comprehension, like a ball of gas or something. Steven Hawking actually gave a great lecture on that if you want to look it up.

       I agree that there's lots of reasons to discount UFOs -- time and distance, difficulty of travel and so on, but every once in while you run into an incident that is hard to come up with rational explanations.

       This latest story, which includes FLIR footage and statements from an F/A 18 pilot is kind of one of them.

       For all those, like myself, who are trying to raise awareness to the subject, please hang in there because there is a lot of frustration to be had when discussing these things with people not familiar with recent developments. Please understand that this is a war on consciousness and we can help fight the battles but must did so patiently and compassionately. It's difficult to blame people who haven't spent countless hours reading, listening, and watching the unfolding of the new paradigm shift because lets face it, people are busy as is and don't have the desire to shatter their beliefs and understandings of the true nature of our reality. Much Love and light y'all.

       This will be the distraction...this narrative will start slowly building steam and MSM will start announcing small reports about unidentifiable objects around the world appearing.  All, just to distract and change the narrative from the massive crimes the deep state has been perpetrating against the citizens of the world...not just America!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  To explain the soon-to-be-exposed existence of major technologies and medical cures that have been hidden from us by the elite cabal for almost a century!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch the news.  More and more about aliens will be reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aliens?  Because the public will want to lynch all elites once we find out they had cures to diseases our families died from too young, that they could generate power without petroleum products etc...
      </p>

       If there is alien technology etc, they have to be awfully careful how they release it.. having the technology to have saved peoples significant others, parents, siblings, and othersâ€™ lives but hoarding all this alien technology amongst the elite is a good way for people to put their foot down and fight the elites. Unless of course that technology consists of like dematerializing lasers that we simply wouldnâ€™t stand a chance against.

       But honestly I canâ€™t trust any of these government assholes- this Tom delonge thing has happened before look up billionaire and owner of a defense contracting company named Paul Bennewitz.

       Instead of letting Paul know that he stumbled upon classified information and projects- they told him what he wanted to hear, aliens of course. Drove the man insane.

       Tweets from "GalacticRedPill" are not a source. Furthermore, the idea that "they" would release information about UFOs to distract from a truly minor scandal that has already more or less gone away is absurd. Are you so far gone that you believe this? Pull your head out of the rabbit hole.
