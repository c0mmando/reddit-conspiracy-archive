       Unless you're an observer of this sub, for the most part, you most likely agree with the title of this post. In some manner, shape, or form, you've been lied to about the nature of reality, society, government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever your conspiracy is, from "corporations collude with lawmakers" to "they're hiding a flat earth." You start from a premise of "I have been lied to."
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason it is ludicrous for you to then assume that you NOW have the answer about the way things truly are. To jump from a previous delusion into a more informed delusion is ludicrous, and its the root problem with this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you've seen through the looking glass, you know two things: 1)You've been lied to about the way things were, and 2)From now on, you will never know the way things actually are without irrefutable proof... and even then, you should remain skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone introduces a new conspiracy or demonstrates some type of evidence for an existing one and you say "No, I know how things are NOW, and that's not how they are." You're jumping from your previous delusion of reality and constructing a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, unless you fly over Antarctica personally, you don't know if its a flat earth. Unless you examine the under-eyelids of the clintons, you don't know if reptilians exist. Unless you personally medically examine every child with autism who's parents claim was caused by vaccinations, you don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean you can't assume things based on mountains of evidence! BUT, when you start saying "I KNOW" you are automatically part of the problem. It is on the flat-earthers to present enough evidence that there is a flat earth. Until then, I can say "It's most likely not true based off literal mountains of evidence, but I will remain open to the idea."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine what we could accomplish in this sub if we took that attitude? Fuck, we were fooled before, and we could very easily be fooled again.... so let's remain open to any possibility and only move forward with that humility. That we don't know how things are, so we can only make best-guesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't tear down someone for suggesting a conspiracy, look at their evidence and decide if its enough to convince you. If not... move on and say "not enough, but keep trying. Let me know when you have something real."
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is one thing I've learned from swallowing the red pill, going down the rabbit hole, whatever. Anything is possible and I will never make the mistake again of saying I know something for sure... it's clearly too easy to manipulate, fabricate, and convince all of us of lies.

       Fantastic analysis. I have written a whole post on how the removal of philosophy from the core education subjects has suppressed critical thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophy is the subject where there isn’t much to learn, but rather it develops how you think. Herding the sheep isn’t as effective if they start thinking twice about walking into the slaughter house.

       "I believe that some research points to a correlation between right brain development and happiness. From my anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen enough right brain activities in public school. Maybe more right brain development could lead to happier people."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I mean. Talking in absolutes after going down the rabbit hole is literally delusional. You dont know. The second phrasing of this conveys the same message but with more openness. The first phrasing is political, exclusionary, assumptive, and frankly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know what the long term effects are of a massive change in the public schooling system to increase right brained activities, over a long period of time, because it hasn't happened. When you make absolute statements like this you immediately alienate a huge group of people and create a talking point for the others willing to accept your delusion.

       I really wish more people would use this reasoning..
      </p>
      <p>
       Some "rules / guidelines" for what I think that you suggest:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even people with the most "publicly accepted" theories have been proven wrong
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nothing is certain except that the only constant is change
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Finding a flaw in one theory doesn't necessarily prove your alternative theory to be true
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Try to focus on discussing the issue / topic at hand without looking for a specific group / person to put the blame on. This will make it easier to focus on things like Why is this an issue? In what way are we allowing this issue to persist and how can we resolve it? What pro-actice measures could have avoided this issue?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       I think you're spot on. In my opinion, if individuals followed your rules/guidelines when consuming and disseminating information we'd have a much clearer dialogue and closer grasp on reality and truth.

       A quote from men in black has always stuck with me.
" Fifteen hundred years ago people knew the earth was the center of the uuniverse, two hundred years ago people knew the earth was flat, 15 minutes ago you knew humans were alone on this Earth. Imagine what you will know tomorrow."

       I think a lot of problems can be associated more to the fact of rapid expansion in technology. We have all these phones and computers and widgets to deal with. And we as humans need to figure out a balance. We have jumped head fisrt into it with out looking at the consequences. To take the whole net neutrality as an example. I bet half of the Congressmen have 0 idea of how the internet works. And they may legitimately think Al Gore invented it. So they don't see a side effect of changing it. We need to change how we govern our people. Old people may have wisdom from there lives. But they don't know anything pertaining to the current times. They know the best decision for 25 years ago. But that's not good enough anymore. We need a wider range of government. Not kids. But real working class Americans.

       Agreed with pretty much everything you said, but I'm definitely not as "accommodating" to the flat earth idea as you are man.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of us on here think that goofy flat earth shit is pushed on here by shills to make us look wacky and ridiculous to anyone lurking or visiting the sub. They see a flat earth post and boom, never coming back and completely shut off to the idea of being a part of the culture here. You know Shareblue spams the shit out of the "new" que with dumb shit like,

       Like I said, you don't know they're wrong. You also don't know that Shareblue spams the shit out of this sub. You don't know if there is a vampire or reptilian living next door to the poster, either. So why pretend?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to come from a place of "I know how the world works and you're wrong" to further discussion, knowledge, etc. That type of religious conviction to an idea is the reason why humans are so susceptible to falsities. Whether its academics, religious ideologies, even constructs of your reality.. you dont know for sure. So don't waste time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, look at those posts and say "I can probably assume those are shareblue shills. I can also probably assume that dude's nextdoor is a human. BUT, since I can't tell for sure I am going to entertain the idea that I'm wrong and see if I can find evidence confirming that I am wrong. No? Great, my assumptions were probably true."
      </p>
      <p>
       Approaching the world with this attitude leaves no delusion to be disproven. No realities to manipulate. You are always open and willing, pending evidence, to change your mind. If you do not follow this logic then you will be manipulated, propagandized, lied to, persuaded, and once again become the "sheep" that you probably disdain.
      </p>
      <p>
       We dive into delusions because accepting the inedible fact that we don't know for sure about anything, is scary as fuck. Humans do not like feeling this way, and it leads us into all sorts of fuckery. The key is to separate yourself from your ego, duality, and conceptualizations. Rid yourself of this attachment and view the world with humility and wonder, not delusions and egoism.

       Sure, but personally, I'm just here to put my focus toward the stuff we have actual evidence for and can show to the unaware masses. I don't tend to get too dazzled by the "what if's" and the fantasy/pandoras box type topics here that have little evidence to support them.

       I know that the global elite convene to establish a global totalitarian government. They admit this in their memoirs and we can easily observe the process by which they do this, incrementally and slowly over time. To me, this is "the" conspiracy, and it's our most imminent threat. Every other act of conspiracy by the global crime syndicate is a move toward this ultimate goal. This is their wet dream. So that's where 99% of my focus is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say I don't delve into ancient Egypt, Freemasonry, UFO's, and the usual conspiracy fodder. I just feel like if we want to wake people up, perhaps we divert our attention toward where the evidence is. Or else this is just a hangout where we spin our wheels and blow off steam. I think this place is a tool to reach people.

       You can't know, man. You cant. You were effectively lied to before, as were billions of people. Who's to say you're not wrong right now? You? You were wrong before, why should we trust you now?

       And there are just as many reasons to believe that the people at these meetings are colluding instead of just a collection of people all trying to convince the others to take a course of action, or just a think tank of people dreaming of ways that the world could be better through concerted action.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have numerous examples of that in the world, as many or more than we have instances of actual industry/government collusion. And it doesn't take long to see that the same people talking about these conferences clearly have regrets and things they wish were different in the world, because they tell you those too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's nowhere near irrational to think it's unlikely for any random people to control the world. Or even to think that leaders getting together in such a fashion is a force for good in the world, and not a plot for deception.

       Guess what bud?  All those other conspiracies you like started off the exact same way, with one guy with a crazy idea and very little evidence. You need to give ideas time to prosper, and that includes flat earth and it's associates which you newbies seem to think is a sudden share blue idea, when in reality it's been a concept forever. Conspiracy sub isn't a place for the masses, it's a garden for ideas to grow. If you want a normie safe place maybe you should make a sub only for proven conspiracies, but I don't think people would really like that..because they are I TO the far out conspiracies...

       You can buy a plane ticket from S. Africa to Australia and the flight is about 12 hours, if you do the same on a flat earth it would be roughly twice that time because those two continents are on the opposite side of a flat earth map. FLAT EARTH DEBUNKED. I met a guy from S. Africa last year who has done this flight many times, it does exist, you can go to the airline website and buy this ticket.

       Fucking great question and I've never seen anything coming from the flat-earthers that gives a logical and reasonable answer to this question.

       I think that, given the lack of this explanation and combined with all other relevant evidence we can assume the earth probably isn't flat. I'm absolutely willing to change that assumption should new evidence present itself.

       It was hyperbolic. The point was, unless you have the scientific tools to actually conduct the research and can find irrefutable proof then coming to a 100% conclusion isn't logical or even necessary. You can say "I'm 99.9999% sure based on logic and what I do know yada yada yada... But you always leave the door open for potential new evidence."

       I've no idea. I'm not a scientist. Based on my limited understanding of basic science I think that it's extremely likely that the Earth is round and that's the assumption I operate on. However, because im not capable of conducting the research necessary, and I'm also inherently skeptical of being "told" something is true because of past lies... I'll leave the door slightly ajar. If some new evidence presents itself that the world is flat, then great, I'll be open to receiving it unbiasedly. If not, then no harm done.

       You can buy a plane ticket from S. Africa to Australia and the flight is about 12 hours, if you do the same on a flat earth it would be roughly twice that time because those two continents are on the opposite side of a flat earth map. FLAT EARTH DEBUNKED. I met a guy from S. Africa last year who has done this flight many times, it does exist, you can go to the airline website and buy this ticket.

       Where would you find the answers to those questions and how would you know they are truthful? Especially since, as the post title says, you've been lied to before.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point isn't to give up on knowledge because you can't say anything is true. It's to stay away from "this is 100% truth" claims as they are (most of the time) not the full picture, inaccurate, a mere surface level description, or at worse... Based on falsities peddled by those who wish to manipulate and lie to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead operate from a place of "most likely" and "probably" and "best evidence suggests." That wat you always leave the door open for new evidence and don't shut off any possibilities that you might have disregarded because of biases and defensiveness from taking a position.

       How many scientific "truths" are adapted? Evolved? Changed? A fuck ton, every single day. We learn more and more about our environment  and the way things work... every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       To claim you know something as 100% true is irresponsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Previously, scientists believed heliocentrism to be scientifically inaccurate. They had proof based on their models and theorems that the universe revolved around the earth. If we were having this same argument back then, my post would have said something like "It is most likely accurate that the universe revolves around the earth, but we should never make an 100% truth claim and be open to possibilities." Your response to my post would have been to "do independent investigations, ask simple questions and come to the obvious answer that "duh, of course the universe revolves around the earth."
      </p>
      <p>
       In my approach, here comes Galileo with a heliocentric model and a lot of sound evidence for it. In my model, i'm not biased and tied to my theorems because instead of saying "this is truth" I say "this is the most true thing I can come up with." Here comes Galileo with something more true, disproving my model, and I accept it and adapt to that new truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our current body of knowledge as human beings, we know a lot. We understand how a lot of things work. We also don't understand probably even more. We don't really understand how our own brain functions. We are just barely coming to terms with how nutrition works. Most mainstream medications are prescribed because they simply work, with the caveat that
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/one-big-myth-about-medicine-we-know-how-drugs-work/?utm_term=.a44b533d8d4f">
        "we think we know how they work, but we're not absolutely sure."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no idea how old the universe is, where we came from, what consciousness is.. we don't find over 15,000 new animal species on our own damn planet per year. We don't know how to organize societies the most efficiently, we
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/unfathomable-how-much-we-dont-know-about-the-ocean/277328/">
        don't even know what creatures lurk in the depths of our oceans.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even mundane things like "what color is the pencil you're holding?" Well... it's red. Obviously, I dont need a government or body of science to tell me this. But what does that mean? Is that the most true description? What light wavelengths frequency is it radiating? What are light wavelengths? What is "seeing"? How deep can we go with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answering "red" is superficial and simplistic. It's mostly true, and a representation of truth, but it's not completely true. The level of detail you could supply me in an answer to that question is infinite, therefore the "most true" answer suffices. This is how science works, the most true thing prevails until it doesn't anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is: as human beings, claiming truth in anything is faulty and ridiculous. Like I said, its usually simplistic. Sometimes deluded, and even less times a construct based on lies from people who wish to control us. So you can take away that power by refusing to answer in absolutes. Saying "I did my own investigation of the flat earth and based on my knowledge and my ability to see, observe, test, I believe that it is most likely true the earth is not flat" is more powerful than saying "the earth is not flat." In the first example, you're claiming what you know and have found.. but with humility and egolessness, in order to be open to the possibility that you could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we all did this and used this approach in our every day lives it would be substantial for progressing society.

       Thats actually not factually accurate. Look up the history of geocentrism and you will find Mars at the head of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geocentric believers could not explain the orbit of mars (And a few others but Mars was the best example) It made no sense, it just did loop de loops through the sky. The orbit of mars made perfect sense if we both orbited the sun.

       You are completely missing my point, friend. You think I am saying that "because we can't make 100% truth claims we can't make any claims at all." That's completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a complex topic and I know it's difficult to change a worldview, but reread what I am posting and see if you can empathize with what I am saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of COURSE I don't think 2+2=7. Of COURSE I don't believe the world is flat. But also of course, I don't make 100% truth claims about anything because as a human being with limited perception, biases, ability to understand and interpret the world around me, an ego, and limited processing power... I am unable to know something 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont need to though. Again, this is how scientists operate. Go ask a scientist in the top of their field if they "know something" to be true. They will get uncomfortable, stumble a bit, and say "no, we think its most likely true." This is how knowledge pushes forward. Because that scientist knows that even their basic truths are susceptible to change. Don't believe me? Go read string theory. Read about how electrons can appear in two places at once. Read about alternate dimensions, universes, the multi-verse, etc. Go found out just how "sure" scientists are about the way the world works. If you can find a scientist saying "I 100% think this is how this thing works" then you haven't found a scientist, you've found a preacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who think like you're suggesting, that are willing to accept a worldview at 100% truth. Not willing to understand their biases, not willing to understand their limitations, that blindly accept the tools, knowledge, and information shown to them... then religiously hold on to those beliefs as if they are some sort of deity... are the reason society is so unable to work with itself to make itself better. Your way of thinking holds societies back, keeps us in the dark ages where new hypothesis and paradigm shifts can land you in house arrest... like Galileo.

       While I would argue that giving people platforms to tell me that 2+2=7 holds us back.

       Not all theories are created equal and we can and should perform tests ourselves to verify these theories.

       Well thats just defeatist. What you should be doing instead of waxing poetically about solipsistic ideas is to figure out what you
       <em>

       do to verify these ideas.

       If I told you getting bit by a shark would hurt would you say that you dont know because you have never been bit by a shark?

       This is an ever evolving process but if we all just threw our hands up and said we will never know anything for sure then where is the pressure to figure this out?

       I'm not. By conducting the research, I immediately begin relying on constructs. I begin relying on hypothesis testing (i didn't come up with this idea,) measuring tools, ways of thinking. I begin relying on others' data (and by others, I mean folly human beings with limited perception.) I rely on institutions, ideas, and even my own intuition and biases to understand the world. At the root of all of these things is the human being, and the human being is severely flawed. It's not a perfect AI machine with unlimited processing power, quite the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the question then becomes "is it necessary to make truth claims?" No. I can do scientific research, philosophical thinking, etc. by relying on most-accurate knowledge at that time. Some of the assumptions I use may be 100% accurate. However, claiming they are is unknowable and simply irrelevant and a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a certain probability that this universe was created inside of a simulation. Not a large chance, its certainly not been anywhere close to proven, but it's certainly possible. If that were true, than nothing we know about anything would be 100% accurate. That alone is enough to say, because we don't know all of it works we can't claim how any of it works with 100% accuracy. But thats the thing - we dont NEED to! "Mostly true" is good enough, and it's actually better because it helps us get away from our biases and be open to change.

       I'm tired of repeating myself so if you still disagree, let me know if I can clarify anything, but otherwise let's wrap this up. If you're not seeing my point by now I don't think you will.

       No, it tells you that depending on your POV, biases, tools, perceptions, constructs, etc. you can interpret reality in different ways and coming up with a simplistic truth that encapsulates the entirety of it is impossible. So don't pretend like you do.

       Not sure if its the correct answer, but I think the sun moves in a sinusoid wave, up and down, which somehow factors for changes in times and stuff, plus I guess diff viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for flat earth.... I really think people shouldn't jump to quick judgements, esp a big leap like flat earth. Discredit existing stuff sure, but don't just jump to push the alternative or blindly support that if something better pops up. I personally am not convinced on the flat earth yet, what I do know is that the standard model isn't accurate, and NASA does really seem to be full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think the glove is in the shape of an apple, but have a few other alternatives include flat that could work. I would also suggest anyone who still wants more answers, check out "electric universe theory" or "plasma science". Just learned about this recently, somehow missed it, and it connected ALOT of dots for me. Helped explain questions I had bout mysterious planets like venus. I might make my own post about it all cause I got some interesting info on it now.

       I think in the example I saw the sun orbits the article circle and goes like diagonally up away from globe, maybe sins left and right or something... not sure. I haven't really been convinced on flat earth either, still going with the apple shape for now, but def enough inconsistences' to question what NASA has put out.

        “What can be more common than the observation that, standing at one end of a long row of lamp-posts, those nearest to us seem to be the highest; and those farthest away the lowest; whilst, as we move along towards the opposite end of the series, those which we approach seem to get higher, and those we are leaving behind appear to gradually become lower … It is an ordinary effect of perspective for an object to appear lower and lower as the observer goes farther and farther away from it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure, the lampposts become lower.  But the lampposts never cross the horizon on a flat earth.  The sun clearly does.

       The vanishing point is infinitely far away.  There is no such thing as beyond the vanishing point.  That is pretty basic geometry.

       Ok. I looked it up.  Turns out, the Earth is not flat.  There are satellites orbiting around it.  There are times zones and sunsets.  These are all things that I have personally observed, no questionable sources required.

       The problem with FE is exactly what you said, they have a model for sun and moon movements but they run into problems with it when its applied outside of the singular model.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Sun is close and small, but those angles dont match up when applied all over the planet.

       Literally the math doesnt add up. It works if you ignore the above link but why would you do that? Is it the truth if you ignore certain aspects of your universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       It requires bullshit like an extra invisible planet to cover the moon.... Come on there is no evidence that is true and that model is patently false.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can the sun illuminate the bottoms of clouds in the morning if it never sets? Unexplained pseudoscience is the only response Ive gotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much counter evidence to the FE that you have to willingly ignore facts to make it work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself why FE is so popularly spread via youtube videos but no papers or technical write ups exist? Its because it falls to shit if you sit down and quantify the FE.

       To add on to this point people should be skeptical of all of these sexual abuse cases from politicians. Al Franken, Roy Moore, and Trump are just a handful that are complete false constructions by the MSM. Seriously, just check where they get their sources.

       Absolutely. It's certainly reasonable and possible that all of them are made up. That some of them are made up. That some are partly true and others not revealing enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certain things that these situations seem to be... But for anyone to say they know for sure, they're kidding themselves. The only for sure thing here is that no one knows the truth albiet the accuser and the accused.

       I agree completely, when I first came to a logical assertion that certain 'facts' we have been indoctrinated with, my critical evaluation changed completely. When talking about more common subjects such as JFK and 9/11 where a high percentage of members within this arena know that the official story is flawed, I still like to refer as the finer points as 'theories'. Be it a plane, projectiles,  detonators, we know one of, or a combination of the theories caused the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when talking about less tangible conspiracies, such as flat earth and theories that are really difficult to grasp in a logical sense, I have learned that I must find proof to support any fact we have been fed. I have seen a lot of questionable arguments that support both a round earth and a flat model, but still can't find any reason to disbelieve the fact the earth is a spherical entity. I do not for any minute believe the simple story is anywhere near one hundred percent true, which allows for theories that question the fed model.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I am really just repeating your viewpoint, but it would be short sighted and myopic to cherry pick standard beliefs, and basterdise someone who struggles to agree even if the scenario seems highly plausible. The lie may not be as stark as some propose, but a full truth should never be expected.

       This is what I tell my kids, I think it goes along with your message:  Water is made up of 2 parts hydrogen and 1 part oxygen.  You have been taught this and accept it as fact. Now prove it. I have no idea how to prove it, nor the equipment needed to do so. Neither do you. I do accept it as fact though. But why do we accept it as fact? Why, when we can't prove or disprove it? I do because I trust those that have taught it to me, but could it be a lie? Without proof that you can see, touch, smell, etc. it can be questioned.

       People will say things like "such and such IS a psyop to discredit us", without any proof whatsoever. So what it should really say is "I have suspicioun that such and such could be a psyop because of x y and z". They think their conspiracy is a fact but it's really a hunch, so it gets chaotic.

       I think the conspiracy community would get a lot more buy-in and less writing-off from non-conspiracy minded folks if we approached it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so easy to write off someone claiming they know something as insane as the conspiracies that get discussed here. But when someone just presents evidence with an openness to being proven otherwise, in my experience it makes others much more inclined to hear them out.

       On one hand, knowledge is generated by increasingly specialized researchers.  On the other hand, the traditional trusted outlets of the media are proving to be utterly untrustworthy.  Even the supposed bastions of scientific integrity, scientific journals, are becoming untrustworthy.  There's the quote that gets thrown around here a lot by the editor of the Lancet estimating "much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do you really know anything?  The limits of what each of us may independently verify are severely limited.  Our evolutionary history imparts a reliance on heuristics in our thought processes-- decisions based on imperfect information that were good enough for the kind of neolithic dilemmas we faced that are far removed from the current demands placed on our brains in sorting this shit out.  I think conspiracy theories appeal to our reliance on heuristics.  We know at some level that shit is fucked up, hence the narrative must be a lie, and if we're being lied to, it must be for someone's benefit.

       You're relying on your eyes, your biases, your constructs and your perceptions to state things as 100% true. This is a huge flaw. We are almost unable to be unbiased as humans. Our perception is so limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that you're wrong. I'm saying your approach is wrong because it does more harm than good. Making truth claims isn't necessary. Saying "viewing the ships disappear over the horizon is enough to demonstrate that the Earth is most likely round" carries the same weight and conveys the same message. Except with more power, because now you're opening yourself up to being proven wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting with a premise of how the world is and then finding evidence to support is an approach that will land you in delusions.

       Absolutely not. You're missing the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many species of animals are there in the world right now? You could find that answer pretty quickly with a Google search. You could then comment back "based on this source there are (x) amount of species in the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, thats great. Except they find about 15,000 new species a year. So your answer would be more like "this is how many species we've found up to date." But once you make that claim of "this is how many there are" you're automatically wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be applied to any knowledge base. Were always learning, adapting, and growing. Way too fucking often people say "this is how it is" and they're wrong. It hurts  discussion, furthering of knowledge, and finding real truth.

       From your comment history it looks like you're a trump fan. (Even if not, this is still relevant.)
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people out there are saying "Trump colluded with Russia! 100%, no question." A fucking lot. What does that do for dialogue? Debate? Investigations? It muddys the water a whole fucking bunch, especially when those voices come from 'reputable' news sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine a world where people on the left said "man, there is a lot of weird connections between Trump and Russia. Let's not jump to conclusions but we need to get to the bottom of this."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a complete shift in the way people think and reason and it would do wonders for saving dialogue and mitigating defensiveness and political bias in our country.

       We live in an age of unprecedented deception, due in large part to the advent of mass media. But make no mistake, mass deception is nothing new. No, it is ancient, it is the primary means by which the few rule the many. We are under layers and layers and layers of deceit. One trick of those who wish to keep us deceived is once a layer of deception has been proven to be just that, the next layer of deception is sold as the truth. Many, I say again many, have been trapped by this ruse. Thinking they now know the 'Truth', when in fact they are still deeply deceived, and thus stop looking. Remember, some of the best lies are wrapped in truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Truth is very difficult to discover in this age. It takes a great deal of thought and patience. It is time consuming, frustrating, and often times the best we can accomplish is proving that the official narrative is a lie. Rarely can we prove absolutely what the Truth is. It is a journey fraught with wolves in sheep's clothing. (There are only a handful of people I trust in the 'Alt Media') There are those who 'think' they know the truth but are in fact still deeply deceived and spread deception as truth, with full conviction. I refer to these as the unknowing disinformation agents. The 'Religious' in particular fall into this category. The Truth can be dangerous to discover and reveal, and oftentimes is deadly. Nor is there any money in the Truth. Anyone who is 'profiting' from telling the truth, is not telling the truth... (Infowars).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I only consider myself slightly less deceived that the average person, and I have been seeking the Truth for over 9 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me second your comment. Never assume you know the Truth. Never stop digging to find the Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing. I do not believe we are falling into the rabbit hole. No, we are ALL in the rabbit hole. What we are trying to do is get OUT.

       I don't know is freedom! I don't know is ultimate knowledge, and I don't know is the purest state of being. It's unbelievable the amount of knowledge you can entertain when you just think about it and let it go, as opposed to getting swallowed by it saying that you know.

       I really do like this, however the flat earth part seems a bit one sided.  The fact is, unless you fly over Antarctica personally, you don't know if it's a globe earth.  There is more than enough scientific evidence to tell you that the surface of water does not curve to 7.93 inches per mile square (more near the equator on NDTs pear earth of course).  What people don't get is that if it's a globe them literally all water surfaces must curve to this.

       If you accept as true flight times of commercial airlines it ought to be pretty easy to prove, if you feel like the issue is in doubt, one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me try it.
      </p>
      <p>
       NY to Beijing:  13-17 hours.
NY to london:   7.5 hours
London to Beijing: 10 hours.
Beijing to Los Angeles: 12 hours.
NY to Los Angeles:  5 hours
Los angeles to London: 11 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is flat then:
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the times I would say LA would be pretty much midway between london (11 hours) and beijing(12 hours).
      </p>
      <p>
       NY is about half way between LA and London ( 5 hours to LA, 7.5 to london).  Also it takes about the combined flight time from LA to beijing and LA to NY to get from NY to Beijing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far so good for the flat earth model.  It all checks out.  Draw this out on paper to really visualize it.  But here is where it breaks down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is flat.  Then the flight time from one end of our flat earth (Beijing) to the other end of our flat earth (London) should be roughly the combined times of London to NY, NY to LA, And LA to bejing.  That total is 19.5 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual flight time London to Beijing: 10 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just like that, you don't get to have a flat earth.  Maybe a cylindrical earth?  But not a flat one.

       There is still the problem of no curvature.  I don't know that we really know all the locations, flight times are heavily influenced by jet streams (random on a globe, fits perfectly on a flat map).

       This system behaves like all of these points are on a circle.  If they were on a 2 dimensional flat plane you couldn't go from one end to the other in the same time (actually 2 hours less) than it takes to get from one end to the middle.

       You can buy a plane ticket from S. Africa to Australia and the flight is about 12 hours, if you do the same on a flat earth it would be roughly twice that time because those two continents are on the opposite side of a flat earth map. FLAT EARTH DEBUNKED. I met a guy from S. Africa last year who has done this flight many times, it does exist, you can go to the airline website and buy this ticket.

       Interesting anecdote. I haven't looked too much into flight times but I do know there are more factors than just distance.  Its just that water surface does not curve to what is needed for the earth to be a globe.  GLOBE EARTH DEBUNKED.  I've known an engineer for a decade and he confirmed that they do not use curvature where they should.

       Well, look into those flights, you'll get it then, I don't even try to use the boat over the horizon anymore as an example because of possible refraction. I know a guy who is a flat earther and I was looking for easy evidence going by his flat earth rules and this flight is a good one to explain. When I presented this fact to him, he says he would look into it, then a few weeks later I asked him what he found, he acted like he didn't know what I was talkng about, so I explained it to him again and he said he would look into it, I haven't seen him since, so it will be interesting to see what he says.

       Ahhh, so it's Satan's old "truth is relative" argument trotted out once again to cast doubt on the absolute truth of God's only son, Jesus Christ, who told us, "I am the way, the truth and the life", in John 14:6. Once one sees past the veil of lies, then it's really a moral decision: Join the liars, or opt out of the rigged pyramid scheme called worldly success and follow Jesus Christ to eternal salvation.

       You're seeing it wrong. This way of viewing isn't contradictory to a belief in God. I actually learned and developed this way of thinking with the help of Jordan Peterson, who is a Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a religious perspective, this would make sense. That us feeble and narrow minded humans can never know absolute truth by relying on our own intuitions and knowledge. From that perspective, relying on a God or diety for truth would make sense. I'm not Christian but I don't believe it contradicts that philosophy.

       Incredible footage. I agree with you 99.99%. But.. I wasn't there. I know video footage can be faked. I am not egotistical enough to assume I know something that the human species has only known for .25% of our modern history.

       People who look at all of the evidence that it is spherical, rely on basic reasoning and assumptions, and cherry-pick a few oddities or selective evidences to claim it is flat... are ridiculous, in my opinion. I am not sure the mental gymnastics needed to come to that conclusion. I am not even sure actual flat-earthers exist, and that its not just a bunch of trolls or psy-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be equally ridiculous to claim to know it's not flat, 100%.

       Like I said, you don't know they're wrong. You also don't know that Shareblue spams the shit out of this sub. You don't know if there is a vampire or reptilian living next door to the poster, either. So why pretend?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to come from a place of "I know how the world works and you're wrong" to further discussion, knowledge, etc. That type of religious conviction to an idea is the reason why humans are so susceptible to falsities. Whether its academics, religious ideologies, even constructs of your reality.. you dont know for sure. So don't waste time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, look at those posts and say "I can probably assume those are shareblue shills. I can also probably assume that dude's nextdoor is a human. BUT, since I can't tell for sure I am going to entertain the idea that I'm wrong and see if I can find evidence confirming that I am wrong. No? Great, my assumptions were probably true."
      </p>
      <p>
       Approaching the world with this attitude leaves no delusion to be disproven. No realities to manipulate. You are always open and willing, pending evidence, to change your mind. If you do not follow this logic then you will be manipulated, propagandized, lied to, persuaded, and once again become the "sheep" that you probably disdain.
      </p>
      <p>
       We dive into delusions because accepting the inedible fact that we don't know for sure about anything, is scary as fuck. Humans do not like feeling this way, and it leads us into all sorts of fuckery. The key is to separate yourself from your ego, duality, and conceptualizations. Rid yourself of this attachment and view the world with humility and wonder, not delusions and egoism.

       You can buy a plane ticket from S. Africa to Australia and the flight is about 12 hours, if you do the same on a flat earth it would be roughly twice that time because those two continents are on the opposite side of a flat earth map. FLAT EARTH DEBUNKED. I met a guy from S. Africa last year who has done this flight many times, it does exist, you can go to the airline website and buy this ticket.

       Thats actually not factually accurate. Look up the history of geocentrism and you will find Mars at the head of it.

       Geocentric believers could not explain the orbit of mars (And a few others but Mars was the best example) It made no sense, it just did loop de loops through the sky. The orbit of mars made perfect sense if we both orbited the sun.
