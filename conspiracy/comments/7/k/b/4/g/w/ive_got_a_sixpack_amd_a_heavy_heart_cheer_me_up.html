<p>I left my wife and kids months back because the relationship was killing me. I was depressed anf suicidal. She&#39;s a good mom though, i just couldn&#39;t put in what i needed to to be a husband and father. Totally fucked things up amd there&#39;s no going back. Thought i wanted my feeesom, and it has heloed somewhat... but today we got into a huge fight in front of my kids over some stupid shit that doesn&#39;t even matter. Normallt things between us are cool. She threatened to call the fucking cops on me... like jesus fuck... I&#39;ve never been on the receiving end of that threat before.. i wasn&#39;t violent or threatening, she just wanted me out of the goddamn house. All i was trying to do was get my income tax files and some other shit. I was trying to be an adult about it and shit... but it ended up in this big fucking fight over literally everyrhing BUT the files i needed. Goddamn it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit. I haven&#39;t been there for the kids like i should have been. I&#39;m trying but for fucks sakes i csn do better than this bullshit. She&#39;s got them full time and does everthing for them. I barelt see them. Fuck.  Fucj this shit. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m even here.</p>

<p>Edit Goddamn it this was suplised to go on r/drunk, there&#39;s no fucking conspiracy here. Other then the fsct that I am  onspiring to fucl up my life and get shitfaced</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it was for a reason.</p>

<p>Remember what you are saying now.  Your priorities sound better now than back when all of those negative things happened.</p>

<p>What do you think is valuable in life?  What do you think is meaningful in life?  What is your purpose?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have an answer to those questions then I suggest you search for them.  I can already tell you one of your purposes is to be a father to your children.  They have some of you in them after all.  We have free will so it is up to you whether you fulfill your purposes or not.</p>

<p>Apologize to your wife.  Fighting with her isn&#39;t going to get you or your family anywhere but deeper down into depression.</p>

<p>The alcohol is going to desensitize and distract you from what really matters.  Get some sleep.  When you wake up, you will be reborn to an extent.  You can decide to change your ways at any moment.  It is only a matter of how strong your will is.</p>

<p>Godspeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I struggle with depression and anxiety, which is why I left in the first place; I was unable to be a father or husband in the state I was in. </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting help, meds and therapy have made a huge difference so far, but im not in a place where I feel like im ready to have a significant role in their lives. It&#39;s coming, but I feel a lot of guilt and shame for the decisions i have made. </p>

<p>Also, my ex is making it difficult for me to see them. She hates and distrusts my family, and doesn&#39;t trust me either due to the aforementioned mental health issues. I have <em>never</em> been violent or threatening towards them, but that males no difference to her. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not consistent, and have a terrible memory in regards to the past to the point where arguments and confrontations with her are impossible for me. I can&#39;t trust my memory and version of events and have to rely on hers, which leaves me at an obvious disadvantage and she knows that. She is very resentful of me amd blames me for all her problemsm but if you met her parents you woukd understand why a relationship with her was doomed to fail. </p>

<p>Her parents are married for 50 years and to my knowledge have never resolved a conflict in their marriage. Like, literally. Their house is unfinished because they couldn&#39;t agree on anything amd refused to compromise. 40 year old house with no siding, curtains for cupboard doors framed in but unfinished basement with sheets for walls... etc etc. </p>

<p>I should never have married her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I struggle with depression and anxiety, which is why I left in the first place; I was unable to be a father or husband in the state I was in. </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting help, meds and therapy have made a huge difference so far, but im not in a place where I feel like im ready to have a significant role in their lives. It&#39;s coming, but I feel a lot of guilt and shame for the decisions i have made. </p>

<p>Also, my ex is making it difficult for me to see them. She hates and distrusts my family, and doesn&#39;t trust me either due to the aforementioned mental health issues. I have <em>never</em> been violent or threatening towards them, but that males no difference to her. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not consistent, and have a terrible memory in regards to the past to the point where arguments and confrontations with her are impossible for me. I can&#39;t trust my memory and version of events and have to rely on hers, which leaves me at an obvious disadvantage and she knows that. She is very resentful of me amd blames me for all her problemsm but if you met her parents you woukd understand why a relationship with her was doomed to fail. </p>

<p>Her parents are married for 50 years and to my knowledge have never resolved a conflict in their marriage. Like, literally. Their house is unfinished because they couldn&#39;t agree on anything amd refused to compromise. 40 year old house with no siding, curtains for cupboard doors framed in but unfinished basement with sheets for walls... etc etc. </p>

<p>I should never have married her.</p>
