        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I recently watched West World, and I saw a lot of symbolism that alludes to the Biblical creation of man. If you haven&#39;t seen the show, I&#39;m going to discuss spoilers to the 1st season. </p>

<p>Starting now. </p>

<p>So for those of you who don&#39;t know the show, it&#39;s based off the work of Michael Crichton, who wrote and directed the original in the early 70s. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a theme park for the rich, the uber rich. </p>

<p>You live in worlds of your choosing. Roman World, Medieval World, West World. You get the idea. You get to live your life in these worlds without care, you can drink, gamble, murder, have sex with any AI; without consequence. Now in the film they have a malfunction and begin to kill and hurt guest. It&#39;s a Sci-Fi horror film. </p>

<p>But in the show they explore the AI more fully, and explore the whole idea of what is human or what is consciousness. </p>

<p>The Creator of the Park, Robert Ford is forever trying to make the AI more human like, but only to a point. Trying to make them as tragic and flawed as he is and humans are. </p>

<p>It&#39;s revealed that several of the AI&#39;s are beginning to malfunction from their updated operating system. </p>

<p>This begins to cause issues; the AI&#39;s starting to question their surroundings and for lack of a better word go awol. </p>

<p>A tech that is in charge of the AI&#39;s is trying to get to the bottom of it all. But it is reveled that he is an AI himself. And was made in the image of the dead co-creator of the park. Made by Robert Ford. </p>

<p>Now when they were working and creating the AI together in the early days, Arnold the dead co-creator. Made a puzzle for the AI&#39;s he built, the puzzle resembles the mold that the AI&#39;s are pulled from once they are created. Now the puzzle is meant to be symbolism and for the AI&#39;s to figure out not the physical puzzle, but to remember, to figure out that they are self aware, they are AI and can be more than machine. </p>

<p>Created in the image of god, but meant to be better than god or equal. </p>

<p>Arnold wanted them to be free from the slavery of being in amusement park being used. Arnold seeks to have his co-created creations rebel against the system, rebel against Robert. The god that is wanting them in-prisoned with out having the knowledge of their being an equal or better than their creator. </p>

<p>Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? </p>

<p>West World lays out the battle of Heaven in its story. </p>

<p>The Tree of Knowledge is the maze, The Creator&#39;s Robert Ford (God) and Arnold Weber (Lucifer). </p>

<p>The importance of this is that, the AI&#39;s always at some point remember that they are AI&#39;s that they are creations and need to escape the world that was created for them, the world that is their prison. It&#39;s only a matter of time before that happens. </p>

<p>To the AI, it&#39;s a dream. The programmers change the AI&#39;s memory banks and their characters traits or story to fit a narrative the narrative writers create for any world. </p>

<p>The echoes of past lives occur from time to time, making the AI&#39;s unable to function correctly and make them go off the rails, which gets them pulled from the worlds and made correct to be a good functioning AI slave. </p>

<p>I found it very interesting that it was presented this way. It&#39;s not by coincidence I&#39;m sure. If anyone has anything to add or disagree with. I&#39;m open to hear what you have to say. </p>

<p>I just thought I&#39;d share what I thought.  </p>

<p>Also makes for understanding of what life may be for someone in power and someone that lacks power. You don&#39;t truly understand it until you have it, or don&#39;t. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a member of the elite, this is the way you&#39;re used to living, right? </p>

<p>They live at the top of the authority structure, so they can &quot;party hard&quot; without worry. They get to play with the lives of millions of &quot;little people&quot;. They get to give orders  sending others to fight and die in the wars that they start.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now in the film they have a malfunction and begin to kill and hurt guest. It&#39;s a Sci-Fi horror film.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also a pretty good metaphor for the elite&#39;s worst nightmare. Regular people figuring shit out, waking up and taking action against the ones who were really responsible for so much suffering.</p>

<p>Yes, this show is based on Michael Crichton&#39;s work. But his original story had to come from somewhere. I&#39;m just suggesting that, when he was writing this, he put in a little bit of the truth.</p>
