       Well, if you feel so jaded then go do something about it.  You know, bring a homeless person into your house for the winter, give your life savings to him/her and see if their life will turn around.  Yea, kind of figured that answer

       And if they fuck up my house and use what I give them for drugs and then stab me for more money? This shit happened to me I was passing out sandwiches w a group and one of the guys stabbed me, luckily missing all vital organs, but then got a 10k bill because insurance only covered so much.

       While those homeless people set around all day wondering where they are going to get their next fix or next drink, my ass gets up every morning and goes to a fucking job I hate making just barely enough money to pay my rent so I won't be homeless.

       It is estimated that there are over 500,000 homeless people in the US. I'm impressed that you know a majority of them to make your sweeping judgement of all of them. Also, kudos to you for getting up and going to your job. You definitely deserve a cookie for that!

       Of course, but what do you do if you don't have the $59  to book the flight? What do you do if you can't afford to get to the airport? There are a lot of factors at play. Like I said it's easier said than done a lot of times.

       Its less than a days pay at minimum wage.  I understand there are a lot factors (assuming a single person), my only point is its not really crazy expansive for the benefit.  There are under the table day labor jobs in every city (like landscaping etc)...just be at any home depot at 6AM and you will see multiple trucks picking up day workers paid in cash.

       No, i've been to Miami and they had a terrible homeless problem when I was there.  Even just walking in the woods toward a warm climate works as many of the wild planets growing everywhere are actually edible (assuming you do your research).

       Hopefully you’re actually helping the homeless like I have. That said, I’m going back to celebrating the wonderful Christmas traditions with friends and family. Merry Christmas!

       It’s a good idea year round to contribute something to an organization local to you that provides services to the homeless. I haven’t done a lot but I’ve shared my time and talents with such an organization where I live, and brought others along with me to do the same. It was very well received. We as individuals can’t completely solve the homeless problem, but we can help those who are trying. If you can’t donate money or goods you can donate your time.

       The conspiracy is that it's actually one of the richest countries in the world and there's more empty houses than homeless. Capitalism at its finest. And demanding a living wage, healthcare and education is somehow just asking for free stuff.

       I don't understand all the vitriol and hate in the comments of this post. Yes, there are many homeless that are addicts. Yes, many homeless also have mental health issues. They are all still human, though. Op is right. For many of us in the northern hemisphere, we are entering what can be a very cold season. Lots of us also live in areas where temperatures can drop low enough to kill a person with inadequate protection from exposure. Maybe, if you happen to be in an area I've just described and see a person on the streets that you think could be in danger from the elements, instead of cursing them under your breath for whatever perceived wrong that you believe they have committed to put themselves in their situation maybe you could show compassion and try to help them out. Many groups will be happy to come and offer to take the person to someplace safe. The homeless person always has the right to refuse help when it arrives. All you have to do is make a quick call and then be on your merry way. In the md/dc/va area the number to call 1-800-535-7252. You can also dial 311 in many parts of the US and Canada and let them know the situation. It's simple. It doesn't take long. You don't need to engage with the homeless person in question and you could potentially save a life.
