       I thought it was terrific! I especially enjoyed Seymour Hersh's cranky interview where he says the CIA would love that in the end, almost 70 years later, the public will never know what really happened nor the info the CIA protected by assassinating a potential whistleblower; how they love to pull one over on us and how they view it as us v. them and they scored another for their team in us never getting closure. Creeps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, this was a terribly sad injustice for            Dr. Olson's son and his life was spent in pursuit of uncovering the truth of his father's death. I think we can all understand his perspective in obsessively seeking the truth, especially since it was very personal to him.  I hope he can find some peace in this life.

       Thought it was outstanding as well. Some people here saying "limited hangout", but I can't agree with that at all. Prior to seeing this I thought the story was about a government employee who got dosed by his employer, and that's what I thought the film was going to be about. Turns out the back-story is far more interesting and complex than the cover story, which the LSD dosing appears to have been, even if it did actually happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you say, it's as much about the son, but specifically, about the unraveling of the story and how the son responds. He is, in a way, the personification of the "conspiracy theorist", and his father and the family were indeed victims of a conspiracy to murder, authorized at the highest levels of the CIA.

       Looking forward to watching it. What interests me at the moment is that there is definitely a push to have the public more familiar with MKUltra. Several shows on Netflix with MKUltra references and information. Why would TPTB be pushing this onto us now?

       It’s entirely possible TPTB aren’t in control of all media released and some gets out without their approval.

       Definitely possible. It is just interesting to me how much I am hearing about MKUltra in MSM at the moment. Seems like a concerted effort. My theory is a very famous politician that is about to go down may use his past MKUltra testing to his defense like an insanity plea of some sort.

       This docudrama was a bit misleading because it had zero to do with MKUltra outside of the CIA drugging and interrogating their own colleague, Dr. Olson, before they assassinated him.

       I felt it was way too much about Olson and not so much about the actual MK Ultra Program itself. It made it seem like it was a limited small little thing and I just don't think that is th case.

       And there it is, just like the Barry Seal movie, these productions I believe are to compartmentalize and give the public closure.  Both of these conspiracies (MK Ultra, CIA coke smuggling) are now public knowledge and this is nothing more than damage control

       Some will say limited hangout, but I think it’s just about ratings. The “drama” aspect will draw people that the “docu” aspect won’t. It could be beneficial to just focus on the most emotionally compelling aspect of this than the cultural implications, if we do want to inform the general public.

       I was a bit disappointed, great acting and production as you'd expect but I wanted a wider insight.
Shame as there was potential.

       No, it mainly focused on Olson's son spending his entire life trying to find out what really happened. It was very good you should watch it.

       Pretty disappointing IMO really about the Family and search for Truth in the Death of Dr. Olson not so much about the CIA and MKUltra.

       What no one in this thread seems to be getting is that MK Ultra is not what was important -- it was the bio-chemical warfare used in Korea. The doc even explains that the MK Ultra thing was possibly implemented as part of the elaborate cover up for the assassination. The real story is that the CIA killed an American citizen with absolute impunity and how the obsessive son has been, and continues to be, completely incapable of accepting that fact.

       Loved it! Can’t believe that the reporter though is now 79yrs old and won’t cough up the details to protect his source. Given the source has access to this info what else is the source protecting. The comment about them having one over everyone else at the end makes me sick. 
Of all that’s come to light in recent years initially forged as conspiracy theories, I have little time for the cias so called truths
