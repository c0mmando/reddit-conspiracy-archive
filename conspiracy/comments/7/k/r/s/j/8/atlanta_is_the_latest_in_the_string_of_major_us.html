        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>LA is in flames, and it started with a fire set by homeless people in &quot;one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country&quot;</p>

<p>NYC almost got bombed underneath Time Square</p>

<p>San Francisco Mayor dies while grocery shopping. RIP Ed Lee, he was a good man.</p>

<p>Charlotte, the banking capital, has been locked by a cyberattack (Mecklenburg County), with no resolution after 12 days</p>

<p>Then we have Atlanta, come on. World&#39;s busiest airport is blacked out by an electrical fire (backup systems?), during which one and only one plane flies in AND out?? Shady stuff. Immediately following, the entire Atlanta metro area is enveloped by an overwhelming gas smell which we&#39;re supposed to believe is okay?</p>

<p>All of these were human caused, ranging from &quot;highly suspect&quot; to &quot;deliberate attack&quot;. This is just screaming &quot;We&#39;re under siege!&quot;. Anyone else getting that vibe?</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Addition: Tacoma Amtrak derailment definitely deserves a mention. Supposedly caused by a track obstruction. Other sources say it was going 79mph around a 30mph curve.</p>

<p>Edit: if you ask me, theres a theme. Its how to cause the most chaos with the fewest deaths</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone else a fan of Star Wars? Probably. How about the comics and video games that fill out the canon a little more?</p>

<p>After the Emperor dies on the second Death Star, he has a contingency plan activated. Spoilers for Battlefront 2 incoming. Part of it is called Project Cinder, and this includes deliberate attacks on systems loyal to the empire, including Naboo, Palpatine&#39;s home world. The remnants of the empire don&#39;t even do much to fight the Rebel Alliance following the emperor&#39;s death, they just end up eating themselves and ultimately lose the Galactic civil war at the Battle of Jakku. The intent of Project Cinder is to cause chaos to undermine the empire that the emperor lost control over. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, I can&#39;t even offer up any decent they&#39;re, but I thought that pop culture factoid seemed relevant here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost all the news i saw called it &quot;some NC county&quot;. Uhm Mecklenburg is not some NC county, its the most populous, and completely contains Charlotte, which is rapidly becoming a world-map-worthy city. This is huge, and there is absolutely no followup since it happened. So fucking suspect</p>

<p>Also 2 bitcoin is like 40k now. Hackers were smart. More you delay, more you pay. Heh. </p>

<p>This article contains the actual ransom letter, if you&#39;re interested. <a href="http://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/mecklenburg-county-offices-experience-system-wide-computer-outage/658993421">http://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/mecklenburg-county-offices-experience-system-wide-computer-outage/658993421</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man. Charlotte has exploded in the past 20 years. And not necessarily for the better. Lots of weird occult shit about this city, too. </p>

<p>I had a half baked theory a few months ago that Atlanta was <em>supposed</em> to have been the “golden city” of the south, but is slowly being replaced and TPTB decided that they wanted to go in a new direction, this is where Charlotte comes into play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just my ass talking but there&#39;s a lot of weird shit going on and I believe it&#39;s all connected to one huge event in 2018. I&#39;ve had this feeling for months now, I feel like humanity (and our whole way of looking at life) is going to change drastically in 2018. It may be a positive change.</p>

<p>I want it to be aliens, lots of them, and for everyone to see... They don&#39;t have to be evil, but I want humanity to realize that it&#39;s not about nationality or religion or money but it&#39;s about working together as a species. Only when we all come together, as a species, we can rise to the next level. Better technology isn&#39;t enough. It&#39;s a spiritual thing. The aliens know whats up, they&#39;ve probably gone through the same shit, thousands of years before us.</p>

<p>TLDR: We&#39;re not in our ultimate final form. Aliens are better people. 2018 is a spooky year.</p>

<p>Certainly the fires have this aura about them as does possibly Vegas. I think we can abandon the idea that our own population is somehow sacrosanct to the major players with weaponry and grudges.
