        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, which is either symbolic of or literally psychedelic mushrooms. If you assume any real period of time in which humans were regularly using psychedelics, and if you’ve taken psychedelics yourself, you know that the possibilities of our own minds are endless. In fact one could argue that ones own mind IS the universe. After all, the we only experience the universe the way our minds perceive it. </p>

<p>Time only moves forwards because we’ve never experienced different and can’t conceive otherwise. Not without the help of psychedelic knowledge passed down generation through generation. Again, it was most certainly that way at some point in human history. At some point, one man developed the power to time travel. Jesus. </p>

<p>This next portion is based off the fictional story “Rant” by Chuck Palahniuk. Don’t read on if you are easily offended by blasphemy.</p>

<p>Now back to Jesus (we’ll assume time is tangible and paradoxes aren’t an issue.) Simply put, Jesus went back in time and had non consensual sex with his mom Mary (keep in mind it was a different time, and the Bible mentions terrible things like rape and incest and even approves of it in some cases). The only reason I say it was non consensual is because rape victims often suppress the memory of it (the Virgin Mary). Jesus did this many times over, in turn making his neurology more and more perfect, in turn making him a God. The same but different. Separate personages, One mind. The Bible says it all the time, Jesus is his own father. He raised himself, he prayed to himself, he had access to all human knowledge, passed down to himself, from himself.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I don’t necessarily believe in the Bible myself. I simply believe the story itself is highly symbolic. Terrible, very literal interpretations of it, along with suppression via mistranslation gave us the story we know now.  One example, the obvious mistranslation of fungi to “fruit.” I mean, they “knew good and evil” and saw a serpent. How do you get “fruit” from that? The real question is, why would they suppress the fact that the entire mythology of the Bible is based on psychedelics, and time travel via enlightenment..?</p>

<p>Any way that’s my take on the Bible. If you haven’t read “Rant” I highly recommend it. I didn’t spoil anything. </p>

<p>Then what are you talking about? You don&#39;t know the Bible and this theory is horrible. You didn&#39;t even attempt to link anything. You just went on a rant about shit that&#39;s not in the Bible. You even made up some stuff that&#39;s not even in the Bible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of this post is to point out the possibility that the Bible is misinterpreted. I never said anything about it being a true story. If you believe it that’s cool too, I spent my entire adult life as a Christian. There’s nothing to link except the references to the book. I didn’t feel it necessary to link the Bible because, well, it’s the Bible. But what are you even referring to? I didn’t reference much. Yes I was ranting but this is a conspiracy theory after all. Tell me what I got wrong. I’ve read the Bible every day of my life up until I was 19 so please let me know. </p>

<p>Of course it was because of book, it&#39;s not like you&#39;d be attributing a real thing to a fantasy book like people do with Nostradamus.</p>

<p>So god doesn&#39;t matter, nor does the devil. Which means it&#39;s definitely not worth to regulate your life over a mythological book on the <em>chance</em> it may be true. Qur&#39;an is more reliable than the bible. Harry Potter is more worth of a reading, so instead of blindly believing your parents mythological teachings, try to think rationally about everything. </p>

<p>If the bible were true then it wouldn&#39;t be useless, but it is since people can live normally without ever knowing it even exists. The bible was not there when we evolved, nor in the Big Bang, nor 5 thousand years ago and won&#39;t be there in the future like all other mythologies so it&#39;s completely irrelevant for our existence. Eventually the belief fades off, as always, and jesus will be forgotten as he never existed (like Zeus, Pharaoh&#39;s, Native gods and so on).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 18 nations in the Bible.</p>

<p>Only one of these nations (Israel) will have a portion or rather a remnant saved in the day that the LORD visits. The one 1/3rd and the 144,000 elect.</p>

<p>Understanding that only Israelite&#39;s can sin for he only gave them the laws. All 17 other nations will be judged for what they did long ago.</p>

<p><strong>Psalms 83:3-4</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>

<p>4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just so that precept is upon precept</p>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Just to add a little more</em></p>

<p>How about world war 3?</p>

<p><strong>Zechariah 9:5-6</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</p>

<p>6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see the above happening right now. </p>

<p><strong>Zechariah 12:2-4</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.</p>

<p>3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</p>

<p>4 In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see that the father has gathered the nations in the land that is cursed. </p>

<p><strong>Joel 3:2</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fool, it is because you have no faith. </p>

<p>The Bible is just a book bound with papers unless your spirit was destined to have faith. Don&#39;t you get it by now? You can&#39;t feel God because you were destined to follow the other side. You are apart of this matrix. You were not meant to escape the matrix, only those who have the spirit of God can see past the flesh and believe. You are someone who sees your wall while other believe that they can surpass it. I only replied for the sake of edification and awakening of others.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t believe in the God of Israel, it&#39;s okay, it was prophecy that you wouldn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought before, that perhaps the story of the Garden of Eden is actually a socio-cultural memory, leftover from our pre-human ancestors, who were once in a land of abundance. It was in this land of abundance that our consciousness first arose, that our first ancestor began the journey to our modern mind. Carried down through myth and legend, preserved through the eons, the story holds the kernel of that time, several million years ago, when the conscious spark was lit. I think that the myths of Perseus and bringing Fire to mankind may also be cultural memories of the first ancestor to master fire, who would have gained incredible power in his group with this newfound ability. Just my 2 cents. </p>

<p>Adam word comes from Atman (soul) from hinduism. </p>

<p>Eve word comes from jeev/jeevi/jeeva (material body) </p>

<p>In the original story, it speaks of two birds, one perched on the branch of the tree, which signifies the body, and eating its fruit, the other merely watching (the soul).</p>

<p>The first bird represents a Jiva, or individual self. She has a female nature, being a shakti, an energy of God. When the jiva becomes distracted by the fruits (signifying sensual pleasure), she momentarily forgets her lord and lover and tries to enjoy the fruit independently of him. This separating forgetfulness is maha-maya (the great illusion), or enthrallment, spiritual death, and constitutes the fall of the jiva into the world of material birth, death, disease and old age.</p>

<p>The second bird is the atman, an aspect of God who accompanies every living being in the heart while it remains in the material world. He is the support of all beings and is beyond sensual pleasure.</p>

<p>I recommend you continue to read the Bible which is the Word of God.  Pray for God to draw near to you and He will.  He loves you, he created you and he desires for you to spend eternity with Him alongside the Church Triumphant.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>You replied to them literally a minute after they replied to you, so I&#39;m going to assume you didn&#39;t do much more than open the link and read the first line, if that.</p>

<p>The blog gives examples and quotes of what OP is talking about, with references/citations.</p>
