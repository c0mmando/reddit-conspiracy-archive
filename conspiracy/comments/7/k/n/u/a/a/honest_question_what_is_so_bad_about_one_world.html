       The world is full of far too much diversity for one governmental body to be able to accurately represent and work for the citizens in a way that would truly unite people.

       People cannot be forced to unite through government. They would have to want to -- and they do not.

       Socialism is workplace democracy, so I don't know what you're worried about. Literally workers owning the means of production. Not all socialists believe in State-Owned Enterprises as the be-all-end-all of socialism. You mean Authoritarianism maybe, or Welfare Capitalism.

       They never would, that's why a World Government is considered an impossible Utopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's good for a political platform to run off in Indonesia, is probably awful for a civilization elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       World Government has always been an impossible dream.  The way it's being forced on the world is nothing less than criminal.  This is why depopulation is a massive agenda for World Government.  The less dissenters, the more control.  No way in hell a World Government would be able to control 8 billion and counting.

       I would argue that democracy would not be the best form of a world government. Elements of democracy would be needed but the issue I have with democracy is that it requires voting, which has its own set of problems, and it would require well informed voters. I don't know about you but I hardly feel well enough informed to weigh in on local issues, much less decisions that would effect the world at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think a world government is viable until we can find a way to allow people to have a voice without letting the uninformed or manipulated masses weigh in on things they don't understand.

       I don't trust half of the country I live in to make informed decisions on issues (myself included) so you'll get no argument from me there at all.   Bring the entire population of the world into the picture, and that goes for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       A world government isn't viable at all, agree there too.  Consensus will never be reached amongst 8 billion, which is why depopulation is so important.

       That's a great question since Conspiracy Theorists cry about how bad they currently have it (from their warm homes, on blazing fast internet, through their 2k laptop, while smoking some of their ounce of weed and having a second page up for new ps4 games of the week.) So if it's sooooo bad for them now, you would think they would welcome some change.

       Oh wait...anything that's done is automatically a conspiracy and they cry about how bad they have it. My bad.

       To answer your first question. People will never be united. EVER. That's why religion and ethnicity exists. The human mind is too dense to realize those things shouldn't matter. You can make a currency united, but not man.

       This is exactly right. I think about boards like /x/ and other subs like this one where the common narrative is that government can't be trusted, everything is larp so they don't believe in anything and if they do believe it the government is behind it. They expect the government to provide this comfort of modern society here in the west yet call for its dismantling regularly and replace it with "something different". But even still it would never work, people wont unite, peace is impossible, utopia is impossible so instead 'we' sit here and bitch, except the shitty system we have in place waiting for it to change.

       Its an endless loop of thought, so to speak. We want something different, we dont know what that nothing is but peace and cooperation is impossible because "people wouldn't go for it". So where does that leave us exactly? Endlessly searching for a solution that we wont even accept?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that the real problem people are those who refuse peace because of fear/doubt. They are the only one's holding us back. You wouldn't have to have a mass genocide, you wouldn't need to get rid of all religions and we wouldn't just set something up run by one person who makes all of the decisions. That wouldn't be possible anyway. I think we are not far from the peace we all want but we have to at least be willing and able to have the discussion about what peace looks like. If we dont/cant ever talk about it, it will never happen.

       Peace is for peaceful things. Humans are violent by nature. History shows that. We don't want peace. That sort of thing is beneath us.

       You're right there too but i don't know if im ready to accept that humans aren't capable of peace. We are kind of like the girl who says she HATES drama yet always shit posting her problems on Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that leads to one inevitable conclusion then....if we don't peace and aren't capable of it...then the only recourse is COMPLETE control of world governments and humans. We have to mold ourselves and future generations into accepting unity and living peacefully. Seems like it needs to be done for us.

       The One World Government is the dentist. There are no options or accountability so when they don't live up to modern society's expectations, well what are you going to do about it?

       There's nothing inherently wrong with a world government. I think it's something we'll inevitably end up with. The issue is what form this government would take, I argue that no current form of govt. would work, we need something new. Then there's the issue of creating a body of laws which would work across the globe, translate across multiple cultures.

       A one world government is still run by fallible men.  With a one world government, there would be no checks and balances.  One man's idea of paradise is another man's hell.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  We are way to divided to unite as one.  For a one world government to work, all religions must be done away with, ala John Lennon's 'Imagine'.  Who gets to decide what the government deems allowable and not?  Just a few thoughts from an uneducated non intellectual like me.
Animal Farm and 1984 were required reading when I was in school.

       How much have you read about the NWO agenda?  It is more than just a one world government.  They also want to reduce the population to about 500M.  THEY decide who gets culled and who survives.  Also, the leaders of the one world government would not be elected.  There is a reason that the American middle class has been decimated.  It is not needed in the NWO, and it is the one power base that could derail their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real NWO agenda is to take the North Korean model and apply it to the world.  This is Luciferianism/Satanism where they want to live as gods in this material world.  There would be a small ruling class, a larger slave class, and a control class that will keep the slave class in line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I am sure there are one world government models that could work for humanity as a whole, but that has nothing to do with the NWO.  I mean, the EU could work wonderfully, but it was created by evil people for evil purposes.  We are seeing that today.

       Also to the people who are stating it would never work or trying to unify the world would be a diaster, why exactly? What does your idea of unification look like? Does it involve force, does it involve one religion or many? What makes any of you believe we can't have peace right now when this entire time we've never sought any resemblance of the word?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were more people on Earth who believe in peace and working towards a peaceful future, would that make it more possible to achieve it or would it be irrelevant?  It seems like everyone who talks about One World government envisions a shadowy man in a suit and tie petting his evil or 1984-esk style dystopia. I think hollywood and pop culture have achieved at least some level control over the narrative when it comes to these sort of topics whether intentionally or unintentionally. We've convinced ourselves that peace could never work without mass deaths or total control by one person/government. I mean just think about that...if world peace isn't possible, what the hell are we going to do?

       Even more honest question: what is so bad about one world government that consistently lies to the people about many critical issues, including its own existence?

       I personally am not particularly against or for anybody. I am not even sure if the regular, salt of the earth people are any better - categorically - than the evil elites. I have a tendency to try and understand things, critic what is presented to me as the formula etc. That's why I'm currently on this sub. Although I can answer you, from the top of my head, like this what's wrong about one world government is more or less what's wrong about any government, organization, hierarchy etc. Assholes gaining power and abusing, oppressing 'innocent' people. As for secrecy, it makes things easier for the assholes.

       Governments get taken over by the psychopaths eventually. They cheat and thus have an advantage over others. They all rise to the top and join together and... then you have what you get today.

       I argue in the opposite direction.   Complete decentralization of government with governing blocks of no more than 100 people.   People will be far more accountable and invested in outcomes if they know everyone leading and being led by name.

       The human species is not capable of having a world government governing over 7.6 billion people.
