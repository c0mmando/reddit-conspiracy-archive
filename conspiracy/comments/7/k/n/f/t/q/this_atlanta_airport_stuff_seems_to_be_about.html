<p>It seems it basically boils down to them wanting to smuggle something out of the country undetected. </p>

<p>The fact that there are armed guards walking around refusing anyone to leave tells me this is extremely real. </p>

<p>I personally think its Elites escaping, track that plane reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no, they had to get past radiation detectors, they wouldn&#39;t tell people to not leave, they wouldn&#39;t have armed guards keeping people <strong>detained</strong>, something serious is going on. That plane that left went to Cyprus, anyone who is tracking is can see, they are transporting elites/slaves/or warheads, those are the only three things that would have this type of security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats why I think they were catching someone and sending him to turkey/ Israel/ Saudi... They locked it down to catch him, cut power and put cell jammers up to make it hard to film/ share. I&#39;m wondering if its the guy erdogan wanted Flynn to capture so america could buy turkeys favor against Iran? Or another Saudi prince that salmon wanted in his crack down? Or someone Israel wanted? They coukd of loaded the cargo plane with a gift and a prisoner in exchange for something in return and atlanta was the rendezvous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is true, but they did not properly indicate this with released information on the airport closing, meaning they wanted this plane to be undetected by the general masses, also the secondary service of no custom agents and no going through customs is sketchy af and alone warrants the idea of something nefarious with this plane occurred/is occurring. </p>

<p>The important part is this plane is going to Tel Aviv, it is likely an elite transfer (safely), a huge slave transfer/sale, or nuclear material/warheads being delivered. </p>

<p>If you want my opinion, I believe its the nuclear material/warheads, with everything going on in the Middle East, I expect a large Israel false flag that they can use to completely remove Palestinians from the region. </p>

<p>You could watch it on FlightRadar. There was no hiding it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that it contained live, perishable, or dangerous cargo that couldn&#39;t sit on the tarmac for X hours.</p>

<p>Bit of a jump there. I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s no actual evidence to support that belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could hide the trail by flying in and out of the airport as normal.</p>

<p>Shutting down an airport and being the only plane flying out doesn&#39;t hide your trail. </p>

<p>If someone was trying to smuggle nukes there are 1000&#39;s of military/private planes and airport they could use.</p>

<p>If there is some conspiracy going on something like smuggling nukes is going on... I doubt (((they))) would be so dumb as to shut an airport down then smuggle something out in the only plane that left while the airport was closed  in a plane that was 100% trackable, transponder on. </p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy, this is probably red herring / misdirection.</p>

<p>My bet is some terror threat they took care of and don&#39;t want to tell anybody about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s a lot of people in these comments speculating that that this power outage was done on purpose in order to smuggle something out of the country on the plane that was allowed to leave during...</p>

<p>if they were trying to do this in secret, why wouldn&#39;t they just hire a private airplane and do it on a private airstrip somewhere? why would they cause a power outage in one of the busiest airports in the world? to keep a secret? doesn&#39;t sound right to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree strongly. If you want to smuggle something undetected you don&#39;t shut down one of the world&#39;s busiest airport for half a day, creating an internationally reported incident. </p>

<p>Seems to me you&#39;d have to be after something that was already at the airport, and want it very badly indeed, in order to justify something so publicly visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest I wonder if it wasn&#39;t a foiled human trafficking operation. </p>

<p>First of all CAL Cargo Airlines ships &quot;100,000 tons of cargo annually including all categories of nonstandard cargo: temperature controlled pharmaceutical and healthcare products, live animals, dangerous goods, oversize &amp; overweight cargo, fresh perishable products and valuable goods including fine art.&quot; (wikipedia) </p>

<p>As the OP&#39;s link says CAL Cargo Airlines also owns LACHS which loads and unloads cargo. &#39;Initially founded to handle and transport perishables, our entire infrastructure is built to facilitate incredibly fast transfer from plane to trucks, for quick delivery to market.&#39; It bypasses customs.</p>

<p>This sounds a lot like the cargo services of Masterpiece International. They ship &#39;priceless artworks&#39; all over the world and are a licensed U.S. Customs broker. Therefore they too can ship cargo bypassing usual customs oversight. 
<a href="https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php">https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php</a></p>

<p>This Voat thread outlines the connections between the Foundation for Art &amp; Preservation of Embassies to Rotheschlds, Rockefellers, Clintons, Alefantis, Abramovic, among others. It seems to be a front for money laundering...
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1855938">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1855938</a>
And through the use of Masterpiece International and its customs bypassing shipment capabilities, it may even be a direct route for human trafficking able to ship pretty much anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>I would argue that although the Israel-benefiting nuke smuggling op. theory that 4chan came up with is a good one, there&#39;s also the possibility of the CAL Cargo Airlines flight that left Atlanta during the black-out was a human trafficking operation.</p>

<p>A snapchat video shows 3 blacked out SUV&#39;s used to escort someone from a plane, allegedly &#39;THE&#39; plane.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kmde3/interesting_snapchat_from_the_atlanta_power/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kmde3/interesting_snapchat_from_the_atlanta_power/</a></p>

<p>Could it be that this was a human trafficking operation that was foiled? It seems someone was escorted off the plane (perhaps into custody) and the plane was certainly grounded long enough for cargo to be unloaded.</p>

<p>CAL Cargo&#39;s main ports of call include Atlanta &amp; NY, Norway, Mexico City, Israel &amp; Cyprus - all known hubs of human trafficking, as well as Belgium (where LACHS&#39; hub is) and Austria. So it wouldn&#39;t be unthinkable for the CAL Cargo/LACHS partnership to be human trafficking based.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although the plane was seemingly &quot;emptied&quot;, <a href="https://squawker.org/analysis/atlantacu/">here</a>, this plane was able to take off absolutely fine, and it stops in Tel-Aviv, it had already taken off before any bullshit.</p>

<p>My personal opinion: Make it look like your using one plane, but really using another. </p>
