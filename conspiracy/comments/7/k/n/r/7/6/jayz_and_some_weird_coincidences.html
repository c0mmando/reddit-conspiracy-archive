        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People say Jay-Z is in the Illuminati, that he has political and social influence right? Overall, he is a powerful, influential figure. We talk a lot about connections such as 9/11, Rockefeller, Etc. Here are a few crazy coincidences I have noticed about Jay-Z:</p>

<p>-1. The infamous &quot;Roc-a-Fella Records&quot; is obviously inspired by the name &quot;Rockefeller&quot;, one of the most powerful and influential families in the world. </p>

<p>-2.The symbol he uses is a pyramid (all seeing eye, Illuminati, dollar bill) formed by his hand (other rappers and entertainers have used this since).</p>

<p>-3. The craziest one, His album &quot;The Blueprint&quot; was released September 11, 2001, the day that changed the world forever. This album was also recorded in New York. </p>

<p>-4. He has been accused of being a &quot;Devil worshipper&quot; along with many other entertainers and politicians and his connection along with Podesta, Lady Gaga and others with the whole &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; thing is quite fascinating. He has been seen wearing Aliester Crowley quotes on his sweater. </p>

<p>I know that this post is silly so please don&#39;t attack me for posting this. I would appreciate if you guys find more interesting connections and coincidences with him to write in the comments!</p>

If God made it why would it be evil... Unless God is evil. If God is evil why are there good things? There are no evil things created by God except actions of humans which humans make choices to commit. Everything else is part of a process by nature fundamental to the functioning of the universe.

    <div class="md"><p>God didn&#39;t make diseases, God made the potential for them to exist. Diseases come as a result of our actions. Living conditions, not living in harmony with love, all of the things we do effect our environment and ourselves. These things either cause viruses and diseases or allow them to effect us whereas they otherwise did not. The black plague, for example, was a mutation that occurred because of living conditions in Europe. </p>

Because they clearly know the entire existence of their creation before they even create it. Lol. If I can write down exactly what you will do, and show you after your day is done, that I was 100% right as to what would happen, how could you claim to have a choice. You don&#39;t.

<p>No you are genuinely salty and raging out because you can&#39;t accept the fact you don&#39;t know everything. You have the intellect of a 12 year old and claim you know how an omnipotent God, that you claim doesn&#39;t exist and that you&#39;ve never en ountered functions.</p>

<p>God sees all and knows what you will do because he has complete information. That means you can do what you want but god knows what you will do because he knows even more than those with the intent to act do. If you don&#39;t accept that you&#39;re just stupid and literally have convinced yourself of one belief that isn&#39;t even rigorous. I&#39;ve seen God, even you admit you haven&#39;t so how would you know what God&#39;s capable of. Lol. When they say disbelievers are deluded it really shines through. The ignorance on you is not only astounding but self affirming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not religious, but has seen God. Hahahahahaha!!! If you believe you have seen God, then you are religious  </p>

<p>There is no salt. That is just ridiculous. If God has complete information and he created us, then he created us knowing what his creations would do, which is the same as creating them to do those things, because God already knew what they would do before creating them. </p>

<p>Yes, anyone who has claimed to have seen God is crazy or a liar. Why don&#39;t you prove it with something more than just your lying or deluded word. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t do what you want if the being that created you already knew what you would do. That means your &quot;choices&quot; we&#39;re decided before you were even created. How is that free will? It&#39;s not. It&#39;s fulfilling your destiny. It&#39;s just actually doing all the stuff the creator created you to do. How can you create something knowing exactly what it will do yet claim you created it with free will? No, you created it to do exactly what you know it will do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, see you do have to prove things to other human beings. That&#39;s the part that crazy, deluded people and liars don&#39;t get. They think they can say the most ridiculous things and not have to prove them. Lol. And to point out yet another logical inconsistency, how do you know that God can do what you claim? Seeing him gives you the perfect insight into God. You now know everything he can do. Lol. It&#39;s beyond insane. Even an insane person would be able to recognize they are likely just insane. </p>

<p>Believing in a God is a man made concept. Called religion. Lol. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand omnipotence. Especially if you think it can exist alongside free will. Can God create a burrito so hot even he couldn&#39;t eat it? Lol. No. God can&#39;t create free will. At least not if he is omnipotent. </p>

You don&#39;t even want to. You have an intellectual I&#39;d you think is right with no attempt to challenge it. You have to prove it to yourself just as I had to prove it to myself, as jesus had to prove it to himself, as everyone who has seen God has had to do because it is a relationship between you and God not between me and you and then me and God back to you.</p>

<p>God would never create a burrito because God doesn&#39;t eat. See you&#39;re more religious than I am because you don&#39;t even know anything about God you just take talking points from theological discourse because, shockingly, you know nothing about God. You lack even basic reasoning ability. What a shock  though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s accept for a moment that we have free will.  Then, that means God created us knowing we would make a choice against His directive and sin.  He created us knowing He would condemn us to eternal punishment.  How does that speak to a loving creator?</p>

<p>Oh, but he sent His Son in the fashion of religions before (another conversation) to forgive those who seek salvation through the Son.  But... What about everyone before?  Because the Son says no man shall see the kingdom of heaven except through Him.</p>

<p>So, if we have free will in God&#39;s great scheme, then He is washing His hands of the guilt of causing mankind to fall.  He isn&#39;t taking the blame for HIS actions.  Sounds rather irresponsible to me.   So, to keep God on the throne and validate religion, we must forgo free will.  Otherwise, there&#39;s a mote in the eye of the Almighty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because God gives us the freedom to do what we want. That&#39;s loving. He also gives us the freedom to always change our decisions to act away from sin. That&#39;s loving. We were never born in sin. That&#39;s loving.  We inherited sin because of what our fathers did. That&#39;s... Loving I guess but I&#39;m still dealing with that one. He also gave us penalties when we act out of love, that&#39;s VERY loving. It ensures we are always being drawn back to loving actions by making it harder to sin. There is also no hell. There is only the personal hells people put themselves in because of their own CHOICES to sin over and over and over again. That&#39;s loving. It&#39;s loving because it is to make it harder to sin, for them to want to stop sinning, and to want to come back to love. That is not only loving to the person but it means it is harder for people to sin so that order can always return to the world. That&#39;s loving. </p>

<p>Free will is the greatest act of love.</p>

<p>God&#39;s only actions are creating man kind, giving us gifts, God only does loving things you just think the Bible is somehow related to God when it&#39;s not. Do you blame Toyota when someone gets hit by a car? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a post I made about Jay Z and Spirit Cooker Marina Abramovich:</p>

<p>Heads up: I don&#39;t really believe in the whole magik or spiritual shit, but this is a weird coincidence I found in Jay Z&#39;s song Family Feud from his album 4:44.</p>

<p>Now, we all know Marina Abramovic, the infamous spirit cooker from the Podesta emails. Here&#39;s a video of her spirit cooking:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EsJLNGVJ7E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EsJLNGVJ7E</a></p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s a picture of Jay Z with Marina:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2015/05/jay-z-marina-abramovic.png">https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2015/05/jay-z-marina-abramovic.png</a></p>

<p>And here&#39;s where it gets weird, if it wasn&#39;t already...
Lyric from Jay Z&#39;s Family Feud:</p>

<p>&quot;I told my wife the spiritual shit really works&quot;
<a href="https://genius.com/Jay-z-family-feud-lyrics">https://genius.com/Jay-z-family-feud-lyrics</a></p>

<p>Hmm... could he be referring to Spirit Cooking? What does he mean by it works? The next line is:
&quot;Alhamdulillah, I run through &#39;em all&quot;</p>

<p>Strange coincidence to say the least. Also Marina is 70 YEARS OLD. She looks no less than 50. Either really good make up or genes. Or the spiritual shit really does work...</p>

I kind of wanted to doubt it because I figured maybe this was photoshopped or something but no , it doesnt look photoshopped. The music industry has gotten scarier and scarier. This is just so much proof of that. Jayz ... Beyonce is definitely into that ish too. It&#39;s crazy. Look in her eyes , they almost seem dead now. Katy Perry and Rihanna has gotten into that stuff too. She&#39;s been acting weird lately... in anycase I got ask God to protect me. This is some scary ish</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You should do some research on OTO, Aleister Crowley and Thelema.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, i&#39;m aware of all that stuff.</p>

<p>OTO is just a variant of the Freemasons. My Dad was a freemason. There&#39;s nothing special about them. It&#39;s basically just a fraternity really and they don&#39;t have any special influence.</p>

<p>The US was founded by Christians. The Christian faith was the main religion in the US. Like I said in my other comment, the entertainment industry was founded by Jewish people who don&#39;t share the same faith.</p>

<p>Because they don&#39;t share the same values as the Christians, Christians for decades have been having fits about any kind of outside esoteric messages. Christian groups as a result, used to make a big fuss about this stuff. The industry noticed that the controversy led to better sales because people wanted to know what the issue was about.</p>

<p>Back in the 40s, the red scare led to McCarthyism where the US government accused Hollywood of trying to subvert the moral fiber of American youth by selling &#39;sin&#39; in entertainment.</p>

<p>Hollywood made fun of them and the issue became a joke but the rub is that Hollywood actually was doing that stuff because it sells better.</p>

<p>As it stands now, making fun of Christians nowadays is about the easiest way to score points with youth demographics.</p>

<p>Hollywood sells to teenagers, teenagers like edgy stuff, they have plenty of disposable income. It&#39;s not rocket science, it&#39;s social psychology.</p>

<p>Heavy Metal in the 80s was called &#39;Satanic&#39; too. There was hearings about that stuff. Singers like Dee Snider had to testify in court about it. It was ridiculous. The whole thing was just marketing. Even Slayer, the most well known &#39;satanic&#39; band released statements saying that they weren&#39;t serious and the lead singer is actually Catholic.</p>

<p>None of this satanic or secret organization stuff is real.</p>

<p>What is real is that Jay-Z works for Universal Music, one of the big 3 music major labels in the US. Roc-a-fella is owned by Def Jam, which is a subsidiary of Universal. The other 2 major labels is Sony &amp; Warner. Disney also owns a label but it&#39;s not as big.</p>

<p>These companies own pretty much everything music related you hear on tv, the radio, or in movies. Universal&#39;s parent company isn&#39;t even from the US. They&#39;re owned by a French company called Vivendi which is one of the main reasons hip hop is full of ads for expensive French fashion companies like Louis Vuitton and Gucci.</p>

Why sacrifice your body at your peak to have a kid with a business partner?  Once she got pregnant with the twins- and I do think she carried those- she really couldn&#39;t go much higher, so it made more sense to do it legit then. Also makes sense that she&#39;d need to do things via IVF, as twins are very common through that process. Makes me strongly question whether he&#39;s the father of them though. </p>

<p>&quot;It seems that as Jay’s success level rises, he believes that his past prayers towards such have been answered and has a newfound love for religion. If one worked, others must, right? He states he’ll “run through ‘em all,” even throwing out the Arabic “Alhamdulillah,” meaning “Praise be to God,” normally used within the Muslim community.&quot;</p>

<p>Though different in meaning, Jay also has a 2016 song called “spiritual,” which has a related line:</p>

<p>(All this work can pay off)
I just want all this work to pay off
(Just don’t calculate us)
Don’t calculate us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is either corrupt or very pretentious. Here is some other stuff I can recall off the top of my head.</p>

<p>∙ Calls himself J H.O.V.A and is close friends with Yeezus (kanye).</p>

<p>∙ &quot;Oh, you gonna learn today, where the fuck have you been,
The world&#39;s under new management&quot; - Jay-Z - Open Letter</p>

<p>∙ &quot;J.Z. knows the truth, but he chose sides with evil in order to be accepted in the corporate world. J.Z. conceals the truth from the black community and the world, and promotes the lifestyle of the beast instead&quot; - Prodigy </p>

<p>∙ I can&#39;t find the video, but there was an interview years ago with The Game and he was talking about his beef with Jay. He said that it was impossible to get near to Jay, implying that he is some kind of elite with special protection.</p>

<p>∙ &quot;I used to say &#39;fuck mic skills, and never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti, That&#39;s right it&#39;s wicked, that&#39;s life I live it
Ain&#39;t asking for forgiveness for my sins, endz&quot; Jay-Z - D&#39;Evils</p>

<p>∙ My flesh, no nigga could test
My soul is possessed by D&#39;Evils in the form of diamonds and Lexus&#39;s
The exorcist, got me doing skits like Homie
You don&#39;t know me, but the whole world owe me strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I&#39;m down for whatever, ain&#39;t nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me
I can&#39;t be held accountable, D&#39;Evils beating me down, boo
Got me running with guys, making G&#39;s, telling lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I&#39;m giving lead showers
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it&#39;s best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he&#39;ll never testify&quot; - Jay-Z - D&#39;Evils</p>

<p>∙ &quot;Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati,
they can&#39;t believe this much skill is in the human body&quot; Jay-Z - Heaven</p>

<p>∙ &quot;Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a &#39;ghini
I&#39;m secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y&#39;all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I&#39;m like Michael, recycle, these are not 16&#39;s
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he&#39;s a preacher, I&#39;m a motherfuckin&#39; prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don&#39;t answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh&quot; - Jay-Z - Heaven</p>

<p>Person take. I think puff and Jay-Z were instrumental in the downfall of Christopher Wallace. I think biggie stumbled upon some form of musical flow that is key to how the manufacture rap/hip-hop. Biggie just had this ultimate flow. Not really sure why they had to kill him though. Most likely to tie up Tupac operation. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>-1. The infamous &quot;Roc-a-Fella Records&quot; is obviously inspired by the name &quot;Rockefeller&quot;, one of the most powerful and influential families in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you believe what Jay-Z, Dash, Kareem Burke, and Nas say, Roc-a-Fella came from a Brooklyn hustler named Rocafella who died of AIDS when it was first becoming an epidemic.  Which has turned them into the butt of a whole lot of gay jokes in the hip hop community.</p>

<p>From Nas &quot;Ether&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that&#39;s the guy y&#39;all chose to name your company after?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Jaz-O &quot;Love is Gone&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rocafella had the crown on the block, him and Sync gettin&#39; bent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that I don&#39;t think Jay-Z is into something with as powerful as he is, but I think the Rockafeller/Roc-a-fella thing is a stretch.  Jay-Z wasn&#39;t shit when Roc-a-Fella Records was created.</p>
