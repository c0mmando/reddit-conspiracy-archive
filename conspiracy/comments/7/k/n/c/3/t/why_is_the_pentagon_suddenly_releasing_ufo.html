       By now, everyone has seen the eye-popping NY Times article and the video that came with it.
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">
        https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html
       </a>
       Why?  Why now?  Why is the Pentagon all of a sudden admitting it is spending money on UFO research? Why are there multiple spottings of cigar shaped inter-stellar objects that could be  an alien spaceship, suddenly being reported on?  Why is Tom DeLonge all of a sudden being approached by former Pentagon officials to disclose UFOs?  Why is the military purposely flying squads of airplane at night in formations that can easily be mistaken as gigantic UFOs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why you ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they need to come up with an explanation for trillions of missing dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s think rationally for a moment.  The UFO phenomenon has been filmed since the 1940’s when Foo Fighters were first spotted.
       <a href="http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2016/10/foo-fighters-of-world-war-ii.html">
        http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2016/10/foo-fighters-of-world-war-ii.html
       </a>
       Over the decades there have been countless testimonies and sightings by credible sources (like military/commercial pilots) let alone hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage.  Ask anyone in the world if they know what a UFO is and they will answer yes.  Are we to believe that the strongest, the most advanced military in the world does not know everything there is to know about UFOs in 2010’s?  Are we to believe that the research into the topic only began on 2007 as according to the NYT?  Absurd!  How naïve do you have to be to believe such utter non-sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter the threat of the first-ever audit of the Pentagon and the DoD.
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-10/pentagon-undergo-first-ever-audit-after-decades-sloppy-accounting-and-missing-trilli">
        http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-10/pentagon-undergo-first-ever-audit-after-decades-sloppy-accounting-and-missing-trilli
       </a>
       As the saying goes, they’re up the creek without a paddle.  Yes, they are missing AT LEAST $21 trillion by some estimates and as much as $29 trillion by more “sensationalistic” media outlets.
       <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/29-trillion-dollars-missing-from-pentagon-trump-calls-for-audit/">
        http://investmentwatchblog.com/29-trillion-dollars-missing-from-pentagon-trump-calls-for-audit/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did all this money go?  Well, I’d imagine some went to legit above top secret weapons research.  Now, most of these experiments probably failed, wasting trillions.  The military has every motivation to hide failed experiments while publicizing the crap out of successful ones.  Why?  Because repeated reports of failures will drive the public and Congress to doubt about funding future projects.  So they hide the unsuccessful results as much as possible.   They simply don’t want their revenue stream reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next?  Probably a significant amount went in to illegal operations and sensitive surveillance.  After all, you can’t actually put into accounting ledgers that we were spying on our closest allies or that we were responsible for certain insurrections in the Middle East, or that we’re actually protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan, right?   Or that we’re even spending vast resources monitoring our own population unconstitutionally.  No, no, all those things have to be off-the-books.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I suspect that large sums of money were embezzled or diverted to enrich the Military Industrial Complex.  All those extravagant perks don’t come cheap you know.  Who cares if the military pays $200k for an LCD monitor that costs $50 to make.  It’s all free money.  Well, to them that is, because it’s our money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what to do?  How are the Pentagon and the DoD going to account for over $20 trillion in missing funds?  Well, you figure they’ll point to covert programs and secret development for up to $10 trillion or so.  But there’s just no way they’re going to come up with an acceptable explanation for all $20+ trillion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s where the UFO patsy comes in.  Yes.  They are going to reveal that trillions that were actually squandered (or outright stolen) were justifiably spent on the following:
1.  To research and validate the existence of UFOs.
2.  To devise and construct early warning systems (such as a satellite network) that can detect UFOs encroaching on our space.
3.  To come up with feasible ways to defend ourselves against an unlikely but possible alien invasion.
4.  Labs and research centers dedicated to understanding how the UFOs function should they turn out to be real.
5.  Etc. etc. bla bla bla…
      </p>
      <p>
       You see where they’re going with this?  When the entire planet is at stake, $10+ trillion in defense suddenly doesn’t seem so bad.   Of course, no evidence of actual development or proof of systems will ever be disclosed.  You know, national security and all.  But all this hinges on the majority of the population believing that UFO are real and that a credible threat is a possibility.  This is why more and more information will be released from the Pentagon in the coming months.  They want you to believe!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you need proof of my argument, just look at the NY Times article.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, the $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was almost impossible to find.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The very first line of the article specifically states the amount spent on this program.  Why does it make such an emphasis in this insignificant amount of $22 million?  Simple.  They are trying to program us in to accepting that it is normal to spend money on UFO research.  Need more proof?  Look further down the article.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue?” Mr. Elizondo wrote in a resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you see the psychological manipulation?  Do you see how the article is trying to make us believe that funding for UFO research is not only justified but absolutely necessary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t fall for this crap.  While I’m a firm believer in UFOs, I also know damn well that the DoD, CIA, NSA and just about every powerful agency in the country knows the full truth of UFOs.  They’ve known for decades!  They’re just trying to convince you that all that money that’s missing?  Well, that it was well spent.  They’re gonna claim they’re saving your ass from greys and reptilians so just be thankful.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the coming months (and even years), the government will release more and more info on UFOs.  Do not fall for it.  It’s old news.  It’s stuff the govt has known for a long time, carefully packaged to make you think… “hmm, maybe we DO need to spend more money on UFO research and defense.”  It’s all a ruse.  It’s all a scam.  They’re just trying to cover their ass for the missing $29 trillion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the real “Project Blue Beam”.  It is to obfuscate and justify the trillions that have been illegally used by our own military.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  Upon re-reading my post, I seem to be saying that UFOs definitely exists and the govt has been hiding it.  I am not.  I am saying the govt fully knows for sure whether they exist or not.  I do not know what they know.  All I'm saying is that they are using psyop to get people to question "MAYBE UFOs exists".   When enough people start questioning the existence of UFOs, their secret unaccounted $10+ trillion spent on supposed projects to verify UFOs will seem justified.  It will all be BS because they already know whether they exist or not and have known for decades.

       I agree that the UFO/Aliens posts and reports are distractions...and your assumptions are good.  I also think that we will see more and more of these reports coming out as the noose tightens around the elites as they are afraid of exposure of their crimes against humanity (withheld medical cures, advanced technologies, funding regional/national wars etc...).

       Only thing is. Nobody gives a crap about the ufo story. Other than people into ufos. If they wanted to distract from 21 trillion. They could literally say. We lost 21 trillion and the masses could give a shit. Its over. The government could flat out say we were behind 9/11 sandyhook jfk assassination pulse night club shooting. And all it would do is garner a few peaceful protests before falling to the next #metoo scandal.

       My opinion...they are using UFOs/alien stories because it is bigger than losing money.  They need a cover for the "slow drip" of exposure of advanced technologies and medical cures that are going to start becoming public.  If the public knew that the elites have been hiding all these new technologies/cures from the masses, they would be literally marched on and lynched on the spot.  Apparently, the elite has been buying up all the patents and been keeping stuff hidden for a century.  Why...because look how profitable it is for big pharma to keep selling medicine that only contains the symptoms of a disease.  Look how much money oil brings to the middle east.  Imagine if energy could be generated without oil and without big solar panels and without huge windmills etc...  or Cancers had cures etc...?   The elites can only hope that the public is stupid enough to think that UFOs/aliens "brought" this technology with them here (or that we discovered the technology along with discovering the aliens in the Antarctic. My take.

       Nobody gives a crap because a majority of the people don't believe in UFOs (yet).  This is what they're working on.  To get the majority of the people to believe in them.  Then the lost money could be conveniently blamed on UFO research and no one will complain.  Hence the release of new info from now on.

       Again, you're assuming most people think like you or me on these issues. They'll look at $29 trillion and they would just go onto the next news article or whatever. No one cares about anything the government does. Picture the USSR in the 1980s where no one really acknowledges the government's issues. Same thing except the government will never collapse because of endless funds from central banks.

       Ok. I get it.  I see what you're saying.  But all I'm saying is that, $29 trillion is just too much to just sweep under the rug.

       Do you know how much money that is?  Imagine you have a Billion Dollar Bill.  That's a lot of money right?  That would last multiple life times no matter how extravagant you are, right?

       I unfortunately tend to agree with you here. The recent past (at the 21st century) has been so filled with "scandals" of awful things going on with our government, all of it sort of adding up, snowballing in the mind of the public. The public's view of the government wasn't glorious already when the century turned, but these days with everything that's happened, I think the average person that would hear the news that our government has foolishly squandered such a large amount of money would say something along the lines of "Oh look, yet another example of our government being absolutely stupid" and they'd move on. They wouldn't realize how big of a deal it is that that much of
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       money is being blown on things completely worthless to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       $21 trillion is a
       <em>
        shit-ton
       </em>
       of money, but it's such a large number that nobody can really conceive of how much it really is, not even you or I. People will hear the number and say "wow that's a lot" but they won't realize how much it is. Even one trillion seconds adds up to 32,000 years, or multiple times longer than all of recorded human history. It's an inconceivably huge number.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this to say that there's a small majority that would see it and call the incredibly smelly bullshit as they see it, but the majority wouldn't really think that it's any worse than the last big embarrassment of the US government. It's sad, but true.

       A big percentage of the population, around 10% I've read, has actually had a UFO/orb/alien encounter that they were convinced was either alien or some extremely sophisticated government technology possibly expropriated from alien craft. My housemate is one of them; he saw a large and extremely vivid orb last year, and it changed his life. He's been pouring through dozens of UFO books, and the evidence is really strong, if you actually take the time to look at it, which I recommend people do....

       I follow your statement but wouldn't it be easier to show the public something old?  Like digging up the real autopsy photos and body that go with them to show the world they exist?  That would be a slam dunk in my opinion and it would be as easy as pulling back the curtain.

       Yes.  But you have to understand.  Baby steps.  You can't just BAM expose that aliens are real. (if indeed they are.  Remember, we don't know.  All we know is that they are using the possibility of hostile aliens to justify trillions in expenditures)  Their objective is not to cause panic or prove that aliens exist.  Their objective is to make enough of the population go "hey... maybe aliens are real... We need to look into this.  Let me get my checkbook."

       Yes and no.  While it's feasible that they are "us" from the future, they can't be. The reason being that everything that happens in the past affects the future.  Thus, we being aware of them, affects them.  Hence, they would not be so careless to jeopardize their future existence.

       I mean what if coming back in time creates branches of timelines though? They'd just change our timeline... What if they teleported in from another dimension?

       that's not quite how timelines work. if you were theoretically able to travel back in time, you wouldn't necessarily travel back to YOUR time, just A time. You could alter alternate you's future, but you wouldn't alter yours.

       I agree with this theory. They want to say the money was spent on UFOs and then they can "poof" the money down a rabbit hole with no more questions asked. Truth be told they probably did spend some of it on UFOs and secret spacecraft but by no means all of it.

       Great post. I'm just thinking out loud here about the weekend.....
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         NASA uses Google AI to discover an additional planet in a neighboring solar system (Kepler 90I, like Eath, is the 3rd planet from that solar system's main star, or sun).
         <a href="https://www.geek.com/science/nasa-google-ai-discover-eighth-planet-in-kepler-90-system-1725937/">
          https://www.geek.com/science/nasa-google-ai-discover-eighth-planet-in-kepler-90-system-1725937/
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On December 16, 2017 (Saturday), the Glowing Auras and 'Black Money' article comes out via The New York Times (
         <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">
          https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html
         </a>
         )
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Foo Fighters are the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. Playing off of OP's mention about how 'foo fighter' was the term used by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II to describe various UFOs or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific theaters of operations, I remember noticing the first of the 2 songs they played on Saturday. Firstly, it struck me as odd that they were the musical guest because, well, it's been awhile since they were on. Secondly, their first song was a song titled, 'The Sky Is A Neighborhood'. Red flag immediately for me. I looked up the lyrics while I was listening to it. Just taking the first couple of lyrics was telling:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The sky is a neighborhood, So keep it down; 
The heart is a storybook, A star burned out
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was the host of SNL on Saturday? Kevin Hart. He just had to admit he cheated on his wife (
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-hart-infidelity-irresponsible/story?id=51813336">
        http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-hart-infidelity-irresponsible/story?id=51813336
       </a>
       ). Those lyrics make A LOT of sense, considering.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts...
       </li>
      </ul>

       It really is though. This is anecdotal af, but I just learned of skinwalker/sherman ranch a few weeks ago. Then I read the article this passed Saturday. Low and behold the owner of the ranch also owns Bigelow aerospace. Who happened to be spoken of in the NY Times piece? Robert Bigelow. He was contracted out, by the secret division spoken of in the article to do research into various phenomenon. He's also heavily involved with NASA. Does any of that mean anything substantial? Nah. Just that synchronicity is a weird thing.

       Possibly.  But my guess is that those behind the military that support Trump want people to go into space, so they want to acclimatize people into the idea that aliens have been here (in our solar system) for thousands of years.

       This is a good question, 1 trillion alone would cause massive impact - how do you even spend that? what contracting company, or manufacturer wash out that kind of elephant sized problem? we could built up the entire us infrastructure with money left over to pay for post education for anyone for the foreseeable future. 20 + trillion my mind can't co prehend....

       What's it going to take for humanity to realise that we are constantly being lied to with literally everything?
      </p>
      <p>
       We massively outnumber the elite, it wouldn't take much for everyone to just come together and remove the 'world leaders'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, regarding OP, I believe we are not alone in the vastness of space, it just seems to be distraction tactics by the 1% - usually these sort of stories crop up during times of uncertainty, and I'm sure that if/when aliens do visit earth to say hello or wipe us out that they wouldn't just go to the superpowers of earth.

       It's a really interesting speculative subject, and you may be right, OP. But this phrase "believe in UFO's" is silly. You mean, "believe that some UFO's are alien crafts," right? I spent some serious time on this subject, and the evidence is overwhelming that some of the instances have involved alien crafts and alien intelligence. You can also encounter non-human higher intelligence through the use of DMT, which I've done. We are not alone here as humans. I really recommend reading Richard Dolan, Jacque Vallee, and Terence McKenna, and also smoking DMT yourself.

       I hear you.  I'm not saying UFO's are real or not. (Although I'm a believer) I'm simply saying the Pentagon is using it as a distraction to bury the $21 trillion that is missing.

       Setting up up for the next "Foreign" Enemy,
      </p>
      <p>
       First it was the Soviets...then the USSR Fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few year later at the Beginning of the New American Century...Terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that ISIS is on the run and by and far it seems people are not buying the Narrative anymore about Terrorism and Islam anymore, they need a new threat to scare people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So bring in the Aliens.  I can not recall how long ago or where, but this was going to be the 3rd Threat to keep people under control after the Terrorism thing died down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Need something bigger and badder to keep peoples attention away from where they do not want it.  Time to pull out the last Big Scary Card...Aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural Human Fear of the Other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would be perfect cover to sweep in and take control right after a Devastating Attack by Aliens, those who come to save people and clean up the mess will seen as heroes and be given the power to set up the New World Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New World Government will be established as a force to combat the new threat from space.  Aliens are the one threat that could unite all people of Earth towards one single goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO i think there will be an attack in the coming years.  It will be an asteroid/meteor/
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment">
        Rod of God
       </a>
       kind of attack at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be passed off at first as just a random event that was missed.  We already know we can not watch the entire sky for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps they already know there will be a collision in the near future and there is nothing we can do to stop it at this point.  But not ones to let any crisis go to waste...they will use it and claim attack to put their plans into action.

       I'll throw my comment in since no one will likely read it anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day, someone came in here to /conspiracy as a new account and pretty much point blank said he worked for the Navy and admitted with great detail that he worked in the Naval weather group and admitted they have been doing aerosol spraying since the mid 90's because of global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if that dude was being a LARP or not but his story sure did make sense and it got me thinking that it could be part of a much larger campaign where shills are being put forth as pawns in a much larger conspiracy to get ahead of the missing trillions story by showing some cards on some low hanging conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always said that the chemtrails are likely weather modification because the government knows something scary about our environment and instead of panicking the public, they spend billions on deflecting sunlight to help cool the earth.  It's possible a good chunk of the $$ is going in for something to be helpful and not really devious.

       Just a thought and since it matched a bit of this UFO narrative, I thought I would chime in with my opinion about how the guvvy is going to stay ahead of this....

       I saw that post.  The guy definitely did serve in the military.  The amount of credentials he cited was not something he could LARP.  As far as his conspiracy went, they were credible except the part about how EM signals being sent into our atmosphere was affecting our poles.  That was a bit too much for me.

       Are you so sure?  What makes you think that all the people who were discrediting him weren't intelligence in panic mode?  All of a sudden, one guy claims he worked for military science div, and a dozen experts pop up to discredit him?  Hmmm... Since when was

       I'm not doubting you.  I too had many questions for him.  All I'm saying is that a LARPer would not go as far as to fake a document and upload it.  All I'm saying is that I found it weird that in a sub where Pizzagate is accepted, a guy claiming he worked for the military shows up and all of a sudden there's a 100 people who are completely familiar with military bases.  Did you read all the comments?  I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were pointing out technicalities that no one would ever give a crap about.  We literally had 100 former secret op scientists here in under an hour when he posted his thread.  I dunno.  No one ever gets treated like him here.  Ever.

       I'm saying that it seems pretty likely for a large portion of conspiracy theorists to be military. It doesn't surprise me at all that someone that knows about Navy ranks would be reading that post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And AG2 does indeed seem to be a very low rank in the Navy so it seems that he's right. On the other hand it's also possible that he's just passing on the opinions of his superiors on global warming. The reason why I was skeptical is that any real scientist would be able to quantify the stuff they're talking about, this guy just talked in a broad strokes manner to please conspiracy theorists. And it's also possible that he (correctly) assumed that most people wouldn't be able to make sense of his documents.

       E2 is the second lowest rank, and there are many enlisted men as e2 in all branches that have distinguished responsibility.  Saying otherwise is something an arrogant try-hard know it all would say.  It is unlikely, but not

       I'm still very skeptical because if he was a scientist then he would be able to quantify his reasoning behind the radio waves causing global warming and the chem trail shit. It's possible he heard rumors of this stuff from scientists working with or near him but I doubt he was involved himself.

       Those qual sheets don’t look like quals that belong to someone with an applied science background.  Spraying grunt seems likely, when he says ‘scientist’ I am actually inclined to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       believe him.  Too much of an embellishment of the truth and doesn’t pass my eye test.

       Good post op. Here is my 2 cents. Maybe tptb have been building a space fleet or interstellar craft? That would have cost trillions to build. Maybe all the science fiction from the last 25 years or so is somewhat true?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking along the lines of the Stargate TV show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that for years tptb had people convinced ufo's were fantasy and when people started to consider that they might in fact be real we are at a point that most here would consider it a false flag aka project bluebeam.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect if tptb were trying to keep the existence of alien life a secret they have succeeded. If the aliens showed themselves tomorrow people wouldn't believe it.

       Here's the issue with your post: no one gives a fuck about the $21T with or without justification from the government. Realize that the government doesn't need to justify that loss to us because normal people don't care. You're thinking that everyone has the "conspiratorial mind" but most people will just glance at that stat, momentarily think "that's fucked up" and go on with their day.
      </p>
      <p>
       To think that the government would go as far as reveal the existence of UFOs after decades to justify unaccounted money to conspiracy theorists is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most likely reason for disclosure would be the upcoming civilian expansion into space. Previously it was the domain of governments and militaries but once civilians go up there it might be harder to deny.

       Thanks for the input.  I think you're missing the main point of my theory.  It's not that they (meaning the Pentagon) believe that there will be any real damage to them for having $21 trillion be unaccounted for.  It's that any real investigation or audit is going to reveal that they are involved in COUNTLESS illegal activities.  Activities which will send people to jail and cut funding for the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I was trying to make is that a convenient way out for them, without having protests and riots, is to simply say "We spent that money researching UFOs and building a defense against it"  The end.  We, the normal people, really can't comprehend just how much $21~$29 trillion is.  There is no way in hell that amount of money is unaccounted for.  They all know where it went.  Illegal activities.   All I'm saying is that they're trying to hide it by looking like they're protecting us... from aliens.

       Right but it seems a lot easier for them to fudge the audit (threaten the investigators, falsify evidence, etc) than to fake an alien threat.

       Maybe.  But rest assured, any inquiry WILL divulge operations which the Pentagon and the DoD would rather not be exposed.  Ah, forget that, NOT EVEN MENTIONED.  Don't you think an inquiry would open a can of worms that they would rather not touch?

       Just think about the amount of effort it takes to falsify, stop, or delay an inquiry compared to the amount of effort it takes to fake an alien threat. And also take into account that the average person doesn't give a shit no matter what comes out of the inquiry or if it gets derailed.

       I don't think you're realizing how much money $21 ~ $29 trillion dollars really is.  It's enough to pay back our national debt.  It's more money than is comprehensible.  Can you imagine a billion dollar bill?  Yes?  One bill would be enough to spend in multiple life times.  Now, imagine you have 29,000 of these bills.  That's how much money we're talking here.

       Yes I realize that and it's extremely messed up that we've lost this much money on likely unsuccessful military projects. But just as most people don't care about the national debt beyond what the news and politicians tell them, people won't care about this number beyond what they're told to think. You need to realize that people who think like us are a tiny, tiny minority.

       Does it? Have a few Senators/ex-military people speak to legit news sources about aliens in a warning way and wallah. Aliens being real and a sci-fi war is pretty interesting compared to articles on taxes, political parties, senators--the boring everyday news. Newspapers/stations know this and they'd much rather have stuff on aliens than the norm so long as they can justifiably put it out there (with sources and what not)

       Right but it's the age of visual news so unless we have video of extraterrestrials and video of the harm they cause, I don't think people are going to be spurred into a war frenzy. It seems like a lot of effort over an audit no one cares about.

       I've spent a lot of time pondering where the money goes. I think there is more than one answer here. UFOs are almost certainly a real phenomena that have happened and scared them (maybe it never scared level 3, maybe only level 2). Massive corruption and hush money is another part. They use the corruption to further the agenda of the secret government.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also maintain at least a 30 year time shift in aerospace tech. Meaning you can point out a tech they are allegedly developing now in aerospace and know with some certainty they perfected it almost 30 years ago. They do that for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they also built lots of underground facilities all over the world for apocalyptic situations. Those would cost a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they even built bases on the moon. I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand all of what they do but it's obvious something is rotten in Denmark.

       You could be absolutely correct.

       I first thought that you were saying that UFOs are fake.. etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think I understand.  You're saying that's a military vehicle and the Pentagon fully knows what it is, but they are presenting it as a possible UFO.  Thus, cementing my theory.  Yes?

       Interesting.  But I do have a question.  If the Pentagon wanted to release a video (which they obviously did) to make people question whether UFOs are real or not, why would they release a video of a known vehicle?  Wouldn't they just release a totally top secret unknown vehicle like the TR3B?

       Well, you're wrong about this one.  The triangle ship has been filmed all over the planet.  Especially for the past 2 years.  It is NOTHING like a fighter plane.  It hovers.  Go on YouTube.  You'll see what I'm saying.

       Like I said, Tom Delonge is part of the plan.  They are using him to push the UFO research narrative.

      <p>
       Look, the govt knows if UFOs are real or not.  They've known for decades.  There is ABSOLUTELY no need for research now.  To say that research began in 2007?  Are you kidding me?  Really?

       The moon landing was fake. There is no going into space. The earth is flat. Which means aliens don't exist. NASA is a bunch of liars. They film underwater.  NASA is a fraud. Don't fall for any alien crap. It's nonsense.  No man can leave earth and no aliens can come here either.

       $21 trillion over how much time? I wonder how much was spent on so called entitlements during that same time period?  Money for entitlements is not the problem theft by our government officials and corporate entities is the problem.

       Hmmm, Hasn't this sort of coverup been done before? I'm thinking something similar about trillions of dollars was unaccounted for on 9/10/2001... Should we expect another disaster to bolster our "patriotic duties"?

       So do you think they’re faking aliens visiting us entirely, or they’re finally telling the truth just to cover up the spending. If it’s the latter I honestly wouldn’t even care as long as we get the disclosure and the tech. Fuck the elites, let them pull off their scams if it means the rest of the world finally gets at least somewhat caught up to speed.

       Now the more important thing these people aren't reporting on is where is that money being borrowed from. I agree with what you are saying and from what other people in the comments are saying, for some reason its hard to get the masses to care about such a serious situation. Especially when everything in the news so sensationalized.

       You know when you say missing trillions it hasn't actually gone missing. Even if is true that money has likely been ploughed back into the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your whole argument is off too. You say that the top secret projects probably failed. Why? Because it helps you push your opinionated agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd hope if trillions has been pushed into black projects they'd have drones which can do what all these videos say they do.

       Personally I think it's more deliberate confusion. When age does conspiracy theories make it into the nyt as actual truths we are talking about a conspiracies being normalized. This means that truths and untruths become indistinguishable for the time being which makes possible for the powers to be further confuse and bamboozle us. I think it's a way for Trump and company to make us look over there... While the magic happens over here.

       There needs to be a catalyst to usher in an official one-world government. It has been postulated that something like a 'staged alien invasion' can fill that role. This rhetoric is nothing new. Only time will tell.

       The govt will tell you whatever you wanna hear about so called alines and ufos. Keeps the space narrative going since thats been in question more and more the last few years. Dont look at these ISS green screen glitches, watch blink 182s washed up star pull a "hello fellow kids" and talk about aliems to my generation. Im glad someome has posted about this because it is 100% a distraction. They dont want you to know the truth so why come out now?

       Maybe that video taken from the jet just showed some kind of rare, natural phenomenon (I dunno, maybe like ball lightning or something else).  Didn't the report say the "object" didn't show up on radar, so it sounds like it was not metallic and just a rare kind of weather phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the universe is so vast, I do believe intelligent life exists somewhere out there around other stars, but, like Carl Sagan said, we haven't seen any good (or even bad) evidence yet that aliens have visited the Earth.  The distance between stars is enormous, so enormous that when the Andromeda Galaxy "collides" with our own Galaxy in the far, distant future, no stars from either galaxy are expected to touch.  Stars are incredibly far apart from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there are over 100 Billion stars in our galaxy alone.  It's entirely possible no one knows we're here, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  Even if some  intelligent aliens have discovered our incredibly faint radio or TV signals from their home planets, we don't know if faster-than-light travel is possible.  If it is possible somehow, it must require mind-boggling amounts of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our radio and TV signals have been traveling out into the interstellar ether for only about 80 years now, so the farthest the signals could have traveled by now is 80 light years in a galaxy that is 100 MILLION light years wide.

       This will be a distraction...this narrative will start slowly building steam and MSM will start announcing small reports about unidentifiable objects around the world appearing or being found after being hidden away for so long. All, just to distract and change the narrative from the massive crimes the deep state has been perpetrating against the citizens of the world...not just America!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? To explain the soon-to-be-exposed existence of major technologies and medical cures that have been hidden from us by the elite cabal for almost a century!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch the news. More and more about aliens being found or hidden away will be reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aliens? Because the elite think this will explain all the "new" technologies that will become public soon. They want us to believe the aliens brought us this technology. Because the public will want to lynch all elites once we find out they had cures to diseases our families died from too young, that they could generate power without petroleum products etc... so they want us to believe that aliens has brought the “new” technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why now?  Because the noose it tightening around the cabal.  Some in the cabal are trying to negotiate their freedom/privacy/power/whatever...and they are using their hidden cache of technology/cures as bargaining chips.  Will not work.  The white hats are going to release everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait for it...the shock will not come soon, but a slow drip so it does not cause mobs out for lynching. But don't be distracted.

       They could not actually be distractions, maybe they are bread crumbs. Small amount of disclosure. My theory is that some of that enormous amount of money was used for ufo research/projects that we don't know about yet. They could be giving us clues now because something in the near future will fully disclose the extraterrestrial phenomena. Think about it, right after we figure out about the trillions, they willingly release some very believeable ufo footage. It just seems weird.

       Do you have a legitimate source that corroborates the claims that the pentagon is "missing trillions of dollars?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're gonna peddle this trash at least make the number a little more believable like the last 30 "pentagon is missing trillions" posts.

       It's an advanced US drone powered by a CFR. The Iranian military also spotted the same exact craft over nuclear sites beginning in 2004, same year as this video. Further, it uses a compact fusion reactor developed by Lockheed Martin Skunkworks. You're welcome. Some reading for you:

       A big percentage of the population, around 10% I've read, has actually had a UFO/orb/alien encounter that they were convinced was either alien or some extremely sophisticated government technology possibly expropriated from alien craft. My housemate is one of them; he saw a large and extremely vivid orb last year, and it changed his life. He's been pouring through dozens of UFO books, and the evidence is really strong, if you actually take the time to look at it, which I recommend people do....

       I follow your statement but wouldn't it be easier to show the public something old?  Like digging up the real autopsy photos and body that go with them to show the world they exist?  That would be a slam dunk in my opinion and it would be as easy as pulling back the curtain.

       I love your optimism but at best this gets to be a minor issue in political campaigns for the next few years. You really underestimate public apathy. Look at the response to the UFO article yesterday.

       I'm still very skeptical because if he was a scientist then he would be able to quantify his reasoning behind the radio waves causing global warming and the chem trail shit. It's possible he heard rumors of this stuff from scientists working with or near him but I doubt he was involved himself.

       I agree with this theory. They want to say the money was spent on UFOs and then they can "poof" the money down a rabbit hole with no more questions asked. Truth be told they probably did spend some of it on UFOs and secret spacecraft but by no means all of it.
