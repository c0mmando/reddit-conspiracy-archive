        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: <strong>Rolling in the downvote fairies, currently number 2 in rising, but with 0 downvotes. This alone proves my point...</strong></p>

<p>I just saw today he plans to expand police militarization....How does this make america great again?</p>

<p>Trump has had an incredible PR team with conspiracy theorists since he was elected, and the <em>way</em> in which he was elected, only seemed to add creedence to his anti establishment image. </p>

<p>Luckily, after a year of the veteran theorists calling bullshit on this social engineering attempt to make Trump appeal to the truth movement, the &quot;outsider&quot; image the social engineers had crafted for him is starting to burn to the ground. </p>

<p>They wanted to get the truth movement and the conspiracy community to throw blind faith into their puppet president, so they devised this big dramatic election, used the media to attack him (adding credibility to him as an outsider), and he went on a massive lip service campaign to try and appeal to our demographic. <strong>The &quot;gatekeepers&quot; who used to call out the two party system and rigged elections (Alex Jones, Paul Watson, Cernovich), all simultaneously flipped during the election and became huge Trump supporters, leading their viewers into endorsing him and beefing him up as a &quot;good guy&quot;. This had to have been planned years in advance</strong> </p>

<p>90% of the people who support Trump know literally nothing about his Saudi Arms deal, his bombing of Syria, his relationship with Henry Kissinger, his relationship with Jeff Epstein, his pledge of allegiance to the CIA, and his desire to militarize the police and continue the &quot;terrorism boogeyman&quot;. Infact, most of the support for Trump is only there, because the media &quot;attacks him&quot; and people are susceptible to this reverse psychology and assume that means he&#39;s a good guy...</p>

<p>There is no deep state coup. If you believe that there is, than you are being effectively suppressed/dealt with by TPTB by pledging allegiance to their puppet president.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need an insider in government to defeat the New World Order, we can do it ourselves, we just need to wake up a certain percentage of the population as to whats going on. Seriously, getting us all unified and on the same page, and then just going HAM on waking up the masses and infiltrating the various online forums with the truth, sparking up conversations with your family and friends, will go a long way to speeding up the awakening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment on both sides hate his guts, Trump is truly a wildcard president, unlike the Obama&#39;s and Bush&#39;s of the world Trump isn&#39;t beholden to anyone, he does what he wants to do, the GOP and the lions would both like to see him gone. I for one love it, it&#39;s fan fucking tasting seeing both sides pull their hair out over him, I hope he says some shit about ET&#39;s and that the gov knows more than they have been willing to share with the public before he finishes his term/terms, I wouldn&#39;t put a it past Trump at all, Obama and Bush were just yes men for their establishment parties, Trump is Trump and does what Trump wants to do. </p>

<p>I feel it is a little bit more complicated. The same people that backed Obama and HRC definitely aren&#39;t behind Trump. Trump represents a different faction of Elites. HRC/Obama&#39;s faction, which has been in control of this country for at least 40+ years, lost in 2016 and so are dialing their rhetoric up to 11 and claiming Trump is a Russia plant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump has appointed former Goldman CEO Gary Cohn as his chief economic adviser, former Goldman CFO Steve Mnunchin as his Treasury Secretary, former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as his Secretary of State, and PS skeptic and Charter School advocate (who has never attended PS a day in her life, and whose family has advocated Charter Schools for years) Betsy Devos as Secretary of Education.</p>

<p>This in relative apposition to Obamas appointment of Citibank employees throughout his cabinet. And the Neocon warmongers like John Bolton and Paul Wolfowitz who openly backed HRC. </p>

<p>All that to say, that though Trump isn&#39;t for us, he is definitely being attacked by a significant segment of the Elites. It is like 2 popular kids feuding in HS. They&#39;re both still popular, they both sit at the &quot;in&quot; table, but they have different circles of friends and are vying, bitterly, for Class President. That&#39;s how I liken it. </p>

<p>The Republic careens towards its&#39; death either way, but at least with Trump this looting fiery death spiral is blatant, versus HRC and Obama etc; who kept it under the table.</p>

<p>My faith is in a purge of the Corporatists who control the Democratic Party at the grassroots level, so that we can get an actual Progressive Populist to run against Trump come 2020, and not some Corporate Whore like Kamal, HRC, or Deval. This is done by organization at the grassroots level.</p>

<p>The smallest organizational unit of the Democratic Party (and the GOP, though I haven&#39;t researched their system that much) is the Precinct. Any registered Dem can attend their local meetings and vote for their Precinct Chairs. Precinct Chairs vote for Country Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how we take the Party from their corrupt hands, we steal it from the Grassroots, and make our change <em>trickle up</em>. This is where I&#39;ve placed my faith come 2020. And I firmly believe that if it does not work, and another Corporatist like Kamala or Deval wins the election, or Trump wins reelection, then the Republic will continue its fiery descent into oblivion. /rant </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. It&#39;s a show. The same shareholders probably own the same amount of stock in both citibank and goldman sachs. The guys we&#39;re watching are second and third tier expendables. Both Clinton and Trump are physically falling apart in front of us and even if the absolute worse happens as in a public MSM reveal of all the Epstien or parts of PG, all of the public faces already have one foot in the grave. Hell, even the bbc admitted Saville fucked corpses after he died. I&#39;ll believe that our beloved overlords are fighting when royalty starts going down in plane crashes or at least David Geffen gets arrested. And yeah, I&#39;m aware of the Rothchilde crashes. So I guess one never knows.</p>

<p>Where you start to lose people is when conspiracy theorists delve into the supernatural. Satan being a &quot;bad&quot; guy. God being a &quot;good&quot; guy and other occult related stuff. </p>

<p>Aliens are possible but improbable IMO. So focusing on that makes people watch X-Files and want to believe but there&#39;s almost nothing else to go on. </p>

<p>So the people who are grounded to what we can see and measure, stick to politics and corporate corruption in league with the government to enslave us all more. </p>

<p>I remember countless times seeing allegations against people for being a predator in Hollywood, or being some satanic baby eater politician because they are in an elite class of people. </p>

<p>The POTUS has a literal Hollywood star. He has been an elite his entire life. </p>

<p>He speaks Leninist propaganda mixed with Goebbels. Yet I&#39;ve never seen anyone accuse Trump of being a satanic high priest. Instead they prop him up as a God among men. Seems satanic to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the answer to the problem you&#39;re talking about is to wake people up to the programming. Leave the satan stuff out at the beginning and just get people to admit that there is evil in the world. Start small and people will come to the conclusion that if there is evil then that has to come from somewhere. Just like heat and wind and whatever else. Everything has a source so to speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree with <a href="/u/bradok">/u/bradok</a> about the factionalism, but there&#39;s some other issues I take with the suggestion of him being subject to a monolithic Deep State.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/410347-israel-saudi-arabia-contacts-iran/">The Saudis are working with Israel against Iran</a> <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/410964-saudis-israel-palestinians-iran/"><sup>2</sup></a>. Yes the Saudi&#39;s are horrible sponsors of terror and it&#39;s a stupid idea to give them weapons, but Trump hasn&#39;t refrained from supporting Israel so it&#39;s not <em>necessarily</em> outside his personal agenda. </p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly said that Russia and the US have a lot in common, that they&#39;re better off working together, and that it&#39;s best for Syria that the Russian&#39;s clean it up. Trump argued that the Russian collusion smear campaign was forcing him to distance himself from co-operation with Russia - which <em>reeks</em> of Deep State. </p>

<p>You might remember the headlines about how &quot;people will die&quot;  because of the collusion story, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/11/trump-russia-putin-transcript-244804">the actual statement was this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when we can -- I mean, you&#39;ll be seeing the release that&#39;s put out. But we can save many, many, many lives by making a deal with Russia having to do with Syria, and then ultimately getting Syria solved and getting Ukraine solved and doing other things, having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing.</p>

<p>And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way. It gets in the way. And that&#39;s a shame because people will die because of it. And it&#39;s a pure hit job. And it&#39;s artificially induced. And it&#39;s a shame. But anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the CIA isn&#39;t making their money from opium, they&#39;re making it by fueling Cold War fears and getting a bigger budget from congress, but they can&#39;t do that when you&#39;re fast friends with Russia. Since a lot of the collusion bullshit was planned before he took office, and he barely won the election, it&#39;s very hard to believe how much all this effort is being put into controlling a supposedly willing member of an all powerful Deep State.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is historically true.  I remember reading somewhere that a fake coup was attempted against FDR in order to give him credibility as president.  Also, there was propaganda spread that the big banks were against the federal reserve act to make it seem like the federal reserve was a good thing that the banks didn&#39;t want.</p>

<p>Trump is just as establishment as the Clintons or Bushes.  His entire cabinet is practically Goldman Sachs.  The elite are not beyond sacrificing their pawns to get obtain their objectives.</p>
