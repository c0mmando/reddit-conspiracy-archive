        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start by stating the obvious: sexual harassment/rape is horrible and should always be dealt with appropriately. </p>

<p>The women that have been coming forward with their stories of sexual harassment and abuse, calling their abusers out by name, signals a positive step forward in killing the culture of silent victimhood that has permeated our society. </p>

<p><em>That said, we need to understand that the traditional family, even traditional relationships have been under attack in the West for some time</em>. Magazines promote single lifestyles. Articles advocate for life without children, citing cost and other factors in an attempt to dissuade procreation. </p>

<p>I met the love of my life at our then-workplace. Often, I’d find excuses to be around her—to tell her she looked beautiful today, etc. </p>

<p>This type of work-romance scenario happens <em>all the time</em>. And many times it starts with a guy “hitting on” a woman he finds attractive. Many relationships begin this way. </p>

<p>What happens though, if it gets to the point where men are so afraid of being taken the wrong way and losing their job over offending someone that they just don’t try? They’d just rather not risk it. </p>

<p>There are already memes of men being terrified of women: <em>girl goes in for a hug—guy dives out of the way</em> - maybe you’ve seen these. </p>

<p>Let me be clear: I am NOT saying that anyone should go back to not speaking up when they’re uncomfortable. We just need to define our expectations because I’m starting to see a wedge dividing men and women. </p>

<p>It either becomes like Eastern Europe, where the women are far more forward and are actually the ones expected to initiate, or to the brave goes the spoils, so to speak, and the men who aren&#39;t afraid to approach women are going to end up with the cream of the crop. </p>

<p>Your second point allows me to touch on the softening of males in the West. Especially my generation, millennials. We are far less likely to take risks—the type of risks it takes to “end up with the cream of the crop”. </p>

<p>Yeah, I agree, but if it does rather gradually shift in the opposite direction, there will be some sort of counter trend. It may take a generation, but it will eventually happen.</p>

<p>But those who do will get the payoff, and probably produce better kids (hopefully). </p>

<p>Yeah, I figured that is what you were getting at, and I tend to agree. But I feel like society will address this on a person to person level like we just discussed, where women will take the initiative or the bolder men will win out and have better options to choose from. My better kids statement comes from a hope that not only will their genes and intelligence be good, but bolder men and women will teach their own children to be bold. We could really use that. </p>

<p>I agree, and I think part of that is also baked into our educational system. If you have 12 minutes, I&#39;ve got a video to link which goes over a lot of what we&#39;re getting at. John Taylor Gatto was an NYC school teacher for 30 years who won multiple state-wide awards for teaching excellence before retiring and spending his retirement exposing the system for what it is, mainly a system to produce cogs in the machine. He touches upon the sexual and intellectual selection aspects of it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, this is interesting. You’re touching on something I hadn’t mentioned, and that’s the power afforded to women who make accusations. </p>

<p>Even if we don’t like to admit it, when a new woman comes forward with an allegation against a man, especially if it’s a high-profile man, we <em>all</em> in the back of our minds somewhere think “Yeah, he probably did it.”</p>

<p>That’s way too much power. </p>

<p>Guilt shouldn’t be assumed the way it is with this cultural shift, but guilt certainly is assumed. Men should have the ability to defend their good name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Especially in this current environment. I mean, people are assholes and women are obviously people too. What&#39;s to stop a woman from seeing how easily accusations are believed anymore and using it to her advantage? And a lot of companies would likely just let the person go rather than deal with the liability. </p>

The rate at which men sexually harass women - at work, when they&#39;re out at bars and restaurants, when they&#39;re walking down the street, literally everywhere.

<p>If men stopped doing those things so often, women would be a lot more comfortable around men.</p>

<p>I know I, as a woman, and all of my female friends would rather men stop sexually harassing us and other woman, not to mention stop assaulting and raping women, to improve relations between men and women generally <em>much more</em> than we are are worried about what the #MeToo movement might do to these relations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What world do you live in where you are constantly sexually harrassed? Everyone is so easily offended nowadays it&#39;s scary.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder how many of the #meetoo folks are legit although to actually say it around others automatically paints you as a dirty man.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually scary being a man nowadays as it&#39;s the last demographic thats still safe to abuse. One &quot;allegation&quot; and your life is ruined guilty or not.</p>
