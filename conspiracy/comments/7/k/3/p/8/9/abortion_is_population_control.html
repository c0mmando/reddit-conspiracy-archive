I personally have no issues with a woman wanting an abortion no matter the reasons. But has anyone stopped to think the mentality towards the subject is based more on selfishness and self preservation more than avoiding putting a child through a rough life. </p>

<p>Does anyone wonder why developing countries don&#39;t have abortions and 1st world countries do? Also how many rich people have abortions compared to poor people? </p>

<p>Why is it in people&#39;s minds that an abortion is normal if your in a financial or personal disadvantage? I am not against abortion but i think the reasons and advocacy for them are misconstrued. </p>

<p>I have always believed that women are the future. When women believe they shouldn&#39;t procreate we have to really consider the reasoning behind that decision. Our future is at stake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I was not really responding to your statement. I selfishly just wanted my comment up at the top in response to the idea of abortion as population control. </p>

<p>Your idea that mothers don&#39;t physically give actual blood to their fetus/child is interesting but I think anyone who is against abortion had also better be very anti-war and very pro-adoption of foreign babies. 
Being anti-abortion in the third world is pointless if you don&#39;t have a way to stop these babies being starved to death or bombed to death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might beyond to something admist your insistence to treat this as a &quot;women&#39;s rights&quot; issue. It isn&#39;t, and never has been. This is a lie these people tell you.</p>

<p>A birthed persons right to life has nothing to do with anyone else&#39;s rights. If I was a burden on you, you cannot kill me. At best, you can take me to court and get a legal order from the state to kill me. Unborn children, who are much more innocent than any birthed person, have no such rights. It is inescapable to admit that they are treated like lesser beings than birthed humans. </p>

<p>You might be OK with that position, but understand <strong>that&#39;s</strong> what you&#39;re arguing for. It has nothing to do with &quot;women&#39;s rights&quot;.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s estimated that since 1973, around 16 million black babies were aborted, and a black baby these days has more if a chance of being aborted than being born in a lot of areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are less abortions in developing countries because they need the children in order to secure a future. Developing countries- as the name implies- don&#39;t have access to healthcare, decent living conditions, sanitary drinking water, and rely on manual labor for their agriculture and ways of life. Also, infant mortality rate in developong nations is much higher than in developed ones, mostlt due to the same reasons as listed above. Basically, they need more people because they are developing. </p>

<p>I assume that most abortions in the developed world aren&#39;t on a whim or a &quot;backup plan&quot; for the would-be parents. Instead, they realize that in their situation, financial or otherwise, they simply could not give a baby the quality of life that is expected in a first world nation. I cannot say for certain, but I&#39;m pretty sure that when it comes time to make the actual decision, a women doesn&#39;t just flip a coin to choose to kill a fetus or not. </p>
