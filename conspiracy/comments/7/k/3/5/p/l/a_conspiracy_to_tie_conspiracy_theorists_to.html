    <div class="md"><p>Anti-Semitism is as old as Semitism.</p>

<p>The god of the Hebrews gave the following command to them as they were about to invade Canaan (the first time), committing GENOCIDE against all of the inhabitants:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>16 <strong>But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth</strong>:</p>

<p>17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+20&amp;amp;version=KJV"><strong>Deuteronomy 20, KJV</strong></a></p>

<p>If the <em>Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites</em> didn&#39;t count themselves as <strong><em>&quot;Anti-Semites&quot;</em></strong> when the Hebrews first showed up, you can bet that they did before long.</p>

<p>The sick irony of this, is that the European jewish colonisers who stole Palestinian homes after 1948 are the real anti-semites. They are Ashkenazi white supremacists who hate and despise the indigenous semitic Palestinians. No morality, no shame, no right to Palestinian land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a taboo subject. We are taught the official holocaust narrative at school, and it takes a certain strength of mind to challenge one&#39;s beliefs. </p>

<p>But when you finally open the lid of the holocaust box of tricks, there is nothing there. </p>

<p>No final solution documentation, no architectural plans for gas chambers or converted shower rooms, no orders of Zyklon B of a magnitude that would kill humans (as opposed to lice) in large quantities, utterly inadequate cremation facilities for the amount of victims posited by the holohoaxers etc etc. </p>

<p>Conversely, you discover that the &quot;extermination of 6 million jews&quot; was a zionist media trope that goes back to the early 1900s, based on a Torah prediction in Leviticus that 6 million Jews had to be sacrificed before God&#39;s Chosen People could rightfully reclaim the Promised Land. The &quot;Holocaust&quot; (literally a burnt offering) was a prophetic requirement for the creation of Israel in 1948. Let that sink in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is “anti-Semitic”, brother. Your list of questions I quoted is testament to that fact.</p>

<p>If the truth is that the war in Iraq was fought for Israel, or the regressive degeneration of Western morality is helmed by Jewish culture makers, then you’re still an anti-Semite for noticing. If you don’t support apartheid in 2017, and violent racial supremacy or religious zealotry (of a particular kind!), you’re an anti-Semite. It’s been uncovered that even youtube is a pretty sick place. Who controls that shit? Who owns it? Don’t say, because it’s anti-Semitic. What if you call the MSM liars? Same thing. Turns out Pedowood is a fucked up institution, too, but don’t address the one glaring commonality between the overwhelming majority of the pervert perpetrators. Unless you’re Larry David, but even then your fellow tribesmen in the MSM will scold you for it.</p>

<p>It’s the reason the JQ is policed in the way that it is. Why you second guess and deny your own common sense and intuition. Why they employ an online army, online censors, wiki editors, MSM shills, entire subreddits. Jews control the media because they <em>absolutely must</em> control the media to cover for a history of ongoing conspiracy. Offline, they’ve already (re)acquired the might to stick you in a cage in many countries for minimizing the persecution of the persecutors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so but i might get called a antisemite for thinking that -_- go figure. It seriously is right in everyones face that israel controls our entire country from the government to the way our society trends toward things like transgender bullshit and every other &quot;immoral and blasphemous&quot; thing. Just mentioning anything along the lines of Israel is the problem automatically lables you as a Israel hater and a racist. Well I dont give a fuck. The jews killed Jesus Christ and still oppose him and his teachings of rightiousness and morality. It ses like everyone is brainwashed...LITERALLY on this topic because it is plane as day to see to me but apparently most people seem dumbfounded anytime you point it out. Being a conspiracy theorist &quot;investigative journalist&quot; will soon be considered being a racist. Just like how they tried to paint trump supporters as whote supremists.

Kinda dont know what else to say in this context other than the fact that in modern times the state os Israel is infact trying to corrupt the U.S. and is using propaganda and lobbyist to stir the nation in the direction they want. I only want the U.S. to have its sovereignity without malign influence from what I consider to be a terrorist state.
