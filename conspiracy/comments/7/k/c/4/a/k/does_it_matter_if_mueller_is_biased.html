       Wouldn’t Mueller need to produce evidence in order for anything to actually happen to Trump or anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was out spreading rumors or something I could see why bias would be dangerous, but it seems like he’s keeping everything under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strzok may have been biased towards Hillary, and in my opinion that’s far more troubling, since he could have ignored evidence in order to exonerate her. It seems like having a bias for the person you’re investigating could lead to corruption, but I’m having trouble seeing how a bias against the person you’re investigating could be harmful, since the investigator isn’t ultimately the one to convict or sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does it really matter if Mueller or someone else on his team is biased against Trump?

       You're right, but it depends. If it's Russia, the evidence stands on it's own. If it's a process charge or something like obstruction, then Mueller has lost standing to bring that sort of charge at this point.

       I see what you’re saying. Not a bad point.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, it does matter. Bias always matters;
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       laws or regulations were broken in support of that bias, or
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       that bias is the bias or the person actually making calls, like you say.
      </p>

       Too bad for Fox News that this is a Republican appointed by a Republican to investigate a Republican for firing a Republican.

       Oh wow lol. I seriously woulda thought he was a leftist too, much more than Mueller.

       And ya, Fox does a disservice to conservatives with its clear and pervasive bias. If they could manage to stick to the truth a bit more and ease up on the slant, it would be much easier to trust the things they say.

       Rosenstein is Republican, too. Half the lawyers on Mueller’s team are Republican.

       You have not made a point.

       You have made a singular assertion, that not all bias is political. Now, what is the point you are trying to make with this

       Between Fox News, social media bot blitzes, Trump himself, and his talking heads all discussing how corrupt and terrible the FBI is, you're witnessing a disinformation campaign.
      </p>

       Trump is trying to groom his supporters to believe that 1) he's done nothing wrong and 2) the FBI is out to get him because they work for "the enemy", whomever they decide that is.

       I love how he already laid the groundwork for this before ever taking office with the “fake news” battlecry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s conditioning people to believe nothing except what Trump tells them, and it really is a brilliant accomplishment. It explains the effort to tie the conspiracy community in with the right wing and more so the Trump movement, because naturally everything is a conspiracy now.

       Trump's entire career has been him trying to play both sides so he always looks like he's "won". He was discrediting the media and the election process so that if he won, great, he won. But if he lost, well that's because of the failing media and the terrible election process and because of voter fraud, blah, blah, blah. So even if he loses, he wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's done it his entire career. It's moving goalposts, gaslighting, lying, bullying, those are his tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is when he was just some sleazy tabloid real estate conman, no one was watching close enough, no one cared. Now, people are watching and calling him on his shit but he (and his supporters) even spin that by claiming that the Media turned on him recently due to his political beliefs.

       There's many that would argue that "republican" doesn't have much standing in this age. I consider Bush and Obama to be the same; they were puppeteered by the same masters.

       Mueller was the FBI Director when 9/11 happened. He has blood on his hands on par with any war criminal. They all have blood on their hands and everyone knows it. It's so normalized in this town that outsiders don't realize the entire layer of subtext in every conversation. Everyone is dirty, everyone knows it and it's just a lottery to see who's number is going to come up at this point.

       I think Trump has been dirty, but I don't think he's dirty in the way that the FBI has now been proven to concoct. I don't think he's a pedo, but he's been a man whore and philanderer. He might have made some untoward comments toward women, but I don't hold that against him since I don't know the details and I have a general knowledge of 'how things work', e.g. it usually takes two to tango and Trump isn't going to waste his time on an undesirable target and frankly he has no tolerance for women that aren't going to fawn over him. Why waste the time...
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is also serving a number of purposes and regardless of your political leanings, you can't deny that there is more "swamp draining" occurring now than ever before. I'm happy to stay on this ride for a bit longer and see where we end up. So far, all signs are positive, unless you're here illegally.

       I don’t think he’s a pedo either, but it would be surprising if every single woman accusing him was lying. Possible, sure, it’s a big country, but definitely surprising.

       How dirty has the FBI been “proven to concoct”? What do you mean by proven to concoct anyways? Sorry, not trying to be a grammar nazi, but this phrase doesn’t make sense to me. I’m assuming it’s a timely phrase I’m not privy to.

       You say that as if it isn't a well-known fact that many DC Republicans are strongly opposed to Trump and have allied with the Democrats to undermine him. See: the Bushes, Romney, McCain, etc. -- this was well publicized during the general election campaigns. Ever see Romney's anti-Trump speech that went viral?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the current political ecosystem in the US, Republican allegiance and anti-Trump bias are absolutely compatible. That doesn't mean that the individuals you named are necessarily guilty of anti-Trump bias, but them being Republicans does not rule it out at all.

       No it doesn't matter. If you believe you have evidence you need to take it to court and win. In the case of the POTUS a lot of things happen with Congress and we know they are biased towards two parties.

       If Mueller takes down Trump, he better have rock solid evidence of crimes related to Russia. Anything unrelated to Russia should be instantly dismissed, unless it is massive.

       Between Fox News, social media bot blitzes, Trump himself, and his talking heads all discussing how corrupt and terrible the FBI is, you're witnessing a disinformation campaign.
      </p>

       Trump is trying to groom his supporters to believe that 1) he's done nothing wrong and 2) the FBI is out to get him because they work for "the enemy", whomever they decide that is.
