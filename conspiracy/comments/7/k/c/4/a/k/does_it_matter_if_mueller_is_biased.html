<p>If he was out spreading rumors or something I could see why bias would be dangerous, but it seems like he’s keeping everything under wraps.</p>

<p>Strzok may have been biased towards Hillary, and in my opinion that’s far more troubling, since he could have ignored evidence in order to exonerate her. It seems like having a bias for the person you’re investigating could lead to corruption, but I’m having trouble seeing how a bias against the person you’re investigating could be harmful, since the investigator isn’t ultimately the one to convict or sentence.</p>

<p>So does it really matter if Mueller or someone else on his team is biased against Trump?</p>

<p>But, it does matter. Bias always matters; <em>if</em> laws or regulations were broken in support of that bias, or <em>if</em> that bias is the bias or the person actually making calls, like you say.</p>

<p>Too bad for Fox News that this is a Republican appointed by a Republican to investigate a Republican for firing a Republican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s entire career has been him trying to play both sides so he always looks like he&#39;s &quot;won&quot;. He was discrediting the media and the election process so that if he won, great, he won. But if he lost, well that&#39;s because of the failing media and the terrible election process and because of voter fraud, blah, blah, blah. So even if he loses, he wins. </p>

<p>He&#39;s done it his entire career. It&#39;s moving goalposts, gaslighting, lying, bullying, those are his tools. </p>

<p>The difference is when he was just some sleazy tabloid real estate conman, no one was watching close enough, no one cared. Now, people are watching and calling him on his shit but he (and his supporters) even spin that by claiming that the Media turned on him recently due to his political beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump has been dirty, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s dirty in the way that the FBI has now been proven to concoct. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a pedo, but he&#39;s been a man whore and philanderer. He might have made some untoward comments toward women, but I don&#39;t hold that against him since I don&#39;t know the details and I have a general knowledge of &#39;how things work&#39;, e.g. it usually takes two to tango and Trump isn&#39;t going to waste his time on an undesirable target and frankly he has no tolerance for women that aren&#39;t going to fawn over him. Why waste the time...</p>

<p>Trump is also serving a number of purposes and regardless of your political leanings, you can&#39;t deny that there is more &quot;swamp draining&quot; occurring now than ever before.

<p>This isn&#39;t how an innocent person acts. </p>
