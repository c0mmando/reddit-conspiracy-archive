<p>The sad thing is I agree with her that Hillary is probably dirty, but the unbelievable slant displayed by her and most of Fox makes me sick.</p>

<p>“Strzok, the button man of the Comey crime family”</p>

<p>Right, because Comey is a crime lord now lol...</p>

<p>If you want to see a real conspiracy, here’s an example of a conspiracy to discredit the Mueller investigation before the evidence he uncovers ever comes to light. </p>

<p>“Plotting a scheme in the unlikely event Donald Trump gets elected?!”</p>

<p>Sorry I haven’t figured out how to record this crap yet, but when I do I fully intend to do a side by side comparison showing just how much more biased Fox is than CNN (and CNN is terribly biased).</p>

<p>“The FBI is the crime family.”</p>

<p>It’s just disgusting, tbh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that she keeps saying “crime family” and used the word “scheming” (so that you know these people are no good because they’re scheming of course) is just so ridiculous to me.</p>

<p>If something can’t be explained without having to use loaded words and innuendo, it’s probably propaganda.</p>

<p>I’d love to believe any of this, because it would be great to know the actual truth of what’s going on, but if there was any real truth to it they could just call it how it is, and they clearly can’t do that.</p>

<p>This is “telling you what to think” disguised as “reporting the news”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta say, it seems like at least 5x as much propaganda on Fox than any other network. I’ve been flipping back and forth between it and CNN the past week or so specifically to see what kind of bias they’re each displaying, and while CNN certainly isn’t “fair and unbiased”, Fox is a whole other level of bias.</p>

<p>Are you watching this show right now? It’s insane the level of propaganda being pushed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attempting to remain unbiased is something I identify with, so I try to lean neither way. I’ve voted for a Republican President and a Democrat President. I was a Boy Scout and am a member of the NRA. I am also against the drug war and believe in the separation of church and state. So I’m not sure what that makes me? I was registered as a Republican for most of my life until recently, and am now registered Independent.</p>

<p>I guess if anything I lean more to the right in that I would prefer a smaller government and more state rights, but the “right” portrayed by the right wing media these days is anything but conservative. Personally I think things started going downhill with the Tea Party movement.</p>

<p>Note that the premise itself isn’t absurd, maybe Trump didn’t collude with Russia and maybe he is just trying to get something done in that swamp, but Fox certainly doesn’t help his case with this biased crap.</p>

<p>This guy Chris just stepped in as possibly the only voice of reason on this show, when he said “the best thing to do is not interfere with this investigation”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don’t usually do that, I guess I should have edited or something. And my point was that Fox pushes propaganda way more than any other news outlet, and that Judge Jeanine pushes way more propaganda than anything else on Fox.</p>

<p>That show was masquerading as news and pushing total and utter propaganda. It’s like Trump called her and asked her to do a segment on why everyone should ignore his sexual assault allegations so she decided to do a smear piece on the Mueller investigation.</p>

<p>None of what was discussed on that show is grounded in reality, the ratio of disinformation to information was something like 5 to 1, and the ratio of spin to any kind of information was 10 to 1.</p>

<p>The majority of the segment wasn’t even laying out the facts. Like you said, all news outlets lay out the facts and then put their spin on it, that’s to be expected. This show, on the other hand, spent maybe 3-5 minutes total on the facts of the situation, with the entire remainder spent on feelings. You can check my multiple comments for some choice quotes.</p>

<p>It’s using specific language to elicit a specific feeling in the viewer to make them feel a certain way about the topic, and the reason I made a post about it is that the show was way worse than anything else on Fox or the rest of the MSM. As far as I can tell, that segment was some of the most spun television in the past year.</p>

<p>It was literally a smear/hit piece, and not just a couple parts of it, but the entire slot of 30 mins or whatever it was.</p>
