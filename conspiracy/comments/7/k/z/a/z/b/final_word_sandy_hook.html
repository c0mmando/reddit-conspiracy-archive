       I am being challenged by several people in multiple comment threads.   I cannot address you all individually, because that would be like working  a part-time job. Instead, lets get this conversation all in one place here in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was once like you.. like all of you. For about 2 months I was a Sandy Hook conspiracy fan. I know all about "crisis actors" the "crisis corner" concocted for TV. I know about people walking in a circle around the fire house.  I know about rumors that the school was not operating at the time of the shooting. I've seen the laughing "father" video showing an actor getting into character. I know all about the kids who were said to have died that day, who were later seen alive on TV. I've seen it and heard it all.  There is no reason  for you to repeat this material to me in comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here to lay the issue to rest.
       <em>
        The massacre happened. The school was open. Over 20 people were killed by a deranged shooter.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some basic facts you need to know.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Connecticut State Police
      </h1>
      <p>
       The CSP is your primary source for all evidence related to the December 2012 massacre in Newtown. They will provide you with whatever reports and photos that you want, upon request. A contingency of forensics investigators scraped the school with a fine-toothed comb. They photographed everything, and you can see them in their blue "clean suits" and covered shoes inside the school. I will be posting photos of them below.    For internet activity, you should request the forensics file
       <strong>

       </strong>
       from CSP.   If you want to "get real" with your conspiracy,  get off the internet and try to contact one of these forensics experts. Find their names and meet them in person in their office. Nothing is stopping you.

      <h1>
       Adam Lanza's mental state
      </h1>
      <p>
       Prior to the shooting Adam Lanza slept in a bedroom on a bare mattress with no sheets.  He had covered the windows in his bedroom and then taped the curtains against the walls with black tape.  On the same floor was his gaming room, which was empty of all furniture and had nothing but a console and a TV sitting on the floor.  In the closet of said room, was a locked gun cabinet, sporting  a near-armory of various fire arms.  On the morning of the shooting, Lanza shot and killed his mother while she slept in her bed. he then drove a Honda Civic to the elementary school, and parked it haphazardly on the sidewalk of the front door.  At first Lanza tried to sneak into the back of the school by breaking a window on a door on the west side, apparently to trying to ninja his way in.  Somehow he figured out that he could not fit, so he returned to the front of the school again.  There he blasted out the glass doors with a bushmaster long rifle, which did not effectively break the class, so he kicked it in with his foot.  Lanza went to the hallway on the righthand side, and immediately shot a woman who came out of the principle's office. She bled against the door that shut behind her.  During the shooting which only lasted minutes, Lanza was heard shouting sentences that make no sense at all. He was likely suffering hallucinations caused by schizophrenia.  More on this below.
      </p>
      <h1>
       The Mother's role
      </h1>
      <p>
       At the time of the shooting, Lanza was living alone with his mother in the former family house in Newtown. Nancy Lanza likely misunderstood the nature of her son's mental illness. We have evidence showing that she attributed his strange behaviors to a mild case of aspergers or other ASD.  This was incorrect and Adam was deep into psychotic stages of schizophrenia. This miscalculation was doubly fatal in that she was the sole supplier of his fire arms.

       In earlier posts I made a claim about a fine-toothed-comb.  In fact, forensics experts carefully re-created the trajectories of every single bullet that was fired.  In many cases they were able to recover the bullet fragments.  They know to within 98% accuracy, exactly how many times Lanza fired a weapon in the school.  I also claimed that the amount of evidence available amounts to an "archive".   The police report tells us how many photos were taken by investigators.  They (took at least) 1344 photos.  Some of them are linked here.

       We have an entourage of photos of every bullet, magazine, fire arm, bullet fragment, and casing collected at the scene.  We have several dozen photos of the damage to the walls, floor, ceiling and windows of the school by shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those claiming the school was inoperative in December 2012. We have photos of every single car that was in the parking lot, containing also their license tags showing the date.   Some of the cars were hit by bullets that left the windows and went out into the parking lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a police report showing a diagram re-creation of the trajectory of every bullet that was fired at the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       The several hundred police reports all contain the names and signatures of the police and investigators involved, if you feel a need to contact them.

       No autopsies or bodies. A lot of the material was redacted. We have a blood-soaked shooter's shirt, and shooter's hat with bullet hole.  There used to be a photo of Lanza's leg taken through a door, which was taken by a cellphone. Gone missing.

       You're right that this batch of material only shows that the school was open, someone fired a lot of shots inside of it, and someone was bleeding. There is a pretty clear photo of the carpet in one of the classrooms where bullets were going everywhere. The carpet should be very bloody there, logically.  IMHO the photos are inconclusive about blood splotches.

       Thanks to specific lobbying by Carver (CT med examiner), a state law was passed before the shooting that prevents the release of autopsy results and photos of pediatric homicides in CT. Oddly specific but conveniently timed. No photographic confirmation can actually be publicly provided because of Carver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the same quirky M.E. who gave the bizarro presser where he flippantly described the examination results with detail and certainty not possible in such a short time after an incident of that magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know what his stake in the whole situation was, but if there's more to the story than what we were told (and there is), Carver definitely knows.

       Also, any adult involved who was injured can voluntarily release their medical records or photos of injuries. Same is true for the deceased adults who could have their forensic evidence and photos voluntarily released by the executors of the estates.

       I agree. It seems to me that the photo of the dead shooter would have been released to the public to show that he was in fact dead at the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder if there is a FOIA conflict there between state and federal law that could compel the CT state police to release it?

       This is well done. Do you believe the Lanza backstory to be true or do you think there is a coverup in his motive or perhaps the cause of his insanity?

       Can you tell why the evil coverup scum haven't released pre-shooting video of the photo-shopped made-up guy Adam Lanza or why nobody has been forthright disclosing media anomalies?  I am certain the pro-murder coverup Satanist secret society scum will eventually claim to have bullet trajectories on the Vegas security guard and 8x10 glossy photos with arrows and writing on each one so nobody'd forget what they were pictures of and Ellen would surely ride shotgun with the view (et tu?)...On the Vegas thing, why  video suppression?  There is no reason for you to approve government/media misconduct that has so tainted righteous homicide investigation...Neither of us has infinite time but government agents do not deserve the deferential buttkissing their media have accorded them...Homicide investigators should not be unaccountable and this is what the sordid Sandy Hook 'narrative' requires with a high-handed demand of which you have been insufficiently skeptical...

       Natalie Hammond was shot at Sandy Hook and survived. She was treated at a hospital in Danbury.  Hospital records exist of her treatment there.  Also she would have been seen that morning by doctors, nurses, and god-knows-how-many emergency room specialists and ambulance drivers.   Since she is still around, she might even have scars from the shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose its possible that the Illuminati overlords told her that she would be shot that morning by masked men, bleed a little bit, and then be whisked to a distant hospital all to make the charade "more realistic".
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't see you suggesting that Natalie "took one for team" in your post -- so I would ask who here is being sufficiently skeptical.

       The wall tiles at floor level are filthy. The 4th row up has been damaged. The door frame is in bad need of a paint job. This was a first rate school? The entire Sandy Hook story stinks and these photos prove nothing.

         They

        brought actual firearms into a school and shot holes in the walls the ceilings and the windows. Dribbled chicken blood on the floor. Then invited a team of forensics guys to take one thousand three hundred and fourty-four photographs of the inside of the building.  All the of the cars in the parking lot were fake props, and the 50 some-odd men involved are all fake actors in costumes.
        <strong>
         They
        </strong>
        then created over 130 fake police reports all signed and dated by actual agents who live in Connecticut. Faking documents signed by FBI, investigators, police, and forensics specialists' signatures. "

       I'm saying without an easy to supply piece of evidence to show a child was killed, why should I presume one was. There isn't much information, for me, that they weren't, but I'm not going to go diving into screaming they were murdered if I don't actually know that.

       Not that easy to supply everyone access to a real dead body, presuming it needs to be seen directly as photos/videos can be faked. Also dead body could have come from anywhere - what proves they were killed in the way claimed?

       The whole time I was looking for proof of events supposedly held by the elementary school, according to the deceased principals twitter. I also thought I could find a list of all active schools that reported to the state for the years 2008-2012, but most likely I don't know where to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do feel like this evidence is too hard to ignore. Have you tried looking at website traffic for the other 10+ public schools in the area?

       This is excellent work OP. Regardless of what ppl conclude we need more research like this. Shockingly this is the first time I’ve even seen these photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much forensic proof has been made from the “seasonal holiday art displays” around the school that the MSM has shown. Could you provide a few shots from inside the school that show some of these art displays? None of the photos you provide have any holiday artwork in the classrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps. I’m not arguing one way or another just intellectually curious if the photos you’ve obtained show them or not.

       Thank you. So sad and eirie looking through this. In all my heart I want to believe its a hoax. But it is just too much evidence that it's not.

       Yet, there is not blood on the carpets where you'd expect to see a lot. I can understand cleaning the halls but the carpet would not be easy to clean.

       The photos seem to be taken days if not a week later? The one with reflections of outside show a full row of forensic tents set up in the reflection.

       Some are taken at night and others during the day.

       But clearly they are of Sandy Hook and there is obvious evidence on the walls that it was December 14, 2012.

       There is a certain set of rules that determine redactions.  One of them appears to be items that could personally identify parties involved, cannot be released to the public (not even items that would identify teachers)  However, when it comes to thousands of photos, there are going to be silly mistakes on their part.    I happen to have a photo showing the teachers and their families and friends, or it might be the faculty.  That is : a jpeg image of photos hung on an office wall.  It was definitely a "woops" on the screening, and slipped through.

       The wall tiles at floor level are filthy. The 4th row up has been damaged. The door frame is in bad need of a paint job. This was a first rate school? The entire Sandy Hook story stinks and these photos prove nothing.

        Some anomalies don't make sense, like the chairs pushed into the desks (would be knocked over or at least randomly placed in panic) and no other writings on the whiteboard except the date "December 14, 2012"

       There is a certain set of rules that determine redactions.  One of them appears to be items that could personally identify parties involved, cannot be released to the public (not even items that would identify teachers)  However, when it comes to thousands of photos, there are going to be silly mistakes on their part.    I happen to have a photo showing the teachers and their families and friends, or it might be the faculty.  That is : a jpeg image of photos hung on an office wall.  It was definitely a "woops" on the screening, and slipped through.

       I won't be posting it here.   I
       <em>

       share it with genuinely interested  people in private.

        In all my heart I want to believe its a hoax. But it is just too much evidence that it's not.
