<blockquote>
<p>Even top bosses who’ve noticed the change in public opinion aren’t willing to adjust. On his blog, Y Combinator president Sam Altman argued that political correctness was damaging the tech industry. “This is uncomfortable, but it’s possible we have to allow people to say disparaging things about gay people if we want them to be able to say novel things about physics,” he wrote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever since seeing this appear on reddit, FB, Twitter, etc, I think the P.C. movement is bad news. It creates a sort of (Season 3 Black Mirror) Fake smiles, fake compliments, fake everything environment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people praising overweight women as sexy and healthy, but overweight men as seen as slobs on some FB posts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Created the Participation Trophy generation that thinks everything in life should be handed to them and they should be making 6 figure salaries without the skills to back it.</p>

<p>Its created an atmosphere on reddit where people are scared to say certain things, and drumpfs supporters live in fear to wear their hats in public, amongst many other microclimates of fear.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad there is now a counter movement to P.C. culture</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately it boils down to Free Speech. I don&#39;t have an issue with gay people, but to refuse to hire someone because they do not believe in that lifestyle is absurd. Fight for your ideals with your own words, eventually you will win or lose. I don&#39;t think the idea of gay rights or things like it have anything to fear from free speech whatsoever, just as I don&#39;t fear that Freedom of Speech and Expression has anything to fear form fighting Nazi&#39;s with Free Speech itself and not curtailing their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s beyond consideration though. Silicone valley is forced to hire P.C. hr managers who start hiring based on a balanced number of women and minorities instead of being meritocracy based.</p>

<p>That creates a whole new mess of problems when you have people employed because of their sex or skin color who are not up to par with what the company break needs.</p>

<p>This would be like a welding company making sure half the employees made women, when the pool of candidates nis like 90% men so they start hiring whoever just fill a quota and the end product suffering because of this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made no specific claims about autism/gender fluid.  An autistic spectrum person has no problem speaking a truth, any truth, aloud.  If a particular autistic spectrum person HAS determined that, say, there are only two genders, it would be confusing to him to find that there are persons who can&#39;t handle hearing that (an autistic spectrum person will be confused by snowflakeitis in general, because an AS person generally will grow up being teased and tortured in school-- much worse than the people who need safe spaces now-- and not only survives it, but comes out of it without selling his/her soul to the God of Safe Spaces).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s two different criticisms of &quot;P.C. culture&quot;, one comes from bigots and the other comes from reasonable people.</p>

<p>Bigots criticize it because they want to be openly racist or bigoted.  Reasonable people criticize it because it can stifle legitimate inquiry and understanding of our world, society, and human interaction.</p>

<p>Perfect example:  In our current climate, the &quot;correct&quot; opinion is that a transgender person is always 100% prudent and unquestionable in their decision to undergo sex reassignment surgery.  It is viewed as bigoted to ask whether or not every individual is making a good decision.  </p>

<p>A university professor attempted to study this by crafting a survey that would quantify the number of transgender people that underwent a surgery to reverse the reassignment.  His study was shut down by the university for fear of &quot;poltically troubling implications&quot;, if I recall the wording in the email correctly.</p>

<p>This is an example where PC culture is harmful to everyone and hurts the people it is intended to protect.  In this example, the fear of offending a politically sensitive group of people takes priority over legitimate and important scientific inquiry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, kids grow up learning how to have a thick skin, how to stand up for themselves, and others by developing a thick skin. Without this, without having to stand up for themselves they lose out on a very important lessons on life. They become less able to absorb difficult situations. If you don&#39;t allow them to build their skills, develop those values then you start to need all kinds of rules which is totally avoidable. From your response I don&#39;t think your open to discussion though. Have fun in the real world.</p>
