       There's something to collective thoughts and actions.  All of these investors are purely gambling in either greed or desperation, both being negative in nature. Combine that with the energy consumption and AI involved... We're talking possible heavy duty next level evils

       Source code that is open to analysis and scrutiny cannot contain malicious code. If it did, it would have become public a long time ago. Many security companies have looked at the code and found nothing. This is one of the reasons why the blockchain and subsequently Bitcoin has such value.

       Not sure if you really understand his question. Not everybody is able to "understand" something like this only by looking at it. Why would you suggest such thing? If he is a layman then looking at the stuff doesn't do anything for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also argue that the open nature of the project alone doesn't make a conspiracy unlikely. Smart people could certainly hide stuff in plain sight. The random nature of the computing chain is what makes this unlikely.

       I clearly understand his question. It’s just a rediculous question, giving all the audits of Bitcoin’s code that have been done over the years. He also could’ve easily searched what the hashes do, or what it takes to mine a block, instead of jumping straight to the extreme.

       A lot of the people who suggest Bitcoin is a trap, has backdoors etc, don't have the math/programming background to understand it. Bitcoin is trustless if you are a scientist and can understand the code and the white papers, but for the layman, they have to "trust" that it all works.

       Just putting this out there for some perspective. Back in the late 90s early 2000s, hacking satellite tv cards - specifically direct tv - was easy and a lot of people were doing it. Though most people had no clue how the hack worked, some of the smarter folks of the community understood and could adjust and update the hack when direct tv sent down a counter measure. They read what dtv was sending down and either bypassed or accommodated it. Anyways, the hackers were good - they came out with updates very quickly and kept the channels open almost all of the time. Then
       <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/01/01/25/1343218/directvs-secret-war-on-hackers">
        this
       </a>
       happened. The hack coders saw the code, were able to read it and see what it would do, yet weren't able to comprehend the whole picture....

       The trap is that sometime in the near future, Wall Street fuckers are going to short the living shit out of bitcoin. So I'd carefully watch the price and be ready to pull out before the crash. And I'd buy in right after because it's gonna go the fuck back up.

       I see so many articles about how they predict it going over $50k then $100k to $200k. What a perfect way to get a bunch of people to buy in and then short it when it's super high. But if you play it right and get lucky you can of course make it work. Just don't bet your life savings.

       My theory is it's the gateway to microchipping finances on people. Eventually all money is digital devolves into a one world currency. No chip, no buy no sell. Maybe not bitcoin itself, but in my eyes, this is the beta rollout.

       I don't think there is a possibility for this to be true.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The algorithms are known

       <li>

         The "tasks" are based on the "tasks" before them, which are

           random
          </em>
         </strong>

       <li>
        <p>
         It is pointless computing. Randomly putting numbers into a
         <strong>
          <em>
           known
          </em>
         </strong>

       <li>
        <p>
         Everything about the process is open

      </ul>
      <p>
       I am by no means an expert but got at least some understanding of math and I don't see any logical reason to suspect something like that. The process does exactly what you expect it to do and there is no real way to inject a "real problem" into this to solve. It is just doing a hash function over and over and over and over.

       We had a discussion about this the other day... (im gonna copy and paste what i wrote)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The thing with bitcoins are that there are a finite number. Thats why back in the day (09-13) they were cheap to get and could be traded for anything. But as economics has taught us finite things are worth more. This is just a modern day gold rush... To many "poor" people are making millions off of this resource/currency (its actually a currency) that the corporate banking entities now want to control it, same they did with gold. They want people to cash out so it can die off, but people that use it for dark transactions or international use aren't selling theirs and it makes the banks nervous."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "No... i dont think bitcoin isn't an attempt for a global currency. The USD is trying to be the global currency. Thiel (who is chairman for palantir) is a gambler and risk taker he just wants the boom. Youre right though the big boys are in a fight, alot of investment firms and banks are duking trying to keep money moving. Thats why they added BTC Futures to the market. To try to to entice people to sell thiers and cah out. Because if they own all of it they can control the value and it defeats the decentralized nature of it. but people are still holding on to it. so it makes it a wee bit hard to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think Singnet is trying o just jump on the bandwagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for this being a military project i cant see it, its not american technology which is why the need to regulate it and get it sorted has been such a priority for american banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads to destabilizing technologies created without government/ military/ intelligence approval. usually those people that create things end up dead or under fire from character assassination attempts. but Satoshi knew what would have happened and hid his identity. No body wants the mantle because they would be killed."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I thought about that with TOR until i realized that the development continued after DARPA and and the US military dropped it. And now no one can stop it, the more people use it the stronger it becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But bitcoin isnt out of control. It is held together by group of people that are the largest BTC players, Many of whom are now millionaires on a whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the new crypto currencies are however agency experiments to replicate. Kinda how they are trying to recreate tor so they can infiltrate it."

       From what i have read about ripple it seems like more of a means to transfer funds than an actual currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the second question... It looks like a lot of international banks which reinforces my its a "transfer protocol" than an actual currency.

       ive heard some say its an nwo coin or a gov coin or a banker coin, etc. if this is the case its not going away anytime soon. also, while I understand the marketcap and supply concerns, if the rumors of coinbase next year are true theres just no way in hell it stays at 70 cents like it is now.  I mean, if you invest even just $1000 right now, if xrp ever hits $10 youve already made some good money. just my .02 worst worst case you lost a grand best best case you gain 100k if it somehow hit $100 one day

       hey man get in now. the rumors are first qtr 2018 IF it goes on coinbase. shit was .20 a few weeks ago i didnt buy in in time now its around .70.  if youre new to crypto get on coinbase buy some ethereum get a binance account(ive been using it its great and verification is quick). transfer your ethereum to binance exchange it for XRP. then just hold onto it.  Hope it works out for ya.

       I was looking at ethereum...  Do you feel that the crypto bubble for Eth is gonna pop? because with bitcoin people still use it for dark trading, where the external value of a BTC is unimportant, but Eth seems to be implicitly tied real world values.

       Ethereum is unique some weird Turing complete thing, Litecoin is basically Bitcoin with 4 times the circulation and a different hashing number SHA512. 2 Min. Block times and cheaper transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will now shamelessly shill for IOTA, its entirely unique, instead of Block chain they use Tangle Chains. Internet of Things Algorithm.

       We know that CERN has been using the dwave to communicate with "extra-dimensional intelligence. I think they are communicating with the fallen angels. Geordie referred to it as summoning the old ones. What if fallen angels are using the processing power of the blockchain to build the technology in our realm of existence that will allow them back into our physical reality.
