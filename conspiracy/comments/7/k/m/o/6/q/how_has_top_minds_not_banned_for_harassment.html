       In an environment that values diversity as much as it does reddit sure doesn't give a fuck about a diversity of opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who keep track and collect links for specific users in this forum are either mentally ill or paid agents. People who laugh at others because of their beliefs are bigots. TopMinds is a forum based off of bigotry and harassment. As long as top minds exists reddit cannot be said to value diversity. Because they allow a forum that is hate based bigotry against diverse opinions.

       RMFN, I found this conversation via TMOR.  I hope you can learn to think of it like I do...I had this old post that wasn't going anywhere I think it had 5 or 6 views, when TMOR decided to feature it on their page.  Think about it...my OP has reached almost 1,000 people now that I never would have been able to reach on my own.  That is almost 1,000 people who would never have heard my voice or thoughts without them.  They are welcomed to 'harass' me until the cows come home.  I am delighted to get the exposure.  Do you know how many people might reject my ideas outright...but will stew upon them over time?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is frigging genious man...it doesn't get any better than that...but you have to look at it correctly, they are a vehicle to get you exposure...nothing more.  Trust me...you may not like it but it is really a good thing for, in my case, hard Alt-Right ideologies.

       Theres a reason TMOR has a fast turnaaround of users. Onces they start to question anything rationally there counterparts tear them to peaces like rabid dogs.

       I enjoy getting into the comments of the piece they are trying to do a hit on and point out their logical fallacies within that subreddit, anything to help make them look mean, petty, and mentally disturbed...
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't really gotten into this yet but I can imagine (as I am banned and have nothing to lose) that a concerted effort to counter stalk TMOR would be highly profitable in destroying them and bring them down if you wanted.  But enough people would have to sub and then violate all their rules OUTSIDE their domain and spoil the 'fun' in the hit pieces, I always try and give the people they stalk a heads up if I know them.  Fuck 'em...they can't help being mentally ill, it is part of (((their genetics))).  But there is no reason to just let them pick off people, or harass them when we are the vast majority of users of Reddit.

       OK...I know you are probably tired of hearing from me and this is slightly ironic because it was actually a shower thought.  Here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment above shows a clear and systematic campaign of harassment against specific Reddit Users, in this case YOU, RMFN are being systematically targeted by the mod u/MAGA_Hatter; that is coordinated harassment via one of the MODS of TMOR...and indicates that the Subreddit TMOR actually classifies and targets individual reddit users in a coordinated campaign of intimidation, prejudice and harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have archived the subreddit and downloaded the zip showing your post on the front page of TMOR along with this

       OK kiddo...do with this what you like...you wanted a way to stop TMOR on Reddit from systematically harassing people and here it is.  Let me know if you need anything.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       The last thing I am going to do in one second is make an archive.is file of this OP and attach it here via EDIT as soon as I post this comment.

       Dude, it's bullshit. They're taking the piss out of you guys. There are no levels of classification for you. It's like how they say they get paid in lizard shekels or whatever. They're mocking you.

       Well you know what they say, "No publicity is bad publicity..." and it's true of course, I can't tell you how many times I have changed my mind completely when I had 24 hours to really think about a challenging issue.

       Wanna know what the absolute best part is?  Being mentally ill, they don't understand Indo-European psychology and that, yeah, we might mock something at first because of (((public pressure))), but deep down, inside it is going to burn and weigh on the IE soul, because they aren't given over to immoral and debased thinking and they know that (((those in power and their slaves like MAGA_Hater))) are wrong, evil and deviant. I couldn't have planned it better...planning my next move to skewer them further...this is actually a lot more enjoyable than I thought it was going to be.

       Nothing wrong with being a racist (usually I feel a rush of pride when people say that to me because it means that I am willing to stand up for my own people)...all it means is that you want to secure the future for you own children and not (((their children))).

       You think this would apply to subreddits as well. Topminds has proven itself to simply be bias and hateful, ban users who make

       on Topminds, it would honestly make r/conspiracy a friendlier environment.

       Yes, I see the inconsistencies in your wording. What names do they call you when they make fun of you? Do they use names like "fattie" or "autistic" ? Pretty sure they don't resort to petty name calling.

       Isn't autism a euphemism for obsession on the internet? Someone who keeps files and links of people's posts they don't like specifically to smear them is obsessive, I.e. autistic.

       If its literally only 6-15 people or whatever, let the non-hate TMOR uses just do their thing, that is such an insignificant amount compared to the people who actually visit this sub for whatever reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate that you do keep on top of abusive TMOR users, it is likely that you have already banned the abusive ones, and the ones that remake accounts to come back likely tippy-toe around the previously broken rules, which is understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate the response, I never realized there was such an insignificant amount of TMOR users here though, seems like the issue is more with users not blocking things they don't like. (EX: "Your r/conspiracy thread was just linked to TMOR", then they proceed to go to TMOR, to that thread, and freak out that there is a thread on another subreddit etc etc, although TMOR users don't listen to reason, there is nothing reasonable about arguing with a brick wall.

       James, can you please ban TopMind users at this point, screw it, this is becoming too stupid, its becoming pathetic. They are openly attacking users and I submitted it to the reddit admins as directed hate towards me and its still up. There is no reason for this type of directed hate.

       You get three or four accounts to make 10 posts or so over the course of like a week. You make it look like typical TMOR douchebaggery except you dox the user you're talking about by linking a fake Twitter account or something that looks legit. Then you get others to report all the posts to admins immediately.

       It's a mystery as to why they're still on Reddit. They were causing issues about a year ago, actual stalking and harassing and threatening of users, I outed some of them and their sock puppets, they had to dial it back. I think a deal was struck behind the scenes and we never really learned what happened. They probably got a slap on the wrist from admins and told to stop harassing. They used to be able to just come into
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or any sub and brigade away, using TotesMessenger bot as a notification system flagging the victims for the attackers. TotesMessenger was banned from this sub at least, but the AIPAC scum are still cockroaching about. They have some sort of position of privilege where they're allowed to operate in the disinterest of just about anyone who's encountered them. I don't really get that. AIPAC, Hasbara, JIDF, not sure exactly who they are but it's some kind of information control outfit pretending to be "just regular assholes here for a laugh".
       <em>
        Nobody
       </em>
       spends that much time laughing at conspiracy theorists unless they're being paid or held at gunpoint. Ahh, so that's what we do with those guys in Guantanamo, make them get on the internet and sling the government propaganda.

       Because the Reddit admins are part of TMoR.  Dipshits like spaz and his group of pedo-protectors get off on internet harassment.  They would get the shit kicked out of them irl so they have to harass people online.

       I'm not a fan of yours for reasons obvious to you and I RMFN, but just from looking at the blatant vote manipulation going on in this post it's pretty obvious you've attracted the ire of TopTards. And whenever those douchecanoe riding mental patients target specific individuals it means whoever is paying them really doesn't want that particular narrative to be heard, so keep doing whatever it is you're doing.
