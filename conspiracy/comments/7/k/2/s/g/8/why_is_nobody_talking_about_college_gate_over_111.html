<blockquote>
<p>For the past few years I have been monitoring reports of professors and staff arrested for trading in child rape and torture; also known as child pornography. My research, which is far from comprehensive, details 111 professors and staff arrested on child pornography related charges. This is a small sample and does not represent the total number of professors and staff arrested for this crime.</p>

<p>Both the volume and type of crime should raise alarm bells. Yet academic institutions remain silent. Protect the institution not the children, appears to be the rallying cry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today in bad statistics...</p>

<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies about 1.5 million people as college or university faculty.  </p>

<p>111 arrests is about 0.0074% of that number.  The rate of pedophilia in the US is hard to judge exactly, but estimated at somewhere in the 1-5% range.  </p>

<p>In other words, 111 arrests isn&#39;t a particularly large amount given the number of faculty there are.  I imagine that you&#39;d probably be able to find at least that number of people named &quot;Jim&quot; arrested for child pornography, but that wouldn&#39;t mean people are silencing an epidemic of pedo Jims.</p>

<p>The facts are 111 and counting in academia in the U.S. have been busted for child porn. Its logically Outrageous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>111 / 1.5million = 0.0074% of post-secondary teachers were busted.  </p>

<p>Except your post says &quot;professors, academics, staff&quot; instead of just the teachers so the actual percentage is even smaller.  </p>

<p>Now lets look at your idiotic Hitler comparison:<br/>
You say &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; so I&#39;ll help you out and go with the largest.  </p>

<p>12m / 900m = 1.33%  </p>

<p>That is already MUCH MUCH MUCH more significant than your so called epidemic.    </p>

<p>Now lets look at some real numbers instead of your asspulls and hyperbole:<br/>
About 6 million Jews were killed in the holocaust.  The pre-WW2 Jewish population peaked at about 17 million.  </p>

<p>6m /17m = 35.3% of the Jewish population was killed by Hitler.  </p>

<p>35.3% = HOLY FUCKING SHIT  </p>

<p>1.33% = someone should probably look into this  </p>

<p>0.0074% = &quot;epidemic&quot;?  lolwut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently my comment was taken as tacit acceptance of the ridiculous pizzagate theory.</p>

<p>When, in fact, my point was that pedophiles are everywhere in every occupation. Estimates on percentage of adults who are pedophiles range from 1-5%, meaning if there were <em>only</em> 111 pedophiles in a sample group of 1.7 million (0.006%, by the way), that&#39;d be a much lower-than-predicted percentage, and you could make the argument that it&#39;s a positive trend compared to estimates of averages overall.</p>

<p>Oh okay. Do you have some source for that? BEcause prior to European invasion into American, one can argue the best race to be before then would be Native, so is this pre or post invasions?</p>

Research the amount of known pedophiles in the US, and then find out what percentage of the population that is.

<p>Because Academia isnt some Utopian society made up of Gods. They are humans, should be also investigated and looked at, see the revolving doors that happen with funding and corporations, see that yes there is indeed a liberal bias there, and yes there are pedos and child porn watchers that make up this group.</p>

<p>just like saying &quot;its only 111 of 1.7 million&quot; is also painting a certain narrative by making this about statics only, so also omission of context.</p>

<p>Its like saying, &quot;the 12 million killed <del>(jews by Germans)</del> is out of the current 8 Billion population</p>

<p>The point os this post, is that pedophiles exist within academia and its hardly ever discussed. VEry simple</p>

<p>That we know of</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Perhaps there is a similar amount in Academia, but because they consist of different cultures, thats why the difference. For example in Catholicism with the priests maybe its acted on IRL more, whereas in Academia being tech savvy its more kept to the computer or hidden better</p>

I never see anybody talking about it and people love clowns but we need to start acknowledging that there are some suicidal clowns.</p>

<p>Not everything can be talked about all the time, 111 cases of pedophilia among that large of a sample barely warrants discussion, the only reason you want to talk about it is because you&#39;re grasping for anything you can to try and discredit an institution that, for some reason unknown to me, you hold a grudge against.</p>

<p>To be more precise, i would go much further and say OP is downplaying the significance of child abuse by only pointing out some specific group of people you don&#39;t like, distracting from the real problem of child abuse happening in each part of the society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you are sad that I can&#39;t detect OPs narrative but yet you fail to detect the academia can do nothing wrong brigade.</p>

<p>Statistics are helpful as a reference and still many of the world&#39;s problems have rarely been / are being handled by their statistical significance, more like the vested interests of a minority (such as academia), and in adherence of what the public perserves as important (as misguided as it may be). Simply due to the fact that our economic system operates on scarcity.
And finally about statistics, I recall being a rule about not admiting that 1% could happen or admiting that 99% will always happen. How&#39;s that for truth?</p>

<p>And again you failed, no one said or stated that academics can&#39;t do anything criminal or wrong, child abuse included. That&#39;s your own silly and flimsy interpretation.</p>

<p>What people offsets is the fact that the OP with his anti-academic mindset tries to instrumentalize child abuse to denounce a certain part of the population/society (don&#39;t rorget the hint that most academics are liberal). This is a disgrace and slap in the face of all those victims of child abuse. Let it sink, think about it. Maybe you will then recognize that this is the most ashaming behaviour to instrumentalize childs, which suffered horrible things, for some political propaganda.</p>

<p>Some systems are socialist by proxy, but coexist with capitalism, which has in it an aspect of evolution, racing to the top, competition, and survival of the fittest, creating also by proxy the technology you&#39;re using to view this sentence, better bridges, cars, health care, meds, etc</p>

<p>Because they are pro-constituion. And if not and some of the bad eggs want to go after the constitution then its fighting/revolution all over again.</p>

<p>If course its not enough, however you can relatively quickly and easily see what something is about or made of in a variety of ways. So if it was some nefarious group pretending, eventually it would be outed and come to the surface one way or another.</p>

<p>Its similar to having a group a friends and wondering who you can trust, and the seeing after a year or two that so and so can never be trusted no matter what</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldnt trust yours either considering you dont believe they are radical, and I can basically post vids and articles showing you that they indeed are. Also back when Occupy Wallstreet was going down, I was there and part of it, in ways that was Antifa too. I quickly realized being there in the unorganized disheveled orgy of stupidity, that there were no leaders with intelligent plans on how to upend the beast, and some had violent ideals of killing bankers/rich/stock brokers, so I peaced TFO.</p>

<p>Instead, revolution will come via decentralization in terms of Crypto, solar, Battery tech, off the gridders, organic communities, genetic engineering of humans, spiritual enlightenment movements, wikileaks, transparency, low orbit satellite open internet and meshnets, and so on.</p>

<p>Antifa is radicalized communist cultural marxist and basically a domestic terrorist group</p>

<p>This is an important issue. There are VERY MANY people in the sector you&#39;re talking about. And so as a percentage of miscreants, I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve made your case that this is the BIG UNDISCOVERED TROVE you&#39;re making it out to be?</p>

<p>But any prosecutions, any rooting out of these people, is good stuff.</p>

<p>I am not a big fan of you pretending to be persecuted for a very well-upvoted post, and there does need to be a semblance of rationality in terms of the totals you&#39;ve provided as judged against the total employment numbers in the sector you&#39;ve highlighted, and how that ratio compares to other sectors?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason it&#39;s not being talked about is because child porn doesn&#39;t have anything to do with people&#39;s jobs.</p>

<p>You will find that pedophiles exist among all walks of life because the core of the attractive energy of child porn lies with the Innocence of children and the power of men forcing the sexual experience. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s about dominance over a less experienced human. Normal porn also highlights this energy with throatfucks and BDSM and sex slaves etc.</p>

<p>I believe we could say that porn leads to pedophilia. </p>

<p>socialism doesnt work</p>

<p>I know, he&#39;s a socialist/commie. It starts as socialism and next thing you know, communism eventually. Plenty of books discuss this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your Trump speaks commie language all the time. He&#39;s a real comrade. He constantly talks about jobs jobs jobs and the workers who need to take back their country. Straight up commie.</p>

<p>Sure he is. GDP just reached 4%, SP500 record highs, shit is looking pretty good for a business man running the show.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m hoping a new major 3rd party could rise up and win it after Drumpfs 8 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, that&#39;s why you dropped it until I called you out on changing the subject. You realized your source was more damaging to your stance than it was helpful.</p>

<p>And now you&#39;re trying to change the subject even further? Pathetic.</p>

<p>You coming to the defense of a joke about Trump indicates that you really do. And going with the &quot;b-b-but Hillary&quot; defense shows just how indefensible your position is. So now you&#39;re trying to claim you aren&#39;t defending Trump so maybe you&#39;ll stop being humiliated. The only way to do that is to actually stop trying to defend Trump.</p>
