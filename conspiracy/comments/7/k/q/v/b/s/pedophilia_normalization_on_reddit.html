        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you call out the pedophilia that&#39;s creeping out in our education system as an epidemic, you get called an academia hater. If you are disgusted by pedophilia artwork creeping up into our politics, you become insensitive to art and its messages. Don&#39;t fall for these normalization of pedophilia tactics. They are here and there are very present.</p>

<p>This is done in coordinated effort when pedogate related posts get linked outside of the subreddit to <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the karma count as it is very telling. Most of the downvotes or upvotes depending on what they want to control come from a brigade. I&#39;m not saying that regular users don&#39;t tend tend to tag along with the narrative that is trying to be pushed but usually it&#39;s the brigades that gets the ball rolling.</p>

<p><del>They will try to make you feel bad and twist words to try to make you admit that the images found by the podesta&#39;s aren&#39;t pedophilic in nature and it&#39;s you that needs mental help for allowing sexual feelings to get evoked by these photos.</del></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I had to change this paragraph because they are trying to take my words out of context again.</p>

<p>They further tried to put words in my mouth and accused me of being aroused by these photos and said that I apperently find them arousing because from their point of view there is nothing sexual about them therefore I must be aroused.</p>

<p>They have no shame to admit that they are normalizing pedophilia through their actions but they will never admit it an actual writing but it&#39;s clear as day.</p>

<p>Have a good day. Much love.</p>

For example if he did browse through such posts then I would ask him a certain question or opinion on what he has observed in terms of behavior or patterns.

<blockquote>
<p>For the past few years I have been monitoring reports of professors and staff arrested for trading in child rape and torture; also known as child pornography. My research, which is far from comprehensive, details 111 professors and staff arrested on child pornography related charges. This is a small sample and does not represent the total number of professors and staff arrested for this crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the volume and type of crime should raise alarm bells. Yet academic institutions remain silent. Protect the institution not the children, appears to be the rallying cry.</p>

<p>And, as u/MoronToTheKore (great username, by the way) has pointed out, you need to look at the dates of the arrests. they go back as far as 1998:</p>

<p>Antonio Lasaga, 52 year old geology professor at Yale University, was arrested, 19 December 1998, on charges of sexual assault and child porn possession.</p>

<p>If educational institutions tend to create liberals, this exemplifies my personal beliefs about the veracity of liberal beliefs.</p>

<p>But, I’m a liberal. I could be biased... and I encourage you to remember that what is perceived as “brainwashing” and “propaganda” is almost entirely dependent on whether the person agrees or disagrees with the views expressed.</p>

<p>To put this in context, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-national-law-enforcement-training-child">a recent speech by Jeff Sessions</a>, over the last 20 years there have been &quot; more than 73,000 people suspected of sexually exploiting children — including 8,800 just in the last year [2016]&quot;.</p>

<p>So, yes, there is a lot of child abuse going on, and it&#39;s nothing new, but that doesn&#39;t justify making shit up about it. The victims deserve the issue to be taken seriously and not turned into some spurious conspiracy sideshow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lt;i&gt;For the past few years&lt;/i&gt; I have been monitoring reports of professors and staff arrested for trading in child rape and torture; also known as child pornography. [My emphasis.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some examples from the list of arrests showing how far back the arrests go:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Daniel Shaw, 47 year old information technology (IT) staff for Purdue University, was arrested, 23 September 2014</p>

<p>Mark Manion, a 51 year old philosophy professor who taught ethics at Drexel University, was arrested, 28 October 2010, on child porn charges. He pleaded guilty, 13 January 2010 ... [Clearly one of these years is wrong. The only confirmation I can find is <a href="https://thetriangle.org/news/student-arrested-on-child-pornography-possession/">here</a> which also says he pled guilty in 2010, which means he was probably arrested in 2009.]</p>

<p>Justin Bradley May, a 34 year old economics professor at William and Mary, was arrested, July 2010, on child pornography production</p>

<p>Kenneth Martin Kyle, a 47 year old Assistant Professor of Justice Studies at California State East Bay, was arrested, 15 March 2010,</p>

<p>James Lesner Query, Jr, a 55-year-old communication professor at James Madison University, was arrested, in 2010, on child pornography charges.</p>

<p>Diego Fasolini, a 42 year old Italian professor at George Mason University, was arrested, October 2010, on child pornography charges.</p>

<p>Now, how about you admit you were wrong or back up your claim of a &quot;recent mass arrest&quot;?</p>

<p>“If you have a golf-ball-sized consciousness, when you read a book, you&#39;ll have a golf-ball-sized understanding; when you look out a window, a golf-ball-sized awareness, when you wake up in the morning, a golf-ball-sized wakefulness; and as you go about your day, a golf-ball-sized inner happiness. But if you can expand that consciousness, make it grow, then when you read about that book, you&#39;ll have more understanding; when you look out, more awareness; when you wake up, more wakefulness; as you go about your day, more inner happiness.” - David Lynch</p>

<p>What can you do? Once you understand there is a small group of ultra-wealthy evil-doers who have infiltrated every aspect of our lives you can then break free. You stop giving your power to them. You stop buying their shit. You ween yourself off their tit. You become self-reliant, thus happy. The ignorant are slaves and they don’t even know it. Knowledge is power. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t see the need for that to occur.

<p>u/sons_of_many_bitches didn&#39;t say that. He/she referred to people holding extreme views on the topic – &quot;The more hysterical &#39;hang them all&#39; guys&quot; – and there definitely are people who hold this sort of opinion.

<p>They will try to make you feel bad and twist words to try to make you admit that the images found by the podesta&#39;s aren&#39;t pedophilic in nature and it&#39;s you that needs mental help for allowing sexual feelings to get evoked by these photos.</p>

<p>Uhhh, yeah. If you are looking at art by some of the artists Tony Podesta likes (like the Serbian painter you guys are always so quick to post paintings from, most of which are not owned by Tony Podesta) and you are have &quot;sexual feelings&quot; evoked by these pictures, you probably <em>should</em> feel bad and you should definitely go see a therapist and talk to THEM about your feelings, not a bunch of people on reddit. Cuz that&#39;s messed up, tbh.</p>

<p>Somewhat ironic considering this all started because of some strange wording on emails that you don&#39;t know the contexts of. But that couldn&#39;t mean you&#39;re taking those words out of context, right? Nah, you&#39;re conclusion that these people are pedophiles, openly talking about it in emails to sometimes hundreds of people, but in a code that&#39;s recognizable enough that someone on 4chan knew about it - that must be right.</p>

<p>This goes to the heart of pizzagate - the problem is primarily with the people who are viewing these emails and paintings and photos and screaming PEDOPHILIA. Most people can read those emails and see nothing wrong with them. Most people can look at those paintings and admit their weird and make them feel uncomfortable BUT they DON&#39;T evoke sexual feelings.</p>

<p>If you see children sexualized everywhere you turn, maybe it&#39;s YOU who is the problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not accusing anyone. I&#39;m saying people who try to get us to be sympathetic to the pedo art work by even denying it&#39;s pedo work are pushing an agenda. I&#39;m calling that agenda out. Then I call users out who try to normalize it. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re pedos. I&#39;m just saying they support pedophila normalization if they don&#39;t see anything wrong with James Alefantis IG to the point they feel they need to defend it at any chance they get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately there really is not enough proof that Alefantis is a pedo/trafficker. Sources of information and suspicious content stopped their flow after pizzagate blew up, instagram accounts were put on private, google map locations were deleted, etc. This makes it hard to continue investigating because they are clearly very careful with what they share online now. </p>

<p>Not many people here are defending Epstein because he&#39;s a convicted pedo. But views on people like Podesta, Alefantis or Biden vary dramatically. However I do believe anti-Trump shills have been rampant recently, they are usually the ones who attack your view without giving any reason apart from &quot;thats normal&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re paranoid&quot;.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because a lot of the people throwing these accusations around don&#39;t care about actually stopping pedophilia, they are just using it as a tool to fuel smear campaigns against people they don&#39;t like. This sub for example, there are a lot of users who start an uproar over pizza/podesta constantly while remaining silent about people like roy moore.</p>

<p>And people aren&#39;t blind, they see this bias too. When you treat a serious topic like this as a tool to attack the other guy, people begin to pay attention less to similar accusations under the assumption that they might also be fake. Using pedophilia accusations as a political tool rather than treating it as a serious issue makes it harder to catch those responsible.</p>

<p>Basically when you go around accusing everyone you don&#39;t like of being a pedo regardless of its truth, people won&#39;t listen to you when you ARE right.</p>

Yeah there&#39;s a big resistance to prevent from finding out and if they do there is an effort to make it seem all normal.

<p>The proportion of pedophiles in society is one static number if you define it as attraction to prepubescent children, and another, much more variable number, if define it as attraction to children under the age of consent.</p>

<p>Either way, the only thing that gives the perception of increasing occurrence is increasing attention being paid to these issues... which is good, because it deserves to be paid attention to.</p>
