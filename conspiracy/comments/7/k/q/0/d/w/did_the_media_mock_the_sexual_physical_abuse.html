       A&amp;E has a great series on the Menendez Brothers, with Erik Menendez's first recorded interviews since the trial. I wasn't alive during their trial so this is my first real exposure to the case but I am absolutely sick to my stomach to see what happened to them in the media and to know that they were found guilty, when the murders were likely justified. Listening to all of the witness testimony and the brothers testimony as well, I'm having a very hard time wrapping my head around how a jury could actually find them guilty of first degree murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       These boys were abused sexually and physically extensively throughout their lives, and there were several witnesses who seem to back up the stories told by Erik and Lyle. No one ever knows what happens behind closed doors, and no one actually witnessed the abuse first hand (a rarity in itself) but family members and friends had been at their home before and witnessed Jose take the boys to the back for their "showers", even into their teen years. Kitty, the mother, prevented anyone from entering the back hall when Jose would take the boys back there and many people said they always felt like something strange was going on. This is only one example and there are so many things that support their narrative, yet the media often described them as money hungry, greedy kids who killed their parents to get access to their trust fund. The sensationalism of their trial was more important than the horrific things the boys testified to... as is often the case in criminal trials that make headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Episode 3 of the series shows segments from Saturday Night Live and other late night shows where the boys were literally mocked and ridiculed.. even going so far as to remake their testimony, with fake crying and bullshit lines read by the "comedians."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch the testimony, it seems so genuine and if you've ever been abused, you can feel the truth in their pain even more. If this were a televised trial now, and TV shows took it upon themselves to mock two teenage boys who were brave enough to testify about the horrible abuse they experienced during their life, at the hands of their parents, I can almost guarantee people would be up in arms. But this is now and that was then, when we didn't know what we do now about Hollywood and the reality of sexual abuse running rampant in The Hills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jose Menendez wasn't a super prominent executive in Hollywood, but he did serve as a high ranking exec at RCA Records and Live Entertainment prior to being murdered. Obviously, a murder in Beverly Hills attracted a lot of media and the fact that he was a Hollywood exec probably made some people worried about what would be revealed once their killers were caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given what we know now about the abuse in the entertainment industry, is it such a stretch to assume that the media portrayed the Menendez brothers as $ hungry because they didn't want people to think that Hollywood execs were capable of being sociopathic, narcissistic pedophiles and abusers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you haven't seen the series, I would definitely recommend it. It's truly disheartening how much of an impact the media has on criminal trials and their outcome. They don't care about the truth- they care about the sensationalism bc sensationalism = more views and more money.

       I kind of grew up just.. assuming they killed their parents in cold blood because they were spoiled brats, plain and simple. That was the narrative and as a kid, that's how I thought of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until I watched some documentary on tv a few years back that I actually learned the whole story - their reasons for what they did, the abuse allegations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was so mad I hadn't bothered to learn all of that until recently. And the one thing that has bothered me greatly since, is that during their second trial (after their first resulted in a hung jury),
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of the sexual abuse evidence was even allowed to be brought up.

       Before you get to depressed, remember the vast majority of people don’t abuse others, instead most of us raise up, encourage, respect, and treasure each other. Don’t forget to tell someone you know you appreciate them, it does wonders and changes lives.

       They killed their parents for money and used alleged abuse as a cover. Did they tell anyone about it? Run away? 
They committed murder, if they were abused there were other avenues.

       That, my friend, is called victim blaming. Abuse is complicated, and does things emotionally and mentally to the victim that can make it very difficult to get away. Also, if I'm remembering correctly, they did disclose the abuse to a few family members before the murders. I think there were also weird photos involved but I'd have to look that up and I'm lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't think killing their parents was the right thing to do, and I do think it was premeditated - I also do believe they thought it was the only way to end the abuse. Or, tbh, maybe they just wanted revenge. Either way, they're both doing time now so justice was served.

       I grew up believing these kids were a punchline, similar to what others have said here.  Thanks for bring this up.

       Very well said. I remember at the time, the few times someone did mention the claims of abuse, it was said in a very mocking way. Like, oh sure, murderers will use any excuse.  I don't remember a lot of people actually talking about the details.

       It's heartening to see that so much of this stuff is being brought into the light now.
