<p>The comment above shows a clear and systematic campaign of harassment against specific Reddit Users, in this case YOU, u/RMFN are being systematically targeted by the mod u/MAGA_Hatter; that is coordinated harassment via one of the MODS of TMOR...and indicates that the Subreddit TMOR actually classifies and targets individual reddit users in a coordinated campaign of intimidation, prejudice (their religious beliefs also; see his title of the OP mocking you) and harassment.</p>

<p>I have archived the subreddit and downloaded the zip showing your post on the front page of TMOR along with this image of TMOR with your post on it. Use all the photos here...including the one at the top to prove your case (because this is now centered around you)...</p>

<p>OK kiddo...do with this what you like...you wanted a way to stop TMOR on Reddit from systematically harassing people and here it is. Let me know if you need anything. :)</p>

<p>The last thing I am going to do in one second is make an archive.is file of this OP and attach it here via EDIT as soon as I post this comment.</p>

<p>I have been dehumanized by the bigotry of <a href="/u/maga_hatter">/u/maga_hatter</a>. They&#39;re intolerance to my religious and political beliefs have made me feel unsafe to freely discus my opinions. This post is to point out the fact that that kind of bigotry is allowed on reddit. I see the ideological of hatred against diverse opinions is the most important conspiracy we OK reddit have to tackle. </p>

<p>Numerous reports to the admins of harassment, vote brigading and report as spam brigading as neither resulted in permanent bans nor restoration of my comment karma. Last year, the admins had banned alt accounts for ban evasion in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.  This year, the admins refused to ban.</p>

<p>Any one else being gang cyberstalked by <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>? Have the admins ever enforced their new rule prohibiting cyberstalking?</p>

<p><a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> brigade takes over 4 health subs to circumvent posting on electromagnetic fields and naturopathy, to remove posts and ban. Brigadier <a href="/u/51Mike1980">/u/51Mike1980</a> gave an ultimatum constituting blackmail. He refuses to restore <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> to its founding mod, <a href="/u/brain_doc">/u/brain_doc</a>.</p>

<p>Brigade from <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> reports as spam 12 posts on harmful effects of electromagnetic fields in <a href="/r/gettingoutofbed">/r/gettingoutofbed</a>.

<p>My guess is that Phoenix, Hatter, ElCamino and the alts hate women. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol- a pm from Phoenix. So hilarious:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate women. I&#39;ve actually been married to a real deal hottie for over 15 years. It&#39;s often easy to picture all reddit males as chubby hipsters from The Bay Area, but that&#39;s not me. I&#39;m just as slick in real life, dear ;)</p>

<p>Oh, and I don&#39;t use alts; never have in all my years here. I have many old-school rules that I don&#39;t break, and that&#39;s one of them. Another is never /u/ summoning people, which, as you know, I made an exception for. I don&#39;t normally make exceptions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need alts for my purposes anyways, but some do, and I tried to point one out to you - but to no avail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am absolutely horrified that this has been a 2 year long ongoing problem for some of their targets. Reminds me of the shills on YT who always had a full psyche pro&#39;file&#39; on their victims.  They would harass them and mention things that we incredibly personal and pointed in the harassment.  I got to experience that firsthand and notice it as a repeating pattern in the harassment of other individuals who weren&#39;t <strong>bending</strong> to the deep state agenda.  </p>

<p>Like if someone&#39;s gf had committed suicide, &#39;suicide themes&#39; would be repeatedly brought up in one form or other in the harassment.  It was pretty brutal.  Imagine having a full psyche file on people and just choosing how you intend on hurting and injuring them for standing up for their beliefs.  </p>

<p>This is why this issue of <strong>&#39;RMFN&#39;s updated file&#39;</strong> is so important to me.  I want to know what types of information they have access to &#39;medical records&#39;, past personal history, financial records?  If they are doxxing people, but not making it public, but using that information to perform a systematic online campaign of harassment, I think this becomes more of a information/national security type issue (I am &#39;pretending&#39; pretty heavily that the current US Gov still cares about its own citizens here, lolz).</p>
