    <div class="md"><p>My thought is this- There&#39;s nothing wrong with Women in the workforce, working alongside men, and being out of the house. What is wrong, is the demonization of motherhood and stay out home mothers. If a woman want&#39;s to have a career that&#39;s great! If she wants to say home and raise a family? Also great! </p>

<p>An example- HRC passively dismisses stay at home mothers in 1992- “I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,” in response to Jerry Brown accusing Bill of helping HRC&#39;s legal career improperly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There it is.</p>

<p>Both options need to be available.</p>

<p>What people perceive/fear as a permanent casting away of more traditional roles is simply the extreme edge of these new ideas being presented. Like a wave sweeping the shore. Human society will endure some overreach, and then human society will settle on the fact that <em>any</em> lifestyle a women wants is legitimate, including a more “traditional” role.</p>

<p>All progress comes with the risk of toxicity. It is the price we pay for the rewards of progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest issue that perpetuates the inability to change our traditional roles is the double standard based around stay at home dads. If society doesnt happily recieve paternity then there is no way maternity will not be dominant. This helps enforce the idea that moms stay home and take care of the house while dads are bringing home the bacon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and it seems paradoxical that men have enjoyed a patriarchal society while simultaneously being harmed by it, but it is true. Men&#39;s issues will endure some repression as we search for this new equilibrium. The old methods of organizing society harm anybody who isn’t part of the “ideal”, whatever form that ideal takes. Many, <em>many</em> men don’t fit that ideal.</p>

<p>It is sad that I predict this temporary repression of men’s issues, because I see no reason why progress has to be a zero sum game. Extremist men’s rights groups and other reactionaries to feminism will only become more enboldened by increasingly legitimate grievances (not that they have a huge numbers of them in the first place), as this new wave occurs.</p>

<p>Dunno about the timescale. Hopefully less than a decade. Social changes happen so fast now.</p>

Her mother was a Presbyterian of mostly German (including Prussian), and some Scottish, descent.[11][12] Her father was Jewish, the son of immigrants from Württemberg, Germany and Radziejów, Poland.[12][13][14][15] Her paternal grandmother, Pauline Perlmutter Steinem, was chairwoman of the educational committee of the National Woman Suffrage Association, a delegate to the 1908 International Council of Women, and the first woman to be elected to the Toledo Board of Education, as well as a leader in the movement for vocational education.[16] Pauline also rescued many members of her family from the Holocaust</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If post-modernism is intellectually cynical and suspicious of transitional ideas and sarcastic; in direct response to modernism and it’s now-conservative attributes, then metamodernism is the fusion of the two. An honest appreciation for the earnestness of traditional narratives, coupled with the pragmatism of understanding that we live in a post-truth world. Where do find fufillment, then? asks metamodernism.</p>

<p>Generally this stuff refers to the cultural tropes of fiction, but fiction informs reality and society at large.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As has been exposed, cia has no love for Americans and serves the agenda of unelected oligarchs. Just that fact is enough to question any influence they have sought to impose on this country.  </p>

<p>We drown in material wealth of 2 earner income while our tender children are cared for by hired help and brainwashed by selected programming in school. </p>

<p>This is the most heartbreaking piece —More than easy, more probable divorces due to stressful hours and tasks, multiple sets of parents, erasing children in the way of careers, women harassed and demeaned in the workplace, women demeaned and dismissed in the intangible role of pillar of the home. Creation of greed, jealousy, unrealistic expectations, and so on. </p>

<p>I hate that we have been deceived... again and again. </p>
