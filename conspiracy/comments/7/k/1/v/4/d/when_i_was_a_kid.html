just something that bugs me while getting older and watching this slow motion fall from grace.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there should be a hybrid of the two.  Television channels that stream from the internet.  In sortof a Youtube-esque way, you build content and get more and more publicity (and revenue).  You can either watch it ad-free with a nominal subscription ($1-2/mo), or free with commercials.  People/organizations can band together and then put together enough content for a channel.</p>

<p>But another worthwhile subject to bring up is... should people search for specifically what they want to learn, or should they be fed a continuous stream?</p>

When it&#39;s not mindnumbing flotsam like &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;, it&#39;s blatant state propaganda like their shows on JFK and 9/11.  It turns my stomach to translate lies from one language into another.  I believe the History Channel is a contractor for intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>This is the beautiful thing about capitalism: Your ideas of what should be on TV aren&#39;t relevant. What <em>is</em> relevant, is what people watch, what generates ratings, and therefore what puts the most eyes on advertisements. This is a sort of passive democracy that makes capitalism far superior to any kind of social organisation that pretends to know what people want more than they do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, it&#39;s almost 2018. Cable is in it&#39;s death throws. Cable TV has no money left so they can&#39;t actually make new, good, content like you&#39;re talking about, because they will not make their money back. </p>

<p>What they&#39;re doing now is prolonging their demise by padding out their schedule with low budget, easy to film, reality TV and syndication rights of older things. </p>

<p>They are in no way making money at all and are definitely hemorrhaging at an alarming rate. Channels are going to start combining and closing as viewership melts away to on demand alternatives such as YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu. </p>

<p>Those types of shows are still being made and still exist, just not on your television. I&#39;m fucking 43, what&#39;s your excuse? Get with it, old man.</p>

<p>Which are slowly turning into what cable used to be. Netflix is becoming like a channel with only it&#39;s own programs similar to HBO, not the huge video library it once was. Every time they make another original they probably drop another hundred licenses of older shows and movies. As for Youtube, I never used to have a problem with ads until they came out with the 10 dollar/month no-ad fee, now its ads are even more obnoxious than cable&#39;s ever was. At least hulu&#39;s no-ad tax of only $3 is reasonable.</p>

<p>What we know as youtube right now won&#39;t even be the <em>you</em>-tube it was, but will be a curated, totally controlled cable channel as well. And I watch on Youtube &quot;those types of shows&quot; you&#39;re talking about, the educational, quality ones, but they will disappear from youtube soon enough as well. There&#39;s nostalgia for the old days, but then there&#39;s realizing there actually <em>is</em> a modern problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhm, you have conflicting points.  Youtube is becoming a paid channel, so the quality of the content is going to..disappear?  Because it has 0 competition, and instead is itself a platform for competition between different channels, which they themselves being awarded ad money?  Cable is dying <em>because</em> people <strong>ARE</strong> willing to pay for youtube; because the quality is there, and it&#39;s totally on demand and at will.</p>

<p>Netflix has known this day was coming as well, almost certainly before you even realized netflix was part of the future.  It takes a lot to get a full blown studio going.  They are already set too.</p>

<p>Look, I work in television and have for almost 15 years.  I know what I&#39;m talking about here. People I socialize with work at lionshead, miramax, netflix, disney, fox, this stuff isn&#39;t a fucking mystery to me. I am not guessing. I think and talk about this stuff constantly every single day.  I can see the writing on the wall, and movies and television as we know it have changed.  </p>

<p>Movies will die first, and already half-way out the door.  Cable TV is next.  Premium channels from cable will survive.</p>

<p>Youtube is becoming a paid channel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve missed my point. Why was it originally called <em>you</em>-tube? It is becoming <em>they</em>-tube, where you cannot upload whatever you want with hopes of getting your own content in front of millions. They&#39;ll get rid of the penny ante ads for joe shmo&#39;s uploads and get rid of joe shmo altogether. My videos will not be part of their paid service, their TV channel. I won&#39;t be able to put my science videos on Youtube just the same as I can&#39;t put them on the Discovery Channel (or whatever they call themselves now). The obnoxious ads on youtube at this moment are the same as when they started to take over cable TV. Remember when cable TV was supposed to be paid content, precisely to get rid of the commercials? It&#39;s all happening like that again, everything is simply morphing. Cable TV is simply called something else now (Youtube, Netflix, etc). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think your job is in jeopardy? You should apply for a job in advertising. One way or another that shit ain&#39;t going nowhere. </p>
