       We'll take for example both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say I'm a normal left leaning fellow, and I see something on r/all about the Alt-Right on one of the many subreddits dedicated to that exact thing. Now I'm heated because I can't believe the Nazis have such braggadocios and offensive types trying to turn the internet into a nazi-infested fuckfest. Now, with worries of pornhub's only category being blondes they take to the net. They come to conspiracy and they search out the first right leaning post they find and shit all over it. They travel down and find the comments and pounces, calls them fascists, murderers, and compare them to the foulest members of their side. This causes the left to have a kneejerk reaction to any right leaning source because it is inherently as evil as the Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, imagine I'm right leaning. I live in the south, and have had a fairly poor/modest background and you go to all and see these communist sites demanding that your "ilk" (great word) should be eliminated out of the gene pool. Basically the communist groups tend to enjoy triggering and berating right leaning people with all the same tactics they believe that white people use on all minorities (always a good excuse if you want to damage another human being). Now the right leaners will go to the safety of the right and start attacks anyone who attacks the right and espouses leftist narratives. They will pull away from leftist sources, because they are not discussing the actual realities of their area in favor of rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       They force us to connect to our ourskirt radicals by using the other sides radicals to push any moderate away from other moderates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's pretend like this behavior isn't coerced by money and political groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets not pretend like we know anything about Roy Moore due to actual politics and not a result of the 2016 election and the fight for a blue midterm?
      </p>
      <p>
       These groups are trying to game perception, and I think that's fairly obvious based on internet message boards like this one compared to modern reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at this subreddit within the last month.

       I totally agree with you in general (I recently made a comment to that effect on another submission), but I gotta say your bias is showing a bit lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you’re left leaning you come on reddit to shit on people, when you’re right leaning you come on reddit to get shit on? That certainly isn’t the

       I mean yeah man, I get that all politicians are generally pieces of garbage. Yet I see it in a simple way. Those who want more government and those who want less. This is my left right spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Not to mention those fucks that call themselves "alt right" because they are literally neo Nazis [I've been to the meetings] fuck those guys, they are left on my scale{based on their proclivity towards censorship and large government} I mean main steam left want to kill white, none main stream "left" want to kill everyone else. Same shit, you know what I mean)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow I get it, government is lame. I live in the woods and come to town to comment on Reddit. Or I wish that was my life... the point is that the technocracy is already more powerful than us bro, do to this insane amount of sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do we do bro? It's feeble to even consider we could free these fools. So then what? We just live our life, yeah? Why bother with the stress? Buddha say reality is what you acknowledge. Thus why even bother with the fools?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it has its fun, The Bleak idealism of maybe freeing one or two minds... yet just looking at the Grand scale, what is the point. Doctor JP said that we are all connected to each other. an organism of unanimity through shared thought. Every thought you have is only that which another has given.

       The dire struggle between Good and Evil has been waged for millennia. Yet in the end, AI will reign supreme. So why not just get fat and watch Parks and Recreation? Please my fellow worrier, tell me why we both with these sponges?

        <p>
         Finds that public policy, in addition to legal analysis, supports the information service

innovation, thereby furthering the goal of closing the digital divide and benefitting the 
entire Internet ecosystem.

       I gotta say, I'm sure you mean and meant well and all, but it is frustrating to watch everyone proselytize over misrepresented information when in most cases they didn't even read the whole 4chan post, let alone the actual document.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys are seriously spreading misinformation back and forth among each other and with every 4chan post you link, your perception of reality slips further and further from the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, anyone else who happens to read this, if you honestly think you can trust a literal shill on 4chan to give you accurate information, just do yourself a favor and actually take the time to read through the full text. I'm certain you will come to the same conclusion I have, which is that we've been mislead.

       The majority of the piece is disinformation. What you think RIF does is actually what Title II did, which RIF nullified. It's depressing that, in a conspiracy theory community, you'd rather have me do the same thing this 4chan poster did which lead to you being misinformed in the first place, and interpret it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give it a shot though, even though it will be difficult since this entire post is a narrative, and doesn't actually say much about RIF or Title II.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         NN was not a move in a sequence of events to completely take over the internet. It (Title II) was a set of regulations designed to prevent ISPs from taking advantage of consumers. I posted an excerpt in another comment in this thread, I believe.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NN was heavily advertised because, although Google and Facebook and Amazon may be huge companies, they aren't the ones who own the infrastructure to deliver internet. They still have to deal with ISPs. This wasn't a problem under Title II, but now the ISPs have almost full power to make the final decision with regard to how a customer will be treated. Now Google, Amazon, Facebook etc have to deal with them if they aren't happy about something, and they can't count on ISPs to be obligated to provide a fair, predictable, and reliable service. This means their (G, A, FB)'s services are at risk of degraded delivery and reliability.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NN has nothing to do with Ford, Rockefeller, or Carnegie.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FCC did not hold ISPs accountable to the Open-Internet rules prior to Title I. Title I is what enacted these regulations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NN has little to do with the Clintons, Democrats, or globalists. The repeated inclusion of these labels

       My biggest realization after becoming interesting in conspiracy theories is how effective propaganda can really be. TPTB can get the majority to think and feel any damn way they want them to.

       Are you saying you're anti-net neutrality?? You really want Comcast or Spectrum or whoever choosing what you can consume or post on the internet, including denying access to sites like this if we dare say anything bad about them? And I'm the one who's a victim of propaganda? Lol

       I get a lot of the rationale of most Trump hate (It's a two party system and everyone has expectations), but we are in such a meme-culture that the more ridiculous the claim, the more hilarious it is to the subreddits and facebook groups.

       He chooses his skin color. There's nothing remotely ironic about mocking how someone chooses to present themself, after that person spends so much time attacking others for how they look.
      </p>

       What is ironic is Trump and his followers getting triggered over such things, after they demand that no one be PC.

       Sure I have examples.  How about Canadian Facebook friends who never in the last ten years ever spoke up about any major political issues happening in Canada, never once pushed people how to vote in a local, provincial, or federal election, and yet somehow, during 2016, began posting shit constantly from Media Matters, Occupy Democrats, Buzz feed, Salon, etc, all anti-Trump content.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this became constant.  Everyday.  They went from having normal walls talking about movies and tv shows and work related things to constantly having an opinion on American politics, while having zero American citizenship and since being on Facebook have not once posted about a trip to the States.  All of a sudden they focus on American politics above their own countrys' political landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the posts that last week were telling all their friends how we must vote against Roy Moore.  Uh, you all live in Canada, your friends list is Canadian, you don't live in Alabama, and you are not allowed to vote in any American election.  Where were these people when the Liberal gas scandal of the last election was happening?  Silence.  How about when Harper passed bill C-51?  Silence.  No push to vote against Harper or to vote a certain party.  No links to articles about local political scandals.  Nothing.  But now some election in a state you're never setting foot in that doesnt affect your life or your job in any real tangibke way is the most important thing ever and is above any local political issues you are actually facing?  Give me a break.

       So because people recognize a massive threat and react to it. That's triggering you. Maybe these people actually have met and made friends from outside their country. Not the craziest of possibilities. Maybe now theyll start caring more about local stuff too, or posting about it. Why don't you engage with them on those problems?

       Oh, and I have tried engaging them with local politics.  Guess what?  They don't care.  Not important.  Even though one of those current issues actually affects them directly.  "That's not important."  "What is?"  "The election in Alabama."  "Really.  An issue that directly affects your union job is not important but an election in a state in a country you have no connection to does."

Been a year now and I was really hoping there was something substantial against him but nope, the media wants to talk about how Putin and him are on a first name basis. FFS

       There's a rational way to force ISPs to treat all data equally without giving the state too much power. The Democrats can't seem to give us common sense policy without slipping in government abuse like a trojan horse, and the Republicans as contrarian as always are perfectly content to simply dismantle everything the Democrats do without attempting to actually solve real problems that even Republican voters unanimously agree are real and pressing.

       He chooses his skin color. There's nothing remotely ironic about mocking how someone chooses to present themself, after that person spends so much time attacking others for how they look.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is ironic is Trump and his followers getting triggered over such things, after they demand that no one be PC.

       Are you saying you're anti-net neutrality?? You really want Comcast or Spectrum or whoever choosing what you can consume or post on the internet, including denying access to sites like this if we dare say anything bad about them? And I'm the one who's a victim of propaganda? Lol

       I mean yeah man, I get that all politicians are generally pieces of garbage. Yet I see it in a simple way. Those who want more government and those who want less. This is my left right spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Not to mention those fucks that call themselves "alt right" because they are literally neo Nazis [I've been to the meetings] fuck those guys, they are left on my scale{based on their proclivity towards censorship and large government} I mean main steam left want to kill white, none main stream "left" want to kill everyone else. Same shit, you know what I mean)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow I get it, government is lame. I live in the woods and come to town to comment on Reddit. Or I wish that was my life... the point is that the technocracy is already more powerful than us bro, do to this insane amount of sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do we do bro? It's feeble to even consider we could free these fools. So then what? We just live our life, yeah? Why bother with the stress? Buddha say reality is what you acknowledge. Thus why even bother with the fools?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it has its fun, The Bleak idealism of maybe freeing one or two minds... yet just looking at the Grand scale, what is the point. Doctor JP said that we are all connected to each other. an organism of unanimity through shared thought. Every thought you have is only that which another has given.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dire struggle between Good and Evil has been waged for millennia. Yet in the end, AI will reign supreme. So why not just get fat and watch Parks and Recreation? Please my fellow worrier, tell me why we both with these sponges?
