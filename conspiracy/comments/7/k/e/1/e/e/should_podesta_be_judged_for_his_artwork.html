       Oh shillies shillies. Come and play. We just want to know who you are and why you think pedophilia-related art work is a fine lifestyle of a person very closely connected to someone who was pretty close to becoming a president of the USA due to brainwashed authoritarians and deep state MSM control.

       I'm basically implying there's no fucking justification for it. If he wants to enjoy that lifestyle on his own time without hurting anyone I'm fine with that. But not while running the country. If anyone doesn't see a problem with that, then why not?

       So do we now only trust people with pictures of Jesus on their walls? I like serial killers and have pictures of them, doesn't mean I'm a serial killer. This whole art thing is the last straw before giving up completely on pizzagate. When the best evidence you have is artwork the next thing you'll criticize is why he won't talk about not being crazy.

       Serial killer genre nonfiction has a huge share of the market in the publishing world. The appetite for podcasts about serial killers is huge: My Favorite Murderer, Sword and Scale, Criminal and so many more. It's pretty goddam common. 
So, no, it's not weird, dude. It's as American as apple pie.

       I'll bite.  you are suggesting that we make it illegal for certain types of art to be owned by all citizens?  Or maybe just citizens "connected to someone pretty close to being a president of the USA"?

       It is illegal to own certain types of art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although if we want to be precise it's illegal to own certain types of pornography. Pornography being nothing more than art that the people in charge decided is not art.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Podesta's art should be rebranded pornography and banned, but I think it's too close to be ignored considering his position of power.

       Hey just look up his emails on Wikileaks but I doubt you'll do it or you'll find a way to twist his words so I'll assign something simpler. Just look up his Instagram photos that he deleted since but could be easily found through a search. Frankly I don't want to see them again because I don't want to vomit again.

       Without getting into the conspiracies that hold the most weight any conspiracy has ever held, even with putting that aside, when we look into his artwork and lifestyle with quickly come to realize he is perverted in the sickest ways imaginable. Therefore they are creeps. Kind of seems like an easy concept to me but then again maybe not everyone has a healthy clean mind so I cannot relate to those.

       So you can't provide any actual examples other than you are creeped out by certain art?  Doesn't that reflect more on you as not being able to view art you find troubling in a mature way and try to interpret the intent of the artist?

       There is absolutely not an agenda to promote pedophelia. No one thinks that unless they are not exposed to other people on a daily basis. People find pedophiles disgusting which is why they accuse people they don't agree with as being pedophiles with no evidence.

       Provide sources. Even people in the south who used to believe dating underage girls was acceptable are now going out of their way to condemn that behavior. That is clear evidence that people are not promoting a pedophelic agenda. Additionally, people recognizing pedophelia as a mental disorder and wanted to treat those afflicted before they commit crimes are not condoning or accepting of the behavior, they are trying to prevent it.

       Russia has a massive problem with pedophelia and their porn industry is disturbing. I don't watch YouTube videos because they are terribly sourced but I live in the real world and interact with many people every day and I can tell you that pedophelia is not becoming normalized in any way. If you know anyone who thinks it is becoming normal it is most likely because you are associating with people who see young girls or boys in a sexual way. You seeing paintings of fully clothed children as pedophelic is evidence that you may need help yourself.

       Yes there is a sexual aspect to them. The way you worded that I find them sexual was a little bit of weird though and I don't think it has the same meaning.

       There's nothing sexual about them, they are paintings.

       You are imposing sexual thoughts onto these paintings.

       You are sexualising children, not Podesta, not Alefantis, not Hillary Clinton. You are the one adding sex to those paintings.

       Which ones? Yesterday you thought it was John Podesta who had an Instagram so I'm not confident you know what was on James' IG. More likely you're going to link me to one of his friends IG account, if you reply at all of course!

       Tell me about who your friends are and it will tell me about your character. Creeps roll with creeps. Also a creep wouldn't recognize another creeps creepy behavior and will do anything to protect them.

       I see a bunch of photos and stare by two that are not weird at all saying that they were bought by someone you probably don't like. These painting are normal but for some reason you are finding them sexual which is disturbing.

       Which parts of the article do you disagree with? This is beyond just one photo it's when you put the whole picture together. I mean if there was no other connections at all and podesta happens to have maybe this one painting then it wouldn't have been such a cause for alarm you know  But because of all the other connections then it starts to raise question about his preferences.

       There's a resemblance but I know the artist's intent was to show the arch of hysteria which is the statue's namesake and she never mentioned the Dahmer photo having anything to do with it.

       Again maybe if it was just one statue and all of the other things weren't considered in the big picture we can probably obviously let it slide but there's a mountain of weird creepy connections so that makes the resemblance to the serial killer much more plausible.

       Not to me. The artist had no reason to hide her inspiration for the statue. She told the model used to make it that it was inspired by the arch the body makes while in hysteria which had been studied by phsychologists since the 28th century.

       It sounds like you are looking at paintings of children lying in the grass or sitting somewhere and you are finding them to be of a sexual nature where most people just find them to be art. Is it possible that you are repulsed by your own attraction to the children depicted? You are the one seeing them in a sexual nature, the Podestas have never described children this way.

       Very alarming.  If you only see children laying in the grass then you're well I don't know what to call you. But I don't want to speak to you anymore.

       Because you just pointed out that the two paintings he owned are not sexual in nature but you find them sexual in some way. You are the one who needs help. The podestas never brought up any kind of sexual nature in those photos, you did!!

       And? He doesn't own those, he chose the paintings of clothed children. Even if he were to choose those paintings, you refuse to research the artist's intent where I'm guessing he has.

       Without getting into the conspiracies that hold the most weight any conspiracy has ever held, even with putting that aside, when we look into his artwork and lifestyle we quickly come to realize he is perverted in the sickest ways imaginable. Therefore they are creeps. Kind of seems like an easy concept to me but then again maybe not everyone has a healthy clean mind so I cannot relate to those.

       Oh, and remember A Serbian Film, a movie about a cartel that tricks a porn star into fucking his unconscious 6 year old son and features a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9XYURcmtzA">
        baby rape scene
       </a>
       . "It's newborn porn!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is anyone claiming the makers of A Serbian Film are trying to run a child rape syndicate or do we just accept they were trying to push the boundaries as artist of their field?

       Some artwork is highly suspicious, like ones by Margi Geerlinks. From the discription of her artwork; "She portrays the ageing process by commenting on the ways modern society tries to slow that same process down." Her work features a lot of photos of naked young children and teenagers. Podesta is known to own some of those.

       TMOR are very creepy people. I know it. You know it. They know it. Everybody knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They get together and defend pedophila. How creepy is that? what's scarier is that reddit caters to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit admins love when TMOR creeps abuse good people yet they claim they take harassment seriously. What a joke. It's all coming to an end soon guys.

       Think of the Sistine Chapel or the statue of David and compare it to Podesta's choice of art, one elevates, one corrupts.

       Stop trying to deflect. The constitution does not protects child pornography or obscenity. A case could certainly be made that Molesta's "art" falls into those categories.

       It's fine if you feel that way but no one will ever take you seriously with that kind of attitude. That's up to you to deal with though, good luck!

       There is absolutely not an agenda to promote pedophelia. No one thinks that unless they are not exposed to other people on a daily basis. People find pedophiles disgusting which is why they accuse people they don't agree with as being pedophiles with no evidence.

       Russia has a massive problem with pedophelia and their porn industry is disturbing. I don't watch YouTube videos because they are terribly sourced but I live in the real world and interact with many people every day and I can tell you that pedophelia is not becoming normalized in any way. If you know anyone who thinks it is becoming normal it is most likely because you are associating with people who see young girls or boys in a sexual way. You seeing paintings of fully clothed children as pedophelic is evidence that you may need help yourself.

       No, do your own research on the subject and maybe you will have a better understanding of it.
