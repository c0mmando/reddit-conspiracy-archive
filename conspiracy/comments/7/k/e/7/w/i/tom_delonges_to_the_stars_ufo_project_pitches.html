       Of course, he should get paid as an owner of the company if it's profitable, but that's not what we're talking about. He's getting a guaranteed $100k/year starting on Day 1, and they plainly admit they have zero revenue and effectively zero revenue prospects.

       This is the new Podesta narrative...this narrative will start slowly building steam and MSM will start announcing small reports about unidentifiable objects around the world appearing or being found after being hidden away for so long.  All, just to distract and change the narrative from the massive crimes the deep state has been perpetrating against the citizens of the world...not just America!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  To explain the soon-to-be-exposed existence of major technologies and medical cures that have been hidden from us by the elite cabal for almost a century!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch the news.  More and more about aliens being found or hidden away will be reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aliens?  Because the elite think this will explain all the "new" technologies that will become public soon.  They want us to believe the aliens brought us this technology.  Because the public will want to lynch all elites once we find out they had cures to diseases our families died from too young, that they could generate power without petroleum products etc... so they want us to believe that aliens has brought the “new” technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait for it...the shock will not come soon, but a slow drip so it does not cause mobs out for lynching.  But don't be distracted.

       you shouldn't outright deny what is going on with the disclosures, but instead be more cautious and see what is presented. You can choose to believe it or not, but trying to convince other people they shouldn't believe anything is ridiculous..

       I didn't initially deny, but then I looked into the facts. What motivation does John Podesta have, and is it likely that it's in anyone's best interest other than his own, given his history? Delonge is right at the point of his career where he's running out of money. Then he pops up and begs for donations to some humanitarian cause. These things can't be overlooked.

       Or sometimes the simplest answers are the most inaccurate. Only time will reveal their true intentions. I'm not saying quit believing they tie together and hold malicious intent but instead quit preaching as if the information you're trying to communicate is undeniably true. Look at how you started your sentence in the comment I initially replied to. Let it play out, and like anything in the world we should be wary of what is presented to us.

       I think you are right, especially when the Mueller investigation/Awan scandal/pedo stuff all converges into a single mother of all scandals. They will need something of massive proportion to cover it. And I do mean massive.

The who, how &amp; why of the JFK assassination. Taken from an historical perspective starting around world war 1 leading to present day. We hope after watching this video you will know more about what happened in the past and how the world is run today.

       Not defending Tom, but why are people bringing up his 100K compensation like that's even remotely compelling? 100K is nothing to him. He could blow that in one night or partying and not even notice.

       They were nominated for a Grammy this year lol. They've done two HuGELY successful tours and Tom still owns blink, so even though Matt is doing his job, Tom still gets paid for all of it. Blink is still pretty relevant , considering.
