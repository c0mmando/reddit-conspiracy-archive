    <div class="md"><p>When you say government, you mean the trump administration right? Not congress, the GOP, DNC, media and Soros organiztions who want to keep net &#39;neutrality&#39;? Is this just a rare occasion where the political parties, media and shadow govt are correct and sincere in their policy decision? Seems counter-intuitive to think a policy of the Obama administration will actually protect the internet since he&#39;s the one who passed ndaa. The social media companies that are pro net neutrality censor and manipulate algorithms on their own platforms. Should I really believe they are on the right side of this issue? Honest questions. Be nice I&#39;m just trying to understand the issue without sarcasm and being called names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beyond the conspiracy focused perspective of Obama weaponizing the FCC in preparation for speech control, it comes down to regulation and the future. 20 years ago I set up a CLEC and built out a residential offering across 60 cities. We ran fiber, colo&#39;ed DSLAMs, routed packets, and anything else required. </p>

<p>I was able to do that due to deregulation provided by the act of 1996, but the colo provision was removed later by the Supreme Court. We had enough fiber of our own at that point that it didn&#39;t matter but I couldn&#39;t do it again today. </p>

<p>Building networks is really easy these days. Most anyone can do it and I would love to see folks offering internet to their neighborhoods and the revival of local ISPs again. But even if there was even deregulation to bring back competition again, how does an ISP differentiate itself? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re google and you want to have an option to offer an ad-supported gig-link for $20 a month. Would you buy that? Maybe not, but I bet someone would. But we&#39;re still talking about the past; the future is not about the wire to your house, it&#39;s wireless.</p>

<p>Pai has been working to open up enough spectrum to support nationwide multi-gig wireless since 2012. Let&#39;s say folks figure out that putting a wireless network isn&#39;t too tough - how do you think 400 pages (320 actually since the last 80 is Pai trashing the first 320) of Title II is going to impact these sorts of businesses?</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;re to wireless, let&#39;s get to the real ISP&#39;s, cellular companies. If Verizon goes and makes a deal with Facebook to and announces that Facebook data doesn&#39;t count against my data plan, I see that as a win all around. Verizon wins by making Facebook pay them, Facebook wins by getting a stronger hold on its user base, I win because now I can get a smaller data plan for my wife. The only potential loser is the next Facebook but the next FB is going to be compelling enough that people won&#39;t be worried about their data plans. </p>

<p>Take it a step further, it makes sense for Netflix and others to work similar deals and at some point the entire model could shift to free Internet for everyone. Companies are already selling your data so they might as well pick up the tab to get your data onto the Internet. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the &quot;1% problem&quot;. With an ISP, you&#39;re going to have a very small number of users that are using 100x the traffic of a normal user. Should an ISP have the option to apply QOS to the traffic to ensure that the voice packets are going to pushed before the torrent data?</p>

<p>It&#39;s way too early in the life of the Internet for the Government to get involved and start making rules. We have yet to see it&#39;s final form. </p>
