       Jesus, I swear the most delusional ones are those who claim every mass shooting is a false flag because they're also the kinds of nutjobs who own guns and want everyone to carry one because of an outdated Second Amendment that they don't even fully understand, despite claiming it every time the topic of gun ownership comes up.

       I believe the 2nd amendment would be more useful if we had a completely separate People’s Militia. Like an additional national guard, but with tighter restrictions on where they can deploy, as to stop racist white mobs from organizing against black people in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would give Americans a sense of unity, a way to come together and for sure that Your community is there for you. If the federal government went overtly rogue, if the police force openly lynches blacks, if the army kills citizens at home, we’d have a local force against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if we needed to protest without the police trying to disrupt it, we’d have an organized deterrent. And yes, deterrents work, that’s literally the foundation of our foreign policy. Deterrence via hegemony. Hence hanging a people’s militia.

       Well, I know this is late but wow. Ya had me up to here, then went completely off the deep end.  I support everyone having a gatling gun strapped around them, and also a people's militia. Because that's (clearly) how the 2nd amendment was intended

       The government would love to take all our guns away so they can control us more easily. I'd say the 2nd amendment is even more relevant today. I think you are the one who doesn't fully understand.

       I doubt the government cares. The politicians would much rather have the NRA money in their pockets anyway. It's not like anyone has the balls to actually use their guns against the most powerful government in the history of the world. The militia types are all just talk because they aren't suicidal.

       They don’t need our guns to control us. They do that through the media and forcing us all into two political parties that they can pit against eachother. I also highly doubt anyone’s hobby custom AR is going to be able to do much against the entirety of the US army or Coast Guard. Even with our guns we don’t stand a chance.

       You’re also assuming that the entirety of the US armed services would agree to turn on their families and neighbors....sure, many would, but there would also be many defectors. I think if a full blown martial law scenario were attempted it would quickly become a multifaceted civil war.

       Police forces would be the first ones called in to enforce the 'rule of law'. And the kind of person who joins the police is a very different kind than the ones in the military, and are beholden to significantly less stringent rules of engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the differences between how police interacted with groups at the Dakota pipeline versus those who were armed at the Oregon Wildlife Refuge. A gun demands respect, and a bunch of people with guns would make anyone question if it is worth putting their life on the line to enforce whatever order was given from their superiors.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nobody at an assembly has guns to present a legitimate threat, police can do whatever they want, and the military would never get involved because the issue would be dealt with by domestic police.

       I would say yes in general but the important difference is that police are conditioned day in day out at their jobs to view the average American Citizen as a threat, meaning they would be much more willing to follow through on some bullshit order passed off as justification for a domestic power grab. Just look at the amount of police brutality and killing videos that are being uncovered now for proof of the direction local PD's are moving in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military on the other hand, I'm sure view coming back to US soil as a great stress relief. Their families are here and the enemy is back 'over there'. For police the enemy is here in America because that is what they are used to dealing with.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the situation ever got bad enough that people were in open combat with law enforcement trying to push through some bullshit legal justification for a power grab, I would much rather the military get involved as well instead of just the police.

       In my mind, those statements kind of contradict each other. There are
       <strong>
        billions and billions
       </strong>
       of dollars in Las Vegas. Bad publicity and lawsuits are something that these casinos
       <strong>
        with a ton of power [and money]
       </strong>
       can easily afford to sweep away.

       I think if you read it as "There are billions and billions of dollars
       <em>
        at stake
       </em>
       in Las Vegas" then I think it makes sense. If bad publicity could theoretically cost you billions of dollars in revenue, you are going to work as hard as you can to prevent that from happening.

       Occam's Razor needs to be used more often here. I agree that there is truth to many of our conspiracy theories in this sub, but it's being conveniently flushed down the drain with garbage that's either unprovable, or easily discredited with hard evidence.

       C’mon dude.  These aren’t the 911 calls.  These are the responders.   And this wasn’t exactly an official release, it was picked up over a police scanner.   You’re not hearing 911 calls here. Bad link.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not even saying the calls are gonna reveal anything but I swear every emergency as big as this has phone calls to 911 released within a week.  The lack of release is more suspicious to me than lack of video or picture

       Yeah ok pal.  What a load of crap. The whole world has seen photos of this guy's room with guns all over it.  The fact that they were "leaked" (yeah right) is irrelevant.  What difference does it make to show one screenshot of this guy on the elevator?

       This is essentially a press release for Tom Delonge's company.  Podesta has been assisting Delonge et. al receive publicity using his media connections.  There was a Huffington Post piece that amounted to a press release for "To The Stars" prior to Delonge's opening volley of speeches, and opening up his investment program where you can invest.  This is all a cash-grab.

       I’m pretty sure the audio is not real. In fact it sounds a lot like Tom Delonge (as many others have pointed out) who is the guy who is pressing all of this.

       Either way, Naval Aviators do not talk like Bill and Ted over the com. Watch footage of actual naval air to air combat and tell me how many times you hear the word “dude”. Zero.

       I have a buddy that flies f-18's off of carriers, he's told me that the chatter is pretty common, especially between a co-pilot and pilot. They weren't in actual combat, so they weren't using brevity. Pilot/copilot are basically buddies who hang out in fighter jets.

       The target is being kept perfectly centered, i would expect it to be physically attached to the plane or camera. How would a fly on the lens or something like that look? Any way we can prove that's not the cause?

       The pilot was in a jet that was unarmed and was asked to engage the UFO. Maybe it was a prototype testing out some new technology. Knowing the pilot couldn’t get jumpy and blow the thing up might have been part of a test run.

       I've noticed a lot of people saying that new technology black projects could explain this. To create an aerial system that exhibits these properties would require rewriting our understanding of physics. Also if it were made of any materials we have it would be a molten pancake given the immense acceleration it shows.

       You know making jokes like that really is counterproductive. Takes away from the importance of what we are going through right now. Things are going south in general.

       Chicago recently requested UN troops to assist with the violence problems. The people in Chicago would literally be facing a foreign invasion and take over. Buy your extra ammo now if you need it.

       It was a county commissioner, not anyone that has even close to the power to make something like that happen. I can pretty much guarantee you that foreign troops will not be landing in Chicago anytime soon.

       I also thought it was funny that he's calling it a genocide. It's
       <em>
        at best
       </em>
       a self-perpetuating genocide as the overwhelming majority of the violence in Chicago is black on black.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S has a stupid amount of power in the U.N, nothing like that is going to happen without the U.S giving the OK which I highly doubt will happen with the current administration.

       Lol so a UFO event in international waters in the Pacific Ocean was aimed at focusing on 1 of the 196 countries in the world (USA) and then sub aimed at 1 of the 50 states in that country (Illinois) and then sub-sub aimed at being about a random city (Chicago) within that state that seemingly requires police assistance.

       No living suspect means no trial. Seems to be the best way keep evidence buried. No trial usually means no truth. We have to believe we are told without any chance of evidence.

       My guess is Mandaly Bay's mishandling of the shooting of the security guard has them hanging on to the footage for dear life. They won't let it go to anyone who doesn't have a subpoena.

       Im thinking he means videos more of the shooter inside the hotel and around the vicinity of the claimed shooting nest which hasn't really been released despite having so many cameras available on a casino. Kinda like the pentagon plane attack, when that casino was robbed around the same time police released photos instantly iirc.

       It gives an opening to see if the hotel "could have" done anything to prevent the incident. If they could have but did not... it could look bad on the hotel. I'm just speculating.

       Sure it could look bad, but again that does not give any reason for everyone to sue them. Which is the main reason why they won't realease the footage, in the mainstream narrative (bullshit).

       Seriously man? This is American. Any Joe Blowhard either at the Hotel or in the music concert crowd will jump at the chance to scrap a couple $$$ grand from Mandalay. The insurance company would be paying out, but still, it's the insurance company's dollar and they'd risk losing their coverage if they do unlawyerly dumb shit like needlessly release video footage that opens them up to lawsuits.

       This still doesn't help them in a hypothetical lawsuit. Either they are already getting sued, rightfully so. Or they are not and revealing a grainy image of paddock in the lobby would not increase the amount of lawsuits. It lacks logic altogether. Just like the whole moon landing has to be real, because it would be too expensive to fake nonsense.

       Right now Mandalay Bay isn't the one making the claims about Paddock. It's the FBI, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's say that someone who stayed at the Hotel in either the rooms above or below Paddock's room, decide that they're going to sue Mandalay Bay for trauma. They'll probably sue for damages in civil court stating that Mandalay Bay didn't do enough to prevent Paddock's actions...right? But see, Mandalay Bay hasn't exactly complied and isn't the one who made the accusation against Paddock, so essentially said plaintiff would have to argue their case by proving the FBI's story.
      </p>
      <p>
       At which point, my guess is that a lot of cases will be thrown out or negotiated to a small manageable sum that the insurance companies can live with.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, let's say that Mandalay Bay releases the footage like you say. The plaintiff just uses their video footage and argues from there. If they don't release the footage though, then there's a lot more hoops, hurdles and political territory you have to wade through just to get a couple grand. It'll still happen, as you say, but it just won't be a floodgate of lawsuits instead of the handful of legally well-connected Americans.

       They would have to prove that they didn't do enough to stop paddock. How would releasing any footage of him help that front at all? Unless they released a video of the front desk handing him loaded rifles, I think this is just really silly misdirection.

       But if the video exists, they have that opening regardless of whether or not the public gets to see it. It’s not like MGM will be able to withhold it from a trial or from police or lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video will be analyzed sooner or later. The only reason to withhold it from the public is because of speculation that some imaginary tourist will pick a different hotel for their upcoming Vegas trip, which MGM could easily mitigate by discounting the room by $20.

       1800 security cameras at the hotel, not 1 second of footage has been released of Paddock in the hotel. Considering how much hardware was in his room it's understandable questions are being asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here try to excuse it by the hotel not wanting to release it, which is obvious. However the police/FBI obviously has all of it and it's usually them or council who release videos. Lawyers representing people who are suing the hotel are meeting resistance from the police.

       So, at least there is 100% a conspiracy to protect the hotel from damages. That part is not even up for debate at this point. It's obvious.

       They (they plaintiffs lawyers) know they are jeopardizing a large payoff pre trial if they release anything now.  The casinos would like this to quietly disappear in time, I'm willing to bet that there are nda's being discussed to keep these videos from reaching the public.

       Well you don't get full disclosure of a bunch of cases. Get over it. You'll never see the inside of Sandy Hook. You'll never see the Pulse nightclub images and video. There's never been this right to see everything about a crime scene so I don't know what you're expecting. I just if you think Mandalay Bay and the local police department and the federal government are all conspiring together to keep some truth from us that you're dumb as can be.

       We'll never see the victims in those cases but Sandy hook actually had a whole report of the photo evidence and layout of the attack. Just none of victims which I absolutely agree with. I don't want to see him in the act... I just want to see more than one picture than the one with his eyes closed and cctv footage of the preparation through a public place would put a lot of skepticism to rest.

       Except for this fact that there's no real reason to be skeptical of three independent agencies claiming it was him. Demanding that Mandalay Bay should release any footage they might have to "stop conspiracy theorists" is like demanding the government prove the Earth isn't flat. Not like releasing CCTV would even stop these stupid ideas from proliferating. They'd just claim something stupid like it was made on a stage by the secret government that controls all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts just speak for themselves. If you genuinely think the employees of Mandalay Bay or Las Vegas PD would go along with a mass shooting of their friends and family, you clearly don't know much about how the real world works.

       Haha, bullshit. Name all ten... If indeed ten are (they aren't) then it would discredit your 'random crime' statement. Random crimes don't require 10+ agencies... I do love the bullshit. It vaguely reminds me of a certain other 17 agencies agree talking point... Do you remember that one? Whatever happened with that one?

       I don't care what you think happened, what else went on at that time. It may have been a false flag, I don't know, and that exact shoddiness of the evidence is why I'm refusing to take it as evidence of anything in particular.

       The first few hours after the incident were pure comedy. 100s of posts about "religion of peace" , "jihadi Muslims"  and bunch of stuff like ... comments asking to deport them and pro gun comments.

       Cause psycho white dudes shooting up people because they feel like they "need to make a statement" has been totally rare these past few years. What's funny too is a lot of the false flag claims are due to people thinking the gov wants to take away people's guns. That never happens, but yet still anytime it's a white guy shooter the attack was a false flag to you lot

       It's harder to explain why a well off middle aged white man would kill anyone, let alone perpetrate an attack like this. It's easy to see why a Muslim would do something like this, because Muslims have an extensive history of this exact type of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a twenty something white guy, you'd have your little gotcha moment, but this attack defies all logic and stunk even before we knew the identity of the alleged shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is unimportant though, because a couple of people don't speak for the entire sub.

       I don’t get this comment, you’re the second to make it that’s I’ve seen. This community generally believes that many incidents that’ve been blamed on muslims were actually false flags, most notably 9/11.

       If the hotel has no legal obligation to release the tapes to the
       <em>
        public
       </em>
       , then they won't - not even a shred. It's bad ongoing publicity and imagery, and it opens them to lawsuits.

       If you can show that they won't even release tapes to law enforcement, then we have an issue. But I assume they have.

       I'm saying it isn't a publicity issue obviously because that makes no sense.  If they were to illustrate to the public it was a lone unstable nutcase that would put the incident to rest altogether.  The photos are already out there.  The whole incident is flagrantly being covered up and it isn't about bad publicity.

       Photos of a psycho gunman who murdered untold scores of people in your hallways, on your elevators, and rummaging around the Casino floors puts a bad taste in my mouth when perhaps I'm choosing between 5-7 very similar hotels in the same location for the perfect vacation getaway. It most certainly a PR thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most importantly - as I mentioned - there is not a single good reason to release, so why would they? No benefit but a chance for risk. Any reputable legal team would lean on the side of caution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there isn't a conspiracy, I just think it's silly to get caught up on this aspect. It's a non-issue.

       Such an unusual nonsensical horrific event that we are being told was unexplained.  The public might be able to help out with something if they affirm any small details.  Can you imagine if the 3 photos we did see weren't "leaked?"  There are still only those 3 photos.  Would there be any increased pressure then to release visuals of this person?  This whole thing is unbelievable.

       But from the viewpoint of the Mandalay Bay they do not exist to rub the public's shoulders and play the part of detective to help everyone get closure on the tragedy. They exist solely and unequivocally to make as much money as humanly possible. Any competent legal/PR team would release as little photo documentation to the public as required by law. It's just smart business, period. Makes complete sense from a business point of view to be dark on any and all imagery.

       Sure but have to add that I'm sure the Mandalay Bay is coorporating fully with official investigation team, so business interests aren't interfering with that.

       You and I aren't investigators. We aren't owed anything, just as I can just walk into a police station and demand they give me whatever case file I ask them for.

       I mean ok, but the guy is dead and there is obviously not a threat to public safety anymore.  It was the worst mass shooting event in history, not really equivalent to just demanding records from some random case.   Kind of a special situation.  These are societal questions at this point.   We need to be asking what kind of society we want to have.  For me, to simply sweep all this under the rug on such nonsensical massive crime is not congruent with my conception of liberty.

       Maybe they don't want to show how easy it apparently was to load a luggage cart or two with gun cases and nobody batted an eye because it's America. I mean, Vegas has shooting guns as a
       <em>
        notable tourist attraction
       </em>
       , there's conventions and expos in that town every single week and I'm sure more than a couple involve the arms industry. Maybe releasing footage of a bored, psychotic upper-middle class boomer pulling a hyperviolent Michael Douglas in Falling Down would be unsafe on an irrational, impressionable and increasingly economically unsecured American public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get what questioning this lack of footage hopes to accomplish. Keep the debate away from guns? I'm not saying he wasn't a rogue asset giving some bad salt, but withholding hotel cctv footage seems like a pretty petty thing to pursue if that's the story you want to believe.

       I think they've been watching and mirroring tech from above for a long time, and they don't want us following suit. I saw something years ago that I'm pretty certain was military/Black ops, but technology wise was definitely out of this world. Granted, it flew overhead and left so I didn't have a chance to see who was piloting it ;-)

       If that was going to dissuade someone from staying at that hotel, wouldn’t it dissuade them from staying at any hotel? Because the video that would trigger this supposed mass psychological trauma would resemble ANY hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people make a decision where to stay based on either how much the room is or where it’s located with respect to what they want to do in town, NOT which crimes happened there in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       By that logic, nobody should want to even go to Vegas because of all the news stories about that mass shooting that happened there.

       And white guys have been doing mass shootings since guns first came to Europe. The University of Texas Tower Shooting was 1966. The first of the "modern" mass shooting was in Philly in 1949 committed by a white guy.

       I'm someone who thinks the UFO video is a joke.  Am I alone or does all the chatter in the video just seem too rehearsed?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a few vids in my time of military and I've never heard pilots speak so clearly for one, and two, speak to each other as if they're surf buddies from Maui.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why and how some people can think of all the project bluebeam.  A setup all too easily done with some choice "leaks" almost by people in the media and in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics, John fucking Podesta no less!  He's our guy for spearheading some amazing new look into UFO's all of a sudden?
      </p>
      <p>
       No fucking way this is not a setup.

       Of course there's no video footage from the casino, as others have stated, it's obvious why those haven't been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is why are the authorities not releasing the 911 tapes?

       Quoting that second article, "The Review-Journal submitted a petition Friday in Clark County District Court seeking 911 recordings and logs of the emergency calls the night of the shooting. More than a month after the newspaper asked for the public records, Las Vegas police have declined to turn them over, the petition says.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Review-Journal requested documents on Oct. 2 and we have received little to no response,” Keith Moyer, Review-Journal editor-in-chief, said Friday. “Other media outlets across the United States have encountered the same outcome and share the Review-Journal’s concern about what amounts to an information shutdown — thus these actions, in an effort to help the public understand more about this historically horrible event.”

        thread
       </a>
       asking for visual (photo or video) evidence of shots actually being fired on the scene, including bullet damage, gunshot wounds, or medical activity. The only thing that even came close was a photo I call "girl with blood on leg."
      </p>
      <p>
       No shots were fired in Vegas. I love saying this and getting downvoted because it shows that instead of evidence, there is only impotent rage and frantic shilling.

       The Las Vegas shooting happened. Just because you didn’t watch people die doesn’t mean that they never existed. TBH that would suck if that happened to me, I died in a mass shooting and suddenly people are saying that I never existed.

       Except for this fact that there's no real reason to be skeptical of three independent agencies claiming it was him. Demanding that Mandalay Bay should release any footage they might have to "stop conspiracy theorists" is like demanding the government prove the Earth isn't flat. Not like releasing CCTV would even stop these stupid ideas from proliferating. They'd just claim something stupid like it was made on a stage by the secret government that controls all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts just speak for themselves. If you genuinely think the employees of Mandalay Bay or Las Vegas PD would go along with a mass shooting of their friends and family, you clearly don't know much about how the real world works.
