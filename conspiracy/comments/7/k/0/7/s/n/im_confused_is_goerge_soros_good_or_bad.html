    <div class="md"><p>It is pretty hard to google. It is buried under &quot;debunked&quot; msm stories, and marginalized as a right wing conspiracy theory. Here is an article I found, and I do believe they are a right leaning publication, but you aren&#39;t going to find this story on MSM.</p>

<p>Bonus relevant story: Bill Gates slipping contraceptives to people in Africa advertised as vaccines. But I can&#39;t find anything good on that haha. There is a snopes at the very top of the results disputing it though!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Soros promoted that messy kind of democracy where everyone has to argue with each other then together make choices. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn&#39;t support democracy at all. He&#39;s literally been implicated in subverting how many country&#39;s elections so far? Now he may &quot;advocate&quot; for political issues and organizations that attempt to brand themselves as &quot;pro-democracy&quot;, but it&#39;s only because he knows that he has the kind of mass media apparatus that is capable of swinging any election through sustained propaganda campaigns and the destruction of independent media. What difference is there between tyranny and Soros&#39; brand of democracy, considering democratic principles originated from the recognition that the greatest threat to freedom of mankind is consolidation of power in the hands of but a few men. Soros uses his echo chamber to reinforce his right wing authoritarian ethos on financially dependent moderate left wing organizations and their supporters.  He views the poor and the middle class as nothing but children, who must be nudged, shamed, and coerced, into doing as their told, and in his private correspondences, as seen in an attachment in the Podesta leaks, he even acknowledges that his political ideology is what he calls &quot;paternal libertarianism&quot;, where the wealthy elites as our &quot;parents&quot; hold the real power, rights, freedoms, and protections while serving as benevolent lords and arbitrators for us lowly disagreeable plebs. The kind of democracy he favors is not a democracy. It&#39;s an aristorcratic corporatocracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to answer. He single-handedly damaged the British pound and the Asian economy which created the Asian crisis. He then said on 60minutes that it&#39;s not his problem, he just plays by the rules. If you&#39;re not happy with the way he does things, change the rules.</p>

<p>This is a great line because he spent the last two decades creating NGOs with the only goal to create social pressure to change laws to his advantage.</p>

<p>So no, he isn&#39;t good. He does everything for himself, no matter how good it looks. </p>
