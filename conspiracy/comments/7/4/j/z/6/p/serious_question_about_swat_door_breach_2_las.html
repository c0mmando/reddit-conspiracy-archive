       So the story is SWAT breached the main double door to 32-135 after 72 minutes and moved into the suite to find the suspect DOA from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  They then swept the room and were unable to gain access to the other door, so shortly after performed a second breach from INSIDE 32-135 to gain access to the second adjoining  room 32-134, which Paddock has also rented to search for an additional shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my issue.  Those adjoining room options always have two doors, one that locks from each side in case there is a different guest staying in them.  Why would SWAT say they needed to explosive breach the second door because they couldnt gain access to that room?  That would mean it was locked from the inside, which would be impossible for Paddock, being he was down in the main suite.  There was a second broken window, and shots fired, from that second suite so how was it locked from the inside?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: floorplan layout of the vista suite shows at least one adjoining door opens INWARD to 32135 at minimum.  That further indicates there was no way for the shooter to lock the door to the next room.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2:  Here is a video, showing connecting rooms in the Mandalay Bay.  Shows there are 2 doors, one opening into each room, that DEADBOLTS FROM THE INSIDE of that room.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: here is a floorplan showing the second broken window and shot location was indeed behind the ajoining room, 32135 and not both in the main suite area:
       <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937-facebookJumbo-v18.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 4:  whats the deal with the guest claiming he was staying in 32-134, the same room which had a broken window and shots fired that adjoined the main suite?  Is this just bad tabloid reporting and the guy was mistaken about his room number?
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock-gunman-hotel-mandalay-bay-man-staying-next-door-a7978696.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 5: quotes from police scanner after the first breach "control, zebra-20.  we are clearing this room, we have one suspect down."  Then several minutes later,  "zebra-20, we have an explosive breach going off into an adjoining room, thats where we are in the suite.  The breach is going off in about 5 seconds." Shortly later, "control, zebra-20.  We've got the eastern room secure, we've got one suspect down, multiple firearms, this is definitely the location they were firing into the crowd."
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 6: VERY INTERESTING TIDBIT AT THE END OF THE VIDEO: The official story is none of the SWAT officers fired during hte breach and sweep of the room, but zebra-20 reports otherwise "We don't need anybody else up on this floor, break.  This floor is clear, it has cleared by swat team with two breaches, we did have one SWAT officer that did fire, we have negative injuries on anybody else.  We have multiple firearms up here, from where they were shooting out of, but we just have one suspect down at this time."  He then gets called over to the SWAT 1 channel, to get him off the public channel.  Thats the last we hear of zebra-20.  Time linked video below.

       it made it through, but at one point it had been seen by 75 people with 20% upvoted, which made me ask the question.  You will see this was asked very early on in the thread and I was legitimately wondering why I got so many downvotes without any comments or critiques.

       I made a recent speculative post and it had 3 downvotes the SECOND I posted it. It's not an issue of downvotes from people that disagree, it's obvious there are bots downvoting keywords in new posts as soon as they go up.

       Can they restrict voting based on certain accounts downvote/comment activity?

       There are some obvious shill/shariatrolls that I've been recognizing without RES, I'd imagine mod tools could be a bit more effective than my naked eye.

       . . .if you get enough downvotes your comment is collapsed and most people might not see it and if they do might not click it and if they do might automatically discredit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a common tactic these days is downvoting top level comment where further down is a good discussion. Happens a lot on the news and world news boards where the only deep discussion is further down on a collapsed comment.

       There's a shill/bot team here downvoting anything that explores anything outside of a specific narrative that's being formed.

       Exploring the possibility of multiple shooters is one of the things that will get you donwvoted.

       Ive seen anything that mentions predictive programming get shot down way quicker than it usually would on this sub. For example I thought this thread was interesting it really surprised me how little interest in garnered on r/conspiracy. Same thing happened to my predictive programming thread I posted yesterday got a LOT of downvotes

       Well, it was an hour after he was shooting, he could have definitely locked it so they couldn't get in that room without him knowing and then having easy access to his room.

       I've thought about this as well. My thoughts are that there were two shooters. One at each window. Stephens accomplice shoots him in the back and makes it look like a self inflicted wound. Can someone show the floor plan photo and where Stephen was found laying? Is the adjoining room to the right of him or left of him? If it's to the right then the second shooter definitely shot him in the back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second shooter goes into second room and locks the door and escapes. Furthermore conspiracy...he escapes thru the window and that's why after the shots, the kids in that video saw glass falling from the street level outside of Mandalay Bay. The shooter goes to the Four Seasons above the 32nd floor (which is claimed to be owned by the Saudi.)
      </p>
      <p>
       These are my speculations. Hope someone has thought this too...

       Yes that's true. But once the shooting started don't you think everyone went inside to try and stay safe?? Because if not then where are the videos??? There were people recording from the foundation room while the shooting happened but nobody stayed long enough to see more???

       Wouldn't they be able to tell the difference between a suicide and a murder? I'm sure with the 'no motive' and everything else the first thing they assumed was a setup/another person.

       Why would they look into it further when they just are going to go with the narrative? The investigation is for the motive. It looks like a sheep, sounds like a sheep, must be a sheep. Or they (LVMPD) believe it was a setup and that's why we seee all these crumbs of bread being dropped through the press conferences etc.

       suicide has mussle flash burn, or some shit like that. Murder, from a couple of feet away, doesn't. they - the coroner - can tell the difference between a suicide and a murder.

       powder burns is the term you're looking for.  Also, if for some reason the shooter actually was setup in a situation like this, the person(s) who did it would probably be smart enough to simulate a suicide properly and not leave much evidence that it was anything but.

       what if there were two shooters... and a drugged Paddock laying on the bed?
      </p>
      <p>
       the two shooters go to town on the crowd. after the two shooters are finished they grab Paddock off the bed and hold the revolver in his mouth and pull the trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock is laid on the ground as if he had killed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two shooters exit into the adjoining room and lock the door as they leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police breach the room Paddock is laying dead in but they can't go into the next room because it's locked from the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooters escape while the Police fumble with entry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that we will NEVER be shown the footage of Paddock entering the casino. I bet he was smuggled in under duress or already unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my theory and prediction of the situation with regard to surveillance footage of Paddock. We will never be shown these images or video footage because it does not exist. None of it.

       What I want to know is why is Paddocks eyes wide open in the leaked photo? Like I haven't see many suicides--none actually. But I'd imagine that if someone was going to shoot themselves in the head that they'd close their eyes before pulling the trigger.

       I don't think anyone has said if he switched back and fourth between the rooms.  He very well could have started in the smaller room, then decided the suite was a better angle, went out the main door leaving the adjoining door locked to provide him extra safety, and entered the main suite and continued shooting from there.  There was a lot of down time between the bursts of shots.

       The only reason I THINK he was switching, if he was lone, is due to the changing of gunfire sounds in all those videos. Some of the shots seem very close, and some seem distant. I don’t know how much of the angle of the two windows play into the sound.

       Yes. This is pertinent. The audio samples showing that their is at least two sets of automatic gunfire going off around the same time together can only be dismissed on the premise that he was switching from one window to another relatively quickly. This is one of the sloppier jobs I've seen I must say.

       There were, like 60 minutes between last shots and the cops entering the room. He only had to lock one room from the inside and use the hallway
       <em>
        once
       </em>
       in that 60 mins, if he decided to  isolate himself in one room, after using both.

       I hope you're not seriously suggesting that a guy planning on killing himself after killing a bunch of people is going to lock the doors between two suites, go through a hallway (which he had monitored because he did not want cops to sneak up on him) back to the other suite room to then kill himself.  Why would he do this, just to fuck with the police?

       For someone who meticulously planned and carried out this heinous act, it seems way out of character. He surely wouldn't enter a hallway he was actively monitoring...especially after he hit a security guard. Ho Hum just expose myself to the police with guns.

       What makes you so sure that the adjoin doors both had dead bolts or could not be locked before they were closed?

       SWAT could have also used room keys but they chose to use explosives. Probably tactical move more than anything else.

       those doors always have two way locks to prevent someone from walking into your side if you are not sharing the adjoining rooms.  They need to have 2 way locks for privacy.  The reason I'm asking is they specifically stated they need to breach a second door because they cannot gain access to the room.  That could have only been locked from the inside.

       I am asking how do you know that the second door cannot be locked before it is closed? Like how you can lock yourself out of most doors. I.e. lock the lock and pull it closed and locked behind you.

       the only lock is the deadbolt, but you would have no way of opening the main handle latch, so youre right I suppose he could have just pulled the door shut while going through.  Still seems like a strange move, but not as daming

       They're going into a room occupied by someone who wants to kill people, the door could be booby trapped or there could have been a second shooter behind it.  No point in risking one of your own men to conventionally open a door when you can get a tactical element of surprise with an explosive breach.

       Now I'm not a Navy SEAL or anything but tactics take time and seven minutes goes by very quickly when they have to complete their sweep for explosives and report back with information and relay decisions up and down the chain of command before preparing a second charge and setting up positions for after the breach.

       Well I 2 thoughts. Tactical flow clearing the rooms, don’t want to intersect at the joining door.  Those doors can close behind you if you don’t prop them open. Second he probably dead bolted both hall room doors so master key card didn’t work or it was easier to break joining door. Seems to be the door pictured next to dining cart.

       It's possible it is their SOP, but I would think I'm a situation like this when they have explosive charges to breach the door they would just try to get up there as soon as possible. I could be wrong.

       Those doors don't have handles on both sides of the door... to protect the privacy of guests. It's possible, as someone else stated, he let the door close behind him and without a handle, it couldn't be opened from that suite. Which would require a door (either the from or adjoining one) to be breached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: I've stayed in hotels. And, in your YouTube clip, you can see the door doesn't have a handle on the inside of the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good theory though, I'll upvote.

       yes I wasn't thinking about the main handle latching, in my head I was focusing on the locking aspect.  Pulling the door closed behind you wouldn't technically "lock" it but you would just have no way of opening the handle latch.  Still seems strange for him to have pulled the door shut behind him, knowing he would have no way of returning to that room due to the security guard in the hallway.

       I agree, those doors are relatively heavy, and sometimes even come with doorstops.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is as planned as the official narrative suggests, he'd have the doors propped open. And there's no way, if he's going back and forth, he can even "accidentally" shut the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good thought process on this. Hopefully, one of the videos he recorded will shed some light.

       Maybe this is why he killed himself in spite of having a supposed get-away plan. He planned to exit via the second room but accidentally closed the door with no way to get back in. He chose to kill himself in a panic

       why would he be able to escape from the one room but not the other?  Would he assume all the cops would gather around just one of the doors, and he could sneak out into the hallway undetected?  That's insane.

       If it really just was him, I don't understand why he would ever intentionally close the doors between suites.  I just stayed in a hotel where we had the adjoining room and there was no automatic latch or whatever, you had to lock the door from the room you were in.  Its possible this hotel's adjoining rooms do have latches that close/lock automatically just from closing the door, so a cross breeze could potentially then cause the doors to be closed.  But if this isn't the case, then I do not see any plausible reason to explain how he locked the door and went to the other suite to then kill himself.

       I agree with you. What are the chances he accidentally closed the door on himself to seal his own death compared to
       <em>
        someone else
       </em>
       closing it? Especially with a lot of this narrative pointing towards an accomplice.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does get locked out from the door that he plans to escape from and shoots himself in a panic but maybe he didn't close the door

       I had that implausible non-theory in the back of my head too...I pictured him parachuting away from the small swat team on the 32nd floor, gracefully floating down onto the street flooded with dozens of police officers.

       I didn't say it would be a
       <em>

       plan.  The Sheriff didn't say that his plan to escape was a good one either, just that he had one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really see any other way out for him.  He had the stairwells barricaded, I think the elevators would be shut down, the room was in his name (or Girlfriends?) so he would most likely not have been able to escape through the hotel.  It seems his only escape route would have been through the windows.

       So the two broken windows were in separate rooms? Meaning this ‘second shooter’ theory is possible and that he got away via room 2’s main door.  Don’t most hotels keep a log of when a door is open and closed?
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possible occurrence could be, that the ‘unknown shooter’ could have been the one to shoot Paddock prior to the shooting occurring and prior to the windows being broken. This might explain the reason for the rifle being on top of Paddocks left leg in the crime scene pictures as well as the lack of strength in terms of breaking the 800 lb windows.

       no log would be kept between adjoining doors opening and closing, but the second room spills right out into the main hallway next to the main rooms door, so there would really be no escaping from there unless they left well before the security guard arrived.

       Yeah I know it's a stretch ha, but you are assuming that guests/security guard we're just standing in the hall for long periods of time. This could be one his reasoning for the camera set up? Also, he may have started from 134, then moved to 135 once his ammo ran out there? Like I said, long stretch, just trying to check all possibilities

       worth noting that the room service cart, holding his secretly placed surveilance cameras, would have been blocking his ingress/egress from the rooms into the hallway, so I doubt he would have done that when he could just go between rooms internally

       The sheriff stated that SWAT informed him that there would have been an opportunity where he could have slipped away between the shooting coming to a halt and then breaching the door via explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still doesn’t negate the fact of how the deadbolt, only accessible from the other room, was locked. Nor does it explain how the other rooms window was broken and fired shots out of.

       so its proven a deadbolt? so he would have had to locked it walked into the hallway exposing himself and then walked around to the other enterance of the room or is there just one main door from the hallway?

       two main hallway doors, one into the huge suite 32135, and one into the smaller bedroom 32134.  Each of those rooms had a broken window and firing position, and there was a set of two doors (two sandwiched singular doors, not a set of double doors) that both need to be opened from their respective sides to make the two rooms accessible to each other without going into the hallway.  Those doors are secured on each side by a deadbolt.

       Just to clarify so that means he would have to lock it on one side enter hallway re enter suite in opposite room lock that door too because assumedly they would just have unlocked the door from their side if that was the only side locked ?

       No, two rooms were rented/booked/comped (however you wanna put it) in his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each room has a door that has a deadbolt accessible only to the individual in said room. The door is opened by pulling toward you. Additionally each room has its own main door accessible only by key card.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes, in order for Paddock to lock the door: he would have had to close and lock the door and then proceed outside of the room and then back into the room where he was found in. This would not prove to be a smart decision on his behalf because, as you said, it would expose him.

       Everyone seems very certain that there were two doors. I believe we’re not being told everything, but every graphic of the hotel room layout does not show enough room to have two doors. Most of these hotel suite link doors are on a master key that a hotel employee unlocks if one party rents multiple rooms. Probably 4 out of 5 hotels I’ve stayed at have had 1 door between these rooms, either locked or unlocked depending on whether the party books both connected rooms or not. I have a big family who often rents out large potions of a hotel for reunions and similar family trips. It’s very possible there was just one door and people are assuming/extrapolating to believe there were multiple shooters based on their experience with specific hotels.

       Not unless #2 escaped out of broken window via rope to roof, chute or possibly when they breached #1 and went inside to clear #2 snuck out the door (unlikely), possibly left between when guard shot and when first police found guard who took them to room or #2 was the guard all along.

       nobody showed up in that close stairway until about 45 minutes after the shooting started, about 30 minutes after the security guard was shot.  So I guess its possible, but they said that stairway door was "secured" soomehow, preventing police from entering

       So, we know the suite door was ajar. We know the stairway was barricaded preventing it to be opened from the hallway (correct me if im wrong and it couldnt be opened from the stair well and was barricaded from the hallway side). There is also 15 min window you say the doors were unwatched. With that said (depending which side of stair door was barricaded) it is possible the accomplice was watching hallway, unloaded on the security guard. Security guard ran and then accomplice ran out the door, abandoning Paddock in the room alone. Accomplice heads into stairwell, barricades it to prevent Paddock from escaping, accomplice heads up stairs to 4 seasons room and waits it out. Paddock realizes hes been double crossed when he goes to the stairwell and door is barricaded and goes back to room, decides he is the patsy and will be taken into custody and writes the note and kills himself. Or accomplice shot Paddock prior to entering staircase. Seems plausible either way. Dunno

       No one ever said the second door was deadbolted. That's a detail you're completely fabricating based on dubious logic. There are many other reasons to conduct a door breach than a deadbolt.

       Very good observation! I dont see any logical explanation of this unless they have auto locks (never saw one in any hotel ive stayed at), he locked it and walked down the hallway back to the other room (no f..king way), or at least 1 other person is involved (which is what i believe).

       Also, if there was a second shooter in the other room, why would they keep that door closed? Wouldn't they need/want to communicate? Idk.

       not just that... locked from the other side... where the shooter was not found.
      </p>
      <p>
       so how is that possible? the shooter locked the door from the other side and then went through the hall to get to the room he was found dead in?

       Sorry if I missed anything you posted, but couldn't the case be that the door was just closed and not shut and they did an explosive breech anyway as a way to avoid Bobbie Traps.

       they dont say if it was ajar when SWAT got there, but it was when the security guard got there, and then Paddock opened fire on the guard through the door.  They breached the door specifically to see if they got a reaction from the shooter, to see if he was still there or had escaped to a different location

       I dunno man, from all the video I've seen, it seems there was a lot of time between shots being fired. Seems like he emptied a clip, then silence for a minute or two before he started firing again. If there were two people I would think there wouldn't be as much time between clips. Just my opinion though, I haven't seen all the videos.

       If the door was locked even from their side perhaps they breached it in case it was booby trapped or there was another person on the other side with a gun?

       well police were on the floor within i think 15 minutes, they waitied to breach because from the moment they arrived (after the security guard was shot) there were no more shots fired, so it turned into a barricaded suspect situation as opposed to active shooter

       i have serious questions if/why the main door was ajar to begin with.  but the story is they saw through the holes from the gunfire and saw an unaccompanied weapon on the floor so decided to do a breach, partly to see if the suspect responded with gunfire.  They talk about breaching the main door to get a response from the suspect in the police scanner audio.

       This is what i was thinking the whole time. The security gaurd killed paddock, shot up the concert. Then shot himself in the leg to make it look like paddock did it. Escaped in plain site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and paddock was an arms dealer to the underworld. This explains why he had the explosives and all those guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for the locations around the public was to have insurances that have the gun deals go sour, the American public would suffer.

       That's a good theory. I have thoughts very similar. But then I think about the hotel security cameras. I mean Vegas casinos have some of the best cameras! And the sheriff said he was going up all floors with the swat team or police and only got away from them for around 60 seconds when he got shot. So how could he have done this? So maybe he killed paddock and then went down stairs to play out the info we have received so far. Maybe he was super smart and rigged the cameras looking down the hall way from the suite for his escape plan (he did after all have access to them since hes a security guard). But it all comes down to seeing the cameras from the hotel to decide if he had anything to do with it or not. I'm hoping they release those.

       I'm guessing breaching a door is Alot safer if they didn't know if he was in the room And active. For all they knew he could of been stood at a blind spot and just open fired on swat.

       Can you explain why? The tiny explosion hardly even damaged that door. You've seen the photos of it. Swat had no real reason to rush in there. The gun fire had been over for almost an hour and they had the floor on lock down. Seems very unsafe. I get it if he was still shooting, go in guns blazing but no shots almost an hour... blow the door?? When it's already open??? And the security guard already had a key card for the cops to use cuz they were checking all the other rooms in the area, but didn't breach any others....

       i think a door exploding would still shock someone. Idk tho never seen one happen irl. If i was stephen and I knew a swat team was en route; I'd stop shooting. Go find a nice lil spot in the room to lie down, soon as that door opens I'm popping swat. Bet atleast one of em drops and the rest of them think twice about entering that room. Now I've shot and possibly killed 1 maybe more. Im guessing they've got to go with a minimum risk to officers in a situation. Although if that's the case, why not just flash bang the room

       Shock a guy with a tiny blast they just blew 100s of rounds... don't you see how silly that sounds. And if he had the peep hold camera like Lomardo said he coulda seen this blast coming. Flash woulda made way more sense since "200 rounds went thru the door.." just toss it in a Swiss cheese door. My theory is that the blast was to cover up something.

       Do we even know what type of explosive was used on the door? I imagine they had swat on rooftops looking in the windows.  Could have seen the guy laying dead on the ground.  I would think the door breach was to set off what ever explosives may have been rigged.

       The door wasn't swiss cheese in the photos I've seen.  I have a friend and relative that are in SWAT.  They teach standard explosive breaching techniques for hotel situations.   SWAT is pretty methodical especially in cities like Vegas.  The blast for hotel doors with indoor hinges requires a specific method.  The end result is the door being blown off.

       I get it I get it, in a certain circumstance, like if he was still shooting... but I  this circumstance there was no exigency to enter. He hadn't shot in over an hour. And no need to "breach" they had a security guard with a entry key. They had been checking all the rooms on the way to his, why not boom boom them all?

       I would breach it.  We also don't know if the card pad on the door worked after it had been riddled with bullets.  Breaching the other doors may not have been required after they went through the exercise of getting them out.

       They didn't use flash bangs. That's what I'm saying there is no reason to even go in. The shooting stopped, for over an hour. Why risk police lives. Send a robot in. The blast is covering something up. Why is the sheriff saying no police shot but zebra 20 says one shot was fired!

       It is a typical breach for hotels situations.

       For the sheriff comments - in that situation I would think verbal mistakes are made especially being out in the field and not on the internet watching videos.  The shot could be something but too soon to tell.

       He had cameras On the hall ways so why did he shoot himself while swat was ages out? He could of done it ALOT better. Also irrelevant if you've been shooting a gun or not your fucking door being blown off it's hinges would still be a 'shit' moment.

       This is still the source of a lot of heartburn for me. SWAT says they're using an explosive breach and you hear it over the radio. Then if you look at the crime scene picture of the door on it's side it seems very obvious that an explosive breach was not in fact used. Not only that, there doesn't appear to be anywhere near 200 rounds put through the door. Plus the overall security guard situation seems suspicious.

       You cannot really see the door in that video.  However the 12% side view blocking the entrance shows bullet holes.  The explosive could have been used on the hinge.  Hard to make a lot of speculation without having better view of everything.

       I thought hinges could be blown too but if you look at the other side of the door the hinges are internal, not external.

       Yeah but they probably used an explosive charge breach with a water bag.  Takes the door off completely.  I will edit once I find a link on what I'm talking about.

       Looks like they refer to it as a water bag charge... found this on youtube:

       Probably different levels of explosive but I imagine similar damage to door would be expected.

       They keep using those exact words active shooter to barricade situation. I get that entering the room was a safety situation but wouldn't you want to get in there asap? I mean who's to say he wasn't reloading and about to Shot more people out the window?? Unless they knew he was dead.

       I have maintained there would be no reason at all to knock out multiple windows with a single shooter. He would likely have all the guns/ammunition on the bed behind him for easy access. Not run to an entirely different room for a worse vantage-point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the need for security cameras if he had a handgun with the intent of suicide doesn’t add up. If he wanted to die they would have 10000% shot him upon entrance anyway so he wouldn’t have gone through the trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       The locked doors is an extremely big issue with me. There had to be another person involved to accomplish that.

       And if the security guard had the key pass for the rooms, and they were clearing everyone out, wouldn't they have already entered the adjoining room? Why would they have to breach the room if they had a key pass?

       But did they even try? Also him "clearing rooms" is really odd. He got shot and they didn't ask him questions about the interaction with him and the shooter. After when he was told to get medical help could've just walked off.

I bet pol could figure it out:

      <p>
       If fbi wants to dispel the notion of him being a gun runner :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         look into the guest logs as far back as possible of every time Steve stayed at a casino
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Verify those datess with video evidence and employee testimonials that he was always gambling - if he really was a high roller and he was well known enough to receive comps then it sod be easy to find employees, management and check in clerks that recognize him
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Release footage from his last stay and his previous stays, footage that only shows him and him alone or maybe with his gf entering and exiting the room.
Not any Isis or antifa or terrorist types...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Show us what's on the note
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Show us video footage of the night of shooting especially right before when a potential client couldve entered and when and where and how the police carried out the breach during the shooting as well as after to dispel the notion of additional bodies being removed so we can corroborate with police scanner.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Release this info NOW or ASAP so people can't claim that the footage was edited (removed, refilmed) and so that the employees, management, check in clerks, bag boys, bar tenders even the casino owner or higher ups don't have time to be pressures into lying or collaborating to fit the gambling narrative
I mean is that really too much to ask?

       I do believe it's been established there aren't cameras on the hotel floors in Vegas (so #3 isn't available nor is #5). Just FYI... not saying you don't have a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure it would be helpful to EVERYONE involved if this info was available. But, this makes me ask...HOW do they know there wasn't an accomplice (even if it wasn't a second shooter)?

      <p>
       If I was the shooter and I knew 2 adjoining rooms were connected by the doors (like you pointed out). I would reserve/book both rooms for the shooters "safety." On a busy weekend like that AND a plan to heinously murder innocent people I wouldn't want to take the risk that there's John McClane (fictional badass cop) on vacation in the next room that could potentially stop you once you started. Basically, you wouldn't want to take a risk of having a hero next door once you started your "business."
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: he did it for his own safety to make sure no one would interrupt him. He wouldn't have to check the room before starting because he knew no one would be in there because he have the key and he booked it.

       the point is that a window was broken and shots were taken from the second bedroom, so why was the adjoining door locked?

       I'm not paying close attention to any of this so maybe I don't have the right info but are you sure shots were fired from the second room? Says who? Breaching a room isn't the cleanest thing. Maybe the window broke during the breach and people are claiming that they swear it was broken before. Details become muddled after chaos like that. Unless you have video proof of him shooting from both windows it's hearsay only to fuel this conspiracy. But if it is true then it also fuels this conspiracy.

       Given the positioning of the windows relative to the building, I'd say it was chosen more for the field of vision than safety. I mean, could you be any more safe with 20+ guns in your room?!

       It's a risk reward thing. If you risk getting a single room then your neighbor could g gungho and try and stop you. He could have a conceal carry. Or you can spend another $200 and guarantee you have one less thing to worry about.

       But he didn't book it or even select it...independent UK says..."When Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino last week, he requested a room on a higher floor, but was told nothing was available. Then a room freed up and managers moved him to a 1,700sq ft suite on the 32nd floor. It lists for $590 a night. But as a big bettor, Paddock got it on the house."

       Wait was the 2 Windows really two separate suites ?
 I remember seeing a picture that was a pretty good view saying it was See! only 1 room post or article Idr which. When i looked at that picture there was one particular window that was to dark to see into and i thought maybe that was where an adjoining two rooms split.

       No, it was not two separate suites. The broken windows were both in the living area of the suite, one facing east, one northeast.

       No, I'm right. See the video tour of that exact suite that was posted by the guy who proposed to his girlfriend in it. And then look at the floor plan. Left is east, down is north. Broken windows are in East and Northeast windows, both in the living room area of the suite. Plus there is absolutely no information confirming he rented more than one room.

       one of those windows was directly above her while she was at the apex, the other put the entire building between her camera and the muzzle.  If you are familiar with firearms you would know how drastically different a report can sound by literally moving 1" in front or behind a barrel, so yes, putting and entire building between you and the report would change it significantly

       I haven't seen any evidence of shots fired from anywhere but those two windows, so "other room" would have to be the second adjoining room, 32-134.  Exiting that room to the stairway, which was secured shut by the shooter, would require being seen by PD and security int he hallway

       Right, but this hotel had multiple stairways. Additionally, people have come out as saying they left their rooms while (or very shortly after) the shooting was happening. They had to leave somehow. Couldn't someone just slipped in with that group?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just playing devils advocate and presenting all theories. Not for or against a second shooter at this point.

       If someone else shot him, would they have been able to shoot him through the mouth with a handgun?  Wouldn't they had to shoot him from a distance? Paddock was armed as well and I doubted he would have allowed himself to be killed so easily.

       I've looked at that picture a lot and I don't see any evidence of a head wound. It looks exactly what someone looks like if they are shot in the chest and the blood gargles out of their mouth and nose. There's no brain matter or skull fragments or anything at all that indicates there was a head wound.

       It could be that the first window he broke out was in the smaller room and he did so more completely.  Then he moved into the suite and broke out that window in more of a hurry.  If he only had 1 hammer and used that to break the windows, it is in the suite, which would support the idea that it was the second window broken.

       Link to the statement from the SWAT team statement?
      </p>
      <p>
       How to we know which is the "second door"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like where you are going with this, don't get me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think there might be a difference between "can't access the second door, and their training, which would not involve walking up to a second door and jiggling the handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       SWAT has a protocol, and it normally does not involve anything to do with a door, much less trying the handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       They place a charge, and blow it.  Stack 5+ bodies behind the blow to enter and take advantage of the momentary shock any occupants would experience.

       it was in the police radio scanner, because unit f-20 stayed with the swat team through the raid and reported in they needed to blow a second charge, AFTER they found and announced 1 subject DOA, because they couldnt access the other door.  I'll try to link  to the specific spot in the scanner audio in a bit.

       Since OP seems reluctant to share it, here is the audio where they breach the second room:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/1xAcTKNpDeY?t=1h16m53s">
        https://youtu.be/1xAcTKNpDeY?t=1h16m53s

      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, there's no indication that the door was locked or couldn't be accessed. OP seems to be making the assumption that it was solely because they used an explosive breach.

       Not saying this happened but, it would be possible for him to have gone into the 2nd room, lock the door then exit the room from the main entrance, got the hallway and back into the suite.  Its a possible explanation.

       There's no adjoining room involved, both broken windows are in the living area. The second breach was of the locked bedroom door, which you can see as a double door in the floor plan.

       From the press conference, I thought he explained the second breach as the locked bedroom. But at this point, if there are two rooms and they aren't admitting that, their second breach explanation is itself suspect.

       The press conference from yesterday, the same one where the "don't go there" whisper is heard. Now I want to go listen to it again.  I'm still puzzled why the people on the Foundation Room patio didn't see that east-facing window broken or having gunfire coming out of it.

       Because there were, at the time, reports of multiple shooters. They couldn't be sure he acted alone, and at the time a room that the mass murderer rented was inaccessible to them. They don't know if he has an accomplice, bombs, anything. Better question is why would they leave the door and just be like "Well, it's locked, so probably no reason to go in there"?

       I'd like to point out that hotels especially large casino hotels track literally everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hotel can very easily run a lock audit on that lock  of the 2nd room to see who if anyone and when has accessed that room.  They can then look at the change history of the reservation attached to that room to see keys made, keys swapped, key added etc.   could also use in conjunction with simple camera watching.  Basically what I'm saying is that hotel can figure out the second room question if they wish to or are forced to by fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 years in the industry is how I know this.

       I think it is known that paddock also had that room reserved, but there would be no log or ability to run a lock audit on the adjoining rooms because there is no electronics involved, they are just manual locks.

       Dude they should know exactly what happened and should be able to replay the entire fucking thing, at least on property. That's what's crazy; if there wasn't something off about it they could have easily laid out the whole thing after like 2 days of surveillance analysis. It's like the Dubai hit but way easier, it's supposedly one guy. Was there somebody with him those several days or not? Watch the footage from Mandalay at 8x normal speed backwards, you're done in a couple hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about his cell phone(s) data? We know he has one, his brother said they text. I feel like nobody has even mentioned that, it's the first thing you wanna hear about in most crimes.

       But you could clearly see how many key cards were issued and hen how many people went up to the rooms.  You should then be able to see how many ppl left the rooms.  I assume there are cameras in the hallways which would be the only way to enter the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless he hid a human in his luggage.  I then assume you could see a blur of a body escaping on camera as someone would have to then wheel 2nd shooter out via cart.

       It's quite possible he had the door open.  They usually don't automatically shut.  He broke out one window in the small room, then moved into 32-135 broke out the second window, and as soon as he did that the cross breeze blew the door shut, or at some point later it was blown shut.

       i thought about wind but usually those doors are heavy, and I don't think there would be much wind entering the room.  He also definately was firing back and forth throughout the event between windows, thats one of the reasons shots sound different in some videos (see taxi cab video)

       Remember that they are 32 floors up, and the wall of windows wrap around the corner of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the wind flows around the outside of the building you can have large pressure differentials between the two window locations.  Even a heavy door could be slammed shut but that airflow.  It doesn't take much pressure working on a large surface like a door to move it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at some of the exterior picture of the building showing the broken windows.  See the curtains being sucked out?

       he had at least one rifle that was the equivalent of a .308 caliber ar-10, different from the .223 ar-15 style rifles he was using.  he apparently took shots a the gas towers at the airport in an attempt to blow them up, so we could be hearing those singular shots, which sound different from the rapid fire .223 of the main attack.

       yup, thats the one I'm referencing.  It sounded pretty loud to be an interior room pistol shot 32 floors up.  My guess is those were single shots from a 308 rifle pointed out of the window at the gas tanks.

       the two breaches were 7 minutes apart from each other.  could be two seperate breach explosions on the main door, but I don't think thats how that works, they only made one call on the radio for "breach breach breach"

       and once the door has been shut from the wind, maybe then it locks itself and you need a keycard to open it, which could be the reason the swat team had to blow it.

       the adjoining bedroom (32-134) had a door to the hallway. on some of the leaked photos you can see a room service cart in front of that door and also the room number. i assume that this bedroom might be an optional room that you might book as an extra feature to your suite (e.g. for a large family). this would justify a connecting door with key card reader (will unlock only if guest has booked that extra feature).
      </p>
      <p>
       i am just assuming, i have no proof for this. in the videos where guests of room 32-135 walk through their suite, unfortunately that adjoining door is never in full sight. and it is also never opened.

       Why wouldn't they just, uh, go in the front door with the security guard's master key? Seems weird to blow an adjoining door when there's a freaking easy door to get into 20 feet away.

       It doesn't have to.  The doors connecting rooms in mandalay bay have a deadbolt and a handle with a catch below it.
      </p>

       These are only on one side of the door.  If it shuts and latches, theres no way to open it from the wrong side.

       Do these doors have a standard latch? I would assume these deadbolt doors would have true deadbolts, which means the bolt has to be in the unlocked position to open or shut the door.

       Image 1 and 2 aren't the same layout. NYT images says "typical" room layout. Where on certain floors the suites can be broken into 2 rooms (if the layout is flipped) and accommodate multiple guests as you are correct with image 2. Image 1 is an actual full suite with 1 bedroom that houses an entertainment area, kitchen, conference center etc. There is no hallway access to entertainment area in image 1. Also, the blueprint depicts additional columns where the wall should be from image 2.

       you are 100% wrong here, count the windows after the angle.  there are 3 windows in the suite after the change in angle, then a pillar break.  the second broken window is after that pillar break, in the adjoining room.  that is not a closet, but a passthrough to the next room.  check the posted video of a tour of that specific room and count the windows

       That door being locked bothers me. 200 shots fired in the hallway is difficult for me to believe. I'm pretty sure half that door would be gone at the least if you shot through it 200 freakin times. If the door is partly open and apperantly it wasnt barricaded by this well planned super villan. 
If you cant see his dead body laying on the ground from the doorway why not send in a drone or a robot or a freaking  dog. It's hard for me to believe that they waited around for an hour putting innocent lives and first responders in danger and costing people there lives potentially.

       Maybe the door was left ajar if he was moving between suites to get around locked internal doors? Or the guard came up just as he was entering the other suite? Just spit balling.

       Its totally protocol, they clear the rest of the floor, develop a strategy, then execute, when they say the door was ajar I dont picture it flung wide open Im thinking it was popped open by that little metal bar most hotels use

       What makes more sense? A strike team throwing a flash bang or 3 and storming the room with 5 or 6 or 12 highly trained officers or waiting an hour or so to stop a guy that killed 58 people in 10 minutes from in elevated position that couldn't be seen from the ground. 
The only reason they didn't storm that room was because they knew he was already dead imo. 
What kind of damage would 200 rounds do to that door and the rest of the hotel i mean would it have been a bigger mess outside the door would windows down the hall be shot out? Unless there is another hallway to take people down u can't have anyone going down that hall where his line of sight is. 
This room being next to a stairwell is no coincidence either. Hopefully someone can answer this one why have swat walk 32 flights of stairs and not take the elevator to 31st or 33rd floor?
Also wouldn't where the guard got shot have some evidence markers around it. I'd like to see where he was to have escaped from 199 bullets. I'm picturing neo between when he realized he could dodge bullets and then  after getting hit realizing there is no spoon. Also remarkably all 200 shots came from the double door on the left. The right door has no bullet holes. And who's watching him on the baby monitor?

       Ahh OK, didn't know that. That makes me wonder how the SWAT team got from the stairwell into the hallway. The article I read stated the security guard wasn't able to get that door open so he used the elevator to get to 32.

       Speculation, once he knew they knew what room he was in, he closed the suite door to lock himself in the suite.

       SWAT blew the other door, not because they couldn't open it, but because SWAT blows doors open to prevent getting shot or blown up from booby traps.

       Could it be possible that:
      </p>
      <p>
       Before he started his rampage, he broke the window of the second smaller room either with a hammer or shot it out. Then he deadlocked the "internal door" and exited through the hallway and back to his main suite?
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterwards he shot out/broke the second window and starred shooting at 10:05pm.

       I think this is what seems most probable. Are there any spent casings in the second smaller room?

       Has there been much info on direction of gunfire when the security guard approached the ajar'd door?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility is that he was freely moving between both rooms. When the guard approached, he deadlocked from inside the second room and started firing from there? Then he retreated into the main suite?
      </p>
      <p>
       The above would definitely take some CQC training but it's definitely possible to pull off.

       I'm just trying to figure out how that door was deadlocked/deadbolted from the inside.

       You're right. This guy was a messy/novice shooter. I haven't seen all the leaked pics, but from what I've actually seen... all his rifles were long barrels. You need short barrel in order to conduct effective cqc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second part of why I think he was a novice is the guard. He had cover, concealmeant and a rifle. Yet after 200+ rounds he was unable to hit the guy? I mean, I'm GLAD the guard survived but this just screams little to no training  to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after all of this, why was the second room deadbolted from the inside? Hmm. I'm thinking the main suite door was ajar because his accomplice shot him and booked it.

       I think he broke the separate bedroom window first. The reason is that in the leaked photo of the main room you can see a yellow hammer near his body, which I assume is what he used to break the windows. If he broke the main room window first, then the separate bedroom window, why carry the hammer back to the main room?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he exited the separate bedroom into the hallway, why then move the food cart in front of that door before proceeding back into the suite through the main door? I think he set up the food cart before he started shooting, doubt he was in the hallway moving it around afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
       The part that's most confusing to me is it looks like he intentionally blocked that door with the cart, so why not barricade the main suite door as well? Unless his escape plan involved leaving through that door. The whole thing is bizarre.

       interesting, I didnt see a wire in that photo before.  Good catch.  I believe the sheriff said he was sending video to a tablet to monitor the hallway.  I don't think the jar would need to be ajar for a wire that small, it shows it going into 32-134 without that door being open, so why would 32-135 door be ajar as the security guard stated?

       32-134 probably looks ajar from another angle. It's possible the wire didn't fit. Would there really be an upside to leaving that door slightly open on purpose? I bet there is a mixup in the media about the room actually being 2 rooms with different numbers. There seems to be generalities about approaching the shooter's room because the door is ajar, but we actually know now the room he was found in is 32-135 and that camera goes into 32-134.

       Most of the time if not every hotel ive been there is a good part of the bottom that you can pit envelops and all sorts of stuff under. Getting a video cable should not be a problem at all. You can kind of see a gab in the pictures provided. But again you wouldn't leave the room open, doesn't make sense, you would close the door on the cable 100%

       Yeah, if the door could be shut with the cable under it, then there is another reason the door was left slightly open. Who would go through all of this trouble and decide to leave a door slightly open if it was not necessary?

        Why would SWAT say they needed to explosive breach the second door because they couldnt gain access to that room? That would mean it was locked from the inside, which would be impossible for Paddock, being he was down in the main suite. There was a second broken window, and shots fired, from that second suite so how was it locked from the inside?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Literally, Paddock goes into the room, locks the room adjoining door. Leaves from the main room door into hallway into the main suite. Probably locks the door from his side too, to make breaching from there just a tiny bit harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this even a question?

       that is indeed possible.

       it sounds a bit contrived, as i can find no logical reason to do so, but it is definitely an explanation not requiring a second person.

       He wasn't transferring rooms, he attempted to fire from the non-suite room at fuel tanks, I'm assuming in an unsuccesful attempt to blow them up (fuel doesn't work like that) and then went to the suite room to fire at the concert goers.

       i havent seen anything anywhere showing a shot, even singular, being fired before the first volley as the singer goes back to the mic.  even a couple singular shots would certainly be audible, if not immediately recognized, but there is no video showing such.  also, the taxi video, to me, clearly shows shots were moving between locations

       This image begs to differ (with the official story)...
      </p>
      <p>
       We've all seen these images countless times. Many have used them to scrutinize the rooms for flashes and yet...nobody seems to have SEEN the obvious smoking gun evidence showing the story is a lie, followed by clear staging...
      </p>
      <p>
       Look. Don't just look but SEE....BEFORE the staging for the public photos...
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you see?

       These are double paned windows. That means one pane on the interior of the room and one on the facade. The exterior window has been busted out but the interior window has not. Yes, that is glass. You can follow the sharp straight, broken edges top to bottom. That is the interior window still mostly intact except for a small broken gap where the curtain is being sucked into the vacuum. The rest of it is pulling against the glass in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       In pretty much every single photo taken of the building to show the broken windows as of the morning of October 2nd (feel free to pull up the msm articles and see for yourself), you see the same couple of images:
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://s17.postimg.org/p3nwttti7/News1.png">
        https://s17.postimg.org/p3nwttti7/News1.png
       </a>
       as one example
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://s13.postimg.org/gzwnbglx3/staged2.jpg">
        https://s13.postimg.org/gzwnbglx3/staged2.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       So, between the ones shown above, and the ones hitting the papers for October 2nd, someone has gone in there and busted out the interior window to a bigger opening and we see the whole curtain being pulled through or billowing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me remind you what is on the other side of this window:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://s13.postimg.org/6sipczc9z/vegas_shooting_hotel_5.jpg">
        https://s13.postimg.org/6sipczc9z/vegas_shooting_hotel_5.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that really look like it would accommodate all the machine guns held or positioned in that cranny between the column and the window? Look closer at the curtain...why is it billowing inward if the entire windows were busted out?
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       And after more staging:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://s17.postimg.org/pt6p6awnj/Staged.jpg">
        https://s17.postimg.org/pt6p6awnj/Staged.jpg

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes on - but the gist of it is that the rest of the window was pulled out of the way for the "official" images.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, where's the other chair? We know there are two on either side of the little table yet in the body image there's just the one and the staged images there's just the one. Even being able to partially see through the windows there's just the one. Probably never know but it's interesting all the same.

      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was dead before 1am and the first photos managed to capture the almost full interior pane window still intact and a little broken area closest to that column in the room, and for the official AP images dealt to the media it's all busted out and spacious, then the only explanation is the scene was staged, tampered with, and the official story of rm 135 being a sniper room is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       One last question: would you be willing to stick your head below these jagged pieces for a shooting spree or would you be likely to get rid of any sharp hulking piece of glass that would be above your head before you started firing out the space?

       Great questions.  IF there was only him there, then he could have been using the main door and hallways.  If so, did he have monitors in both rooms so he can see if someone was approaching?

       If he rented both rooms he’d probably had a key to both rooms (the suite and the adjoining room). So he could have just used the exit doors to the hallway for both the suite and the regular room in order to access them. He may have kept the middle connecting door locked and just used the regular entrances. Idk I’m a little confused as to the whole explanation of this and what the official report is on how it went down, but I don’t really see anything super suspicious.

       why would he risk leaving his room and entering the other via the hallway, exposing himself to other guests and security/pd when he could use the adjoining rooms in the interior of the suite?  he would also be constantly moving and disturbing the security cameras he set up to monitor the hallway

       I totally get what you mean and I’m not disagreeing with you that it’s unlikely, but he did have machine rifles to protect himself w which he did use on one of the security people, and I’m sure he knew he wouldn’t have an issue with any guests or these personnel in the short term cause, well he had a ton of guns and he clearly wasn’t afraid to use them. either way once the police got in the building he probably knew he was going to be fucked no matter what door He was going to use. regardless, I’m just mostly saying that it’s a possibility this was the case. Your post sort of made it seem like because of the lock, this was some sort of setup/scenario  that couldn’t have occurred the way it has been presented, that’s all.

       One thing I'm curious about is the baby monitor the chief said he had set up in the "living area" of the room. The way he worded it made it sound like the baby monitor camera was a separate system from the other 3 cameras (1 on peephole and 2 on food cart).
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the diagram of the room, there would be no reason to aim the baby monitor camera at the bedroom or bar area. There would also be no reason to aim it at the main entrance door since he already had 3 cameras covering that area. It makes me wonder if he had a handler watching him on the baby monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the handler was in the separate bedroom behind the closed door? That could also explain why the diagram shows no weapons were found in the separate bedroom. If Paddock was running back and forth between the two rooms why wouldn't he split the guns up between each room?

       This guy is fake. He says he heard the gunman in the next room and then went down to hide in the bushes and "nobody knew where the shots were coming from". This is classic MSM "diversion" story with keywords to help hide the real searchable terms like the room next door. They did a similar story with the security Guard story to dillute the search. Instead of a dead Security Guard or bloody guard being chased, now it's a guy who is a "hero" and was just shot in the leg. Bah!

       I have interest in the other room as well. But he could have simply entered the other room, locked it, and then exited into the hallway and then entered the room he was found in. Not saying that it what happened, but that could explain it.

       I just watched a video of a SWAT breach. Those things do some serious damage, more than I wouldve expected. Judging by the floorplan and what the crime scene photos show, why is there no evidence of a breach blast in the room? I imagine Paddocks body wasnt far from the right window which would mean the crime scene photos would be showing portions of the rest of the suite which was on the opposite side of the breached door. Why do the photos show the room to be perfectly in tact?

       Question (not sure if this is right place for it)....
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking, while listening to the scanner feed, how do they get people in nearby rooms out? Obviously, the guy next door (or wherever he was) was alerted by the other woman. But, they had to clear every room on that floor, whether they were occupied or not (they didn't know). At that point, he had stopped firing, so they couldn't just knock on doors. And, if they didn't know FOR SURE what room he was in (or an accomplice), they wouldn't just use a key because what if someone ended up shooting at them? They didn't blow up each door.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...how do they get the surrounding guests (even 2-4 rooms down) out? WOULD they? What if there was an accomplice in one of the rooms? Searching the room wouldn't do much good if they had no evidence (why would they be that stupid?). What if they've just let that person go by now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious about the logistics mainly...but I guess this could fall under conspiracy. Since the news finally released the note, I'm starting to really question the second person theory.

       they stated they used the keycard to open every door and clear out the floor of guests.  If thats true, why didnt they enter 32-134, which would appear to be a different guests room?

       I wish I knew how they knew there wasn't a separate person in one of those rooms who was a second shooter... I mean, that person could've just come at them shooting. Especially if they caught him or her trying to get away. I'm sure there's (prob an obvious) answer to this question but I don't know what it is.

       Yeah, some people were bitching about the SWAT team taking so long.  In reality I thought it was way too fast given the size of the hotel.  There was a cop who was shot in my city and the suspect ran into a little fleabag motel with maybe 30 rooms. It was a good 6 hours of lockdown and surrounding rouds blocked before all the rooms were clear.  I guess it took some time to review the security cameras, and evacuate the bystanders before they would go in.

       Right... but one thing I did read was that there isn't any security footage on (at least Vegas) room floors. I was surprised by this fact because I thought....how could there be a second shooter, they would just see this person leave the room. Or, even just someone who helped him. OR...if there was a person who had no clue what he was doing. How do they know? Because there's no footage of the room. I guess they could ask ppl in surrounding rooms. But, no one was there 100% of the time. Not saying there was a second shooter. But, now that I know this whole camera info, I wonder how they can be so sure he didn't have someone else in the room (besides the maid), ever?

       I think a breach is a safer way for SWAT to enter a room.  They had a key from the security guard so they could have used that to get into both rooms, but they didn't.  The door could have been closed and not locked.

       If there was just one shooter, he wouldnt lock the door between the two rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other shooter was Eric. They look the same. They deliberately chose a suite next to the stairwell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen and Eric look and dress similar, they ID'ed as each other which is why Stephen was in the hotel earlier than it appears. That was Eric.

       He rents 2 rooms with different vantage points and chooses to use the best one after knocking out 2 windows. He locks the door in between rooms. He sets up the cart and camera in front of the door in the less optimal room. The camera cord keeps the door ajar, but there are still 2 locked doors in whichever room he chooses to shoot from. The security guard never entered the room; he was shot through the door. The security guard is a hero because he continued to evacuate people in other rooms, aided the police/SWAT, and probably saved lives.

       SWAT wouldn't want to just open the door to the second room and stroll in. They had to assume there was a second armed gunman in that room. So they breached the door same as the first and waited for any suppressing fire from within.

       Well they got the master keys from Campos, according to the official story. Why not use them to open the main door? There was literally no reason whatsoever to need to breach any door beyond the first one at best. Once inside the main room, 135, they'd see the security surveillance set up and would know then and there whether any of it was linked to 134.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       All they had to do was use the key and go inside. Everything they've done since is covering up.

       Is there any way we know that it was deadbolted? If deadbolted that's crazy as hell but those doors don't have handles on the opposite side so if it was just latched shut they don't have a handle to open it even though it's  unlocked and I could see there being spring loaded hinges that swing them shut, those aren't standard for connecting doors but then again I work in hotel maintenance and if I needed to replace a hinge and all I had was a spring loaded one I'd throw it in there. I've seen a lot of doors in the hotel I work that aren't supposed to have them but they do. Still that is interesting because you need a lot of maybes and what ifs for that door to be shut even if it's not deadbolted.

       I mean is it really so hard, FBI?
I bet pol could figure it out:
      </p>
      <p>
       If fbi wants to dispel the notion of him being a gun runner :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         look into the guest logs as far back as possible of every time Steve stayed at a casino
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Verify those datess with video evidence and employee testimonials that he was always gambling - if he really was a high roller and he was well known enough to receive comps then it sod be easy to find employees, management and check in clerks that recognize him
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Release footage from his last stay and his previous stays, footage that only shows him and him alone or maybe with his gf entering and exiting the room.
Not any Isis or antifa or terrorist types...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Show us what's on the note
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Show us video footage of the night of shooting especially right before when a potential client couldve entered and when and where and how the police carried out the breach during the shooting as well as after to dispel the notion of additional bodies being removed so we can corroborate with police scanner.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Release this info NOW or ASAP so people can't claim that the footage was edited (removed, refilmed) and so that the employees, management, check in clerks, bag boys, bar tenders even the casino owner or higher ups don't have time to be pressures into lying or collaborating to fit the gambling narrative
I mean is that really too much to ask?

       Can you explain why? The tiny explosion hardly even damaged that door. You've seen the photos of it. Swat had no real reason to rush in there. The gun fire had been over for almost an hour and they had the floor on lock down. Seems very unsafe. I get it if he was still shooting, go in guns blazing but no shots almost an hour... blow the door?? When it's already open??? And the security guard already had a key card for the cops to use cuz they were checking all the other rooms in the area, but didn't breach any others....

       This is what i was thinking the whole time. The security gaurd killed paddock, shot up the concert. Then shot himself in the leg to make it look like paddock did it. Escaped in plain site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and paddock was an arms dealer to the underworld. This explains why he had the explosives and all those guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for the locations around the public was to have insurances that have the gun deals go sour, the American public would suffer.

       My thought is at this point in time he knew he had SWAT etc closing in on him. He had two choices; kill himself or try and get through the door. He chose the former

       not just that... locked from the other side... where the shooter was not found.
      </p>
      <p>
       so how is that possible? the shooter locked the door from the other side and then went through the hall to get to the room he was found dead in?

       But did they even try? Also him "clearing rooms" is really odd. He got shot and they didn't ask him questions about the interaction with him and the shooter. After when he was told to get medical help could've just walked off.
