        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has there been any answer to that question? Any excuse or reasoning about why they haven&#39;t released any footage whatsoever? </p>

<p>You can disassemble a rifle and fit it in a gym bag, you can make multiple trips over the course of a few days carrying a small backpack for all the ammo.</p>

<p>The questions I ask myself are,</p>

<p>How many trips did he make carrying a bag? Over what time frame? With as many cameras that are inside a Vegas hotel, you cannot tell me that these questions cannot be answered by looking at the security footage.</p>

<p>I would be half content if they would release that, just a small short video showing Paddock carrying a bag that could contain a disassembled rifle at two separate times. Just two. Just to prove that he did enter the room with bags more than once.</p>

<p>So to anyone who is more informed than I, why are they not releasing any footage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can normally understand that. Considering how major this event is. with that said, I still can&#39;t help but Wonder why someone along the chain of command cannot release select footage. Especially simple things that should be inherently implied in this situation. Such as him carrying bags for multiple trips. Something like that should normally not have any impact on the case whatsoever. So if it is being held for that reason, it means that its release would impact the case.</p>

<p>So either they&#39;re just being extremely gun-shy and playing it by the book as much as possible because how much attention is on the situation, or the footage contains things that are extremely important.</p>

I&#39;m going to avoid giving out too much information about my personal life but, my employment leads me to work in a lot of people&#39;s homes. One of my regular customers is a 55 year old woman who was at the Jason Aldean concert in Vegas when it happened. She showed me the blood on her shoes and pants. It wasn&#39;t hers she didn&#39;t get hurt.</p>

<p>Also, there is pictures, there is footage. I won&#39;t post them here but go spend a little time on /pol/ it won&#39;t take you long to see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy in the video was definitely in on it, playing his role in the carefully controlled stream of content that gets released surrounding these hoaxes. There is never any visible entry or exit wound, or any wounds in any images or videos, or even the images of anything being shot, or even any bullet holes which would be spread throughout the entire area even damaging the pavement.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact opposite way around: Why would they need to mass murder a bunch of people when they can hire and control a crowd, tell the media networks what to show and say, and use the power of suggestion with videos which show quite literally no proof of shots fired yet 80% of people who watch it say &quot;wow that was horrifying.&quot; Keep in mind, if whoever did this gets caught, they&#39;re just going to be charged with a hoax. They&#39;ll still go to prison for a long time, hopefully life, but it&#39;s not the same as being tried for wanton mass slaughter. No one would take on that guilt if there was another way to do this, and no average Joe Crisis Actors are going to sign up for an event where innocents are actually being killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d say you may be right about the camera guy.</p>

<p>I will say if you just perpetrate the act you wouldn’t need to hire actors, because it would be real.</p>

<p>Lastly I’ll say, the only way for you to find closure on this is to search a victims name and find their family, go meet them and attend the funeral. Easy to remove the human aspect and dismiss the fact real people with real lives, hopes, dreams, jobs, plans for the next day were snuffed our in an instant. I guess it’s easier to cope when you think it’s all fake. Idk</p>

<p>I am 99.9999% sure no one died in Sandy Hook, yet I&#39;ve never been to Connecticut or talked with the families. We need much better proof of shots being fired, let alone that people really died. </p>

<p>My main argument is this: the images we have now, 5 days after the event, is nowhere close to the abundance we would have if it were real. I wouldn&#39;t be able to have legitimate doubts about the idea that shots were even fired.</p>
