       Gotta try to video tape inside the house. Next time you see the flashing crawl up to the window and hold your phone in to capture some video (peeking in is too risky).

       No animals no . I’ve tried creeping near his window after I saw the lights . He had very loud. Music on ( normal music ) . When he finally left the house two weeks ago he drove off fast , very fast . I then went over to his place and quickly opened his letter box flap, I couldn’t see anything but there was a kitchen light on . I couldn’t get a picture as it was mainly carpet I saw and some coats ( or gowns ) I just worry as these lights were like some sort of fireworks but not if that makes sense . He’s a strange creature would it be possible that someone come come to earth pretend to be human and then connecting with the mothership ? It’s gotta be

       Good start I think you should (I know this will sound gross) pick through his garbage to see what he's got to hide in there. You say he does ordering for most of his needs, gotta be boxes with packing slips right?

       Tbh I already have . Only twice though that was after he sped past me very fast and flashed his car lights at me three times . No need for it at all. But that was after I posted the note so I kinda let it go , however I checked the bins as if he’s putting meat out in the street his knows what else he may have stored . I found nothing incriminating in the bin

       I thought about buying a drone and flying it near his upstairs window . I can see it from my back alley . And seeing if I can attach a camera but don’t know if the police would arrest me for spying . Any footage I got would no doubt be destroyed as I reckon they must know if they got some alien in their vicinity

       I thought that at first . But then he does go to work sometimes so it can’t be that severe . Also how does that account for the lights . Is there some sort of lights people can purchase that are like bright beams ?

       How are you so sure that he is going to work? And yes there are lights like that they are called 'Happy Lights' or light therapy boxes.  People who have Season Affective Disorder or SAD use these lights as a form of therapy for their seasonal depression.

       Thanks for reply I’ve heard of sad lights as I’ve suffered myself with bouts of depression . These were like strobe lighting , almost flares but indoors ? Do these lights come with smoke three times I’ve seen the lights with the smoke it’s not fag smoke

       Hmmm, I do not think they SAD lights have a strobe effect or smoke.  That is certainly bizarre.   Maybe he likes having a party of one and has a smoke machine and strobe likes for a more natural party vibe?

       I’m gonna look more into this thank you . What about the speeding out of a cul de sac ? That’s not something someone from our planet would do , or flashing me , then the noises in the garden , leaving meat out , skipping past dogs , staring at me through my window , he hissed at my husband this is not signs of depression though ? It’s just frustrating. I want to live in harmony

       I sent him a message on Facebook saying something to the affect of ‘ hi it’s me number .... I just wanted to try and build some bridges with you , after you clearly spied on me and then drew your curtains and the dog waste incident I would really like to talk things over clear the air  ‘ he replied something to the effect of ‘ I know nothing about any dog waste , I heard from a reliable source you was in my bins and have been poking through my letter box ‘ 
then he blocked me !!!! How can we build a relationship if he does that ? . Also who is his source ? No one talks to him apart from his equally strange gentleman friend . That’s what’s baffling me

       You’re right I’m not sure he goes to work I just know when I come home he pulls up as well then sits in his car until I go in . This is only Monday and Wednesday though . I suppose I assumed he worked as we live in a nice area .

He then did a skip thing threw my note on the road and sped off again . My husband says I need to let it go as we had dog excrement thrown st our kitchen window the same evening

       I didn’t think of that thank you . It could certainly explain some . Last Sunday he started leaving chunks of meat outside near his car in a line , only four pieces . I called the council on him and the next day they were gone . I mean that’s strange surely ?

       You know you are being a stalker, right? You might have an alien for a neighbor, but he has a possibly delusional busybody who is trying to surreptitiously invade his privacy. I hope you aren't a murderer.

       Lol deffo not a murderer . I understand it looks like that when u read it but this is nothing there’s been a whole list of things that have occurred that lead me to suspect something is off . A month back he had some kind of experience in the garden . Lots of shouting and weird noises , Then his only friend I’ve ever seen ( another man ) went inside and the noises stopped but the lights started again and so did some smoke coming out of the windows . I’ve started to keep a diary of events , I want evidence . I sat there for two hours that night watching the smoke and the lights , all the time thinking I should knock and speak to him

       I’ve put a polite note through his letter box so don’t think I’m a stalker ? I told him it was from me three doors down and I was concerned about the meat trail , the noises , the way he speeds like the sound of light when we live in a small cup de sac . I explained that myself and others were concerned for his welfare , and if he wanted to chat I am here

       I’m addition you say I invade his privacy ?? Think three weeks ago I was perched at my window in the dark as I heard the noises and thought I would glance out and see if all was ok I’m case I needed to report anything, as I was sort of checking up on him , he cane to his window with the light on , point blank stared at me for about a minute then drew his curtains . So he is looking at me as much I at him !

       Lol I wish !!! No I couldn’t and then I’d lower myself to him . If I did that he will start hissing at my husband again . I’m trying not to cause s confrontation too much . He screamed at my hubby saying he’s been overtaken then hissed again till I cane outside I saw it all from the kitchen window, I tried to throw a slipper at him ( I should not have done that I’m not proud ). Then my husband shouted at me to get inside . Whilst I threw the slipper ( which didn’t hit the alien hybrid ) conscientiouly anyway , the alien neighbour just laughed . I mean who laughs when they have someone throwing something

      <p>
       I haven’t got the outfit I said I was gonna dress up but my husband will definitely leave me if I do that he said to me to leave neighbour to it but I want to prove he’s an alien . I know this all sounds irrational when u read it if we were here having a conversation face to Face I think You would understand it more from my view
