        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TheBeeAndTheBard.html">TheBeeAndTheBard</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is purely my opinion based on my military background. I don&#39;t know for a fact he was the real shooter, but this is why I believe he was and acted alone.</p>

<p><strong>The Guns.</strong></p>

<p>His massive stock of weapons is a big point of contention. Any trained shooter could have inflicted massive, massive damage with what he had there. With the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000142646182_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bquwg2gQQ9g5aN1wB6TZJ-Hb_ZOGfIXqMBsnEy-EkfKlk.jpeg?imwidth=480">magazines stack in the corner</a>, and a <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/inside-hotel1-LV-abc-171003_4x3_992.jpg">series of rifles ready to rock</a>. Those are high quality rifles and high quality magazines. Someone trained could have cycled through magazines until an stoppage beyond fixing in a few seconds occurred, and then switched to the next rifle.</p>

<p>I think this was his intention with the sheer number of rifles. But I don&#39;t think he had the training, and the muscle memory to properly carry out that action. And I think this explains why there was such long lulls between bring. I don&#39;t think he fired off entire magazines, I think he got a major stoppage (stovepipe/double feed) and got fixated on trying to clear it rather than stick to the plan of switching rifles.</p>

<p>What we are NOT hearing in this video is an <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/PEO_M249_Para_ACOG.jpg">m249</a> or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M240_machine_gun#/media/File:PEO_M240B_Profile.jpg">m240</a>.  Anyone who has worked with these weapon systems can tell you that, especially any <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/marine-corps-enlisted-job-descriptions-3345316">0331</a> that are kicking around here and other subs.  You can here very clear cyclic rates in the long bursts from the bumpstock rifles.  You would not hear that with a 249 or 240.  As well, we&#39;d have seen <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/Ju0AAOSwT%7E9WiNv-/s-l300.jpg">links</a> along with shell casings all over his hotel room.  Has he actually used one of those weapon systems against that crowd he would have turned them into shreds.  </p>

<p>I know him wearing gloves also seems odd to some people, but it&#39;s very common.  Gloves ensure you have a better grip.  It allows you to grip the magazine better.  It lets you grip the charging handle better.  It makes sure you can keep going when you hands start getting sweaty.</p>

<p><strong>The &quot;Note&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe <a href="http://cdn.images.dailystar.co.uk/dynamic/204/photos/291000/Las-Vegas-Shooting-Pictures-Stephen-Paddock-Body-Motive-Note-Gun-Hotel-Room-Mandalay-Bay-1095291.jpg">what we see here</a> is a note.  I do believe he explained his motives, possibility in a video or written, but this is not it.  What I see here is a marker, tape, and a notepad.   What I think he possibly used that for was range sighting on the window.  Incremental tape marks on the window, marked by the pen/marker, would give him an easy way to sight each new rifle in his original plan.  Notepad was most likely used for a range calculation, as Paddock was a math guy.</p>

<p><strong>The Camera</strong></p>

<p>I think the camera setup is pretty obvious. I don&#39;t think he planned on being taken alive. I think once he saw the SWAT getting ready to breach is when he eat the bullet. SWAT blows the door, they see him on the ground but don&#39;t know the status of the threat. I know personally from breach training that its within the protocol to still engage the target regardless of their status. I think this explains when he potentially has a bullet hole in his chest.  The positioning of the handgun is most likely based on the SWAT members kicking it out of reach, which is pretty standard on a breach and clear.</p>

<p><strong>Two Windows</strong></p>

<p>Why was there two windows shot out of?  In my opinion it was to have two angles to fire on based on which way the crowd moved.  He would have line of sight on both ways the crowd would flee.  But again this is all based on off his original plan, not what he carried out.</p>

<p><strong>Other Shooters</strong></p>

<p>There is a video of a security guard or cop that has been getting it&#39;s rounds as a second shooter video.  You know which one I&#39;m talking about.  He absolutely is not a second shooter.  What he&#39;s doing is raising his handgun in reaction to sudden gunfire.  This handgun also happens to have a flashlight on it.  IF he has actually shot, everyone around him would have heard.  Guns are much louder than people realize.  This is a real guy who was reacting to an unexpected situation in the best manner he could, and I think anyone still sharing it is willingly spreading disinfo.</p>

<p>As for reports of other shooters, I think people either was an armed response from police, or other civilians trying to respond to the shooting, as so many people claimed to have wanted to do.  In regards to claims of other shootings in other hotels, all we see are videos of panicked people running.  No gun shots, no wounded, nothing.  I believe this was simply a case of word of mouth panic mixed with the fact there was an actual shooting going on.  </p>

<p>While I think the security guards actions have been a bit sketchy at this time, I think people also need to chill the fuck out in calling him an accomplish or the second shooter.  Again, this is a real guy who was responding to a situation to a situation way the hell out of his pay-grade.  So while I think we should stay tuned for more information on his involvement, labeling him as the second shooter/partner is pretty goddamn irresponsible.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The way he planned this shooting was honestly well thought out for a suicide mission. The way he executed it is well within line of an amateur and was not representative of what he planned. Someone trained could have bumped that body count of exponentially.</p>

<p>Again, this is purely my explanation based on my experience. I think he planned for a much, much bigger body count bit didn&#39;t have skill or steadiness to execute his plan properly.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t a hot fucking clue what his motives were, but the way he carried it out is consistent with a middle-aged man with very little practical firearm experience.  I think the conspiracy here isn&#39;t if he himself did it, but why he did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the jist of this post, with minor exception.</p>

<p>The way a bump fire stock works takes practice to make it work.  In the multiple audio/video files I heard inconsistency not found with a true auto weapon.</p>

<p>The two windows explains the different sounds in the videos.  Basically, except for perhaps the last two shots, we are hearing two different shot sounds from different locations, and two different echoes.  Add to that the sounds of the rounds hitting the roof of the stage (as the band reported) but also the rounds hitting everything else.</p>

<p>I agree it was a suicide mission.  He booked the room in his name.  He drank heavily in the hours leading up to it in the casino with a hooker or lady friend.  While taking the same class of drugs as the shooters of Sandy Hook, Columbine, Denver/Joker and dozens of others.</p>

<p>I have no clue why he would want to exit life this way, a lot cleaner exit would have been just taking his last shot at home.  </p>

<p>With the possible other bookings overlooking other venues, meh.  He was rich and traveled all over the place.  If for whatever reason he did want his name in the history books, the other concerts and their ticket holders varied wildly, from Country, Rap, or Alternative.</p>

<p>Good post, dude.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still swimming after reading Illumannati and Numerology posts about the height of the Pyramid.  </p>

<p>HE WAS WEARING SLIPPERS.</p>
