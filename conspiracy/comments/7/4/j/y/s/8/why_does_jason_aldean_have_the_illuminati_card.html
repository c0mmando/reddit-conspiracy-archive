       Hello folks ive found some more links and synchronicities with Jason Aldean and the Illuminati cards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some previous posts. This stuff just keeps building its hard to keep up.

       So if we look at the card Jack and ace of spades. Now lets use those spades to dig a little.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jack is the 11th card and has a value of 10 in some games The Ace is the 1 and the 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       so the jack is 1011 and the ace is 111 eliminate the zero and 111 for both.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my research of the event, I found the Luxor pyramid being 111 meters tall And looking at the CNN image I thought it was peculiar that the floor the shooter was on was about the same height as the Pyramid capstone. This capstone is the Brightest light in the world. (siriusly)

      </p>
      <p>
       so 10-01-2017 1001 and 2017 is 2+0+1+7=10 111000
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole lotta ones going on here. So the J is 10 and the Ace is 1 10-1 or maybe the Jack is 11 and the Ace is 11 too for that good ole 11:11
      </p>
      <p>
       So JA Jason Aldean. Thats interesting. But wait, this wasn't his Original name?
      </p>
      <p>
       “Aldean changed his name on the suggestion of Monte C. Willis, a music consultant hired by Barry Williams (now partners in managing Curb Recording artist Rachel Holder).[citation needed] "There was an artist named Jason D. Williams performing all over Nashville at the time and I felt like there would be a lot of confusion, so I called Barry and suggested the name change. Really, not an easy thing to suggest to a father, but ultimately it worked out well". Monte Willis: "In order to stand out, he changed the spelling of his middle name, Aldine, to come up with the name Aldean.”

       This is the gent who made Jasons new name for him. His initials would have been JW or JAW had monte not been there to Craft his new name.

       In this interview he discuses the Black hole sun tatoo or eclipse on his arm, but he may have not added the other elements being shown here.

      <p>
       You look for Jason Aldean tattoos and this song comes up everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Main point here is He got the Illuminati card tattooed on him AFTER he was indoctrinated into the industry and reborn under his new/ modified name.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR Jason Aldeans official logo and current Left arm tattoo represent near identically to the Las Vegas Illuminati card. Couple with Jason Aldean being given to him along with the logo he uses. Along with everything else in this event ,curiouser and curiouser.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They dont know" and the truth are some of his more popular songs.

       There isn't anything officially saying how high this floor was up so i took the height and divided by the #of floors multiplied by the floor number to get an estimate of 109 meters (if all floors are the same height.

       That's the Blackjack best hand. From Wiki
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the ace of spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand was called a "blackjack", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a blackjack refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colours.

       This is pretty eerie. I've none about this game but haven't really looked back at it recently. I found this while researching the Vegas card. Sorry in advanced if this has been shared here before.

       You are figuring it out. Good job. The iluminati card game is to mock us in our face. The next to figure out is that it was a complete hoax like the rest that's why it is so easy to control these events. Usually a hoax

       Guys, the tattoo isn't necessarily linked to the "Illuminati Card". That configuration of card is known as a literal "black jack"...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">
         ace of spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand was called a "blackjack", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn.
        </a>

       It's a sign of luck and success, or he could just like to gamble.

       Now if he also had a showgirl tattooed on his arm, that would be something.
