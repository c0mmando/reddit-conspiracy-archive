       I don't buy the story we're being told. But I'm curious what people are thinking actually happened and people's theories as to the real story. Would make sense for the far left to be behind it to push gun control, but what do you all think? Post away.

       But it is likely. Being "tired of it" just sorta shows that the narrative is working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is an obvious consideration. If its "tiresome", blame that on Israel pulling so much passive-aggressive bullshit, not on the honest folks that want to bring it up.

       Lol so just double down "the Jews did this!" with zero proof, I'm sure that will convince all of us who don't automatically just assign all blame to Jews.

       Something I've not seen much speculation on is a mob link. High rolling gambler, money laundering, guns, prostitution... all natural mob territory. Indiscriminate mass murder, not so much but who knows? Maybe the guy wants to fuck the city he feels fucked him.

       I saw a theory about a major casino heist which sounds kinda similar. The mass shooting was the major distraction and it makes sense with the claims of shooters in so many other hotels. But they won't make it public because of it giving ideas to more people.

       That sounds jooocy. How much would the take be? Millions? Multi-millions? But if that were the case, why not just detonate a bomb closeby, or shoot indiscriminately. You still cause the same chaos without such high needless casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 500 shot, that guy wanted blood. If this was agenda pushing, couldn't a magazine or three fired off, with only several deaths have the same effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this just TPTB wanting to keep the weight of panic and fear in the people's everyday lives?

       It is crazy I agree. But the more shots and deaths the more distraction. It's just a theory. It does make sense though. If you heard the police scanner there was supposedly shooters in multiple other hotels. Though I feel if they were robbing them people would have seen or there would have been casualties in said hotels. Who knows man. We'll never know the truth lol

       Yeah, this looks like the cabal factions fighting. Attacking the faction that the mob are linked to. That mob faction are a big part of the group that got Trump in which seriously messed up plans of the other faction.

       I’m swimming against the current here and thinking Steve paddock is being grossly underestimated. We know for a fact he was a smart, successful man and I think we can agree the average guy can’t accomplish what he has. Independent Self made millionaire who managed to stay rich says a lot. I’m still not buying the multiple shooter speculation either, the would have been able to detonate the explosives finishing the plan if there were accomplices. The fact that he killed him self because he thought he was out of time with the security guard there thinking it was the police says a lot. He panicked didn’t get to finish.

       I think the factions at the top are at war, the plan was to kill 10k, and the third faction thwarted the plan. Now, they are all busy covering up what hand they played in it and they completely undervalued how powerful and resourceful the proles are at calling out their shit.

       He was setting up a deal to sell these guns and thousands of rounds to a contact ultimately tied to ISIS. I think the hotel is providing a safe place to do business, and the FBI is tacitly monitoring the deals. Which is why they are so terrified of the leaks.
      </p>

       FBI trying to figure out how to paint the ISIS picture without exposing that they monitor deals like this all the time to try and track the weaponry.  This is the second time that scheme has led to American deaths.  They have to be terrified.

       Good theory but why did he end up killing people instead of making the sale? And what was the other scheme that you say is the same as this one? I'm honestly curious, I'm not attacking your theory at all.

       Why take unnecessary risk of moving those guns into the inner city. Why not in a remote place? or some garage? or abadonned place? They would get caught on the elevator cameras and lobby. How did they escape? And why the fuck would they then shoot a bunch of people for no reason. Those are some retarded criminals.

       Despite what the media says the DDM4 and Colt AR15's are not valued at $5-10,000.00 a piece. Closer to $1,500-$2,000 each. Now figure in black market value or used gun value which cuts the value almost in half. We don't know the full extent of the arsenal but assuming he could sell them for $1000 each, he would only really be making around $23,000.00 at best. Seems like a lot of work for little payoff considering he was a gambler and it's Vegas. $23,000 is a lot of money to most, myself included but in Vegas it's not considered much. Not to mention that I doubt bump stocks are a hot commodity on the black market.

       Yeah, this looks like the cabal factions fighting. Attacking the faction that the mob are linked to. That mob faction are a big part of the group that got Trump in which seriously messed up plans of the other faction.
