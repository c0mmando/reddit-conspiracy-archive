        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is based on what mega anon was saying on pol yesterday. He said that Trump is planning on dropping 3 days worth of massive red pills on camera to the public that will wake everyone to the truth of reality. These red pills will destroy the reputation of many famous people and agencies. Nobody can predict exactly when this will happen but the cabal is in full panic mode. There is also an underground war between white hats and black hats where the white hats are winning. </p>

<p>Las Vegas was 2 part. First it was the cabals attempt to thwart trumps red pill drops. 2nd, it is the underground war seeping out into the open for public to see which is bound to happen at some point. </p>

<p>Currently, I think they were planning on slaughtering thousands of the country music fans at the festival using all 47 guns from Mandalay Bay rooms. The top floors of MB are owned by a Saudi prince and VOTL claims this false flag was a joint mossad and Saudi operation. </p>

<p>Mega anon also said that it was blackwater mercenaries that caught onto the plot and helped foil it. </p>

<p>Edit: 2 other important points are that a lady warned the crowd 45 min prior to the shooting saying “You are ALL going to die” and someone is said to have blocked off the exit doors so the people were trapped inside.   </p>

<p>Yes...  There is a lot more to this story.  Something more happened, and they are hiding it.  I know because I have some friends that get their news from the MSM.  They believe it was a lone gunman who snapped, so this tells me it is not true.  LOL.   They are useful measuring sticks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A more reasonable scenario is someone was buying 23 guns and thousands of rounds of ammo in an illicit deal.  They had other ideas though, than just buying some guns and ammo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a possibility, but why bring all of that ammo and why put it into the magazines?  That is a lot more work for a gun deal.  </p>

<p>Also, if he acted alone and intended to kill as many people as possible, then he did not need all of those guns.  He also did not barricade the door to his room to buy himself more time to kill more people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if selling these specific guns.  That part could have gone 2 ways (he did it or others did).</p>

<p>I do think this whole scenario unfolded quite possibly because of the involvement of people selling illegal guns or something to that effect.  This guy is too suspicious to me.  </p>

<p>If I accept that he is laundering money, and I think there is some decent evidence of that, then the question is, for who?</p>

<p>Himself?  Maybe, but where did he initally get this money to support being this rich.  He is very very wealthy.  No job in 20 years.</p>

<p>A group of people who have contacts with nefarious groups all over the world?  He&#39;s got defense contacts, and knows how the US Govt (IRS) and Defense Contractors would audit their books.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His plane was registered to a private LLC he owned called Volant, whose only contracts since 2007 came directly from the Department of Defense.  </p>

<p>His &#39;girlfriend&#39; was the ex-mayor of a Filipino town who supported CIA interests in the &#39;80s, for which she received a letter of recommendation from her contact there for her US immigration application.  </p>

<p>The Phillipines was just overrun by ISIS earlier this year. </p>

<p>Reports from responding officers clearly mentioned multiple Asian shooters on the ground at Tropicana, The Bellagio, and multiple casinos <em>after Paddock</em>&#39;<em>s room was breached</em>.</p>

<p>In 2015 Leland Yee was arrested for using government contacts to illegally sell guns to the Phillipines. </p>

<p>A likely scenario accounting for this information is that Paddock was an undercover agent selling weapons to an ISIS cell as part of a sting operation, his cover was blown (possibly by Danley due to the CIA wanting to arm ISIS for an insurrection against Duterte, a known belligerent), and ISIS decided to humiliate the US and expose their illegal dealings to the public by way of the massacre.  </p>
