Nobody makes 5 million dollars playing video poker. But if you already have millions in cash, playing $100 hands of video poker(which has around a 99% payback if played correctly) is a perfect way to launder money. There were reports that he was gambling very large amounts leading up to the shooting. Could he have been laundering cash from a down payment on a gun deal? He gets paid 50% cash for the guns up front, expecting the rest when the guns are delivered at the hotel. Rents the room a few days early and puts all that cash into video poker in order to launder it.</p>

<p>Video poker is know to be a popular money laundering scheme at casinos <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/dirty-laundry-20101020-16udi.html">http://www.smh.com.au/national/dirty-laundry-20101020-16udi.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>MGM Resorts has ties to companies from the Middle East (Dubai) that are owners of ports known to smuggle illegal weapons and terrorists</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock is an accounting wizard that worked for the IRS&#39;s defense auditing team, an then was hired to work for the defense company(ies) himself, first on the books at Lockheed Martin</p>

<p>Paddock gets introduced through those defense and government entities to gun runners who sell American guns to nefarious groups around the world, and starts working with them.</p>

<p>What better place to launder illegal gun money than through a casino on a machine that pays 99.7% which turns a blind eye to said gun running and laundering all with the wink wink of the US govt</p>

<p>Somewhere in this scheme, this go-between and launderer get pissy at the US govt, and gets radicalized. Either that, or coerced with threats of force towards his family. </p>

<p>It means creating the illusion of profit to turn illegal profits into legal ones. If you buy $100k in chips they&#39;re gonna take your info and know how may chips you bought. Same for putting $100k in a video poker machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is 1 report that he made 5 million, we don&#39;t have any info on his losses for the year, if he was really playing that much money he&#39;d have to claim all his wins and losses, you don&#39;t get to just subtract what you lost from what you won its all itemized when you&#39;re gambling that much money.</p>

<p>The casinos are in it for the long haul, the guys who get &#39;banned&#39; are the ones the casinos are convinced they can&#39;t beat and often they aren&#39;t really banned they just aren&#39;t allowed to play under whatever special rules they negotiated before hand.  The advantage player thing is complicated, its not just guys who are good at winning which is impossible on many of these machines its guys who convince the casinos to change odds in their favor, which for a slot guy would be convincing the casino to give him free plays, the casino gives these expecting the player to lose it all and then some back to them eventually, this isn&#39;t a one night/visit deal its a relationship between the casino and gambler that the casino believes they will end up getting the best of in the long run.</p>

<p>Very often those big advantage players that claim to be banned are just not given special concessions they could easily go into a casino and lose their money at the regular tables like us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know there are claimed cases, but at some point, the casino is either going to get a bust-out (like what that one who posted here was talking about) or will eventually get it from both ends and be forced to ban them -- this is why casinos employ Risk Management types on top of normal security.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a book called &quot;The Smart Money&quot;, where the author goes in undercover for a massive sports-betting operation as a &quot;beard&quot;, and is effectively banned out of Las Vegas within about a year or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s probably why he was able to keep playing, exactly what you are saying.</p>

<p>The problem with that theory is the concept that he was a known &quot;advantage player&quot; -- meaning he had knowledge of some mechanism (not cheating) that would allow him to, somehow, turn the tables.</p>

<p>If the advantage player community knew of him (as the one who posted here claims they did), there&#39;s no way, with that kind of money involved, the Vegas people didn&#39;t either.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a large difference between &quot;just because he may win&quot; and that he probably will -- if we are to believe the person who posted here about the guy, he was heading toward the latter, if not already there.</p>

<p>Advantage play adds something to the equation.</p>

<p>Made a couple hundred on my last trip going that way -- that&#39;s a bit of advantage play.  You&#39;re using the law of averages against the casino in a way they may not (given scale) entirely approve of.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s a question since I&#39;m curious about the thought process. If the wheel came up red 10 times in a row, then we swapped all the stickers on the wheel, do we expect the next spin to be red or black?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll play along: Do I know the stickers are swapped?   If so, red, because of the fact that it doesn&#39;t change that it hasn&#39;t hit those slots (which were black and are now red) in a while.  If not, black.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re indulging me, can you give us any description of the actual physical mechanism that guides the ball into a slot it hasn&#39;t landed in recently? What change in physics are we seeing occur after the ball comes up red several times?</p>

<p>Also, if this effect were real, it would be trivially easy to demonstrate it happening in a large-scale experiment, yet no one has. There would also be a huge community of advantage gamblers making millions off of this casino oversight, yet as an advantage gambler myself I&#39;ve never seen or heard of these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called mathematics and probability.</p>

<p>Over the course of an infinite number of throws, if a 50-50 proposition were to go +X one way, then the probability of it going the other way would increase as X increases, and normalize as X decreases.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you run the risk of the game no longer being fair.  Your task, as a gambler, is to take that into consideration -- which CAN and often does work both ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, can you describe the mechanism by which the ball is guided towards slots it hasn&#39;t landed in before?</p>

<p>You say a ball that has landed red 7 times is more likely to land black next time, but you don&#39;t describe how that happens. Does it matter if I switch out the ball? Does it matter if I switch out the wheel? What if the table sits vacant for a year, is it still more likely to come up black on the next spin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So probability takes this spinning ball and gently guides it towards the black slots instead of the red slots? You still never explained what mechanism allows probability to do that.</p>

<p>Anyway, my curiosity is sated. If you give a shit this article lays out various explanations of how you&#39;re totally wrong. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy</a></p>

<p>A coin toss is always 50/50 regardless of what the previous coin tosses are because neither the coin nor any other physical phenomenon has any idea what the previous outcomes were and has no physical mechanism to allow itself to land on heads or tails more often. This does not make a coin toss unfair. In fact it makes it perfectly fair since it&#39;s always a 50/50 proposition regardless of the past. In your reality it <em>would</em> be unfair because I could flip the coin ten times before the other person shows up and know which outcome it&#39;s &quot;due&quot; for now. Hopefully I don&#39;t grab the wrong coin, or does it matter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t believe in the mathematical concept of probability, the game becomes intrinsically unfair.</p>

<p>If the probability of an event is 1/2 the time, and you see, over the course of the last 10 or so events, they&#39;ve gone all the one way, what&#39;s to say that the probability of the next event going the other is effectively increased, since the probability over the course of infinite time will go to 1/2?</p>

<p>Because if that&#39;s not the case, then the wheel is unfair.</p>

<p>It would gain you an advantage, if you could call the coin, in the case you&#39;re listing, for the same reason.  But the reason the game is still fair is that you CAN lose -- and that&#39;s &quot;The Gambler&#39;s Fallacy&quot;.</p>

<p>I know your eventual theory is to say this guy was a gun-runner either gone rogue or bad or patsy to be shot beforehand.  The fact is that you CAN make money, but the casino will be metering what kind of risk you are, even if you gamble hundreds of thousands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are easier ways to launder money.  Also, to file tax returns where gambling is your income the state is extremely rigourous and requires all receipts and these are often checked.  If he filed a return stating 5 million then that&#39;ll be what he had a proven record of making.  Oh and just over 1% of people do make money gambling but don&#39;t try it because it takes years to become profitable and usually at the expense of your home, wife, kids, friends etc.  It&#39;s a long road that is paved with failure and huge losses.</p>

<p>The simplest way to launder money is through art.  Find a dirt cheap artist who&#39;s going nowhere, buy up a pile of their work, then sell an item at auction - have several friends bid the price up to how much you want for the guns, then the buyer of the guns bids the final amount, you get the money (less commission) he gets the guns and a worthless painting.  This is absolutely legal, can go on books and go under investigation - the only item sold in public was the artwork.  Why the fuck do you think dogshit modern art got to be worth anything?</p>

High return gambling machines, let&#39;s say 97% return (I don&#39;t recall seeing 99% video poker machines at Mandalay Bay) have to return the expressed return over the life of the machine, but it does run at 97% all of the time.  Since there is no guarantee when the machines are loose, this is not the most effective way to launder money.</p>
