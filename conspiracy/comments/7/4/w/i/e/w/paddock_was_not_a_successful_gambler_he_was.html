       His tax returns show that he made a profit of $5 million in 2015, mostly from gambling. Nobody makes 5 million dollars playing video poker. But if you already have millions in cash, playing $100 hands of video poker(which has around a 99% payback if played correctly) is a perfect way to launder money. There were reports that he was gambling very large amounts leading up to the shooting. Could he have been laundering cash from a down payment on a gun deal? He gets paid 50% cash for the guns up front, expecting the rest when the guns are delivered at the hotel. Rents the room a few days early and puts all that cash into video poker in order to launder it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video poker is know to be a popular money laundering scheme at casinos

       MGM Resorts has ties to companies from the Middle East (Dubai) that are owners of ports known to smuggle illegal weapons and terrorists
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Paddock is an accounting wizard that worked for the IRS's defense auditing team, an then was hired to work for the defense company(ies) himself, first on the books at Lockheed Martin
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock gets introduced through those defense and government entities to gun runners who sell American guns to nefarious groups around the world, and starts working with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better place to launder illegal gun money than through a casino on a machine that pays 99.7% which turns a blind eye to said gun running and laundering all with the wink wink of the US govt
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere in this scheme, this go-between and launderer get pissy at the US govt, and gets radicalized. Either that, or coerced with threats of force towards his family.

       Even if he did we gotta dig a little deeper. He's right simple traveling to a place bad things happen isn't enough. We would need at least the name of some one he meet there. It's a place to start but not the end of the line.

       ISIS and extremist groups would of wanted the attention and wouldn't of wanted the attack to be suspect. So who would want to use him as a patsy and for what motivation? Republicans control government so it wasn't the government doing a false flag. Government doesn't want to talk about gun control especially with Trump in the white house it would counter his base which he needs to cling to power. I agree patsy are a good way to cover things up I just don't see what group would benefit.

       I knew what you were commenting on.  I wasn't upset.  Just saying - Dubai is a top vacation destination.  I've seen on this sub a lot of people using that activity to prove radicalism. To hinge on his travels as proof of something requires a lot of information we don't have access to at the moment.

       Yeah I took the chief's comment to mean he could have been radicalized by another group (ANTIFA, etc). But one of the things that makes me suspicious is how quickly they claimed to have ruled out terrorism.

       No, these are both really stupid ideas of how to launder money. Laundering money doesn't mean trading one set of bills for another set of bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means creating the illusion of profit to turn illegal profits into legal ones. If you buy $100k in chips they're gonna take your info and know how may chips you bought. Same for putting $100k in a video poker machine.

       So, the issue with being a gun runner for terrorists in the Middle East is this.  Those terrorists are not going to be buying guns made in the US.  Far too expensive.  They're going to be buying the cheap AKs out of former Soviet Bloc countries.  Could he be a middle man?  Maybe, but I doubt it.  The guy is from the US, not known for speaking other languages or having ties to Eastern Europe/Africa.

       They aren't really buying guns for the caliphate.  They are taking advantage of dumbass America who is supporting gun running in the name of security.  They were trying to track a gun deal with some shady guys, and didn't realize they and/or Paddock had other ideas.  They started buying the guns just to get into contact with someone that could put them in a room with 23 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammo.  Or they got the launder to help them through this second mysery women no one is talking about.

       I think so too. A gun deal gone awry isn’t a bad theory, that’s the part that stands out. Even if you did bring ammunition it wouldn’t be loaded in mags. More than likely in bulk cases.

       How does the money laundering work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say I bet $5 million, come out even (profit is $0) then lie to the IRS and say I made a $5 million profit and pay taxes for that, then what the casino reports to the IRS doesn't match what I reported. Sure, the IRS may be happy to not ask questions, but wouldn't the FBI receive an alarm that money laundering patterns were exhibited?

       There is always room for movement when you are constantly cashing in a reportable amount of chips. If one does not always use their card, no actual way of knowing exactly how much was bet. Vegas cameras are good but not follow you around counting every spent dollar good.

       The claims are he played high stakes video poker, which is a laughable claim, anyone with a brain would know those machines are set up in their favor. I’d believe it more if he was playing actual hands and a good card counter or something but even then, casinos catch on and you get banned

       In the sense that people at those factories live in company housing next to the plant and walk across the street to the factory... like Steve staying in the hotel and walking down to the casino to start "work".  It's not a workcamp.

       I think I read that those machines pay out at like 98%.  It is an IDEAL way to launder money at the highest returns.  You have to play the cards right by the books, which Paddock seemingly would have been able to do.

       What is the Casino reporting that doesn't match?  In your example, let's say it's $100.  I come in, change in $100 of 'dirty' money for chips.  Wander around the casino, up and down, break even at 100.  Turn in my chips, and get a check for $100.  Report to the government that I won $100, pay tax, and go on with my life.  The casino doesn't keep a profit and loss statement on each patron.

       Obviously that small a number doesn't matter.  Let's say I'm in real estate.  I take in 5000 dollars in rent.  My neighbor has a buddy that wants to buy some guns, I put up 5000 cash, and it comes.back a month later as $10,000 (5000 was clean from the rental ptoperty, 5000 is profit from the sale of the guns).
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to buy a 3000 used car for my son.  I deposit the clean 5000 in the bank, but I can't just deposit the other 5.  I go the casino, get 5000 in chips.  Play for a while,  and lose 500.  I take my chips to the clerk and get a check for 4500 to deposit in the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I do my taxes, I declare the 4500 in winnings, and pay the tax on it.  With the 3000 remaining, I buy my son the used car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, small amount, you could get around this in cash.

       I realise that small a number doesn’t matter. Let’s say it’s the 5mil like he had. You can’t walk into a casino with 5mil, turn it into chips, “win” back 4.9mil and it’s suddenly clean. Where did the original 5 million come from?

       Yeah. This theory falls apart the higher you go in money. You could theoretically do this with tens of thousands of dollars if you're careful,  but once you get to a certain point it doesn't work the same way.

       There is 1 report that he made 5 million, we don't have any info on his losses for the year, if he was really playing that much money he'd have to claim all his wins and losses, you don't get to just subtract what you lost from what you won its all itemized when you're gambling that much money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The casinos are in it for the long haul, the guys who get 'banned' are the ones the casinos are convinced they can't beat and often they aren't really banned they just aren't allowed to play under whatever special rules they negotiated before hand.  The advantage player thing is complicated, its not just guys who are good at winning which is impossible on many of these machines its guys who convince the casinos to change odds in their favor, which for a slot guy would be convincing the casino to give him free plays, the casino gives these expecting the player to lose it all and then some back to them eventually, this isn't a one night/visit deal its a relationship between the casino and gambler that the casino believes they will end up getting the best of in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very often those big advantage players that claim to be banned are just not given special concessions they could easily go into a casino and lose their money at the regular tables like us.

       <em>
        video poker

       ...is there any evidence to suggest he never played anything BUT video poker? Or is that just what 4chan has been saying? Because the actual report reads “he made $5mil which is a combination of gambling AND investments.”

       Reminds me of that MIT blackjack scam that was running -- got banned out of at least one Vegas casino, got banned from the entire island of Aruba, and should've been shot and killed en masse for trying to take on Monte Carlo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shocked they were able to make it back to American soil, and double-shocked they weren't arrested and jailed for good immediately upon doing so.

       I know there are claimed cases, but at some point, the casino is either going to get a bust-out (like what that one who posted here was talking about) or will eventually get it from both ends and be forced to ban them -- this is why casinos employ Risk Management types on top of normal security.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a book called "The Smart Money", where the author goes in undercover for a massive sports-betting operation as a "beard", and is effectively banned out of Las Vegas within about a year or so.

       It would be different if he was counting cards playing blackjack. He was playing a machine in which the house has an edge, period. He gambled a large amount of money, just because he may win the casino is not going to ban him, hence comping him suites. They want him to continue to play so they get their money back.

       That's probably why he was able to keep playing, exactly what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with that theory is the concept that he was a known "advantage player" -- meaning he had knowledge of some mechanism (not cheating) that would allow him to, somehow, turn the tables.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the advantage player community knew of him (as the one who posted here claims they did), there's no way, with that kind of money involved, the Vegas people didn't either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a large difference between "just because he may win" and that he probably will -- if we are to believe the person who posted here about the guy, he was heading toward the latter, if not already there.

       Yeah, it is called strategy. An advantage player is able to be disciplined to always stick to that strategy. It's just like playing optimal strategy in blackjack with out counting cards. It lowers the house's edge.

       That's not advantage play, that's optimal strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advantage play adds something to the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in roulette, it's a coin flip (sans zeroes) to go red or black.  But what if you go to a wheel and see that the last seven or so spins have fallen red?
      </p>
      <p>
       Made a couple hundred on my last trip going that way -- that's a bit of advantage play.  You're using the law of averages against the casino in a way they may not (given scale) entirely approve of.

       you're an idiot if you think that is strategy. and makes anything you had to say on this matter moot. flip a coin 100 times just cause it was heads all 100 times doesnt mean 101 will be tails .. its 50/50 no matter what.

       As a math major who has done a fair share of work at probability, you are right on each case as isolated (hence, there is the Gambler's Fallacy) -- but, since you bet on a specific outcome, if you know the last 100 have been heads, you know that, over the course of an infinite number of throws, it has to go 100 or so the other way over the course of time...

       no .. it doesnt... it can be heads for infinity.. thats how it works. each new coin flip is 50/50.. as a math major you shld know this. but i think you are so far into your own world its clouding your judgment.

       It can be, but, as a mathematical concept, chances are it won't.  If you get 100 in a row the one way, then, as a mathematical concept, you would get 100 more the other way over the course of an infinite period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that infinite period of time which creates both the Gambler's Fallacy AND the concept of the game remaining fair for the casino.

       I'll play along: Do I know the stickers are swapped?   If so, red, because of the fact that it doesn't change that it hasn't hit those slots (which were black and are now red) in a while.  If not, black.

       Since you're indulging me, can you give us any description of the actual physical mechanism that guides the ball into a slot it hasn't landed in recently? What change in physics are we seeing occur after the ball comes up red several times?

       Also, if this effect were real, it would be trivially easy to demonstrate it happening in a large-scale experiment, yet no one has. There would also be a huge community of advantage gamblers making millions off of this casino oversight, yet as an advantage gambler myself I've never seen or heard of these people.

       It's called mathematics and probability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the course of an infinite number of throws, if a 50-50 proposition were to go +X one way, then the probability of it going the other way would increase as X increases, and normalize as X decreases.
      </p>

       Sorry, can you describe the mechanism by which the ball is guided towards slots it hasn't landed in before?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say a ball that has landed red 7 times is more likely to land black next time, but you don't describe how that happens. Does it matter if I switch out the ball? Does it matter if I switch out the wheel? What if the table sits vacant for a year, is it still more likely to come up black on the next spin?

       The mechanism is pure probability.  To assert otherwise makes the game unfair.

       So probability takes this spinning ball and gently guides it towards the black slots instead of the red slots? You still never explained what mechanism allows probability to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my curiosity is sated. If you give a shit this article lays out various explanations of how you're totally wrong.

       A coin toss is always 50/50 regardless of what the previous coin tosses are because neither the coin nor any other physical phenomenon has any idea what the previous outcomes were and has no physical mechanism to allow itself to land on heads or tails more often. This does not make a coin toss unfair. In fact it makes it perfectly fair since it's always a 50/50 proposition regardless of the past. In your reality it
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be unfair because I could flip the coin ten times before the other person shows up and know which outcome it's "due" for now. Hopefully I don't grab the wrong coin, or does it matter?

       If you don't believe in the mathematical concept of probability, the game becomes intrinsically unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the probability of an event is 1/2 the time, and you see, over the course of the last 10 or so events, they've gone all the one way, what's to say that the probability of the next event going the other is effectively increased, since the probability over the course of infinite time will go to 1/2?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if that's not the case, then the wheel is unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would gain you an advantage, if you could call the coin, in the case you're listing, for the same reason.  But the reason the game is still fair is that you CAN lose -- and that's "The Gambler's Fallacy".
      </p>
      <p>
       I know your eventual theory is to say this guy was a gun-runner either gone rogue or bad or patsy to be shot beforehand.  The fact is that you CAN make money, but the casino will be metering what kind of risk you are, even if you gamble hundreds of thousands.

       Vegas is full of full time gamblers. There are plenty of people who win consistently. Especially with poker and sports, but definitely a few through other games. I lived there for a long time and sports betting was my primary source of income for years. It isn't easy and I wasn't rich, but I sure as fuck knew people who were rich and only bet for income. The town has tons of pros. They are just vastly outnumbered by the people who lose. And the ultra-wealthy that love to gamble are what makes Vegas Vegas. They don't care if for every 20 whales that lose a million a year there is one pro who wins a million.

       My problem with this is he could put 5 million into a machine but only play 50,000. His win/loss would be based on the 50k not the 5 million. Otherwise you could just stick in a bunch of money , not play, and get free comps.

       Paddok had a players card he used for comps, these generally keep track of amount deposited, amount won and time played. I'd love to see the data from his card :)

       Here's the big problem.....when you risk millions, even hundreds of thousands, the casino will comp you whatever the fuck you want, suites, limos, send a helicopter to your house to bring you over to the strip, you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was using two (or more) players cards precisely because HE WAS NOT GAMBLING A TON OF MONEY.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was trying to play small amounts, stop, and have the casino try and win back his business sending him emails for free dinners, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is BS, a guy playing the kind of money he would need to in order to walk away with millions would be known as a whale, and he was not even close.

       It's bizarre that you think video poker is a good way to launder money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have $1M in coin-in and $900K in payouts... all you did is produce a $100K loss. You didn't launder anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were that simple no one would do anything else.

       thats why u have front men or businesses.. or sell a house and use that as your start up bankroll and clean up while your making dirty money on the side.. then you get to the point where your claiming a 5 million win in 2015 and it all started with the 300k from selling your house 5 years earlier.. its not rocket science.

       Was just thinking this last night.  So lets say he is into some dirty business. Hes a money launderer for some aort of organized crime, like the Netflix show Ozark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hea showing up at the casino, laundering the cash under his and perhaps gf name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes doing 5 mil a year in 2015 alone according to the news reports.  It could have gone up.

       The reason I doubt the "arms dealer" theory is the type of people who have millions to spend on illegal weapons aren't going to bother with stuff like AR15s with slidefire stocks. That's for hillbillies bumpfiring cheap wolf ammo into a pile of dirt on some farm.

       He'd been there since the 25th.  Why do you assume everything was left in the room when swat got there?  Multiple deals could have happened and what the FBI and police found in the room were just left over from the shooting.

       Why would Paddock carry around 23 legal AR15s and tons of ammo in addition to all the other weapons? Why would he store large amounts of illegal weaponry in his room over several days when a maid could accidentally walk in at any moment?

       That is a good question no matter what the narrative is.  Its way too much for a 10 minute rampage if he's truly the lone wolf.  And it would be risky to leave it all in there for multiple days if it was an arms deal.  The excessive amount of guns is one the stranger parts of the story.

       AR15s don't cost a few grand, the market is so saturated you can get one for under $500 these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you want one off the books there's no need to meet an international arms dealer on the 32nd floor of a hotel in the middle of the most heavily surveilled city in the US. Just go on Armslist or buy an 80% lower and a complete upper with cash.

       Someone on a terrorist watchlist can't just go to the gun store and buy an AR15.  That's why you have the guy with no criminal record buy them for you.  And, gun walking is a bit different from arms dealing.

       You can buy 80% lower receivers and complete them in your garage. Slap on an upper receiver (also paid with cash) and you're good to go with no paper trail at all. No need to meet an arms dealer in a hotel.

       Sure. But the ISIS guys could have walked into a CIA or FBI gun walking scheme after "someone" (gov't. informant) let them know that there's a guy who can get them lots of guns. Steve could have seemed like just shiesty enough of a guy to make them think that he was just in it for the money and wouldn't ask questions. They could have planned this whole incident but they didn't have to plan it THAT in depth (what you said) when a quick cash deal is presented to them.

       Its not out of the question that he made 5 mill from online poker. You go into some of those high roller tournaments where the minimal bet is 10(s) of thousand(s). He was a advantage player as we all know. Think about the WSOP player who wins top prize, its not unlikely at all even if he wasnt in a tournament like WSOP. He made 5 mill, you don't know how much he lost, hell' he could have broken even.

       There are easier ways to launder money.  Also, to file tax returns where gambling is your income the state is extremely rigourous and requires all receipts and these are often checked.  If he filed a return stating 5 million then that'll be what he had a proven record of making.  Oh and just over 1% of people do make money gambling but don't try it because it takes years to become profitable and usually at the expense of your home, wife, kids, friends etc.  It's a long road that is paved with failure and huge losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest way to launder money is through art.  Find a dirt cheap artist who's going nowhere, buy up a pile of their work, then sell an item at auction - have several friends bid the price up to how much you want for the guns, then the buyer of the guns bids the final amount, you get the money (less commission) he gets the guns and a worthless painting.  This is absolutely legal, can go on books and go under investigation - the only item sold in public was the artwork.  Why the fuck do you think dogshit modern art got to be worth anything?

       I've seen this idea about of laundering money through high return video poker  and I have to say it's a streach at best.  High return gambling machines, let's say 97% return (I don't recall seeing 99% video poker machines at Mandalay Bay) have to return the expressed return over the life of the machine, but it does run at 97% all of the time.  Since there is no guarantee when the machines are loose, this is not the most effective way to launder money.

       What if his winnings were actually payment, through the casino, for his illegal activities? Perhaps he was the recipient of the laundered money, as opposed to being the launderer.

       He gets rich, poses for the staged suicide photo, and takes the fall for the shooting. Now, he's off to Tel-Aviv for some plastic surgery, and the casinos get their DNA scramblers. Or, he gets offed, and the casinos get their DNA scramblers.

       Is anybody considering his claim of 5 million profit may have come from gambling more? Say he gambled 8 mil and only came away with 5 mil.  What’s the max he can claim each year?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real answer to all this is in his win/loss statement, which every casino would have on file for him to use on his taxes each year.

       Paddock is such a intelligence agency cut out patsy. You and I can hardly roll through a stop sign, go 8 miles over the speed limit, smoke a cigarette near a subway entrance or even miss a number on your tax returns without the government coming down on you. This guy is just gallivanting around sending hundreds of thousands overseas, winning 5 million at gambling, being a "numbers guy" for Lockheed Martin, 64 years old doing what a young special forces guy couldn't do and buying guns and air planes like fucking James Bond. The average man can't take one step side ways in this incredible police state built up around us and this dude gets around like that. No way. Knew a guy one time that just tried to smoke a little weed in a room in Vegas that set off some fire alarms and he got hemmed up real good. Security at those high class places is tight.

       People don’t realize (unless another comment has mentioned this), video poker in NV is not required to payout. See those signs at casinos altar say 99% payout? Video poker is not required to have any type of requirement like that.
