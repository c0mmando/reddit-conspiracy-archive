       If this guy was an illegal arms dealer (and this whole thing is basically Fast and Furious 2.0) then wouldn't it make perfect sense that his two main sources of income are the two most notorious ways to launder money??

       Why would ISIS spend 100k on less than 30 rifles? That is insane stupid.

       With 100k you could buy crates of them closer to home and not in a hotel room in Vegas.

       It seems youre suggesting that ISIS would travel from the ME to LV to buy guns and then travel back to the ME to use those guns instead of the more likely scenario of buying the guns in LV and use them in LV or other parts of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the $100,000 was just money sent to his GF, not the purchase price of the guns.   Paddock had millions of his own money that he could have used to send her $100k.

       If the plan was to buy the guns, shoot up the concert, and flee, then Paddock was clearly double-crossed.

       The guns where higher end AR15s and AR10s, that he bought legally since June. The estimated value of all these guns was about 100k. This is seperate from what he sent out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they were gonna use them in LV, why not go for better rifles or explosives? AKs (even the knock offs) could have killed more people because of their caliber. 2.23 vs 7.62. Why not get them from the Cartels already in the area and deal with some dude in a hotel room when Vegas is always packed with security?

       I can tell you why the US military uses the 5.56 vs the 7.62:  Accuracy at distance and lighter weight (so you can carry more ammo on you).  The 7.62 is a bigger bullet, but it is not traveling as fast and the ballistics are  much different between the two when they make contact and penetrate their targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, ARs look scarier than AKs, supposedly, and of course terrorists are going to want the scarier guns ;)

       Honestly, they both look the same to people who are scared of guns.

      <p>
       And bullet speed and drop have little bearing in the scenario of firing from a high vantage point down into a "barrel of fish".

       Could he be an ISIS operative, sure. He could have done it for ISIS but not looking likely.

       Im not convinced he was an ISIS operative. I think he was a gun dealer (independent, working for FBI? I dont know) and the deal went bad.  Im not convinced, at this point, that he was the shooter.  To me, it doesnt make sense and there is a lot of mystery around him that makes the official story suspect.

       I think if you're going with gun dealer, you need to go with "set up" rather than "deal gone bad." The concert is too convenient and hammers to break the windows. Unless there are concerts every night.

       Don't forget the ballistic characteristics of the 5.56. It creates a wound channel that is devastating. And not to many countries still use 7.62x39 (AK-47). Hell even the Russians who invented it don't. They use the 5.45x39 round for the same reasons we use the 5.56. It's light, shoots flat, and has a destructive wound channel.

       Could be for the actual effect for which, I believe, the AR was made. It is a small fast round, it makes small less lethal wounds. The idea is if you wound 1 guy, at least 1 other guy now has to carry him, so it is a 2 for 1 deal. In this circumstance, it makes for a next level terror weapon, because of all the wounds and screaming that comes after.

       The fact that my comment was downvoted and I've had to talk at length about how loud and lethal guns are today with people who haven't even shot guns before speaks volumes as to who is all on this sub right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our military isn't carrying guns designed to injure one so another carries him. That is a myth. These rounds are made to kill and stop the threat. That's kinda like saying 9mm are made to injure compared to 45s.

       I didn't mean you downvoted me, i meant other people. I literally had to explain to like 29 people gun are loud as fuck even with suppressors.

       I believe the gun control thing is very plausible. Push an unsteady guy off the edge to push legislation. Why not? They've done worse. Honestly, it's the most plausible.

       It might be smalll but the idea is not to wound but cause devastating damage.. the 5.56/.223 round is designed to tumble when it hits an individual and it will rip you to shreds inside. The amount of animals I’ve kill with this round trust me it’s devastating. And for the guy who was supposedly shot 3 Times in the chest and survived, I highly doubt that!

       If Paddock was indeed an illegal arms dealer, then who knows what they were meeting about. They could have been meeting just to discuss a deal that would be happening just as you describe--closer to home--and found out it was a setup so they killed him and framed him for the shootings to keep the heat off their guys?  I mean there's a million explanations, but yeah I don't think they were paying 100k for 30 guns.

       10 and 30 round mags are everywhere. The best high capacity mags are made by Surefire and are 60 and 100 round capacity. I’m not familiar with anyone making a 50rd mag, but I could be wrong.

       The CIA is involved with the funding of groups like that but what you people fail to realize is when their ideas don't align anymore they cut them off. Usually by then these groups are somewhat established so they don't need a 'handler of sorts' anymore and they think why do we need you anymore.

       Why would the CIA/fbi plan to frame an 'agent' in a LV hotel on the strip? Then create the deadliest shooting in modern times. I call fake story and y'all eating this shit up like crazy. Remember we got alot of info from 4chan anon's. Perfect place to start disinformation

A full auto M16 goes for over 25k A colt LMG $75k full auto guns sold to civilians are insane. 100k for 30 guns is 3k per gun... not a bad deal at all.

       What are you talking about? I’m responding to a comment about why Isis would pay $100000 for 30 guns when they could “buy a crate of guns closer to home.“ $100,000 for 30 fully automatic weapons would be a good deal. I’m not exactly sure what you’re referring to or why you’re calling me a liar.

       You claimed they are fully auto they are not. That's a lie, they are bump fire.

       There is a difference, learn it if you want to keep talking. 100k for those rifles is over paying by A LOT.

       I’m not talking about the guns in the room. I’m addressing your questions why would ISIS pay 100k for 30 rifles. You then went on to say they could have got a crate of rifles closer to home for 100k so I didn’t assume you were talking about the rifles found at the scene.

       SAWs are way louder and would spit more rounds making them sound different.

      <p>
       100k for 30 rifles in ANY situation is stupid expensive. And why buy them legally to sell? Just buy them off a person online, no paperwork and less hassle.

       Again, im talking about buying 30 fully auto weapons since that is what I was under the impression you were talking about when you mentioned buying a crate of guns for 100k. I then pointed out the going rate for several fully auto weapons. Yes SAW’s do sound different, that is the point.

       Players are tracked more than you will ever know, especially the big ones.  The casino will generally know how a ballpark figure about how much up or down their big players are at all times.  You don't buy in for huge amounts at the cages and just walk around with the chips.

       Let me reiterate, you just said casinos get angry about people buying in and losing money all over the place. Other than keeping track for Currency Transaction Report compliance, they love this kind of activity more than you can possibly imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're wondering about how to fake a win (which is what the "professional gambler" would want to do) this can be accomplished by pulling chips out of the pocket while playing, making it appear that these chips were won rather than purchased, and creating the paper trail that the "professional gambler" wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even easier in a location the casino doesn't watch heavily, such as the poker room (since their money is not at risk).

       there are so many cameras in any casino, you'd be surprised

       He's obviously losing money, as his brother says the casinos comp him a ton. You don't give huge perks to consistently winning players, unless they play cash poker at high stakes earning lots of rake. This guy played slots.

       I think this sub would benefit a lot if people cited why someone is wrong, rather than just say they're wrong.

       Problem companion wasn't kidnapped. Most likely he got in a cartel way over his head that hates trump,  they kept him in style, they used him, drugged him with something often ( people said he had mommy issues when drunk, hate and angry was already in him ). They convenience him, they had a plan that included escape but cartel double crossed him leaving him as the patsy and they have no loose ends. Humm Hispanic women playing with people hair and telling people they all are going to die 45 minutes before the massacre. Accountant with algorithms in casino ffs he was laundering money lol..

       You sure? I read 200-250k. But point is, the area I live houses are going for over a million (I don't own a house, living with my ma right now). The people here I don't consider rich. It's described as a middle class area. Just saying that, even if it was 400k, it's not as much money as people seem to be implying.

       It really depends on the area. Even just in my state, 100,000 will get you vastly different homes in the north part vs the south. Housing prices are not consistent, just as local wages aren't.

       I don't think real estate is a traditional money laundering business...Also, if he was an arms dealer, why would he bring all of that live ammo to a deal? Guns, sure, but live ammo? That would just be stupid.

       Also nobody cares if you pay contractors in cash and nobody asks how you paid for the $25k of laminate flooring, carpet, tile, fixtures, appliances, etc. You could literally go into Menards dressed in clothes from the dumpster behind the thrift store and buy a $1500 washer/dryer with a roll of $20s covered with cocaine dust and nobody would bat an eye. Just another contractor working on a fancy house. Never thought about it before, but you could sink a ton of cash into renovating a property without any questions about where is came from, then sell it and take the check to the bank.

       Question: Ignoring irregularities has anybody here made any complex argument why this whole thing appears to warrant a conspiracy? I mean what do you guys believe really happened and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy snapping and mowing down people is sadly nothing new. What is your starting point for arguing towards a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       When things like this happened I personally always assumed that with billions of peoples it is bound to happen that some snap and their brains just stop working properly. Most don't have the tools, finances or finesse to pull something like this off.

       This happens so frequently that I personally think the most reasonable explanation is that he snapped like hundreds before him but instead of stabbing his children during their sleep he did this, because like I said he was able to pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a major difference between terror attacks and such events ( If I am correct ). Terror attacks are deliberate and based on some kind of rational argument ( even if it wrong ) while such shooting sprees are often caused by people whose brains stop working properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do people see the evidence or at least circumstantial evidence that this is anything but a guy snapper and trying to go out with a bang?

       Personally, I think it's worth investigating because it "just doesn't add up" and I think that is on purpose, to make this a gun issue and not a mental health/terrorism issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, the shooter has such a plain benign MO "Middle age, white accountant with no previous gun history" but for some reason he decided to purchase a ton of guns and kill innocent people. This causes people to think "well if a regular ol' white accountant could snap, so could ANYONE right?, and if that's the case, we better take away the guns!".
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR- It's a text-book case for gun control, and could have been designed to make this a gun issue, and only a gun issue.

       I mean. What doesn't add up? In my post I said he appears to be a normal guy whose brain got fried one morning. In contrast to the average person who has such things happen to him, he had more money and was likely smarter so the fallout was bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people think this is somehow so mysterious. Every new information I have seen somehow feels it fits right nicely. Where is the part that doesn't add up? People snap.

       I'm not making a decision one way or another, it's very possible he just "snapped" and I'm not ruling that out because mental sickness is a huge problem in North America.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible this was a pre-meditated conspiracy to push a gun control agenda. I think right now it's logical and important to explore both possibilities.

       But my point is. what is your basis for this? I understand where you are coming from but I have not seen and well thought out argument how this looks like a false flag or anything. Obviously the event is extremely special and therefore much to consider but even those who are actively searching for a conspircary don't even offer a proper theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks more like "a major event happened let's look how this could be a false flag", which in itself is fine but to me, it looks like nothing came out of it at all.

       While I do see the logic in this, I don't understand the timing - would a Republican Presidency, Senate and Congress not hugely impede this argument? Seems better to do this during a Democratic swing instead of one where a large right-wing base is heavily mobilized.

       For me, it's the dad. Paddock's father being FBI Most Wanted and straight up disappearing from their lives is just wild and I can't wrap my head around it. Combined with Paddock himself being so un-noteworthy that he didn't even have a ticket on his license... I'm not convinced of any theory, I'm just poking around to see what I find, if anything. I can't even explain why his father's history has me so engrossed in Paddock himself's actions; it just does.

       Well he has to work somewhere. Again this only makes it more unlikely to be false flag IMO. Besides his skin colour he is a pretty special guy, I don't see why you would take someone like him but then again everybody can snap and at some point, it had to be a guy with enough money to do such thing. People at the concert likely were out of luck he had money, if not he would have stabbed some people and we would have never heard about it

       I 100% agree with you and it's more than likely that's what this is, but this guy didn't 'snap'. This guy had almost 50 weapons in his possession, specifically told his girlfriend to leave the country and wired $100,000 weeks before. We have to stop saying he "snapped" when this was methodically planned out for god knows how long, especially as he had no recorded history of mental illness.

       A problem is that we now thinkg Lockheed Martin is weird because it is "exactly" that. Assume he would have worked for the FBI, you would say the same, assume he was a cop you would say the same, assume he would have worked for a major bank, you would have said the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a big variety of jobs that would have created a comparable reaction in this community but for slightly different reasons. This is what I mean with "he had to work somewhere".  He apparently was smart and somehow made a good buck very many jobs that fit into this life would have rigged your alarm bells. Earlier I said his special life resulted in this "special" event if he would have been an average american he would have been unable to pull this off. Imagine he would have been in the military like millions others, you would have likely said "well he was in the military so they got to him".
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel this makes it just more unlikely that he was somehow choosen, his history and stuff is too "special".

        We're at the crux of it - a lot of discussion in this sub is around him being used as a pawn or patsy by some other organization, which I'm not convinced of either, so I think we've been arguing separate points to the same conclusion.

       My initial post asked for some kind of complete argument that puts those oddities into one frame. That's exactly what I meant, I have not seen anybody give a good explanation for this even an entirely theoretical one. I have not seen a reasonable "why" here. Some moon conspiracy theories have a better basis.

      <p>
       I have the feeling this major event made people immediately search for weird stuff ( that's ok ) and people are unable to calm down and say that at the moment there is hardly anything "suspicious" besides him being a guy with a weird history. Not seen any good theory why this was not just a guy who snapped and sadly had access to a lot of resources. What I agree with some "trump supporters" the silence about his political views lets me believe that he was likely leftish but that's obviously not really a conspiracy

       No, it isn't obvious at all. Paddock didn't rob a gas station or even do something he gave a shit about coming out of alive. Shooting a whole bunch of people at once is so unremarkable that kids do it at their schools with depressing regularity. There's absolutely nothing about this that required a mastermind. What was there to fuck up? Get guns in room, shoot out window. Literally that simple.

       Consider a few things. 
1- There is no identifiable motive or cause. He has clean background (clean background check), Also a pilot (means he had a clean mental health evaluation), no political or religious affiliation, wealthy, elderly, etc. his neighbors and own family are all confused. No weird online groups, or videos, etc.

      <p>
       2- There was no standoff, he was simply found dead.

       3- Casinos have incredible security, how does someone lug 10+ suitcases up to his room, without any suspicion? additionally, how did it take over 10 minutes to get to his room? If I were to touch a dealer the wrong way I'll be escorted out within seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       4- What is a successful accountant doing gambling 10-30k a day on slots and video poker. for someone mathematically inclined there are games that provide much better winning odds. He is a prime candidate for laundering. He has professional accounting skills, few close friends, regular large international money transfers, and is actively engaged in two of the top laundering platforms (gambling and RE)

       Considering the past 4 times more leniant gun laws were to be voted on there were mass shootings days before the vote which suspended it, its too convenient. Also, when this happens a Dem and the MSM all call for stricter gun laws within 24 hours of the tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this just a coincidence that HillClin called for banning suppressors on Monday (one day after shooting and 2 days before vote) when suppressors wernt even reported to be used in the hotel. I am so not a conspiracy theorist and laugh most of the time how insane people sound but this massacre is really making me grieve and I cant stop with out knowing what really happened and what the reason was for this. I doubt we will be told anything other than he was sick, if thats the case I will quit drinking, get in shape and start stockpiling ammo and supplies because shit isnt right to me. I can almost feel a race/civil war on our doorstep and I need to be prepared to defend my family and country of we cant rely on USG. Fucking sucks

       I have no idea who "they" even are but its just too coincidential for me to go along. Its insane that the first (I think) was a Republican charity Baseball team that was targeted THE DAY OF THE FIRST VOTE. I dont know whos behind it, but killing American citizens to keep them from suppressors is the most evil thing ive ever heard. Its worse than actially relaxing gun laws because you are causing the reason you say we shouldnt be allowed to purchase them...

       I think killings sprees happen in every country. In my country ( Germany ) people who go nuts grab a knife and kill their family, in the US those people have access to different tools and the fallout is bigger. That is why I don't see a good reason to believe this was somehow planned.

       Right. I understand that people snap, this just doesnt feel like it to me. Hillary tweeted very shortly after about how we need to ban silencers to stop violence like this bur silencers wernt even used. This was 2 days before the vote. I stole this from an article and it checks out.

       This didn't used to happen so frequently.  It started happening right around the time it became easy to control these kinds of narrative by controlling the television production crews that put the news together.   Why would one man bring that many guns to his hotel room?  Obviously he wasn't using all those to do the shooting.  He couldn't have needed more than a few--why two dozen? If this was   Fast and Furious 2.0, there's no way the FBI are going to let the public know this time--because this tragedy is WAY worse. Read

       People kill their own families all the time. Not sure why people here think this is rare. Happens every year in Germany that a family father snaps and for some incomprehensible reason starts to kill their entire family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such events are just different in the US because the people have easier access to weapons which allows them to creat a greater mess. People snapping and going on a rampage is nothing new and happens every year in big countries.

       Yeah but when a man snaps and kills his family, it's in the heat of the moment. If this dude did all this himself, it would have had to take him a lot of time and effort. Lots of planning.  Even so, why drag 2-dozen guns up to that room?  1 guy has no use for more than a backup set.

       That's not necessarily true. First of all I don't know Paddocks motives  I personally assume the most likely factor was a psychological event and no political motive or no rational motive at all. If this is true then Paddocks behaviour is nothing special. Man sometimes grab their kids from school then execute them then drive to their own mothers and kill them too. Those are not necessarily impulse situations I don't talk about a guy losing it in an argument and killing somebody I talk about people snapping and then starting to kill everybody off the know. This is not that rare, but like I said often those are people less capable and it only hits the close surroundings of the person.

       In his mind I would argue, that all possibilities considered, he didn't ever want to run out of ammo or barrels. He had no money constraints he was making sure to not run out of firepower. Makes total sense to me. take any school shooting anywhere people bring everything they got, they never want to run out of ammo. I am not talking about the US exclusively. People who run amok bring everything they got, always. They loaded up with guns often bombs as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is totally normal behaviour for a guy going berzerk but he had more money to do stuff like that.

       Yeah, because historically these shooters have never had more than a dozen guns.  The statement is patently false even in THIS example.  (The dude left half his guns at home!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would he lug literally 4 times more guns up to the 32nd floor than he could possibly need?  Unless of course there was another guy shooting out of the second window. I would assume if that is the case, that neither shooters were the dead guy on the floor with clean bullets and bullet casings dropped all over his pool of blood.

       Iam not seeing what you try to say. You think he brought too many guns? How much is to much if you plan on dieing while shooting on thousands of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean how does this make you suspect? He brought a lot of guns like dozens if not hundreds of persons running amok before him.

       Then why didn't he bring ALL his guns?  Why did he leave half of them at home?  (Clearly he didn't NEED them, that's why he didn't bring them.)  He obviously had a NEED for those weapons and the NEED was certainly not to fire them all himself. There is a very good chance he brought all those extra guns for the same reason I brought two-dozen extra forks to my company potluck last month.

       One of his houses was at Ground Zero in FL housing-bubble-land(central Florida). It's really easy to get comfortably rich playing around in these areas if you can put in enough in the beginning. I'd "bet" that his gambling winnings aren't that impressive in toto.

       Side note in regards to his financial situation: what happens to his assets and money in the bank now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve never wondered about a mass killer’s assets or money before, because it’s never come up before in previous cases, at least from what I can remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       Him being a multimillionaire doesn’t fit the “typical profile.” But, he did it (or is blamed to be the culprit, whatever you want to believe). Either way, when somebody commits an act such as this, what happens to his financials afterward? Seized by the government or passed along to next of kin or whomever he designated in a will? General curiosity here.

       Class what's wrong with this picture, makes millions as gambling account, worked with arms contractors, owned air planes, foreign travels, foreign wife.. hummm casinos and real estate can be way that cartels launder money. Odd how a nutty Hispanic women told people at the festival "you all are going to die today " while harassing them and was tossed by security. There are multiple people reporting this ( very credible looking), zero footage from security cameras coming out as did with Boston bombers incident. 
Country music is associated with Republicans ( perfect target for those hating Trump and wanting gun control) .. yet our media and government is dumb founded c'mon he was either a out of work agent went rouge or there are elements in our government that desire to get power back by horrible means. If he was solely a cartel the feds would be all over this not scrubbing records and hiding video footage. Why are they asking for private camera footage when every inch of that city is under surveillance?

       Let's be logical for a second. Why would an arms dealer have platforms set up in his windows? Even if it was, by a stretch of the imagination, an arms deal gone bad which resulted in a shootout, why would someone take the time to go to two windows to shoot down at a random concert thousands of feet away? Why not get the fuck out of there once the shit started going down? Who in their right mind would stay there, give away their firing position to a crowd of 20000 people, and only after that, try to escape? These arms deal theories, along with the other conspiracy theories are just guesses at this point. The direction we should be looking in is what was on those cameras and what was on that note on his table. Also, if the leaked receipt is accurate, there may have been an accomplice. Even the sheriff, who's up for re-election next year, hasn't ruled that out.

       That would be true if ISIS hadn't taken credit for this event.  If he was meeting with ISIS in a Fast and Furious style weapons negotiation, it would explain the cameras and reason he brought so many guns and ammo.  If ISIS had planned all along to conduct that massacre, he could have easily been a stooge.  If ISIS outsmarted the FBI, they aren't gonna want the public to find out about it, seeing as how this is the worst massacre in modern history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The direction we should be looking is ISIS--those psychopathic murderers who have never before this taken credit for massacres they weren't connected to.

       From a Slate.com article published 3 days ago: "Terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank suggests in a Twitter thread Monday that ISIS’s claims seem to be getting less reliable. The group claimed credit for a June attack that killed 37 people at a casino in Manila, Philippines, which appears to have actually been a botched robbery by an indebted gambler. ISIS also claimed, after a British Airways flight at Charles de Gaulle Airport was evacuated last month, that it had planted bombs there. There were no bombs, and the evacuation was due to an unrelated incident."

       I mean. What doesn't add up? In my post I said he appears to be a normal guy whose brain got fried one morning. In contrast to the average person who has such things happen to him, he had more money and was likely smarter so the fallout was bigger.

        Think about it, the shooter has such a plain benign MO "Middle age, white accountant with no previous gun history" but for some reason he decided to purchase a ton of guns and kill innocent people. This causes people to think "well if a regular ol' white accountant could snap, so could ANYONE right?, and if that's the case, we better take away the guns!".

       While I do see the logic in this, I don't understand the timing - would a Republican Presidency, Senate and Congress not hugely impede this argument? Seems better to do this during a Democratic swing instead of one where a large right-wing base is heavily mobilized.

        Isn't that obvious? The entire incident wasn't doable for a "normal" person, with normal I mean average. You underestimate how much possibilities there are to fuck up stuff like that. The average shmo is too dumb to rob a gas station without showing its face to the camera or trip over his own foot.

       No, it isn't obvious at all. Paddock didn't rob a gas station or even do something he gave a shit about coming out of alive. Shooting a whole bunch of people at once is so unremarkable that kids do it at their schools with depressing regularity. There's absolutely nothing about this that required a mastermind. What was there to fuck up? Get guns in room, shoot out window. Literally that simple.

       But this has happened many times and nothing has happened with gun control. So what's your actual point?

       Besides, you didn't know the guy personally. He could be fucking nuts.

       SAWs are way louder and would spit more rounds making them sound different.

       100k for 30 rifles in ANY situation is stupid expensive. And why buy them legally to sell? Just buy them off a person online, no paperwork and less hassle.
