    <div class="md"><p>i said nothing about helicopters.  many police train with rifles, even in thier own time.  I dont believe a sniper would have to be above this guy to hit him.  shooting from the ground is not an impossible or hard thing to do when someone is filling the frame of a window.  we even have special optics that would allow them to see his figure.  sorry but there still hasnt been someone who knows the protocols saying anything about why a sniper wasnt used.</p>

<p>Yes, they do. Most police departments now issue an AR15 patrol carbine, because shotguns had a bad habit of hitting innocent people. There are whole product lines marketed toward this market segment:</p>

<p>If even one round goes through a window above/below/beside that window, thats a failure the police have to answer to.</p>

<p>Without a proper rifle that can actually hit the target at range, all they&#39;d be doing is endangering the people in the hotel too.</p>

<p>Where he was shooting from there weren&#39;t any tall buildings in a good line of sight to get a good shot into the rooms. Plus if it took SWAT 72 minutes to breach I&#39;m sure it would have been just as long to get a sniper up and running. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a detail many people seem to have missed in all the news reporting. The actual shooting only took place over a span of about ten minutes. About five minutes later, police were outside the hotel room door. When the police announced themselves, Paddock fired at them (blind, presumably) through the door. For the next just-under-an-hour-or-so it was a barricaded-shooter situation, as Paddock wasn&#39;t shooting at anything, either into or out of the building.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read any accounts of the details of what went on during that hour, but we can make some educated guesses. The first rule of responding to a casualty situation is not to become a casualty yourself, so it&#39;s pretty safe to assume that once Paddock stopped shooting, it became a question of how to get him out of the room without anybody getting hurt or killed. It&#39;s possible the police tried to talk him into surrendering by yelling through the door, perhaps even not knowing that by that time he was already dead. But whatever the case, I bet the question was &quot;Do we have to go in there?&quot; and nobody wanted to say &quot;Yes&quot; to that until all other options had been exhausted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he was on the 32 you aren&#39;t shooting him from the ground. First off where are you getting a high powered rifle and a marksman? Because if you miss you might kill someone else. It lasted for 10-15 min that just wasn&#39;t realistic. The only realistic thing was a group of cops/armed civilians breach, flashbang and take out asap. But they just didn&#39;t know what the fuck was going on man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how long does it take someone to set up as a sniper? this is the info im curious about.  if you look at the timeline based off the police scanners they were on the 31st floor almost immediately but it wasnt until almost an hour later that the suspect is found dead.  your saying this isnt enough time?</p>
