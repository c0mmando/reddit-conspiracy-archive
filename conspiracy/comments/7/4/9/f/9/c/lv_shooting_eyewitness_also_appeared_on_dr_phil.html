    <div class="md"><p>First time I watched the interview I was like &quot;Damn girl please shut up and let your mate speak, stop playing with your perfect hair and showing off your perfect make up&quot; 
then I told myself to shut up because who knows maybe she&#39;s just a good looking girl who maintains a level head. Only I know if I was there my make up would be all over my face. THEN I saw people linking it to the Dr Phil show, but I really don&#39;t know. that&#39;s an old episode and if it is the same person she looks pretty much the same, no aging or style change...
But it&#39;s not impossible for teenage/adult girls to look extremely similar. I was trying to search for the girl in the interviews name &amp; age but couldn&#39;t find it anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know three people that have been on TV in some way, are they crisis actors now? Or is it possible, even if this is the same girl, that a girl who was once on television went to a vegas concert with tens of thousands of other people?</p>

<p>What is it you think they tell/promise these so called actors? I know what crowds on demand is, it&#39;s for politicians or community groups that don&#39;t have a lot of support to look like they do so that hopefully other people support them or they can get some media attention. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t just pull in some bitch from taco bell, offer her $15 an hour to do interviews on a mass shooting and everything goes great.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually considered that myself.. definition of dox:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dox</p>

<p>däks/verb, informal, gerund or present participle: doxxing</p>

<p>search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the Internet, typically with malicious intent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the lack of malicious intent is important.. but then again, because someone got her full name, someone else got her Twitter, and now someone&#39;s potentially harassed her on Twitter.. do actors and famous people deserve to be harassed by paparazzi? Does some girl who&#39;s a no one but has been on TV twice deserve it? (Sorry if girl who is a no one ends up seeing this!)</p>

<p>Here is where you need to focus, this is a crisis actor (sure you can say coincidence, or whatever) but she is an actor, she has been on a nationally televised fake tv show (80% of the people that go on these shows just want to get in front of a camera and get a free hotel stay and trip out of) there was an ad placed in las vegas searching for crisis actors, somehow she got infront of CNN reporter immediately after she got out and tells her story, it sounds legit, it might be legit, but 2 of the 3 condition have been met for her to be a crisis actor (she has acting experience, she happened to be at the right place at the right time with CNN) the only thing missing is how she got there which someone could probably find her facebook page or twitter or something to help clarify that up. </p>

<p>I think the lack of malicious intent is important.. but then again, because someone got her full name, someone else got her Twitter, and now someone&#39;s potentially harassed her on Twitter.. do actors and famous people deserve to be harassed by paparazzi? Does some girl who&#39;s a no one but has been on TV twice deserve it? (Sorry if girl who is a no one ends up seeing this!)</p>
