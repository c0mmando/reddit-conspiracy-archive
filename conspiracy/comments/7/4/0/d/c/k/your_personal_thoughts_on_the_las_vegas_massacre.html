       What does everyone, here, think about the Las Vegas Massacre? There are a lot of different conspiracy theories out there, right now, about how there were multiple shooters and that he wasn't even on the 32 floor or he was on the 32nd floor but the real gunman was on a lower floor...
      What do you think, personally, after watching so many different stories from all news channels?

      <p>
       BEST EVIDENCE OF TWO OR MORE SHOOTERS.!!!
watch this video from a cab driver that was at the Mandalay Bay during the first shots and you can clearly hear two sets of gunfire. You can here the first shots very clearly about 60 seconds into it then you here more gunshots, clearly farther away and the cab driver even mentions that they were further away. About another minute later you here the gunfire close by and before the firing stops you can hear the second gunfire start before the closer fire stops. To me, this is clear evidence and the best evidence, so far, that there were two or more gunmen!

       I pretty much believe the MSM narrative so far... I don't think there were multiple gunmen, but there had to be a conspiracy theory applied.... I'd go with this dude being a patsy and was dead before the shooting even started.

       That's what I'm leaning towards as well. I believe the shooting was in that room and that room only but I'm not sure I believe that he was the one doing it. If If were to see footage of him carrying all the stuff to his room and no one else go in or out of the room until the cops went in then It would be more believable but until then I find it hard to believe

       You are correct there. Anything that doesn't infringe on our current rights. But that doesn't mean that they can't make new laws to make it difficult to own your own weapons. An example is the 10 round magazine limit.

       It was an act of Congress. But that law expired and is now up to the individual states.

       I don't even see Trump as a puppet. He's literally powerless. The second he treads on their toes, he's done. Read a book called The Devil's Chessboard by David Talbot.

       Yeah, they are already using it to their advantage. Hillary is saying " what could have happened if he had a silencer?" And everyone else is saying ," a silencer would melt on assault rifle." That's Stupid because a Silencer doesn't really make a gun very much quieter. It's not like the movies where it sounds like a silent fart...

       Patsy executed and framed. Concert goers were sacrificial lambs for deep state policy pushing. Many deep state investors are profiting off of blood donations and gun stock surges. Anyone who asks for the reasonable evidence of unedited surveillance footage will be labeled a conspiracy nut.

       As far as conspiracy goes I just like the fact that a paddock, is an enclosure, meant to be for your animals in outdoor living quarters. Technically it is called a sacrifice area because you are giving up use of that small portion of land as an area to the animals and benefit from it. It happened it’s Yom Kippur a holiday where they sacrifice cattle, goats. Lockheed Martin has a part of the unicursal hexagram in their logo. The place it happened is the ideal sacrifice altar.

       I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. I don't believe it was a fake shooting, but I just cant understand the motivation. Maybe he was just had a completely messed up mind. I just don't understand why people want to cause so many others so much pain, but its just the mind of a evil person. I'll never be able to understand, but this is just such a sad situation. I do believe a majority of these USA controversies are trying to move us towards marshal law, but I expect it to get much worse for that to come in effect.

       Yeah it was definitely a real shooting just like 9/11 was a real terrorist attack! It's very possible that the very same group of people behind the Boston bombing and 9/11 and so forth are the very same people behind this.

       I go back to the book "Programmed to Kill.." by McGowan and I'm reminded of the underlying tone of it.  It's almost as if he's saying no human would do these kinds of things to another human/s on their own.  I think of the millions of people in America who have the ability to do such things, but don't.

       The oddest part is the wounded security guard. I don't know if Paddock was a complete patsy or the security guard was the second shooter on the second window and then escaped after killing Paddock, but it seems real fishy to me. I don't want to talk about motive yet though, I think its too soon and we need more info.

       It is difficult to say at this point, but I just go on what people are talking about. His "Lover" was in Tokyo at the time. They have not said whether she was on vacation or on a business trip. We can speculate that if they were having Relationship Issues, it's possible that she had broken up with him and he was just drunk and blind with rage. Maybe she snuck off with another man and he found out about it or she told him. 
       So that is the more conservative theory but there are too many other thing that people are saying that absolutely make sense. I have seen videos and the most popular one right now has a pretty good veiw of the hotel as the shots are being fired so that tells me that, either, he was only one of the gunmen or he wasn't a gunmen and they made it look as though he was firing from that room after the fact.
         I remember looking for Windows that we're broken, all over that building but I couldn't see any broken as it was happening...

       That would be the world's bravest security guard if his story is exactly as we've been told.  Definitely possible, but most wouldn't risk their lives with police on the way.

       It was a real shooting, but I don't think Steve Paddock did it. I've watched all the videos, shots were coming from the 4th and 12th floor. Multiple eye witness accounts of multiple shooters, dude on 4chan warning about an incident in Las Vegas. If it doesn't make sense it's not true.

       Multiple shooters will have left fingerprints, which we'll know about eventually. They would have been captured by hall surveillance cameras the same as activity on other floors. Other than the perpetrator(s), nobody has any reason to hide what really happened. It's awfully early, when nobody knows squat, to start making up stories. The simplest and most likely explanation remains that a wealthy guy nut went berserk and shot a bunch of people, a random and unpredictable event. Had there been logical antecedents, it might have been predicted and prevented.

       BEST EVIDENCE OF TWO OR MORE SHOOTERS.!!!
watch this video from a cab driver that was at the Mandalay Bay during the first shots and you can clearly hear two sets of gunfire. You can here the first shots very clearly about 60 seconds into it then you here more gunshots, clearly farther away and the cab driver even mentions that they were further away. About another minute later you here the gunfire close by and before the firing stops you can hear the second gunfire start before the closer fire starts. To me, this is clear evidence and the best evidence, so far, that there were two or more gunmen!

       Yeah it was definitely a real shooting just like 9/11 was a real terrorist attack! It's very possible that the very same group of people behind the Boston bombing and 9/11 and so forth are the very same people behind this.
