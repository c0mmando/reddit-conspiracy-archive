        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What does everyone, here, think about the Las Vegas Massacre? There are a lot of different conspiracy theories out there, right now, about how there were multiple shooters and that he wasn&#39;t even on the 32 floor or he was on the 32nd floor but the real gunman was on a lower floor...
      What do you think, personally, after watching so many different stories from all news channels?</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/WNiRr763gJA">https://youtu.be/WNiRr763gJA</a> </p>

<p>BEST EVIDENCE OF TWO OR MORE SHOOTERS.!!!
watch this video from a cab driver that was at the Mandalay Bay during the first shots and you can clearly hear two sets of gunfire. You can here the first shots very clearly about 60 seconds into it then you here more gunshots, clearly farther away and the cab driver even mentions that they were further away. About another minute later you here the gunfire close by and before the firing stops you can hear the second gunfire start before the closer fire stops. To me, this is clear evidence and the best evidence, so far, that there were two or more gunmen!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m leaning towards as well. I believe the shooting was in that room and that room only but I&#39;m not sure I believe that he was the one doing it. If If were to see footage of him carrying all the stuff to his room and no one else go in or out of the room until the cops went in then It would be more believable but until then I find it hard to believe </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as conspiracy goes I just like the fact that a paddock, is an enclosure, meant to be for your animals in outdoor living quarters. Technically it is called a sacrifice area because you are giving up use of that small portion of land as an area to the animals and benefit from it. It happened it’s Yom Kippur a holiday where they sacrifice cattle, goats. Lockheed Martin has a part of the unicursal hexagram in their logo. The place it happened is the ideal sacrifice altar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I go back to the book &quot;Programmed to Kill..&quot; by McGowan and I&#39;m reminded of the underlying tone of it.  It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s saying no human would do these kinds of things to another human/s on their own.  I think of the millions of people in America who have the ability to do such things, but don&#39;t.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oddest part is the wounded security guard. I don&#39;t know if Paddock was a complete patsy or the security guard was the second shooter on the second window and then escaped after killing Paddock, but it seems real fishy to me. I don&#39;t want to talk about motive yet though, I think its too soon and we need more info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is difficult to say at this point, but I just go on what people are talking about. His &quot;Lover&quot; was in Tokyo at the time. They have not said whether she was on vacation or on a business trip. We can speculate that if they were having Relationship Issues, it&#39;s possible that she had broken up with him and he was just drunk and blind with rage. Maybe she snuck off with another man and he found out about it or she told him. 
       So that is the more conservative theory but there are too many other thing that people are saying that absolutely make sense. I have seen videos and the most popular one right now has a pretty good veiw of the hotel as the shots are being fired so that tells me that, either, he was only one of the gunmen or he wasn&#39;t a gunmen and they made it look as though he was firing from that room after the fact.
         I remember looking for Windows that we&#39;re broken, all over that building but I couldn&#39;t see any broken as it was happening...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple shooters will have left fingerprints, which we&#39;ll know about eventually. They would have been captured by hall surveillance cameras the same as activity on other floors. Other than the perpetrator(s), nobody has any reason to hide what really happened. It&#39;s awfully early, when nobody knows squat, to start making up stories. The simplest and most likely explanation remains that a wealthy guy nut went berserk and shot a bunch of people, a random and unpredictable event. Had there been logical antecedents, it might have been predicted and prevented.</p>

BEST EVIDENCE OF TWO OR MORE SHOOTERS.!!!
watch this video from a cab driver that was at the Mandalay Bay during the first shots and you can clearly hear two sets of gunfire. You can here the first shots very clearly about 60 seconds into it then you here more gunshots, clearly farther away and the cab driver even mentions that they were further away. About another minute later you here the gunfire close by and before the firing stops you can hear the second gunfire start before the closer fire starts. To me, this is clear evidence and the best evidence, so far, that there were two or more gunmen!</p>
