       Like most "mass shootings" the guy who did it is a "loner."  Nobody close to him to give us any kind of indication of why or why not.  Never a popular person with lots of friends and family to give us insight into their actions.  Which makes me question everything.

       Except a lot of people are like that. And even if you do have 6 close friends who could vouch for your character, they're going to be written out of the narrative and their voice never heard if that's what is wanted.

       What does the approach and takedown matter? Whether it was Paddock or someone else, the result of the takedown was the same -- they barged into his room to find him dead of an apparent suicide. I'm not saying the LVPD was in on it, just that they are going by what they found in that room. A dead man with 23 rifles. But what occurred in the hours before that?

       Whenever the cops are doing shit in similar circumstances, there is no radio traffic on the open channels, they have private channels for that. But here we have this extremely dramatic play that could be in a movie for how perfect it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when approaching a heavily armed mass murderer, seems like they come in shooting. That room was a death corridor, they threw a flashbang and took a peek like "oh he's dead, all good!". Not saying that can't happen, it is just unusual to me.

       Considering how seriously casinos take their security, I would not be surprised if one moved to confront. Doing it without calling in for help first though is just mental.

       Some one estimated the weight of his stash at the hotel would have been 2k.  Seems like an awful lot for one man.  Also two broken windows in two different suites?  And those windows are made not to be broken.  Again this is a 64 year old man.  Trey Gowdy has come out and said he finds it hard to believe that one person could do this.

       This is a standard suite layout of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino Suite Room. It is not exactly the Suite Room he rented. The arrow points towards the direction of the concert. The red circles are where windows where broken. The line is a possible door.
