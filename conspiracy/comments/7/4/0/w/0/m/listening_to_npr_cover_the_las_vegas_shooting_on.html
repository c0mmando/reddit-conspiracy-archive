        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They were interviewing the Democratic mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn Goodman (although her Wikipedia page says she is an independent politician, not Democrat. Maybe NPR doesn&#39;t want us to know this). </p>

<p>Anyhow, the guy interviewing her for the radio program kept trying to push the conversation toward gun control and it was glaringly obvious. She was being very respectful to the families and very careful not to make any overly political comments about the tragedy, but the NPR host kept pushing her. He asked questions like &quot;But wouldn&#39;t you say there is something that can be done about this&quot;? and &quot;what do you think should be the response from congress&quot;?</p>

<p>The agenda is gun control, and it couldn&#39;t be more blatant. I would not be surprised if this whole event was planned and carried out for the soul purpose of passing gun control laws.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep our heads about us here folks. We cannot afford to give up any more of our constitutional rights. If we aren&#39;t careful pretty soon the Constitution itself will be null and void.</p>

<p>A person who would give up freedom for security deserves neither. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This talking point is so fucking stupid. When are we allowed to talk about gun control? Next week? Two weeks from now? 3 weeks? Never?</p>

<p>Every time a terrorist blows up, or shoots a bunch of people in America, the right immediately starts talking about Islam and how we need to crack down on these people. Every time an illegal immigrant commits a heinous crime that makes the news, the right immediately starts talking about how we need to crack down on these illegal immigrants. </p>

<p>You never hear the left say &quot;guys, guys, guys. Stop politicizing this tragedy. Please, wait a couple weeks. Now is not the time to talk about immigration.&quot; </p>

<p>Because if an illegal immigrant killed 30 people, that would be the time to discuss this issue.  If a Muslim guy came here from Syria and killed 20 people, that would be the time to discuss the Muslim ban.</p>

<p>Stop pretending this some disrespectful thing to do. You dont actually give a fuck. You just don&#39;t want to ever talk about gun control. Not now, not a month from now, not ever. So you want to shut down the conversation every time it comes up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about maybe one or two things in your incredibly redundant rant. Here is what you&#39;re wrong about:</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> disrespectful to talk about gun control right after this. People lost their lives and all these politicians and TV personalities want to do is ride their moral high horses because they support gun control. What they don&#39;t think about is how many Americans have died fighting to protect the 2nd amendment. There are many ways this tragedy could have been avoided; banning guns or preventing people from buying them is not one of them. More people are killed every year by hammers then they are by guns. Do you want to ban people from buying hammers?</p>

<p>The second thing you&#39;re wrong about is that I actually <em>do</em> give a fuck. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have made this post. You know what pisses me off? 60 people die and the entire country is up in arms, but the media doesn&#39;t ever talk about all the innocent people we kill overseas in our unjustified wars for oil and profit. Should we not be just as outraged by their murders? Especially because our own government kills them? The media tells us that the killing of brown people in other countries doesn&#39;t matter, it only matters when they are American. This sort of gross nationalism is disgusting and practically no one sees the utter hypocrisy in it. Is one human life worth more than another? Not in my book.</p>

<p>The one thing you&#39;re right about is that I don&#39;t want to talk about gun control. I don&#39;t think it needs to be talked about. The 2nd amendment exists for a very important reason and I support that reason.</p>

<p>How is it disrespectful? What&#39;s the waiting period here, because these issues are affecting people now. So why not talk about them now? People always say it&#39;s disrespectful to talk about it so soon but then by the time the next one happens it&#39;s too late because more people have already died. What if we start the conversation and then another one happens (which it will)? Are we just supposed to stop talking about it? People like you are the reason nothing ever gets done. </p>

I don&#39;t think gun control would have changed this situation. It&#39;s a topic that should be fervently discussed and debated though, just not used like a cudgel during a tragedy.</p>

<p>Total gun bans may have changed this situation. As in certain types of gun being 100% illegal to own, not simply checks/hoops to jump through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think a total gun ban could change things, make these things much less common, but it would mean when someone did get their hands on a gun, they would for sure be up against an unarmed populace. But I don&#39;t even consider complete gun bans because of how crazy that would be in the US... not that it&#39;s not something to plug for, but there is such a large portion of Americans who will resist their weapons being taken at all costs, it would be a crazy situation. And there&#39;s always going to be the people, especially on this sub, who see a gun ban as the first step in an overt totalitarian takeover of the US citizenry, who see guns as our last defense against a corrupt government who has made itself an enemy of the people. And I can&#39;t say that fear is without merit... It&#39;s a complicated subject.</p>

<p>I will note, the only thing Trump did was remove a limitation keeping guns from being sold to the mentally ill that Obama had passed last year.. the most I can see is that getting passed again. And I&#39;m glad that&#39;s being talked about, because what sane person wants mentally ill people to have easy access to guns?</p>

<p>But the most annoying part was that because npr was their only news source and a source that they turned to when they wanted to &quot;feel smart&quot; and get talking points that made them look knowledgeable in real-world conversations, you had a group of people who were ill-prepared to debate, hear differing view points, or have their views on a matter change.

    <div class="md"><p>I also was listening to NPR last night as they interviewed an individual who had something to do with security at another casino in vegas, I believe it was The Wynn. The guy conducting the interview was asking him about how difficult it might be for someone to sneak a bunch of assault rifles into a Casino hotel room.
The security guy said that they would have ways of figuring out if this was going on, but declined to reveal how.</p>

<p>The conversation then moved on to how the security could possibly be ramped up to prevent this from happening in the future. I thought the whole interview was pretty strange.</p>
