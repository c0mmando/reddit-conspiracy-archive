        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Theory:   Paddock was an arms dealer who laundered his money in mindless gambling (video poker/slots) for the past 20 years.  He had all those guns because he was going to sell them in that Vegas suite.  However, he was set up by someone/group who planned the chaotic shooting event.  Key items to look at revolve around his private plane (transporting arms?) and who/when the suite was booked.  It was likely specifically chosen, so it may really matter who booked it and when.  I also wonder if the properties he owned were partially used as warehouses for guns.  His background would give him &quot;defense&quot; contacts and an understanding of the margins of arms trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the narrative but how easy is it for those controlling the narrative to bend the truth here? Who has access to the guns and serials? We just have to trust the narrative here. How can we get the serial numbers and look them up in a database, preferably an older db? Perhaps dated sales receipts. Perhaps we can find the people who remember selling them to him? People who remember him at a shooting range? If they were his guns, he&#39;d be totally confident they work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your theory could be a valid scenario when you consider situations such as the government&#39;s relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel. </p>

<p>When they interviewed an employee at the gun shop, he said that he has dealt with Paddock &quot;50,000&quot; times. Paddock had a series of federal jobs over the years (IRS, Lockheed). He probably has security clearance. It&#39;s not like he was just an average citizen buying guns under his name.</p>

<p>If the black market was considered a nation, it would be the world&#39;s second largest economic superpower. Pretty sure our government agencies are involved in this underground economy. </p>

<p>Also, what would be his incentive to hoard all these guns? Apparently he checked into the hotel days earlier with the intent to commit this mass murder. You would think that he wouldn&#39;t want to blow his cover before he could execute his plan. Logically you would think that he would bring a weapon or 2 for backup....but why 42?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember that any gun can be made a ghost gun, that’s why they have pushed microstamping which is when a bullet casing is marked with an id number unique to the gun. If he sold them, he could take them to some one (like that dude in Modesto or Stockton forgot which he’s in deep shit now) and have them ghosted and a DIAS installed for covert ops. </p>
