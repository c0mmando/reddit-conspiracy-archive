        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;re not advertising, we&#39;re not asking for money, but we&#39;re looking for a few more individuals to assist us in putting an end to the media meltdown going on in the world today. It&#39;s obviously not just MSM anymore, but it&#39;s now encompasses the bulk of the social channels we use on a daily basis (Reddit, Youtube, Medium, etc). Despite our vast technological connectivity, our information platforms are failing us (as usual) as social networks continue to censor, promote garbage ideology and refuse to fix an easy problems like botting and vote manipulation. This has to end...</p>

<p>We&#39;re attempting to solve this problem right now...</p>

<p><strong>The Project</strong> - The connections between humanity are progressively shrinking as we accelerate into an age of universal connectivity. The speed and malleability of the internet as a medium has revolutionized our lives and service environment . The sweeping changes in the service environment has opened up new opportunities in how we make, share, view, and analyze media. Cyberspace is now filled with individuals not only seeking quality content, but quality commentary, analysis and coverage. As our technological capabilities expand, so does the “hidden ground” of the media. The “hidden ground” being the total service environment at play. The devices we use shape our interactions, points of view and most of all our environment. What’s being obsolesced? What aspects can be manipulated or controlled? What effects does today’s service environment have on the content, the senses and the audience? What barriers are currently in place to prevent abuse?</p>

<p>Humanity is starving for an information platform that can bring them quality news, videos, and articles from verifiable sources -- and not just the traditional split narrative provided by today’s media giants. Social Networks make up a significant percentage of the most visited websites in the world, and for good reason. Social networks enable people to congregate, chat, share, contribute, laugh and cry, but they also perform a progressively pivotal role in keeping humanity in-touch and up to date.</p>

<p>Nearly two-thirds of American adults – 62%– get news from a social media site, according to Pew Research Center.</p>

<p>The traditionally high barriers of entry in “show business” have been well guarded by the entertainment industry. Technology and its many forms threatens these old business models immensely as virtual networks become the standard. The dramatic shift in attention towards these social platforms has created an entirely new gap in media literacy due to the additional layer of detachment. The integrity of social networks has been badly diminished as they continue to miss the mark when it comes to censorship, content quality, system gaming, botting, content verification and customization. Despite society’s increasing connectivity and technological prowess, we’ve yet to perfect the transmission and verification information.</p>

<p>We intend to shake up the status quo by building the most diverse, content agnostic, social content aggregation platform to date. A platform that prides itself on providing the tools that allow individuals to shape the content, communities, feeds, the entire ecosystem. The project combines its vision with blockchain to create transparency, in addition to a means of monetization through our cryptocurrency token. Our Crypto token isn’t merely a fad coin either--the token maintains a real utility that is supported by services on the platform; most notably the advertising and content subscription services.</p>

<p>The project is an all-in-one platform that combines many of the best aspects of sites like Reddit, Wikipedia, Youtube, Medium, and Twitter into the most flexible and transparent platform seen yet. The project delivers a broad scope of profile privacy settings, in addition to advanced profile verifications that allow professionals, celebrities, professors, journalist, influencers and creators to make a name for themselves. Last, but certainly not least, The project combines machine learning at many different layers to detect bots, vote manipulation and to better search results/recommendation systems. Artificial intelligence will play a large role in the future of the company as we employ ways to use our vast data streams for the betterment of the creators, users and public.
Great leaders from Martin Luther King, to Krishnamurti, to John F. Kennedy warned us of the dangers presented by western media. 60 years later we’re still suffering from the levels foul play and centralization at play in our media. The problem we’re attempting to solve is vast, real and cannot be solved by one individual, group or entity alone. The issue at hand requires a calculated group effort, energy, incentives and the involvement of the public. Through user consent, recommendations and criticism we can grow a media collective of the highest quality.</p>

<p>What We Need
We&#39;re a bunch of conspiracy theorist who won&#39;t budge when it comes to doing the right thing. Not only that, but we&#39;re good at our jobs and have generated quite a following in our avenues over the years. We&#39;re well known in the crypto, marketing and machine learning areas of the technology spectrum, but we&#39;re seeking something a little different. We&#39;ve come to realize that most people, especially in Silicon Valley have no idea what&#39;s going on with the world, let alone any idea of conspiracies or why they matter. We need people who are passionate about the same problems as ourselves and that&#39;s why we&#39;re posting here today.</p>

<p>1) With that being said we&#39;re looking for engineers, business savy individuals, content creators, journalist and just damn near anyone willing to chip in. Feel free to PM if the idea sounds of interest. Would love to exchange info + more site info, in addition to hopping on a call for the right individuals.</p>

<p>2) If you have any comments, suggestions, questions, please feel free to list them here. We&#39;re not putting the sites name here. We don&#39;t want to advertise. Feel free to PM for site details if interested.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is accurate and why something like this has to stand above the trench warfare that passes for the information delivery system that has evolved over the past decade. Asymmetrical tactics are well and good but someone at some point decided that it&#39;s use at every opportunity was better than just reporting facts or even opinions. Better to destroy another&#39;s argument than to fully develop your own. I applaud your undertaking as well your intent. If you ever need a piece that strives to piss off both sides...

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting idea, and one there&#39;s definitely an opening for. Here&#39;s a question (one that I often have when it comes to replacing the MSM): how will you gather information? The MSM has many faults, but what it still does well is put people on the ground in places where your average Redditor (or whoever) won&#39;t go. War zones, etc. I think &quot;the crowd&quot; for lack of a better term has been great at uncovering government corruption, corporate malfeasance, and so on, but how do you foresee filling that gap in other areas?</p>

<p>Again, not trying to shit on your idea at all, I just have studied the media a lot so I&#39;m curious as to your take. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, </p>

<p>Thanks for asking a great question. So our platform is split between creation and aggregation channels. The website will come equipped with dedicated hosting options for Video + Journalism. (Think Reddit and Medium). This is a different area of the site, but it merges with the communities area of the site which is like Reddit. </p>

<p>Media is going fully decentralized in the future and I&#39;d assume the ability to get press passes will change in the future too. We&#39;re building platforms that allow creators to create + monetize, while giving the users base many options for how that want to aggregate, organize and search for content. </p>

<p>It would be great in the future if large platforms like ours could apply for press passes which could then be levied by the community. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re too far away from this, but obviously some bureaucracy involved. As far as local news goes...</p>

<p>The kids in my college town could produce way better material than our local news. It&#39;s bland, brainwashing, programming. So... 1984 =P </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s just a long subject. </p>

<p>I feel there are many obvious conspiracies that don&#39;t get the credit they deserve 9/11, PizzaGate, Sandy Hook, etc. Easy to prove conspiracy theories. If people invested time in the comments sections, looking at different materials, they would realize how bad it is. </p>

<p>In the same time we have a ton of bots on social media, vote manipulators, marketing agencies destroying the integrity of the most upvoted content. These spots are also worth a lot of money! I know I&#39;m a previous growth hacker. It&#39;s now very difficult to tell who and what&#39;s real. </p>

<p>The future is in decentralization. We basically want to be an Uber for content. So if you&#39;re a solid content creator you have a place to go where you can report on the truth, get paid, all in a open manner. We also need waaaaay more community input. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I am completely on board with what you&#39;re doing.  What sort of help are you looking for?  Content or back-end?  I&#39;m so fucking sick of Reddit and YouTube you have no idea.  The people who control these sites and their agenda is so repellent to me it needs to be answered in equal volume.  People like Spez and David Brock have no business controlling <em>ANYTHING</em>, not just the front page narrative on the fourth most read website in the world and every major newspaper just because they have unimaginable money.  </p>

<p>I think this kind of thing you&#39;re doing hasn&#39;t been attempted yet out of sheer fear.  Everyone is so afraid of ending up like Seth Rich or some-such.  But really these people are just rich, and are so inept at everything else that they are counting on mass ignorance to coast by on and praying to <em>God</em> the public believes people like Hillary Clinton can reach and murder all of their ideological enemies.  </p>

<p>As long as everyone is also convinced The Fed&#39;s debt matrix is outside anyone&#39;s control, they all win.  They get to go about they&#39;re despicable plot to convince people to over-breed the planet, over-consume in the process and then mass exterminate everyone with manufactured famine, manufactured disease, nuclear war, what have you.</p>

<p>Sorry, anyway.  Do you want content or code? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you&#39;re at it, you should put a focus into hobby components of your website. News and pop culture knowledge will get you pretty far, but Facebook, Pinterest, and Reddit thrive because people with hobbies are able to join small communities dedicated to their interests. This is reason they continue coming back even if they hate the platform.</p>

<p>If you were able to integrate independent video hosting for tutorials, image/album sharing, and a forum area for discussion, you&#39;ll be able to build the user base that you need to launch the platform and attract the average user.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into acquiring these services, or partnering with other companies to accomplish these goals. </p>

<p>As far as informative videos are concerned, I would strongly recommend modelling your style after Prager U. They host fantastic 5 minute videos with experts that try to get to the core of hot topics (not just politics), while staying as concise as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple answer... </p>

<p>Reddit + many others are corrupt and this is a long subject to get into. Let me just stick to the bots. </p>

<p>You can easily apply machine learning + reinforcement learning to solve this issues with vote manipulation and bots. Many factors to pull like site activity, who they vote for, how quickly votes come in, IP, etc </p>

<p>We can even bot our own network to increase the ability of our algorithms to detect odd voting patterns. This will deeply bring back the integrity of the content. Using blockchain we openly broadcast how much we make and how much we pay out. No more smoke and mirrors like on other add platforms. </p>

<p>Reddit, Google, Facebook are all big business and tied directly to the military industrial complex. This is the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone is wrongly blocked, how and who would they appeal to?  Are there moderators, and qualifications to become one?  If so are there checks and balances for moderators?  Who controls the censorship you mentioned, and can it be adjusted, or is there an appeals process?</p>

<p>You talk about proving things for conspiracies, but a lot of information can be difficult to prove, and some disagree on things that are supposedly proven.  How do you determine what&#39;s actually true content?  If you have content creators that are posting things that conflict with other conflict creators, how is it resolved?  </p>

<p>How do you plan to filter content to find legitimate, factual information and separate it from the garbage or shilling?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many different parts play a role in this for example... </p>

<p>Monetization/Blockchain - Our profits + payout amount is recorded on the blockchain. Users know exactly how much we bring in and how much we pay out. This allows the community to contribute to payment % and overall reward structure. </p>

<p>User generated communities will have different levels of censorship. We must remember not all censorship is bad. You don&#39;t want porn playing at work do you? We need to find the common ground within each community and watch those moderators like a hawk. </p>

<p>A.I. Bot/Vote manipulation detection - I&#39;ve mentioned it here earlier, but will mention it again. Clearing up this bots/vote manipulation issue is cake with the current state of A.I. We&#39;ll use a reinforcement neural network that works with user and moderator reports to train itself. In addition we will bot our own network to better train it. Raising the integrity of the content so real creators can get noticed is huge. </p>

<p>These are three quick ones. Feel free to ask more! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self policing communities are one thing, The trick is that whoever is doing the “watching like a hawk” is susceptible to infiltration by forces who seek to censor over time. Same thing happened to Reddit, Google, and YouTube.</p>

<p>If you truly want to be different those forces that seek to censor have to be mitigated.  IMO, that’s the only way any new community will gain traction. This box must be ticked or the cost / benefit of leaving the others will not be high enough. </p>

<p>Also you should allow people to vote on articles with the scale being left on oneside and right on the other. That way people can vote if there is a biase in the information or not. </p>

<p>Lastly alway require all posts to have sources so people can verify the data presented in the article and keep opinion pieces in the Opinion section.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s just a long subject. </p>

<p>I feel there are many obvious conspiracies that don&#39;t get the credit they deserve 9/11, PizzaGate, Sandy Hook, etc. Easy to prove conspiracy theories. If people invested time in the comments sections, looking at different materials, they would realize how bad it is. </p>

<p>In the same time we have a ton of bots on social media, vote manipulators, marketing agencies destroying the integrity of the most upvoted content. These spots are also worth a lot of money! I know I&#39;m a previous growth hacker. It&#39;s now very difficult to tell who and what&#39;s real. </p>

<p>The future is in decentralization. We basically want to be an Uber for content. So if you&#39;re a solid content creator you have a place to go where you can report on the truth, get paid, all in a open manner. We also need waaaaay more community input. </p>
