        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I mostly lurk on this sub on a daily basis and remember when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/">ElsaGate</a> was really gaining momentum about six months ago. I made my sister aware of it about six months ago because she has a little girl about 5 1/2 years old.</p>

<p>About a week ago my sister installed the <em>YouTube For Kids</em> app on my niece&#39;s tablet. The next day my sister checked out the videos being promoted by the app and guess what? Dozens (if not hundreds) of disgusting ElsaGate videos.</p>

<p>She deleted the app immediately and has made several of her friends aware.</p>

<p>So thank you for making me - and many others - aware, r/Conspiracy.</p>

<p>Side Questions:</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s been answered/discovered elsewhere, but my sister and I were thinking out loud:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Aside from profit, what is the motive for creating these videos? Disgusting messages targeting children...</p></li>
<li><p>Why does google/youtube not demonetize/restrict/remove these videos? Why are they included in &quot;The Youtube Children&#39;s App?&quot; Their silence is deafening.</p></li>

<li><p>The desensitization of children to the grotesque, or the acclimation of children to sexualized content. It&#39;s a separation from typical societal norms and the introduction of new, more emotionally detached norms.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube likely makes an enormous amount of money off the videos themselves. Also, if there is a grand conspiracy to sexualize children, YouTube is an excellent medium on which to conduct this plan. Children typically have access to internet connected devices, often unsupervised. They can start out watching innocent, benign videos, only to be redirected to the &quot;new programming&quot; automatically via the auto queue.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>My belief is that these Elsagate videos are meant to promote evil to children, such as the videos of kids eating poo, eating ones feces is actually an occult ritual that Aleister &quot;The Beast&quot; Crowley practiced and this man was a very influential satanist and was known as the most wicked man of his time, he also performed sex magick on children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, did anyone log into a YouTube account when using the kids app?</p>

<p>I switched to using the kids app with my daughter after these videos popped up left and right on the normal YouTube app. I sit with her while she watches videos so I know what she is seeing, and I have yet to see any of the elsagate videos pop up. I do not have an account set up with the kids app. I just installed it and went through the set up till you could pick a video. I understand that these videos pop up in the kids app for some people and I&#39;m curious if it&#39;s because they set up their account with the kids app. It would make sense that if you were logged into your account in YouTube and these videos got watched that it would carry over to the kids app when you log in.</p>
