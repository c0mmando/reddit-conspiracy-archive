       Working with u/whatyoureallyknow on this one. There is a glaring flaw in the shooters room that has not been noticed until recently. If you haven't seen the news showcasing the audio scanner of police breaching the shooters room, then listen/watch the link below:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/7EyoKuaJ10Q">
        https://youtu.be/7EyoKuaJ10Q
       </a>
       (if this video is deleted just search for the newsreel with the audio from police going into the room)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then watch this video, which should accurately represent what the audio from the link above is depicting:
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cRVSJb3K368">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cRVSJb3K368
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at the photo of the shooters door:
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/glimpse-inside-las-vegas-shooters-hotel-room/story?id=50255988">
        http://abcnews.go.com/US/glimpse-inside-las-vegas-shooters-hotel-room/story?id=50255988
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the lock on the door even look broken? The latch looks like it is retracted. There is no burning or loss of paint or marking that would indicate a bomb blast. Even the bullet holes in the door look like someone just used a drill. There little indication of debris on the other side of the door, and the door also is off the hinge?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is undeniable proof of the staging of the shooters room if the audio from the news is to be trusted, and even that audio sounds edited.

       Why would they have anyone get back for that? A slug isn't going to do damage enough to tell everyone to back off, and listen to the audio again and tell me if that sounds more like a shell or a bomb.

       You're right, and the sound heard could only be an explosion if it knocked the door off the wall. Even so, look at the door laying on the ground. No apparent damage other than some fake bullet holes that are not heard in any police audio.
      </p>
      <p>
       You hear a prep for "explosive breach" then countdown and then entry and body found. In fact there's no evidence of explosion other than the audio.

       Good catch. I don’t understand how they were so sloppy like this? They are either panicking and can’t think clearly or they want us to know it’s a false flag which is less likely. Weird.

       No two parts of the story line up. My biggest issue is that if there is evidence of Paddock entering the hotel with all of these weapons, it should have been released. If there are accomplices, that information should be released because there may be another "shooting." Either way, information is clearly being misrepresented like I've shown in this post. And that room looks more staged than broadway.

       Imagine if the judge asked for something and a civilian said no. He would be in big trouble. The people are demanding proof of Paddock bringing in those guns and these clowns are just staying quiet.

       Also, I'll bet that image from the hotel with the dead guy on the floor and suicide note is a fake.

       Suicide guy doesn't look that much like the shooter. I think the point has been proven, and now we need to help people who want to find the truth and are asking hard questions. Everyone else is just defaulting on their programming, it's a sad reality that people don't understand the extent to which their world has been influenced by things they "haven't looked into but read a headline about it."

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock was a loner who was targeted to take the blame.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His brother was blackmailed into playing ball with the FBI.

        <p>
         5 shooter took off in a white van with tinted windows.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Soros and Mossad were the masterminds behind this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The image the FBI released of the room was taken before the shooting for something to show to the public so it's fake.

       Okay I guess one round can breach. Now explain away the fact they said explosive breach, told everyone to get back when the video you just showed me has cops right up next to the officer with the shotgun, why the door is on the floor from the one round that should have only damaged the handle like the one in the video you showed (they supposedly entered the room right after the explosion in the audio, you can verify that, and if they could enter with one shot, why take the door off the hinge after finding the dead body?) and there are some other points to make but that's enough for now.

       I could argue everything you mentioned just like you will find more to disprove what I say. I was not there I don't know and I doubt you were either. If you really want to argue fine but not right now I'm tired of reading all the bs about this subject

       Then come back when you have the energy and mental clarity. I'm not here because I'm vengeful, and I'm definitely not here because I want to argue about this. I'm so tired of arguing, so so tired of the friction of what these images create. I definitely wasn't there, but you must know that this whole event makes little sense.

       Why can't you find a single photo of a bullet hole anywhere from the concert? Why are there videos of police declaring people on the grounds dead and turning off the lights even as assistance is being given to many still-breathing people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there no evidence of the shooter even being present at the fucking scene, other than a suicide photo that isn't clear at all? There's only like 3 photos of this guy in all of media right now! One of those is from many years ago, and the other is a hard to see suicide photo. You're literally taking what is fed to you if you aren't even questioning a single aspect of this.

       ok I rewatched all your videos and reread all the replies. first your comment about the door and the latch is wrong if they used a hinge breach device there would be no damage to the latch, a latch holds a door closed it is not physically hooked to anything if you take a door off by the hinges you wont have to unlock the door, being that its a double door the shock from the blast may have moved the second door on the hinges. a breaching blast is just one explosion I don't see what your point is about that but I wanted you to understand its not going to take multible explosions to remove a door watch the videos you put up for proof of this. breaching explosions are a shaped charge there is no fire or burn marks from them except right where the explosion is supposed to be. next the bullet holes you ask about I don't really understand your question bullet holes where? they have shown plenty of damage from the bullets just look anywhere on the web if that's not good enough look at the fuel tanks he was trying to blow up there are plenty of bullet holes in those tanks. now for the lights and other blatent fuckups at the concert, someone maybe the police decided it would be best to turn off the lights thinking the shooter would not be able to aim in the dark I don't think it was the right decision because it caused more confusion but I can understand the thinking. the suicide photo is blurry I agree but from what I understand the fbi has promised to prosecute whoever released those photos if it was not for some brave or greedy individual we probably would not have any photos of the scene in the room im sure there are better pictures but no one is going to release those until the fbi is done with investigation. last the bullet holes in the door hmmm well I have shot wood and steel with a 5.56 rifle before it leaves a really clean hole but you would have to see proof of that so I will drop this one im sure I missed something but your going to find more anyway

       anybody familiar can confirm if the bullet holes can tell the direction of bullets? Bullets going in or coming out of the room?

       Depends on the material, but a rifle round will be suited for penetration. So the entry of a rifle round would theoretically be cleaner than the exit, which may have some tearing marks. Or if the material is solid you can think of it like a crater, and the bullet makes a pocket for itself.

       I thought that might have been an explanation for the door being off hung, but we only hear one blast, so that isn't it.
