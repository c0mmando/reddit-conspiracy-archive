    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be that guy but in a situation like that It doesn&#39;t even cross your mind to pull out your phone and record. It doesn&#39;t cross your mind at all. A month ago, some guy drove his car through the soccer fields my kids and 40 other kids were playing on damn near hitting them before crashing into two parked cars and then a fence. Me and 6 other guys ran over to the car. I was thinking it was some drunk guy and was ready to drag his ass out. He actually was having a seizure and his foot locked up. His wife swerved him off the field and it&#39;s cause of her he didn&#39;t hit any kids. What I&#39;m getting at is by the time the cops, ambulance, helicopters showed up and the time we left I never even thought to pull out my phone and record the zoo that was forming. And I never saw any other person do it either. I was so pumped up on adrenaline from my kids almost being ran over and the whole situation after that it just didnt even register to record anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve witnessed a homicide/suicide before--one shot in head (suicide) and victim shot 3 times (chest, stomach, and leg), and there wasn&#39;t much blood. Most of the blood drained in the lungs in that case. Depending on where the shot is, you might not get a ton of blood draining out and have more internal bleeding. Amount of blood is not a good indicator of the reality of what happened. </p>

<p>Movies really do not portary shootings realistically. </p>

<p>And yes, I have seen videos of shootings where tons of blood comes out, but that&#39;s often not the case.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know that you&#39;re looking for exactly. You said you hadn&#39;t seen any footage of people getting shot, bullet wounds or blood. People responded with videos of people getting shot, bullet wounds and blood and you said you&#39;d already seen them but were still skeptical and thought they might have hired 100 crisis actors to fake it. I gave you a hospital testimony that they&#39;d accepted nearly 100 gunshot victims (and that&#39;s only one hospital) and now you want to see video footage of all 100 people actually getting shot? You realize most people were running for their lives, trying to save others, and leaving their phones behind, right? Very, very few people are gonna stick around to record that kind of thing. </p>

<p>This video is strange but it does appear there are dead people. Whos to say this wasn&#39;t staged earlier at maybe even a different location?  Its odd this is really the only video I have found like this: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think it&#39;s crazy to say it. Like I said I&#39;m at around 90% that it really happened. I just would like to see a bit more evidence to get me to 100%. </p>

<p>I will sound like a kook saying this but even in the video we don&#39;t see any entrance or exit wounds and really only one puddle of blood that still doesn&#39;t look like that much. </p>

<p>I also think at the end when they turn off the lights is weird af and the guys says &quot;everyone out here is already dead.&quot; Really dude? Then why turn off the lights? It just seems bizarre. </p>

<p>This combined with the fact that I haven&#39;t seen a video where someone gets shot. This is 2017. We have more evidence that 9/11 really was a terrorist attack than we do that this event actually killed 60 and injured 500. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something you will be interested in. Might have to watch the whole thing but at 7:10 in the video guy claims to have gunshot wounds. Seems staged to me. Like the camera man is just waiting for the shot guy to show up then repeats I&#39;ve been shot needs ambulance (could be shock I suppose) but goes around a corner and what looks like a dr comes out a door exactly the right time and right to him. Anyway: </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know that you&#39;re looking for exactly. You said you hadn&#39;t seen any footage of people getting shot, bullet wounds or blood. People responded with videos of people getting shot, bullet wounds and blood and you said you&#39;d already seen them but were still skeptical and thought they might have hired 100 crisis actors to fake it. I gave you a hospital testimony that they&#39;d accepted nearly 100 gunshot victims (and that&#39;s only one hospital) and now you want to see video footage of all 100 people actually getting shot? You realize most people were running for their lives, trying to save others, and leaving their phones behind, right? Very, very few people are gonna stick around to record that kind of thing. </p>
