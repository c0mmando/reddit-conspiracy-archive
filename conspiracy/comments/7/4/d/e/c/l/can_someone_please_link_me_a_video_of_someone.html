       I hate to be that guy but in a situation like that It doesn't even cross your mind to pull out your phone and record. It doesn't cross your mind at all. A month ago, some guy drove his car through the soccer fields my kids and 40 other kids were playing on damn near hitting them before crashing into two parked cars and then a fence. Me and 6 other guys ran over to the car. I was thinking it was some drunk guy and was ready to drag his ass out. He actually was having a seizure and his foot locked up. His wife swerved him off the field and it's cause of her he didn't hit any kids. What I'm getting at is by the time the cops, ambulance, helicopters showed up and the time we left I never even thought to pull out my phone and record the zoo that was forming. And I never saw any other person do it either. I was so pumped up on adrenaline from my kids almost being ran over and the whole situation after that it just didnt even register to record anything.

       I guess I'm looking more for the videos of people who were recording the concert when the shooting started (because we all know how many people watch concerts through their phones). I get what you're saying though.

       I see what you’re saying, all of the videos I’ve seen seem to start either midway through (presumably) the first or second clip, or in a reload/reposition. Where are the videos of whatever singer singing a song, and then chaos erupting? I haven’t seen a single one with a band on stage. Maybe I’m wrong.

       Yeah I've seen that. Do you really think that's a lot of blood for that many victims? We know that a minimum of 60 people were fatally shot on that field. That doesn't look like that much blood.

       I've witnessed a homicide/suicide before--one shot in head (suicide) and victim shot 3 times (chest, stomach, and leg), and there wasn't much blood. Most of the blood drained in the lungs in that case. Depending on where the shot is, you might not get a ton of blood draining out and have more internal bleeding. Amount of blood is not a good indicator of the reality of what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies really do not portary shootings realistically.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I have seen videos of shootings where tons of blood comes out, but that's often not the case.

       I should add that I also know people who were there but not down front. They were at the concession stand when it started. I also am not thinking they would have to hire 22,000 crisis actors but maybe 100?

       If it really did happen then ok, but it is still odd that we have no video or photographic evidence in 2017 of any bullet wounds. We have people posting pics after the fact in the hospital, but nothing beforehand.

       TBH, I am not surprised. She said that she kept running (along with anyone else that could run), until they made it to the road.

       Once there, they tried to get vehicles to stop and finally a car stopped and let them in and they took them to their house.

       I'll try to find it. IIRC one of the hospitals said they took in 120 or 140 shooting victims and 80% of them had gunshot wounds. So that's a minimum of 100 right there, and it's only one of several hospitals who took in gunshot victims from the event.

       Sorry I deleted my first comment because I found the source and created a new comment for it.

       But I don't know that you're looking for exactly. You said you hadn't seen any footage of people getting shot, bullet wounds or blood. People responded with videos of people getting shot, bullet wounds and blood and you said you'd already seen them but were still skeptical and thought they might have hired 100 crisis actors to fake it. I gave you a hospital testimony that they'd accepted nearly 100 gunshot victims (and that's only one hospital) and now you want to see video footage of all 100 people actually getting shot? You realize most people were running for their lives, trying to save others, and leaving their phones behind, right? Very, very few people are gonna stick around to record that kind of thing.

       Dan Blitzerian posted video footage of a guy getting shot in the head. It's been posted on here and watchpeopledie a bunch of times but I don't feel like watching all those links again to find it.

       Also the videos show us that plenty of people WEREN'T running for their lives. People just stood there and crouched down for a good minute before doing anything. There should be some footage in those initial videos of someone getting shot.

       I agree. I think it's crazy to say it. Like I said I'm at around 90% that it really happened. I just would like to see a bit more evidence to get me to 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will sound like a kook saying this but even in the video we don't see any entrance or exit wounds and really only one puddle of blood that still doesn't look like that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think at the end when they turn off the lights is weird af and the guys says "everyone out here is already dead." Really dude? Then why turn off the lights? It just seems bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       This combined with the fact that I haven't seen a video where someone gets shot. This is 2017. We have more evidence that 9/11 really was a terrorist attack than we do that this event actually killed 60 and injured 500.

       There most certainly is. You can question the motives behind the event as much as you’d like, but real people lost their lives on Sunday, and to deny that simple fact is just plain disrespectful, and abhorrently ignorant.

       I agree it is strange. What sticks out to you the most as strange. And I agree it is odd that it's the ONLY video we've found like this. This is 2017. Everyone is recording everything all the time. Where is all the video??

       This is something you will be interested in. Might have to watch the whole thing but at 7:10 in the video guy claims to have gunshot wounds. Seems staged to me. Like the camera man is just waiting for the shot guy to show up then repeats I've been shot needs ambulance (could be shock I suppose) but goes around a corner and what looks like a dr comes out a door exactly the right time and right to him. Anyway:

       That was a different video I think, but that's a pretty convincing one that people were shot. It's still just so surprising that we don't see them actually getting shot.

       It sucks that when asking for actual evidence that proves without a doubt someone got murdered (not word of mouth or common sense statements) you get nothing but bullshit response and no upvotes. Wouldn't everyone like to know for certain?

       The "evidence" is circumstantial at best. The best thing I saw was a guy with an actual wound to the arm that the video shows. That's awesome. I thanked the people who sent it. Videos of people laying on the ground after the fact is not hard evidence. I asked for video of people getting shot and still no one has produced that.

There are videos all over reddit of dead people with bullet holes and people who are shot and getting worked on. If you are too lazy or too ignorant to find them you don't need to see them.

       Just pay attention to how many people are coming out of the wood work to dissuade you from thinking it didn't happen.

       I have searched. I have been online literally since the shooting started, all night Sunday night and every day since. I have yet to see an actual bullet wound in a photo or video.

       Sorry I deleted my first comment because I found the source and created a new comment for it.

       But I don't know that you're looking for exactly. You said you hadn't seen any footage of people getting shot, bullet wounds or blood. People responded with videos of people getting shot, bullet wounds and blood and you said you'd already seen them but were still skeptical and thought they might have hired 100 crisis actors to fake it. I gave you a hospital testimony that they'd accepted nearly 100 gunshot victims (and that's only one hospital) and now you want to see video footage of all 100 people actually getting shot? You realize most people were running for their lives, trying to save others, and leaving their phones behind, right? Very, very few people are gonna stick around to record that kind of thing.

       Okay well you said "So where is all the video footage of a minimum of 100 people getting shot?" That sounds like you wanted footage of more than one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dan Blitzerian posted video footage of a guy getting shot in the head. It's been posted on here and watchpeopledie a bunch of times but I don't feel like watching all those links again to find it.
