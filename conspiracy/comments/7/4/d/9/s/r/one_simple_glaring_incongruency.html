I feel as though you are doing mental gymnastics acting like it&#39;s a logical choice to bring nearly 20 guns for no good reason other than he could get away with it. Clearly he didn&#39;t use all of the guns, and the breaks in the firing suggest he was reloading.

<p>So are you saying there was a valid reason to bring that many guns? If there is, what is it, and why didn&#39;t he use most of the guns? Or are you saying he was too crazy to bring the logical amount of guns required to inflict mass carnage?</p>
