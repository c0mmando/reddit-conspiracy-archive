       And I'm not saying we're there yet. But the worst part is defending an absolute evil psychopath that murdered innocent people for attention and fame before suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, we're not there to conclude this of Stephen Paddock but right now, there is absolutely no evidence to indicate it's anything else. No occult ritual. No crisis actors. No arms deal gone bad. No second, third or tenth shooter. Just one messed up gambling addict who was sick of living and wanted to go out with a bang.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what we need to know:
      </p>
      <p>
       What did the note say? What was the motive?
Where is the footage of him in the casino, on the floor of his room  or in the parking garage?
      </p>
      <p>
       Only two questions I need to know. Then we might just have to admit in the end, we're defending a deranged, evil lunatic. The tough part of being a conspiracy theorist.

       Zero evidence to indicate otherwise. My third question was answered today. Statement from the girlfriend:
      </p>
      <p>
       He wired her money to the Phillipines. She thought he was breaking up with her. Why else would he give her money? He never told her anything. He wanted her out of the picture.

       No past history of criminal, violent activity doesn't mean shit! The evidence is the FACT that he booked the room, it was his guns, it was his body laying in the room by his guns. Now the burden of proof lies with the conspiracy theorist to prove otherwise. And once again, there is no evidence to indicate he didn't do it.

       You seem to be pretty set on the msm narrative and pretty ignorant (willfully or not) of the inconsistencies and anomalies in, among other things, the public statement given by the LVPD sheriff to the reporters.

       Just because it's msm narrative doesn't make it wrong. And quite frankly, there is no evidence period. I just said, let me see a motive and the note and video footage and then my mind will change. Until then, a 4 chan post isn't proof.

       Just the first three names turn up quite a lot of info in a basic Google search under "[person's name], CIA control".  Couldn't be bothered with the rest because my point of heavy CIA influence was already proven at that point.

       No way that guy had the skillsets to do what he did to that many people. Vegas casinos are some of the most surveiled buildings on earth. People all over Vegas who were there are saying there were multiple shooters.

       Adrenaline is a powerful thing. We also have no idea what his skillsets were. All we know is he was a gun advocate and has a large stock that was found in his home as well as testimony from a gunshop owner where he bought them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vegas casinos are defintely highly surveillanced but again, he was a local resident and could easily make trips to take guns and ammo to the room with his suitaces.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for people there, they have no clue regarding sound dynamics of a gun shot. How the bullet breaks the sound barrier and creates an echo that is further magnified by the highly elaborate structured casinos around the Mandalay Bay. What they heard most likely was echos.

       They have not witnessed any shooters. Fact. They heard echos which is common for bullets breaking the sound barrier. They were confused as the situation had  injured people arriving at multiple hotel locations. No one saw any shooter

       By seeking the truth you are seeking justice for the 59 people killed in this massacre and justice for their families and friends. If the FBI had an ounce of humanity left in them they would be using their vast resources to do the same.

       They win and then they lose. House always wins period. That would be called statistics. Unless you're a professional poker player investing thousands in tournaments and taking huge risks and then winning lump sums once in awhile.

       Poker players make a lot of money playing cash games as well.  Sports bettors make more than poker players.  You can beat slot machines video poker and blackjack in some casinos.  You can bet on horses or dogs and make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make prop bets.  You can beat street dice games.  You can hustle pool.  There's actually many ways people can and do make money gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is a gamble.  Every time you cross the street you gamble.  Which school to go to, career to enter, significant other to marry are all huge gambles.  Most decisions are some kind of gamble.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick to life isn't to avoid gambling.  It's to learn how to gamble well.
