<p>That goes to show how little you know about the Constitution and the people behind it. Natural Law, or Nature&#39;s Law. You do not need a Constitution for rights, they are inherent. You have no rights, you have a privilege. FFS, you ask permission by getting a permit. That&#39;s not a right, that is a privilege. Wake the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Missouri I see. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a book about it.  The American welfare state.  Goes into how the money is spent.  It was over $900 billion when the book released in like 2012.  I read somewhere a while ago the number is over $1 trillion today, can&#39;t remember where but it seemed legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like horse manure to me.  Here is the real welfare spending.
The. U.S. Defense Dept. that keeps the globe safe for U.S. international investments our multinational corporations and banks need a lot of protection  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/FY16-Budget/">https://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/FY16-Budget/</a></p>

<p>Here is a budget chart.  And if you are including the Social Security program and Medicare in your number, that is an outright lie.
But you don&#39;t have your support documents so I don&#39;t know what you blame your claim on.  </p>

<p>This document shows welfare at less than half of your claim and on the decrease while military spending is on the increase.  The current budget proposal is for $700 Billion. </p>

<p>There should be no gun registry.</p>

<p>That goes to show how little you know about the Constitution and the people behind it. Natural Law, or Nature&#39;s Law. You do not need a Constitution for rights, they are inherent. You have no rights, you have a privilege. FFS, you ask permission by getting a permit. That&#39;s not a right, that is a privilege. Wake the fuck up.</p>
