       They move ever further against guns.  Have you seen the history of gun control?  They want to kill you.

      <p>
       Trump pushes greater police militarization, gun rights go down.  What future do you invasion this holds in the USA?

       Army veteran here...many of the junior enlisted would brainlessly follow orders, but the majority of leadership will recognize an unconstitutional order and not follow it.  It's right there in the Soldier's Creed;

      <p>
       I am an American Soldier.

       I've read it suggested they are pushing towards allowing the usage of the US military on US soil.  If we can take any truth from how many they've killed to hide secrets and prevent people in other nations from doing things they dislike, what lengths wouldn't they go to here?

       I understand that line of thinking, but as far as our Constitution goes it is considered a Right, so I consider it a Right. Additional hoops are only road blocks to that Right, but is is still, fundamentally, a

       That goes to show how little you know about the Constitution and the people behind it. Natural Law, or Nature's Law. You do not need a Constitution for rights, they are inherent. You have no rights, you have a privilege. FFS, you ask permission by getting a permit. That's not a right, that is a privilege. Wake the fuck up.

       I suppose it just depends on what we mean by infringement...to me an 8 hour easily passed safety course to have a CCW isn't an infringement. It's an easy check to prevent people who really shouldn't have them in the first place from having them, and something any citizen can easily pass. No need to insult friend, we are just of differing opinions :)

       I don't believe I am part of the problem considering I own guns and advocate gun ownership. I just don't see an issue with a few checks within the system that still don't make it that difficult to acquire a gun. You and I really aren't that far different in our thinking regarding this my friend.

       We will just have to agree to disagree here. I just have a slightly different perspective. I don't think an 8 hour safety course is really infringement...I think it is responsible practice. I tell everyone I know they ought to own a gun, and again, the course is only for a CCW. I believe anyone should be able to buy a gun with only a cursory background check. We really aren't that different here.

       While you are worrying about your guns, they are killing Medicaid, stealing the Social Security and Medicare funds privatizing Veterans care and well along the way to privatize education so that only those who can pay can send their children to school.

       That along with outlawing the right to organize a labor union and eliminate the national minimum wage and all labor protection laws.

       "The establishment," has been entirely conservative/libertarian and now to libertarian/conservative since 1981.  The current "establishment is a one party conservative, KochTeaparty establishment.

       Liberals have been deliberately and carefully and successfully removed from the dialog, the narrative and office since the 80s.

       The harshest and most oppressive conservatives, the libertarians, are fine with godlessness, LGBT, feminism, immigrants, multiculturalism etc.  But they hate the idea of individual rights, labor rights, and political rights for anyone not already a billionaire.

       There's a book about it.  The American welfare state.  Goes into how the money is spent.  It was over $900 billion when the book released in like 2012.  I read somewhere a while ago the number is over $1 trillion today, can't remember where but it seemed legit.

       Sounds like horse manure to me.  Here is the real welfare spending.

      <p>
       Here is a budget chart.  And if you are including the Social Security program and Medicare in your number, that is an outright lie.
But you don't have your support documents so I don't know what you blame your claim on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This document shows welfare at less than half of your claim and on the decrease while military spending is on the increase.  The current budget proposal is for $700 Billion.

       So, our multinational corporations leave their profits off shore to avoid paying taxes to support the U.S. global military operation that protects their investments and trading and shipping but you say it isn't welfare?  lol!

       Trump is never going to pass any gun control legislation.

       That said if the establishment ever came after our guns we'd have a war on our hands.  Americans are beholden to the Constitution and we will kill any traitor who tries to take away our rights.

       2a is super infringed, as is basically all the bill of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be no gun registry.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be no limit to size, capacity, rate of fire, or any of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be no background checks, if someone is too crazy to have a gun, they are too crazy to be free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to blackpill you, but people say they are all over the bill of rights like white on rice, but who among you and yours are willing to fight and die in the streets to defend it?

       Our rights have been infringed upon.  We should all be willing to fight for our rights, but it's not going to happen.  We'd need to be organized, good luck with that.  As soon as you start trying half your group will be FBI agents.

       I've read it suggested they are pushing towards allowing the usage of the US military on US soil.  If we can take any truth from how many they've killed to hide secrets and prevent people in other nations from doing things they dislike, what lengths wouldn't they go to here?

       That goes to show how little you know about the Constitution and the people behind it. Natural Law, or Nature's Law. You do not need a Constitution for rights, they are inherent. You have no rights, you have a privilege. FFS, you ask permission by getting a permit. That's not a right, that is a privilege. Wake the fuck up.
