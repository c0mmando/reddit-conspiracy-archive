       The Satanic, Talmudic, usurious pedophiles are going to keep hitting us with hurricanes and shootings (etc.) until we're outraged enough about their trafficking, raping and killing kids; about reaping human lives and resources and about wanting to control everything for their own benefit. Until we stop buying their shit, using their money and doing their bidding, this will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're barely outraged that they're controlling our government officials, and those sad fuckers haven't been in control of anything for over a century, including presidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has been the victim of a soft, slow kill since the 40s, and it's all "government" sponsored and approved (food, water, air, drugs, media, etc.). To keep the global agenda going and the kid-killing hidden, The US has to either be the strong-arm of that movement or go down in flames, and we're straddling both sides, with most people completely unaware of that dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many on this sub are thinking about the future and solutions, and that's what we all need to do. If any of you r/T_D refugees still think he can play 5D chess and stay alive need to give that up and get creative without any hope from any authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I've seen enough about Las Vegas that I can piece it together and know that it's another state-sponsored op. I don't want to waste my time with more proof, because it's still a distraction even though it's very real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you to all here who contribute to the real shit and to the real conversations that we need to have.

       Litterally the first sentence. Sorry I don't believe in Alex jones theories. "Interdemensional beings from space", ya, hard pass. In order to even read the rest of the post I have to agree with the first sentence, and I don't.

       Why are you here? Like I don't get it. We get all these mouth breathers from r/politics crying about Conspiracy Theories all the time. Why come to this Sub? What do you think you will achieve? Cunt-Face Hillary didn't lose the election because of places like r/conspiracy she lost it because the Democrat Party is extremely weak and out of touch with Real Americans. You are just waisting your time bitching here.

       I came to this sun seeking the truth. Go ahead and look at my history. I have no political affiliations and I unsubscribe from that subreddit cause I can't stand the constant negative outlook on my life. Then this happens, and I want to dig deeper than what mass media is telling me, so I go to reddit, 4chan and other forums to do so. Just because I disagree does not mean I don't belong to be in a place where information is shared. I am sorry I don't believe your viewpoint. But that doesn't mean I Am not allowed to seek information.  Sorry my views don't align with yours, that's what discussion is, people with different views attempting to persuade the other sir. But unlike you guys, I don't attack the others. I'm here for information just like your and when something is absurd this is the platform I'm allowed to speak out on.

       . ( Not too sure if i linked that correctly... sorry if i didn't I'm on mobile and honestly rarely post.) The title is called "Satantist &amp; Pedophiles Run the World." David Icke talks about everything op brought up including the "reptilian" theory. I honestly never believed it and always chuckled at it until i watched this video. The evidence of "reptile people" throughout history is astronomical!

       There is no god, and our collective human consciousness has been brainwashed enough to let this happen. We were seeded on Earth as half-wits, and those in the heavens are placing their bets as to whether we evolve out of the bullshit or destroy ourselves first. I agree with you that it's being
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       but wondering how you could believe in a god that would allow the state of our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean, however, that I discount the Bible at all, and I completely agree with the sentiment of that verse, and it's implication that "god helps those who help themselves." God isn't going to waste his time on a bunch of morons, but the deeper implication to the verse is that unified consciousness feeds itself and draws others to it, IMHO.

       "Evil" is our construct of "what destroys or defies humanity"; that's the baseline commonality. From there it's fuzzy, and evil becomes relative, blamed on outside forces/demons, etc. You're implying that "God" is the antithesis of "evil," but this is a problem if that god is omniscient, omnipresent and created everything. From a universal standpoint, murdering someone isn't "evil"; it's just something that happens in our possible realities. If the God you're describing is real, it's impossible to define a conscious "stand" or "will" concerning that, except, as you say, "allowing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Why would a creator bring conscious beings into the world to suffer evil? And pain, and disease, and mass shootings, and IRS persecution, and stupidity, and Spongebob?

       It's absolutely and completely "wrong," but you have to understand that we're agreeing on that point from a construct that is human, not divine. We don't feel and know that because it's in the Bible; in fact the ones who chose to espouse that belief
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       because it's in the Bible are the most dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are others on the planet who either don't think that it's "wrong" or don't care. So, there's your objective relativism. One you introduce what "god" thinks is good or evil, then you're introducing what different religions and people define as god or good or evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking for "good" and "evil" to be defined universally, but by our own collective consciousness, not by a god. That's the only difference we have that I can see, and if we get there from our different angles, then awesome.

       According to the Bible, it's okay to both beat and own slaves:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free."
      </p>

       Do you consider slavery to be "objectively right"?

       There are loads of us who feel the same. This is the sentiment they are trying to keep hidden. Take comfort in the fact that they ultimately will never win. They can try to control and imprison and torture people all they want, it only makes us adapt. We're becoming more focused even as they want us to believe that we are stupid losers. Ironic isn't it?

       Isn't it funny that during the Bush/Obama election, one of the best bumperstickers around was "Republicans for Voldemort." It was so easy to kick Republican ass at the time, because they looked so fucking stupid.

       The idiots jumped to the liberal/democrat side with Obama, and counted on Hillary to win. Yes, it's incredible to watch such a post-election tantrum that will likely lead to the implosion of Western culture.

       Yep!   Exactly.  I think the 1st step is for everyone to internalize that those referenced in your first sentence have a historical and long established motive of bringing about world domination by killing the institutions that promote individual sovereignty.  By accepting that fact we can begin to go to work together diligently to undermine any attempt by these occultists to deny us of our God given and  inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
