       According to the
       <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/unarmed-security-guard-jesus-campos-took-on-las-vegas-killer-stephen-paddock">
        Daily Beast
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When Campos first arrived on the 32nd floor, he did so by elevator because Paddock had somehow blocked stairwell doors leading to the hallway outside of his room, Hickey said. The door to the room itself was also barricaded, Campos found when he tried to open it, just before the bullets came through the door.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yet this article from
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/las-vegas-shooter-how-many-rounds-shots-bullets-hotel-mandalay-bay-2017-10">
        Business Insider
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On the 32 nd floor, noticing an ajar door, the security guard began approaching and was then hit by some of the hundreds of bullets Paddock fired into the hallway. Police, who had been checking the 31 st floor, arrived “in a matter of seconds” to find the security guard at 10.17pm, who was able to identify the shooter’s room. Despite earlier reports that Paddock had cameras set up in the hallway and in his doors’s peephole police now say the cameras weren’t in use at the time of the shooting.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So which one was it? Was the door locked or ajar? Where the cameras working or not? Why are they no pictures of Jesus Campos?
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that the security guard was actually the shooter, Paddock was a patsy

       I've also heard that there was a large gap of time between the security guard encountering Paddock (when the shooting stopped) and when police 'breached' the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this seems consistent or adds up. Also why haven't we heard from the security guard? If he's the one that prompted Paddock to kill himself shouldn't he be a sort of hero that stopped the massacre from getting worse?

       He is a hero. He didn't cause Paddock to kill himself, but after the encounter he went into barricade mode and stopped his madness on the festival. Jesus saved countless lives that day.

       i think hes the second shooter i made a post but just saw your post after posting. Paddock has bullet wound to chest. Security guard killed paddock and staged suicide. Somehow managed to only get shot once in the leg by an automatic weapon, even tho shooter had cameras set up outside

       I have a theory regarding Jesus Campos and this is actually extremely plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos is asking people to evacuate on the 32nd floor. He approaches the entrance to 32135 and receives a hail of gunfire. He falls to the ground knowing only that he's hit. At this point the two actual shooters leave and Campos doesn't see them (perhaps they leave from the Adjoining Room door). In this scenario Paddock is already dead on the floor killed by the actual shooters. Campos being a low level security guard embellishes a few details making the whole experience sound more significant than it was (I wouldn't blame him as this has been known to happen in situations like this all the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain the inconsistency of certain details and how the real shooters escaped undetected. This would also explain why no one heard Paddock's suicide.

       See the door to the hallway on the left that goes to the room labeled "Hotel Room"- that's the second room Paddock had in his name. That's where the 2nd broken window was. Under this theory if Campos was incapacitated around the area labeled "entrance" then perhaps the 2 actual shooters could've slipped by. There still would have been people evacuating the floor so it's not impossible to think this might have been the case.

       I don't see how they could have slipped by him though. The second door is right next to where he'd be after being shot. And then which door was ajar? The main one?

       The main door may or may not have been ajar. My theory assumes that Campos is incapacitated on the ground briefly after being shot and then misremembered certain details.

       In this evening's press conference, the sheriff said the security guard "happened upon that doorway because it was ajar, which keyed his interest." I don't think he specified which door it was though. I assumed it was the main door but after seeing the floorplan someone else just posted here, I'm not sure. So, so confusing.

       Maybe it was ajar because it had just been opened (because the shooters saw him on the surveillance and opened the door to fire at him). They shoot him. He falls to the ground. They leave thinking he's dead or incapacitated and everything else proceeds as has been reported, except Campos doesn't see them leave because he's incapacitated.

       Yes unconscious. I could see that happening with a security guard not used to high pressure situations like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like I'm saying maybe the only reason the door was suddenly ajar is because they saw him coming on the surveillance. There's no way (whoever the shooter/s was) that they would leave the door partially open during the whole massacre.

       Totally plausible. I mean look at Paddock... his life over the past couple years is easily repeatable. Goes to Vegas a few times a month, gambles for hours on end, goes back to the room for the night then does it all over again for a few days in a row. He does this month after month. And with Las Vegas being his destination everything he does is on record that the FBI could tap into. They could have easily surveilled him for quite a while and learned his patterns. His loner lifestyle and gun collection at home was enough to make him an easy patsy.

       Look at the end of the day what happened is terrible. Just the longer this goes on the more fishy it looks.

      <p>
       Not to turn this political, but its just fishy how something of this magnitude, happens at the success ( I hate using that word in this scenario) that it did without someone slipping up somewhere. It just so happened to happen after 2+ weeks of Trump getting blasted by remarks. His twitter has fallen relatively quiet the past week and this happens and he receives praise from all around how well he handled the shooting.

       What about the girl who said a Hispanic man and woman were telling them everybody was going to die?  The security guard has a Hispanic name and they are looking for the mystery woman who they claim was with Paddock and ordered the bagel and soup.

       All of which is insubstantial evidence...you really think theres no Hispanic security guards in Vegas? The whole receipt thing proves literally nothing, not that any one was with him nor that there was a second shooter

       Who orders a double cheeseburger and a bagel with sour cream at the same time?  Sure, there are probably Hispanic security guards, so it would not be hard to dress as one and go unnoticed...duh.   A young woman told a news reporter that a Hispanic man and woman were telling people they were all going to die and were removed from the crowd.  Who removed them?  They must have identified them and where did they go?

       I visited LV in July with my sister and her husband (they are LV regulars, they stay in LV at least once a month) When we arrived they were giving me suggestions on places they would like to take me ....any way my sister joke about going to see the protestors. She said that there was some group of religious protesters that stand out side of casinos and tell people that they are going to hell etc. She said that the protesters would be at the casino later ( I unfortunately forget the name of the specific casino) We laughed about it but now I wonder if religious protestors could account for the "Hispanic lady".

       There’s a group of them that are always by the escalators between Bally’s and the Cromwell. Maybe that’s what you’re thinking of?

       A couple things came to mind for me... first the sheriff said campos approached the door because it was ajar. If that's the case then the door would have to be propped open because hotel room doors close on their own. Secondly who in their right mind would approach an active shooter situation unarmed? And finally he got shot in the leg. The sheriff said he then proceeded to help them clear rooms on the 32nd floor before making him seek medical attention. In what scenario would the police add a wounded non-police/private citizen to help clear rooms during an active shooter situation? I don't like it...

       Not too mention the fact it was estimated that some 200 rounds were fired into the hallway, even Sheriff Lombardo was shocked that the security guard only had one GSW too the leg.

       Plus there's not even close to 200 bullet holes in the door and they seem to have confidence in that particular number. They don't even give a disclaimer like "roughly 200" or "about 200" when making statements about it.

       He had 100rd mags. I'm guessing he emptied 2 into the hallway (making 200 a pretty easy number to come up with).

       We know the smoke alarm triggered in his room bc of all the thick smoke from the gune being fired, all hotels have a fire board either in the lobby or behind the front desk that notifies them when an alarm is triggered and where its coming from, so the security guard goes to check it out, the door is propped open with that metal bar that goes across as some wierd cross breeze mechanic to move the smoke out of the room, Paddock sees him approaching and shoots where he thinks he is, shots not on target but some catch him in the leg as hes diving out of the way, Paddock panics and blows his brains out, SWAT still blow the doors bc they are unsure whats on the other side

       How is the door dead bolted shut from the inside leading into the second room(2nd broken window) and Paddock is dead in the 1st room with the other window?
      </p>
      <p>
       So SWAT either made it up or something is fishy here because it’s impossible to lock one of those doors from inside the adjoining room.

       I just read this shit about the security guard on some news site. Where the hell was this guy days ago? Why did the first story of this come out yesterday?
      </p>
      <p>
       Things don't add up more and more. Paddock fired 200+ rounds at him and he only got hit once? The picture I seen of the outside of Paddock's room must have been stock, cause I didn't see bullet holes? If Paddock really shot 200+ rounds at a security guard, why didn't he shoot at the cops? He still had plenty of ammo on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it said that once paddock opened fire on the crowd, it took cops minutes to reach his room.... Didn't they say it took cops like an hour to reach his room?
