<p>10:12pm- first two officers arrive on 31st floor</p>

<p>10:15pm- last shots are fired by Paddock</p>

<p>10:17pm- first two officers arrive on 32nd floor</p>

<p>10:18pm- Security Officer shot in foot tells LVMPD exactly where Paddock is</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand- Paddock had two cameras in the hall and every intention of escaping. He sees the Security Guard in the hall and fires 200 rounds into the hallway injuring the Security Officer in the foot. So after that Paddock decides to stay in the room and kill himself rather than face 1 unarmed and injured Security Guard. Why? This doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope it doesn&#39;t. Very basically speaking, if as we&#39;re told he intended to escape, why didn&#39;t he attempt to escape? </p>

<p>I am not yet convinced he was alone in the room. Another basic fact: there are 2 windows broken. Why would he need 2 vantages for himself? At that distance the 2 windows would provide only the slightest difference in regards to the target, maybe a few degrees of angle.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible there were 2 in the room, the other killed Paddock and made the escape. Purely hypothetical, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fuel tank thing is really interesting: Cause he was aiming at the fuel tanks: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74da7k/lv_shooter_shot_up_nearby_fuel_tanks">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74da7k/lv_shooter_shot_up_nearby_fuel_tanks</a></p>

<p>Especially <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/stephens-media/image/upload/v1507173957/webSHOOT_targets_Oct5-17_copy_new.jpg">this diagram</a> that shows how one of his two broken windows is in line with the concert site and the other with a direct view of the fuel tanks. </p>

<p>So he starts by shooting at the crowd, killing as many as he can while driving all the others back toward the airport. Once there&#39;s a critical mass by the fuel tanks, start shooting them up hoping for an explosion to kill as many runners possible. Makes sense. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s say the security guard shows up on the floor as he&#39;s aiming at the fuel tanks. He shoots through the door at the security guard and then never fires another shot. Why not continue aiming for the fuel tanks at that point? It&#39;s all very odd. </p>
