       Black holes and stars are Directly Connected! But not how you think they are! I believe that when a star's mass becomes so large, it implodes but the energy has to go somewhere. When the star implodes, it's energy is forced into another dimension. In that same space, where the black hole now is, the star still exists but in another dimension. And these beings are somehow able to use these wormholes to travel between Dimensions and the world governments have known all along. They would have to have some serious heat sheilds to protect them from the heat they would experience while coming out of the core of a star!!!

       I have a hole theory about how the black holes and Stars are directly connected; 
When the stars mass becomes too great, it will implodes and create a black hole, Everyone knows this theory but I Suggest that when the star collapses, it is just forced into a dimension. It does not change it's position in space, only the dimension. The black hole and the star still occupy the same space but in different dimensions.

       The energy from that star has to go somewhere it can't just disappear. From our perspective, it would seem to disappear but it is only being displaced into another dimension. They can't explain where the energy goes when it is pulled into a black hole. The only thing they can say is that it creates a worm hole that leads to another area in the universe. But the mathematics does not make sense. It is impossible for that much energy to be transferred over such large distances without being seen; there would be evidence of this everywhere, cosidering how many black holes and Stars there are.
     By the way, I bet if you can count the number of stars and black holes in the universe, the number would be the same. There can never be more of one another.

       That would be difficult to determine. I can only speculate. I imagine they could be using it for multiple reasons. The mass and density of the star could determine which dimension the black hole is linked to so if we can track ufo activity near our star or other and at the same time, moniter black holes and see if there is a correlation. You would think that something going into a black hole and out of a star could be detected if you watch for graviton wave fluctuations...

       Every alien encounter or sighting! Lol. It's widely theorized that governments have been using reverse engineered technology and it's safe to say that if they had contact with these beings, they would have learned things from them. Unfortunately, the only evidence that would be acceptable would be if a person recorded a video of them going through one of these worm holes. It would be very difficult to find evidence to support this claim because the government would never admit it. But the very fact that we have the technology we have is evident enough

       Okay so a star's energy doesn't disappear. It is dissipated as heat energy and light. (
       <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question13.html">
        https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question13.html
       </a>
       )
Energy sucked into a black hole changes into Hawking radiation - which had been detected and confirmed.
And there are waaaaaay more stars than black holes (
       <a href="http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/encyc_mod3_q7.html">
        http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/encyc_mod3_q7.html
       </a>
       ). 
Plus the number of both changes constantly, however stars are born and died at a far higher rate than blackholes.

       The energy does not turn into Hawking Radiation; Hawking Radiation is just a small amount of Radiation that is detected. Hawking Radiation is basically like the few embers of a campfire that float to the sky, only to fade away very quickly

       You should seriously consider electric universe theory, days of YouTube videos on the subject. I believe it acurately demystifies some things that are confusing to astrophysicists. I think a Sun is a simple plasmoid. At least watch the one on mars' geology. It
 will blow your mind.

       I'm not sure if the star exists in the same form just in another dimension.

       I think all black holes go to the same "singularity"
I think all protons are black holes, and all go to the same "singularity"
We live inside a blackhole, and our consciousness could be another blackhole, and our brain mediates between the visible light spectrum and everything else.

       The energy from the star isn't "missing." It's present in the mass of the black hole. You can't
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       send it off to another dimension. It's one or the other.

       Right, transferred means "no longer here in our dimension." If the energy was transferred to another dimension, the black hole here in our dimension would no longer have mass. It'd just...poof...disappear. And that can't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of us know that black holes have mass. And scientists know that black holes have the exact amount of mass they should have, give or take (possibly) some Hawking radiation. Nothing's going anywhere. All the mass &amp; all the energy that should be here is here.

       There fact that we have the technology that we have today is evidece because you are just an animal and no other animal on this planet has the capability of creating such things. 
    Every civilization on this planet has stories, in their history, that states beings came from, what the christians call heaven, and with them, brought knowledge and technology. 
     There is enough evidence of this all over the planet but most americans choose to believe only what they are told. You must read and research for your self. You should google "Thoth". To the Egyptians he was responsible for bringing the written word and creating our number system, as we know it. But if you tell that to a Christian, you're the 😈

       Wormholes are actually theorized to possibly exist but not practically. Imagine a piece of paper. Two serious Black Holes pull in each half and the paper rips in half however the singularities remain connected. Each half of the paper has its own story, and the left side takes an extremely fast train light slowing its time down. The right side of the paper just floats calmly. They met again and combine. You know have a theoretical wormhole bridge between different times. A person if able could enter the left paper wormhole and come out earlier in time from the right paper wormhol since the singularity connection uses the age of the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond it getting destabilized by you trying to cross it, this also puts a limit on when the connection was made and how fast one wormhole traveled.

     And not to mention, have you ever heard of Andy Basagio? I believe that he was apart of the Gateway Project, starting when he was a kid. I am friends with Andy on Facebook and I might be able to convince him to do a short video with me to explain what he did with the CIA's Gateway Program...
