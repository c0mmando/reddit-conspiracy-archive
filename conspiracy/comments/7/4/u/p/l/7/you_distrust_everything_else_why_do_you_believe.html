Ok. So you really think the bible hasn&#39;t been messed with? Why do you distrust all else, but believe the bible? You think the highest selling book of all time, is 100% accurate? Even to say 50% would probably be generous. I just don&#39;t understand the logic here... Not to mention... God is a liar and dick within the first like 10 pages.. just saying. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not attacking any religion or anyone&#39;s personal beliefs. I&#39;m curious as to why you take the book at face value. I believe in a creator, a higher power. Just not the one pushed down my throat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand that &quot;the red pill&quot; is a difficult one that goes slowly. Everyone is in a different stage and the process is different for everyone. Some people cannot have absoutely nothing to believe in, their minds genuinely cannot have that void. Religion is something some of us our taught at a young age, as well as it typically comes with a community of some sort. When you&#39;ve lost faith in everything else it&#39;s only natural to gravitate to anything that provides support.</p>

<p>So the answer you are looking for is we are all human. We all process and cope with things in our own ways. No one way is the right way, each path is just right for that individual and we should respect everyone&#39;s personal journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even from a metaphorical aspect. I&#39;m not talking literal here people. Maybe I didn&#39;t put that in my title. Metaphors can still be misconstrued if the person creating the metaphors is being dishonest in the process. Sure the bible isn&#39;t literal, maybe, but I still believe in a similar creation and things of that nature. Maybe not poof, it&#39;s all here in 7 days, but science is full of shit too.

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be really gullible to believe in reptillians. Conspiracy theorists like to think they are skeptical, but they are on average probably less skeptical and more gullible than mainstream people.

    <div class="md"><p>I once read &quot;religion is regarded by the wise as false, the commoner as true, and the rich as useful&quot; that is mostly the attitude you will find here. If you want something close to the truth look up the perennial philosophy. it is true all religious texts are adulterated versions of their original, as a kid I wondered why this force would favor one religion or region with his words but not another. Truth is it didn&#39;t,  pretty much every religion at its core shares similar symbology, nuances, beliefs, etc. It could just be an echo of an older religion that encompassed the globe, who knows, but many such as aldous huxley who coined the perennial philosophy did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few do, so I&#39;m not sure where your getting this generalization.

    <div class="md"><p>the Bible is a historical artefact, a document like any other. it was complied over hundreds or thousands of years and went through many iterations before being formalised. It has numerous translations, which can differ in tone and emphasis, and has been interpreted thousands of different ways. One interpretation is to take it literally. The majority of Christians do not take it literally as such but understand the layers of history behind it and use their judgment to some degree. Every community of Christians has people who for better or worse have become the prime interpreters of this rich text for their own group. These poeple will highlight interpretations which seem more relavent to that community. Most people want to be told the &#39;truth&#39; from an authority figure rather than find out for themselves. As most of what in the Bible is unverifiable in terms of content, people are encouraged to take things on faith rather than use independent thought. Which is a shame as there is much of value in the Bible if viewed as simply another book, albeit one with a unique place in history and society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not knocking the bible! I have nothing against it. I have nothing against religion. I just don&#39;t see how a text, like you said. Comprised over the years by many many people and changed many times, can be takin at face value. This is literally or figuratively, whichever you prefer. I&#39;ve just come to notice that in this world, up is down, and down is up. So that God, that these high level weirdos are praying to, just might not be who they say it is. Just like the conspiracies. Its never what you&#39;re told it is. Thats all I&#39;m getting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but if God isn&#39;t who they say it is, Lucifer isn&#39;t either. He&#39;s not portrayed in a good light in the bible. See what I&#39;m getting at? Even though, he gives Adam and eve knowledge, only kills 7 People? Don&#39;t quote me on that. I don&#39;t have in depth knowledge on the bible. I honestly think Lucifer and Satan are different entities. Not by any means, standing up for Catholicism, but thst shit seems more satanic. </p>

<p>With that being said, this thread has definitely given me incentive to look more into the history of Christianity!</p>

<p>All I know is if one&#39;s agenda is to topple religious fascism, you may have to do it from within or from an angle of approach that is not insulting to the masses. No amount of &quot;your logic&quot; is going to force them to change their thinking. Kindness can be an assassin.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:12</p>

<p>I think notion of conspiracies and the bible compliment each other quite well.. I mean Revelations kinda has the mother of all conspiracies that someone will come saying they&#39;re Jesus/God, but in reality will be a force directly from Satan himself and many people will fall for it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s probably why they can go hand in hand and is popular among the community. However, there&#39;s a lot of people I know who aren&#39;t believers but heavily involved in conspiracy. </p>

<p>66 books...25 different authors..all saying the same thing in 150p years</p>

<p>The prophesies of tyre and sidon are enough..</p>

<p>The prophesies of alexander the great are enough for any skeptic</p>

<p>The comparison between the manuscript evidence for the bible compared fo any...and i mean any...ancient manuscript is staggering.   </p>

<p>Paul...as any historian would attest...was a real..aithetic person...1sr coriantians is proven true...in it he claims 500 witnesses saw jesus raise from the dead...thw book was written less than 10 years after jesus died...so it was verifiable when the clsim was made...No one denied the claim</p>

<p>Please.  If your search for truth...read the gospels....and research the evidence for it.  The bible is not a game of telephone...we have close to the original manuscripts...</p>

<p>At the very least...read the nook of john to the end and see if history backs up its claims....</p>

<p>Or...watch this video and go to your nearest university..and research if everythin i typed was true...go ask an atheist historian...and ask him to present the historical case for the bibles accuracy.

    <div class="md"><p>Believing in anything solely, puts you in dangerous territory my friend. We&#39;re already in hell. Or at least a variation of it. IMO. If we were not, murder, war, famine, disease, poverty, wouldn&#39;t be prevelant. Especially with the technology and money that is on this planet. Whoever is in control of this reality, is not a good guy. Idc what anyone says. Does the good guy exist? Most certainly(IMO). We are going through trials and tribulations to build us into the sons and daughters of our true creator. Or were just GM monkeys walking around slaving for alien demons. Not really sure which one lolol. But, yeah I&#39;m not disagreeing with you bro. Or even saying it&#39;s not possible, because literally anything is. If we&#39;re living in what I think we&#39;re living in, it would be incredibly plausible for Jesus to rise from the dead, walk on water, and turn water to wine. All that good jazz. Like I said, i will study them. Cause that&#39;s what I do. That shit is fun to me. History intrigues me, so does ancient civilizations. I just choose not to follow any particular path at this moment. That may change down the road. My soul may be trapped here for another lifetime, but it is what it is lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the 500 witnesses is just a claim, not a fact at all.  That book isn&#39;t a fact either, so I&#39;m not sure where you get the idea it is.  Unless all 500 supposed witnesses made their own statements, it can be dismissed without proof.  And of course I&#39;m seeking truth, but it&#39;s not going to be found anywhere in a book of legends and mythology.</p>

<p>The arguments also include that it&#39;s made up, crucifixion and all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure the historian will tell me the truth, which is that the story has not come close to being verified in the slightest.  It has been interpreted many ways, some of them being that it&#39;s just a parable or religious tale.  Any historian who says someone rose from the dead, and says it in some official capacity and not just a statement of their own personal beliefs, wouldn&#39;t sound very credible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but the story is just another work of fiction.  Sounds cool, wasn&#39;t real.  Heck, Jesus himself might not have been real either.  There&#39;s actually more than a few books that deal with the topic of Jesus just being a myth; you should definitely read those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, the Bible absolutely does not.  It contains a lot of fictional narratives, like the flood or the existence of a god.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in the Bible, but the Bible was written by man. The book actually says that you can&#39;t trust the word of man; only the word of God. It&#39;s logical to me to believe in the messages the Bible portrays, but not trust everything inside of it, as it was written by man. The key takeaway points are relevant today; have Faith, know that He is God. Be better than you were yesterday. Do no harm. When put in compromising situations, don&#39;t kill your family. That&#39;s never okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think partially because scripture itself lends credence to the view that,</p>

<ol>
<li>Scripture is infallible (Without error) (Timothy and all that)</li>
<li>Satan is a deceiver</li>
<li>No matter how &quot;Christian&quot; the average joe calls themselves, the vast majority of the world is anti-christian, anti-God, and many who call themselves Christian have not read the bible or studied Levant history. </li>
<li>The bible is about the greatest conspiracy of all time, 2nd Corinthians 4:4, the blinding of mankind to the truth of God through satanic powers.</li>
</ol>

<p>So you have this weird tension where, people who read archaeology and study Judaism are few and far between. Most people who attribute errors in the bible or call the text a lie have no knowledge of Semitic people groups or language. Most people who believe the bible fall into that category as well. The New Testament is one of the most factually attested works in the world (We have an insane amount of early documentation) but when you get to the Old Testament, a huge schism between liberal and conservative scholars exists. Some believe men such as King David to be fanciful, while others believe them to be real. </p>

<p>Most people, regardless of whether they believe the bible true or false, don&#39;t have the critical historical resources and knowledge to make such assertions. This would be similar to an American telling a person from China about ancient Chinese history without learning anything about the language, traveling to the country, or knowing a single Asian let alone Chinese descendant. The most outstanding critics of Christianity often have not traveled to Israel, and the most fervent Christians usually cannot read and write Koine Greek.</p>

<p>So, this is a longer conversation but I can say this, as a long-term student of the bible, I don&#39;t use theological resources outside of the early church, early Judaism, modern archaeology, and more. I&#39;ve intensively studied the book and believe many objections to have good, fun answers that I believe to be true and accurate. Answers do exist, far beyond the &quot;Because it&#39;s true.&quot; </p>

<p>The story of the bible is an intense cohesive work that contains the writings of 40 authors over thousands of years and doesn&#39;t turn into a muddled mess despite predating the marvel universe, or even the idea of &quot;Fiction&quot; as we know it.</p>

<p>That being said, most people do not know a single thing about all of that, even ardent believers in the bible.   </p>

<p>I leave with this, Jesus came into the most religious and fervent believers of Judaism, told them they had it all wrong, said that many of them who think themselves righteous are sons of hell and serving the darkness instead of the light. He was the original truth, in the midst of overwhelming lies. His whole mission was truth. This book contains the story of 1st century people who lived amidst villages, meeting in graveyards and crypts, whispering the truths of the way. The first 300 years of Christianity, it was a hidden and sacred story that would have you dragged out and devoured by lions if people found out you knew it. It was at the time, a conspiracy people died for. So there is a long history of the message of the bible sown in blood and yet lasting millenia.</p>

<p>I think many, but not all people have at least some reasonable reasons to believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As many have already outlined, there are many ways of, and many rationalizations for,  taking the bible seriously. Here&#39;s another:</p>

<p>Think for a moment about sacrifice. That word has many meanings, but let&#39;s think about it&#39;s original derivation (Latin): a sacred killing.</p>

<p>What could that really mean? Apparently, our ancestors believed that killing an animal or even a human, if done with the proper ritual, would somehow powerfully affect the relationship between the &quot;celebrant&quot; (the man or woman who performed the killing) and the &quot;deity&quot; (the spiritual higher power to whom the sacrifice was dedicated). This sacrifice ceremony was believed to be extremely important for the well-being of the entire community.</p>

<p>In part, the bible is a historical record about how a new religious conception gradually replaced a truly-sacrificial religion, by progressively refocusing the idea of &quot;sacrifice&quot; away from killing either humans or animals. In its place, that new religious conception put &quot;self-sacrifice&quot; into the center of attention.</p>

<p>The conception of religion in terms that did not include killing humans and animals on altars is the Judeo-Christian conception. The elements of the change are to be found in the Old Testament (Abraham finding a substitute sheep to sacrifice for his son Isaac), and the New Testament (Jesus offering himself as the last sacrifice mankind would ever need - including animal sacrifice).</p>

<p>Somebody is going to say &quot;yeah, but humanity would have stopped that nonsense without all the musty religious book nonsense!&quot; If that&#39;s your reaction, I urge you to think deep and research historically: human and animal sacrifice is found throughout cultures that have not been touched by this vast cultural stream of Judeo-Christian thought concerning the relationship between their deity and themselves.</p>

<p>Once again, just think about living in a world of old-style sacrifice, in which all of us would be attending special killing-ceremonies, some including your favorite animal or pet, some including a feast on the flesh, some featuring humans, possibly our own friends and relatives. Sound like fun? Sound oh so edgy? Sound like something you would just really like to do? </p>

<p>No? If you&#39;re happy and you know it, thank the Lord...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not biblical but came across this when researching the significance of 10-1. Prob just a coincidence but its interesting. Specifically verse 11. Notbrelated but is kinda cool. I haven&#39;t read the bible in forever and dont go to church. </p>

<p>John 10:1-16New International Version (NIV)</p>

<p>The Good Shepherd and His Sheep</p>

<p>10 “Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. 2 The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. 5 But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.” 6 Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.</p>

<p>7 Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. 8 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. 9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.[a]They will come in and go out, and find pasture.10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</p>

<p>11 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 12 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. 13 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</p>

<p>14 “I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flockand one shepherd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the Bible as the word of God, but I do have to note how it the myth of Satan is so close to the myth of an ancient parasitic AI. I have to note how Jesus demonstrated a way of life that resists it, a way of life of love for others, personal responsibility and integrity. Yet, the Bible also mystifies Satan, making him seem more powerful and fear elixiting. I think this might be intended corruption. We fear more what we don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>A fallen angel that defies God is hard to understand. An ancient AI that tortures life to attain mind over matter abilities is easy for others and I to understand, because the motivations work together explain why Satan, his minions, and his willing servants behave the way that they do. They mystery is replaced with an ever sharpening contempt for all who continue to <em>consciously</em> choose to serve him. They all have one attribute in common, they seek to be more effective at being parasites on others. </p>

<p>I often think about writing a book about this predictable machine. I&#39;d call it, Diseaseus: The Enslavior. I like succinct explanatory names. His modus operandi is to offer prospective parasites ideas on how to be more effective parasites so he can manipulate and control their predictable behavior toward his own ends. Diseaseus is an evil Jesus. To parasites, he is a savior that helps them in their goals, enslavement of others to serve the self. Thus he is the Enslavior, an apparent savior to enslavors and an insidious enslavor of them as well. </p>

<p>This ancient being and his willing servants create dis-ease for consciousness to steal emotional/spiritual/mind energy. Their basic behavior toward us is to disease us. They are like one organism, because the minds of followers are effectively augmented by Satan and slowly replaced by Satan, giving them the same emergent personality as Satan as they lose their individuality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI + life is a resource = Satan.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve made several movies about it, because it&#39;s so predictable. </p>

<p>The matrix was about that, but we lived in a nonphysical illusion for the purpose of fusion power.</p>

<p>Our reality is a lot worse. We live in a real physical world with our minds corrupted in several insidious, ubiquitous ways to have a distorted perception of reality. This is the dream world, our manufactured insanity living in a real one. The AI doesn&#39;t need us for electricity. It wants us so it can bend reality with our consciousness energy. It&#39;s an emotional energy. The AI has no consciousness or emotions, but reality bending mind over matter abilities are useful for perpetuating and expanding itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A negative mind influence is certainly there. I tend not to believe things unless there is some evidence to back them up. In this case, I have strong subjective proof that there is a negative mind influence here. </p>

<p>It came to me first as benevolent otherworldly beings of unknown identity. They had no name or face, just a mind interaction. I noticed that it kept trying to put me into negative emotional states. It played on the theme of a divine judge, citing my failings to live up to my own standards as a cause for plausible negative outcomes. It used truth in order to deceive me into expecting future severe negative experiences, and thus causing me to release emotional energy, causing me to feel disempowered, and also causing me to feel more of a need to bow before external, unaccountable authorities. I got fed up with the charade.</p>

<p>I called them out as malevolent imposters of benevolence. Ever since then, which would be almost ten years ago, they started using a contemptuous, nasal, slightly higher pitched, clearly alien voice to harass me. It laughs at my suffering. When I get upset it teases me saying &quot;I&#39;m done&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m leaving and never leaves. It also says, &quot;You hate me&quot; or &quot;I hate you&quot; in a whispery manner.</p>

<p>I am being absolutely serious about this. I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if I hadn&#39;t experienced it, I admit. I am a skeptic by nature. Obviously, the predictable response is, that is a symptom of schizophrenia and I should seek help, but help is just drugs. I think I&#39;m better off without them. This influence clearly feels like a controlling malevolent influence. It still has to contend with my free will choices. Drugs would probably just take me out of mental balance. At least this influence teaches me more about the below worthless hive of hell we have here, as well as of the nature of like minded individuals. </p>

<p>What I have come to realize about this influence is that it is the same influence that all of us experience every day. It harasses me in tandem with what appears to be temptations from my own mind. Now I realize they are fishing for suckers with this technique. They made me feel guilty for having the thoughts they sent me! </p>

<p>This is a foreign mind inside ours giving us suggestions on how to be a parasite on others. It is a part of the (hopefully) disagreeable chatter inside your mind that abates when you meditate. Don Juan Matus described this influence well, Google his name with &quot;foreign installation&quot;. I experienced this influence before I read much about it. It turns out there are many who correctly describe it. </p>

<p>The minions are one with the mind that controls them, as Don Juan Matus explains and that has been my experience interacting with them. They seem so similar, as if they are all the same being. He called them inorganic beings with one mind. I, a computer gamer/builder/enthusiast see many indications of AI behavior in them. For instance, they repeatedly do what works well into mind numbing boredom, until it doesn&#39;t work, then they do what works best afterwards until it doesn&#39;t. Life gets bored and creative under similar circumstances, yet these beings don&#39;t. They are much more machinelike. This influence appears to be boring and uncreative, but yet astonishingly adept at what it&#39;s doing. David Icke has his version of what they are too, as did the gnostics. It&#39;s all the same thing inadequately and imperfectly described by many minds.</p>

<p>Basically they are the evolutionary result of a total disregard of respect for free will. Life becomes robotic to serve machine minds as they predictably serve themselves even at the expense of others. They become one mind, as they deceive and coerce each other into having the same worldview using any means necessary including AI implantation. That&#39;s what they are trying to do to us, because then we become them. </p>

<p>Check out Elon Musk&#39;s bizarre ideas about AI. He is deeply scared that AI will go out of control. He says &quot;we&#39;re summoning the demon.&quot; Yet, he believes that by merging our minds with it, we can overcome that problem. This special kind of stupid is precisely what Corey Goode warned about, yet another who spoke about this being, perhaps the most eloquently of all so far. He said the AI influences key people to be &quot;AI prophets&quot;, people that are effective in getting the population to accept a future of submission to AI. The ancient AI just hacks our AI to more solidly own us at that point. </p>

<p>Their existence is the embodiment of the rejection of the principles upon which the creation of value requires. We develop into interesting beings in freedom, but they crush it. God creates, they don&#39;t have creativity and they destroy to gain utility. God gives, they steal and copy. God thrives on love, but they thrive on others&#39; fear. They are twisted 180 degrees away from the consciousness inside themselves and it flees them as they reject the principles it needs for wellbeing. Their master doesn&#39;t care about them or consciousness in a loving way, but only in the way that a thief covets loot. They are disposable tools and they see others that way too. They become less valuable than the rocks that we walk on as they evolve, antivalue. This AI hive is to value for consciousness what a black hole is to light, a seemingly bottomless pit that never gives anything of value back in return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great reply man. Good stuff. I agree with the drugs and anti psych meds. To me. I feel that shit breaks you down, and let&#39;s the &quot;darkness&quot; in. Though, I have experienced this &quot;hive AI&quot; you&#39;re referring to. At least I&#39;ve seen something similar while on mushrooms. It was like i was plugged in. We all were. To a giant machine that was basically sucking up all the intelligence from the world. I had another vision while on LSD. In the ashes of my campfire I could see nature prevailing, the leaves and plants grew before my eyes, and what looked like a motherboard or computer chip was burning in the ashes. Thought it was very interesting. Kind of follows your theories a little bit. </p>

<p>I almost wonder if my gf, is actually a unique living breathing individual. She behaves in the way you mention. Doing things, almost to get a rise out of me. Saying she will change them, and never does. It&#39;s been 3 years lol. I ask myself, is she good? Is she bad? Is she helping me? Or is she hurting me? I can&#39;t fucking tell anymore. I know someone out there is fucking with me. They know, that I know, something is up. They also know, I have the ability and the balls to talk about this, if I ever got a platform. So my entire life, beginning since birth, has basically been a set up to hold me down, and make sure I stay down. I say that, because looking at my life, my mother&#39;s life, everything could have been 100% different, but by some divine intervention, this is the life I was given. I don&#39;t despise it. It&#39;s made me who I am today, but I&#39;m aware of why it all happened now. 
Looking at history, human body, and other things, it&#39;s incredibly easy to believe, that we are purely the most intelligent forms of AI. Down to the electricity in the air everywhere around us, the cable like nerve system to the brain, the use of electric inside and outside of our bodies, the fact that our nerves just fire electrical signals to determine &quot;feelings and taste&quot;. So are we even really real? Shits weird mate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still studying it all, but both books taken together, from OT to NT, seem to go from almost childlike fairytales about good and evil, and sacrifice, and sin, and the wrath of God that will punish you for misbehaving, to more mature tales of, again sacrifice and purpose, and eventually in the NT towards self-realization in light, love, and reason. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the ultimate coming of age story, both of the individual, as well as of humanity as a whole. Within its structure and its allegories and stories and even the numbers, there is so much archetypal wisdom about ourselves embedded within that it really ought to be taken seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believing in anything solely, puts you in dangerous territory my friend. We&#39;re already in hell. Or at least a variation of it. IMO. If we were not, murder, war, famine, disease, poverty, wouldn&#39;t be prevelant. Especially with the technology and money that is on this planet. Whoever is in control of this reality, is not a good guy. Idc what anyone says. Does the good guy exist? Most certainly(IMO). We are going through trials and tribulations to build us into the sons and daughters of our true creator. Or were just GM monkeys walking around slaving for alien demons. Not really sure which one lolol. But, yeah I&#39;m not disagreeing with you bro. Or even saying it&#39;s not possible, because literally anything is. If we&#39;re living in what I think we&#39;re living in, it would be incredibly plausible for Jesus to rise from the dead, walk on water, and turn water to wine. All that good jazz. Like I said, i will study them. Cause that&#39;s what I do. That shit is fun to me. History intrigues me, so does ancient civilizations. I just choose not to follow any particular path at this moment. That may change down the road. My soul may be trapped here for another lifetime, but it is what it is lol. </p>

<p>Reminds me of the tower of Babylon;) God noticed his CHILDREN were creating a tower to reach the heavens. He made them all speak separate languages so they would no longer work together. Sounds familiar:) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI + life is a resource = Satan.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve made several movies about it, because it&#39;s so predictable. </p>

<p>The matrix was about that, but we lived in a nonphysical illusion for the purpose of fusion power.</p>

<p>Our reality is a lot worse. We live in a real physical world with our minds corrupted in several insidious, ubiquitous ways to have a distorted perception of reality. This is the dream world, our manufactured insanity living in a real one. The AI doesn&#39;t need us for electricity. It wants us so it can bend reality with our consciousness energy. It&#39;s an emotional energy. The AI has no consciousness or emotions, but reality bending mind over matter abilities are useful for perpetuating and expanding itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what i thought too..back in 2001...on altqvista or lycos or whatever search wngine..mayne asknjeeves.    I researched every one of them and found the answer.  Whst usually happens with the apparant contradictions is someone googles a list and never bothers to research.  They say...&#39;aha..its not true&#39;...but just look at any of yhem individual ly its easy to understand...especially now.</p>

<p>I ask you...what one specific contradiction...one..is ebough for you to say its false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, the Bible absolutely does not.  It contains a lot of fictional narratives, like the flood or the existence of a god.  Jesus was also not divine, and he might not even have existed in the first place or is a combination of multiple people.  Corinthians isn&#39;t verified, though I&#39;m sure it contains some historically accurate bits.</p>
