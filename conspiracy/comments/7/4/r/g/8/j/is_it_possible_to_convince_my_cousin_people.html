        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about the official story or motive or anything. Forget the details of the whole thing. I believe people actually died in Vegas and at other mass shootings. My cousin genuinely thinks that every mass shooting since Sandy Hook is fake(probably before too but that was the one that set him off down this road). Orchestrated by the government to take our guns. I showed him the video of the guy walking around doing triage where to my mind it&#39;s very clearly real dead bodies. Among many other videos. He says nope all actors and fake blood. Do all conspiracy people think this way? Not trying to sound like a dick or anything but that can&#39;t be the majority way of thinking. Again I&#39;m not talking about the details only that actual people died no matter how it went down or who did it or why. </p>

<p>Is his mind made up no matter what and I should just give up? Or is there something I can show him that will make him think differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just count the shots fired. it is absolutely the last thing they want you to do.
we know 200 were fired down the hall. and 58 dead and 250 injured due to gun fire.
count away. where are all the non lethal strikes that hit real men that would never go to the hospital for such bullshit? there should be countless pics of bullets that people picked out of themselves that were mangled? and the were ricochets and passthroughs on other targets that still struck them with hardly any force? Why didn&#39;t people scatter like when you toss a rock in a pond full of fish? not like the firing stopped? or was no one hit to send the crowd into a frenzy?
if that shit doesn&#39;t show up right away. you can guarantee it is bullshit. they love to stick it in your face and they have nothing once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever you ask where the cell phone footage of anything actually happening at these events is, people say &quot;no one would be filming!&quot; when in reality, yes they would. Hundreds of them would already have their phones out and recording. Dozens, therefore, would have captured bullets striking someone, something, anything. Or seen an actual wound on scene.</p>

<p>However, what&#39;s the point of filming in this situation? What is this jackass accomplishing anyway, let alone with his cell phone? In this situation it would be nonsensical to waste one good arm on your cell phone.</p>

<p>And yet this one four-minute clip is the one that has been foisted on me and posted incessantly so many times in the past few days to &quot;prove&quot; that people were really shot! When it shows literally diddly squat, and is kind of stupid on its face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Liveleak video you&#39;re talking about shows no gunshot wounds, effects of bullet strikes on anything, or medical personnel.  It&#39;s a few people lying there moaning and drooling &quot;blood.&quot;</p>

<p>The power of suggestion is very strong, indeed it&#39;s a form of mind control. Because a few people are lying on the ground moaning or whatever we are to imagine and assume that there is an area where hundreds of shots were fired shooting almost 60 people to death and wounding hundreds of others in the deadliest massacre the country has ever seen, in front of 20,000 witnesses all with recording devices in one of the most heavily video surveilled cities in the world, in the most grisly and horrifying scene of carnage imaginable. </p>

<p>And yet, there&#39;s still no pictures of gunshot wounds, bullet damage, video of any<em>thing</em> being shot. The power of suggestion is strong indeed.</p>

<p>I can assure you that Dr. Fisher is a real surgeon, though I suppose unless you talk to any of the medical staff yourself you won&#39;t be convinced.</p>

<p>The problem with your theory is simply that it is not feasible to carry it out to its natural conclusion. Sure, you could fake the initial incident, but you aren&#39;t thinking far enough ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I do. At the time they happened I did think they were real, but then when studying them saw that they were all part of the same series of faked terror psy-ops. </p>

<p>Put it this way, if we are right about just one of those events being fake -- and I think Sandy Hook is fairly easy to prove -- then the idea that they are all faked deserves serious consideration. At the very least, you can understand why if we think killings are being staged that we would require much better evidence that people were really shot and killed than the silly paucity we have now with this Las Vegas hoax. </p>

<p>He has seen something that does not ring right. I will tell you that if you start paying attention he is not alone. There are a lot of people starting to question these over the top mass casualty events.</p>

<p>That triage video was very real and very disturbing. Now compare to my link.  You will never understand if you are not willing to listen. He is trying to make sense of all of this.  Everyone deals with grief differently and we have seen a lot of people here trying to make sense of this tragedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at The Boston Unbombing on youtube. Then you&#39;ll understand why he thinks this way. The Boston bombing was very clearly staged, in my opinion. But this was not. Show him some of Dave Acton is Acting Out&#39;s tributes on youtube. The hospitals in Vegas are packed with recovering victims. This was not fake. Evidence is everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can watch the video I linked to all the way through and not ask just what the fuck is going on I will eat my words. Your post was on my mind when I woke up this morning.</p>

<p>I can tell you with confidently that the state and the media have pulled of mass casualty drills as real more than once.  Once you see it it will threaten your world view.  Your cousin has seen these things and he is not alone. He probably cares for you very much and wants you to be aware of the danger. </p>

<p>I will leave you with a quote from J Edgar Hoover.</p>

<p>&quot;The individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists.&#39;&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I do. At the time they happened I did think they were real, but then when studying them saw that they were all part of the same series of faked terror psy-ops. </p>

<p>Put it this way, if we are right about just one of those events being fake -- and I think Sandy Hook is fairly easy to prove -- then the idea that they are all faked deserves serious consideration. At the very least, you can understand why if we think killings are being staged that we would require much better evidence that people were really shot and killed than the silly paucity we have now with this Las Vegas hoax. </p>
