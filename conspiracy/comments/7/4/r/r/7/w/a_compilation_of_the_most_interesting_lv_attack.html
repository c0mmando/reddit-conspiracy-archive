This post is just my attempt to consolidate what I&#39;ve found so far. There are several links that I&#39;d like to add, but I can&#39;t find them at the moment. Additionally, I&#39;m sorry if I used one of your posts and didn&#39;t credit you. I&#39;m just trying to put this out there before I go on with my night.</p>

<p><strong>Sheriff Suggests Multiple Shooters During Press Conference</strong></p>

<p>See the full press conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg6mZ80C8qc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>. A few notable moments:</p>

<ul>
<li>9:50 - the sheriff begins to explain why it may appear that there was a delay in reaching the <strong>suspects</strong>. He even pauses for a moment, as if to let what he&#39;d just said resonate with the audience.</li>
<li>20:20 - Sheriff begins to respond to a reporter&#39;s question about accomplices. &quot;It&#39;s <em>troublesome</em> that this individual was able to move this amount of gear into a hotel room <em>unassisted</em>. It&#39;s troublesome, the amount of stuff he had at both residences <em>unassisted</em>.&quot; Note how he emphasizes <em>&quot;unassisted&quot;</em>.</li>
<li>20:48 - the FBI profiler &quot;didn&#39;t understand this individual&quot;</li>
<li>21:03 - &quot;what could be more beneficial than to find people who were associated with him either by friendship or <strong><em>accomplice</em></strong>?&quot; Note the same emphasis is given again.</li>
<li>22:20 - When asked about the shooter&#39;s lack of social media presence: &quot;The premeditation of this room, this is well thought out. <strong><em>So don&#39;t you think the concealment of his history or his life was well thought out?&quot;</em></strong></li>
<li>33:35 - someone whispers &quot;don&#39;t go there&quot; when a reporter asks about Paddock&#39;s car (credit to <a href="/u/10gauge">/u/10gauge</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More Evidence of Multiple Shooters</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e88_1507253728">2:00 - two different guns being shot simultaneously?</a> Note- one user suggested that this isn&#39;t evidence of two guns being fired at once. If anyone has another video that&#39;s a better example, please comment and I&#39;ll update the link.</li>
<li>The Taxi Driver video (among others) shows there were multiple guns being fired at the same time.</li>
<li>Audio analysis of gunshots - suggests suppressors used and multiple shooters (link needed)</li>

</ul>

<p>I know there&#39;s <em>a lot</em> more evidence and video out there, but this is what I had time to compile tonight. Please feel free to add to this post!! I&#39;ve been wanting a megathread of evidence, so I figured I&#39;d just start my own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s so much here that shouldn’t be posted because it throws off too much of the theory. The thread is so confusing because people have differing opinions that other people are spreading to make things even worse. </p>

<p>The fact that a phone charger in his room that doesn’t match his phone is irrelevant. Has anyone thought maybe the charger belongs to any other electronic device in the room, such as the cameras? </p>

<p>The taxi cab videos depicting multiple shooters isn’t a guarantee. No one can claim they saw muzzle flash in the windows. People have confirmed there was a strobe light on floors below. I would believe that before agreeing there were multiple shooters because muzzle flashes cannot be confirmed. No video has surfaced yet that is steady enough to show  the building during the shooting. </p>

It&#39;s 2017, I feel like the FBI would know if it was a charger for an electronic device other than a cell phone. Also, they&#39;ve been investigating for 5 days now. If there was another device that was in the room that matched the charger, they would have found it by now. </p></li>

Explained to my wife that there must be two shooters as one man would have a hard time firing two automatics at the same time. Come to find out they are claiming he used bumpfire stocks.
