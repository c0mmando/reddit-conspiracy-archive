       So where is Jesus Campos? 
He's a hero right? 
Why do we have no interviews or Trump visits with him but Trump visited the hospital for all the other victims that have been injured?
We're supposed to believe that Jesus Campos fucking matrixed 199 bullets in a hallway not much wider than 6' and only was hit by 1 bullet? 
I think hesus Campos or w.e. his real name is was the shooter and the body we have left was the guy viewing the cameras as a lookout.  I think when he realized police and swat were in the building the security guard put paddock down staged the scene unloaded the 200 rounds down the hall shot himself and dressed up as security to wait in the hall 
I spent a good hour last night trying to find any information on Jesus Campos and it's impossible it's also a pretty common name as well making it even harder to sift through and results. 
Open to discussing in the comments =]

       If we believe the story as it's being told, Campos is a big hero.  But, he also makes all those "the police did such a great job" pronouncements look a bit foolish.  He did in a few minutes, without a gun, what an entire swat team took an hour to do.
I think the problem here is that the Casino is screwed.  If they comped the shooter's room, how will that look to the general public?  They're obviously dependent on tourists thinking the area is safe, they just want this to go away.

       But why would an unarmed security guard just run into a room with a known active shooter in it knowing police and swat are literally on their way up?  I don't think they're worried about losing business over this tbh I think it's the opposite.  " Any coverage is good coverage " sort of thing.    Think of all the tourists that want to now go gamble where the shooter gambled   when people visit Texas as tourists how many people make it a must to go and see where the jfk shooting went down?    If they comped his room maybe they were behind it and we're using paddock as the fall? Would explain the security guard able to be there within minutes of it starting

       O definitely.   Just to see the room and see the view he had.       I wonder if the casino is gonna offer both of those rooms as special packages once this is buried by the next conflict

       I don't think they would offer that haha, it would come across as profiteering from a tragedy.

       It will probably be like, they don't rent it out at all, and then some high-roller will offer to pay a fortune to stay in it for the weekend and the MB obliges. High-roller tells his friends, they offer the MB a fortune for a night in that suite, MB accepts. Becomes a secret perk for the rich and powerful. MB profits without looking like greedy monsters publicly.

       And what kind of bullet fragment was removed from his leg?

      <p>
       I have a feeling the two handgun shots after the automatic fire are related. One for his leg, one for Paddock. But that’s only one guess.

       I'm really curious if the investigation has deteremined the last time Paddock was seen walking around the casino.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely possible he didn't leave the room that morning, the night before, etc... but if he doesn't show up leaving or entering his hotel room for 2+ days, then there is definitely something suspicious about that.

       How about instead of refuting the person's point and simply disagreeing with them, why don't you include evidence along with your claim? 
   Anyone can just say the opposite of what someone is claiming with no proof just to try to rope in the unexpected sheeple and think people will agree with you just because it's falling in line with social norms/"govt wouldn't screw us over and lie to us and they know what they're doing and they know what's best for us" ideals/cattle mentality and is the less damning to the gov't/authorities. 
   However this sub isn't the group of people you hang out with, when we make claims here we back it up with evidence/literature to verify said claim (well we used to now I guess anything goes). We don't just contradict a point and make no other argument besides a menial 3rd grade response. 
   Add some meat to those bones and give us some sauce with this bland ass dish your serving because right now you're giving us a big fat nothing burger. We're starved on this subject and instead of watering down the discussion and trying to discredit/weaken the argument of OP, add something meaningful to the topic...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to rant, your comment rubbed me the wrong way and I'm tired of seeing people disagree with something or contradict what OP (not just in this thread, in all threads related to this subject) says, but all they say is, "NUH UH!! [
       <em>
        blank
       </em>
       ] did happen. You're wrong you idiot!" Or "YES! [
       <em>
        blank
       </em>
       ] did happen! You are wrong dummy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY waste your time typing that meaningless comment? You can't expect anyone whose opinion holds water and has a mind capable of critical and FREE thinking to just go "okay this person said this so it must be true! Also, it's just their word and no concrete facts/evidence to defend this silly accusation, but I'm gonna parrot this absurdity and believe them anyway!!" 
   No one is going to take you seriously and you're going to get downvoted and you're taking away from the good theories and evidence that's being brought to light. Quit tainting the discussions. Either add to it with substance or lurk.

       Accomplice that bailed. One of the three. He was part of the escape (uniforms) possible second shooter. He was in the adjoining room. Got scared and bolted. Paddock took some pop shots at him kept firing then bought it. The third person was supposed to dump the explosive laden vehicle at or near the fuel spot. After his to partners bailed/no showed he pumped some rounds into the crowd then into him self.

       FBI was already aware of this cell and was waiting to connect to other cells and botched the timing of the takedown. I think Jesus may have been the inside CI for the FBI. Lack of info is due to Feds not wanting to burn the CI that may be involved in ongoing operations and the fact that they would appear to be the monkey fucking a football.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm prolly way way off. There's just a lot of fucky shit here and a huge void of released info. This theory just sorta popped in my head earlier.

       Something is up with the security guard aspect - I don't think its as nefarious as you're stating but there's something off about it. They said he was responding to a door alarm of some sort and another time they said he noticed the door was ajar when he arrived on that floor- so someone else broke into paddocks room while he was shooting or what? Those parts are so weird but hardly anyone's talking about that stuff (that I've seen). 
Also do you guys think it's possible that swat accidentally shot the security guard and in exchange for him not coming forward about it they would make it known that he "found the room" and was a hero etc?

       The thing about this theory that doesn't make sense is it doesn't sounds like any kind of "government conspiracy" so the FBI would clearly know by now that the guard was in the room before the shooting and came out after and have him in custody. I mean unless yeah he was some kind of undercover agent or something

       You have a point true.   If the government isn't directly involved there would be no reason to cover up especially if the casino orchestrated it but if an undercover was involved it would be a reason to cover up I just can't think of anyway an undercover would fit in my theory unless the government actually knew this was coming? But then that would fall under that terrorist cell theory going around?

       There is a simple explanation. They don't want any accomplice aware of where they are in the investigation. Everything we find out going forward will be days old. They have to protect the integrity of their investigation that means keeping things out of the press

       I've been thinking about this.. If he fired 200 rounds into the hallway, his windows were already open from shooting out. That may be some of what we are hearing as the second and third shooter in all of those different videos. I have been wanting to see the man who got 200 shot at him and survived with a just leg wound.

       I also have been trying to find anything on him because his part in the story seems super vague. Can't find anything. Guy is more of a ghost than Paddock and he is supposedly 25. His whole life should be online.

       It can definitely be un searchable, however you'd think someone would find it or someone who knows him would say something. Another weird thing, I've seen no interviews with hotel employees.

       Yea there should be selfies of friends and family with him like " Jesus is a hero ".  All I can find are hashtags no profile links or anything and there are 2 pics of Jesus 1 of which he's kissing someone but it looks like it's cropped from a full pic.  Doing a reverse image search I couldn't find where that came from at all

       Ok so I've been doing digging and trying to reverse image search with no luck.    So the link he reveals himself on that person's twitter there is one more cropped pic of Campos looks like he may have a gf I tried reversing that image as well and no luck.   Tried searching fb, twitter, and ig and he has no social media which seems weird when the cropped pic of him kissing someone pulls nothing from a reverse image search.   You would think that pic came from his profile or the girls profile but nothing.

       He probably says he notivced the door ajar because he had the other key and doesn't want people to know that while paddox was spraying the crowd he had a friend pop on in.

       This is what I was thinking. He didn't need to kill himself as prepared as he was in that room. There was no way the cops would wound and arrest him, they would have shot to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could have sprayed threw the walls with what he had and put up a fight for hours and taken a pile of cops with him. So many things here make no sense.

       Anyone remember after the Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta when Richard Jewell (a security guard) was suspected of planting the bomb himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       He rushed to clear the area/warn spectators to back away from the device and saved an unknown number of people, and everyone thought he orchestrated the entire thing so that he would be recognized as a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       For 12 weeks this guy’s life was a nightmare, as he was investigated by the FBI and condemned in international news media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not necessarily saying one thing or the other when it comes to Jesus and the LV shootings, but people historically people rush to point the finger in these situations without having all the facts. In this scenario - because of past situations like this - he could have been advised by law enforcement/lawyers/casino executives to lay low, heal, and work with investigators to provide as much info as possible before he starts blabbing to news outlets.
