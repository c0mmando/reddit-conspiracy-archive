       Look...this is all distracting from the real point: the footage from other hotel lobbies where
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006205137/https://imgur.com/a/bd1Zr">
        TONS OF WITNESSES
       </a>
       are claiming there were shooters on the ground.  where is the footage of the shooters NOT there?  bellagio lobby footage around 1042pm is much more important to the case at this point.  or even one clip from one of the thousands of tourists watching the chaos down near Mandalay Bay from the far side of the strip.  it's what we're not seeing that is making this whole thing fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one person out of the thousands on the strip that weekend night didn't record those areas near the other hotels during the chaos?  I've seen hundreds of clips near the Mandalay Bay, but none from people watching from a distance further north on the strip where other shooters are being reported. VERY STRANGE, GUYS!  This is gonna bring them down. This is impossible to cover up.  seriously, if you are shilling, get out while you still can!!  you owe nothing to the monsters who made this happen, and you're given an impossible task of covering up their mess, it won't work!

       Wrong! It's not blind faith. I don't believe their reports to be factual. But it is absolutely considerable evidence. Meanwhile there is a MASSIVE HOLE in video evidence from one end of the strip.  If you're not a shill, which I'm 100% certain you are, but if you are not then open your fucking eyes dude!

       This is true. Video recording equipment costs money. Storage space for the video costs money. They're willing to do it on the floor because that's where the money is. Can't have cheats or robberies. They have it in the back-of-house to detect intruders (again robberies) and for loss prevention. They don't have it on higher floors, because the likelihood of someone on a higher floor costing the casino money is almost unheard of.

       I seriously doubt that is correct. LE has said they have footage but they aren't releasing it to the public until the investigation is over. They do not think he plotted this alone. They even said the tape could be used in a trial and to release it to the public could damage any future case. The investigation did not end with Paddocks death.

       It would be very odd for them to not have any footage. It is Vegas after all lol. I can understand them not releasing it. IMO this isn't a hoax and maybe not even a false flag. But there is a bigger picture that we don't see yet. Something is way off about this one. Also, if it is a false flag...from what I see LVPD doesn't know it. This isn't like Sandy Hook. That was done in a small town in a controlled environment. Way too many variables to pull those stunts on the Vegas strip.

       This whole this is a red herring, they aren't losing shit, no matter what it's a big distraction.  They are still doing whatever the fuck they want and enslaving us all in the process.  They own the federal reserve and are the unseen oligarchy of the USA.  People died and got hurt, but in contrast it's insignificant to the big picture.

       does not even have to be in the hallway or elevator landing, but 100% they have them inside the elevator itself.  enough to get a list within hours of suspects he was traveling with or those getting off on his floor leading up to time of shooting.  wouldn't be too hard to pick out the tourists from the terrorists.

       it's been nearly a week, we know they aren't hung up analyzing phone chargers.

       Look...this is all distracting from the real point: the footage from other hotel lobbies where

        TONS OF WITNESSES
       </a>
       are claiming there were shooters on the ground.  where is the footage of the shooters NOT there?  bellagio lobby footage around 1042pm is much more important to the case at this point.  or even one clip from one of the thousands of tourists watching the chaos down near Mandalay Bay from the far side of the strip.  it's what we're not seeing that is making this whole thing fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one person out of the thousands on the strip that weekend night didn't record those areas near the other hotels during the chaos?  I've seen hundreds of clips near the Mandalay Bay, but none from people watching from a distance further north on the strip where other shooters are being reported. VERY STRANGE, GUYS!  This is gonna bring them down. This is impossible to cover up.  seriously, if you are shilling, get out while you still can!!  you owe nothing to the monsters who made this happen, and you're given an impossible task of covering up their mess, it won't work!

       All this gnashing about any surveillance video. Even if there was any video, it wouldn't get released during the investigation unless they had a very specific reason to do so.
