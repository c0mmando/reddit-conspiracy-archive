        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>I was unfairly banned from r/conspiracy with the explanation that I&#39;m a troll, when I am clearly not.</strong> They have not replied to any message I&#39;ve sent.</p>

<p>Article about the door alarm: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/06/us/las-vegas-shooting-investigation/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/06/us/las-vegas-shooting-investigation/index.html</a> Didn&#39;t they just officially say Wednesday, that the person staying in the room below the shooter called the front desk, and that&#39;s how the guard ended up there?</p>

<p>Also, now they&#39;ve found the phone that belongs to the mysterious charger?(more relevant in a minute) Article: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/las-vegas-massacre-investigators-probing-whether-others-were-gunman-s-n808431">https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/las-vegas-massacre-investigators-probing-whether-others-were-gunman-s-n808431</a> (note, this is the same link cited by the next Article)</p>

<p>4 hours ago, <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/10/06/new-evidence-may-suggest-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-was-not-alone-in-hotel-room/23235474/">https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/10/06/new-evidence-may-suggest-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-was-not-alone-in-hotel-room/23235474/</a> AOL article states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Senior law enforcement officials told <strong>NBC News</strong> that they have made two discoveries in Paddock&#39;s 32nd-floor hotel room that they currently cannot explain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bolded part is supposed to link/cite the article, and instead goes to an article titled:&quot;Police ‘Confident’ No One Else in Shooter’s Room Before Las Vegas Attack&quot; which is the opposite of what the AOL article says, and <strong>the exact same content of the first NBC article I linked</strong> - they changed the article! Did they release info they weren&#39;t supposed to, and they&#39;re attempting to <strong>make it disappear?</strong> I found the archived version(5 hours old) of the same link, what the fuck? <a href="http://archive.is/5rXHg">http://archive.is/5rXHg</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/tDyYI">http://archive.is/tDyYI</a> this is the AOL article, archived an hour ago.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#39;ve never been on the &quot;fake news&quot; bandwagon, but this is pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>Edit: to be clear, this link is the <em>exact same link</em> as the archived version. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/las-vegas-massacre-investigators-probing-whether-others-were-gunman-s-n808431">https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/las-vegas-massacre-investigators-probing-whether-others-were-gunman-s-n808431</a> same link in archived form <a href="http://archive.is/5rXHg">http://archive.is/5rXHg</a> </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t simply add something, or make a correction, everything about it is different, the title, the content.. and it says the exact opposite of the original article, and mentions nothing from the original.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand this &quot;fake news&quot; stuff. NBC is trying to get new news, even if that means contradicting what they&#39;ve previously reported. If the police say they are confident in something, then the story is that this is what the police said- not what we&#39;re saying. You&#39;ve also probably got different reporters with different sources.</p>

<p>Yes, I want new news, but that doesn&#39;t mean they should delete the original article.

    <div class="md"><p>They <strong>should</strong> be giving notice that, say, &quot;new information has been presented to the editorial staff that contradicts the previously reported content, and nothing within this revised article was present in the previous&quot;.</p>

<p>Just replacing your reporting with something that&#39;s condradicts the original reporting is incredibly unethical by journalistic standards. Did they not verify their info? Why did they publish it without verificiation? Who disputed it? It seems like they had verifiable sources that gave info, and after it hit, someone high up called to dispute it and provide the &quot;correct information&quot;, from a more &quot;reputable source&quot;.</p>

<p>Regardless of <em>why</em> it was done, <em>how</em> it was done is equally important, they didn&#39;t want anyone to know it had changed.</p>
