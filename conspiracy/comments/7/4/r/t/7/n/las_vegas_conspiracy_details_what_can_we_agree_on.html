    <div class="md"><p>We can also agree on the crime scene is staged. The positioning of the pistol he supposedly commited suicide with is way above his head while his hands are perfectly by his side and more. </p>

<p>There are multiple shooters.</p>

<p>Gun used is a m60 e6  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKbiG6UoJY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKbiG6UoJY</a> (look at who was shooting it last month)</p>

<p>Thats what comes to mind. I agree with all your points.</p>

<p>Also i would like to mention in one of the tax&#39;s videos you can see a flash occur from the pyramid. Some people see it some people dont. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His hands facing downwards still proves he didnt commit suicide. Regardless of kicking a gun. Your arms arent going to be in that position. Straight down as it is in the pics of his body. he was shot twice. One in the torso one in the head above the left eye. The shot at his head is at an angle you  know why? because the bullet enters the upper part of his head but exits out the lower part which is why we have a larger pool of blood at the lower part of his head. I made a post about the crime scene here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74or16/footage_i_havent_seen_in_the_feed_shared_footage/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74or16/footage_i_havent_seen_in_the_feed_shared_footage/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) There is no proof that paddock is a mass murderer until we see video footage, or any kind of evidence that corroborates that. This is not a fact. Many believe he did not commit the attack at all, but was a patsy. 
2) You can never &quot;prove&quot; a theory, only corroborate it. Scientific theories are agreed upon everyday based solely on supporting evidence. 
3) How does this differ from the MSM narrative...? is any of this conspiracy related??? If so- where do you think the conspiracy lies? and if there is no conspiracy, why are you even here? 
4) How is this even getting upvotes??? I want conspiracy theories, if you have none, GO HOME. </p>

who do you think murdered him, the CIA?
Why do you think he had nearly no record of personal life available... and why did he have the guns if you was selling them/smuggling them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he could have killed himself, the security guard could have offed him, the cops could have killed him, etc. He doesn&#39;t have social media, that doesn&#39;t mean he has no record of personal life available, it has yet to be released to the public. 3rd: why does anyone do anything? there isn&#39;t enough evidence to point any solid answer for the amount of arsenal in that room yet.. which is why it&#39;s frustrating to see people jump to conclusions. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>He was an arms dealer/smuggling guns/selling guns to terrorists</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Speculation.  </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>He laundered his money through gambling through the casinos</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>More speculation, although casinos were formed to help the mob launder their money, right? I guess it could work from the consumer side, I would however like a brief explanation from someone who knows. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>He was a secret agent/part of deep state/mafia (or all of the above)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>More speculation. We do know he worked for a company that was bought out by Lockheed Martin, and that he sold his plane to another smaller company that is also a defense contractor. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>He was murdered</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Allegedly. The initial report was police killed him then they found him dead, and then I think it&#39;s changed again. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>He was working with associates/an agency</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Speculation. There&#39;s no evidence. Logistically it makes more sense than a single shooter. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>ISIS/CIA were involved somehow</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Speculation. We need more proof. All we know is what we&#39;ve seen from the photos. </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Things did not go as Stephan had planned, but someone else had planned the terror, and he was caught in the crossfire</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed they didn&#39;t go as he planned. Something was fucked from jump street. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need more information. Something. Anything. </p>
