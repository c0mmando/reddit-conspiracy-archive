       If you don't think so, then that means they lied about their role in it after claiming responsibility.

       If so then won't that mean other things they claimed they did were lies too?

       I'm pretty sure they just took advantage of it. They claim that the shooter converted "a few months ago"... I'm not saying it isn't possible, but a 60+ year old convert would be pretty rare. Most converts are between 15 and 30. Just old enough not to believe everything their parents tell them, not old enough to be set in their ways

       Stop.

      <p>
       The U.S. &amp; UN formally refer to the group as ‘ISIL’ (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant). Others refer to them as Da’ish/Daesh. THEY rebranded themselves as ‘IS’ (Islamic State) in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       Past use of the acronym ‘ISIS’ stems from translations of their former names, specifically in regards to the word ‘al-Sham’; which basically translates to ‘Syria’, ‘Greater Syria’, and/or Damascus’.

       the MO of shooting up a concert. similar to bataclan, manchester. premeditation, planning. shows deep ideological commitment &amp; resources. who better as a sleeper cell than a nondescript white guy, he can amass weapons without attracting attention, esp in Nevada. rumours now that he may have travelled to the middle east (tho admittedly only on cruise ships apparently), claims that he made a video etc. more concrete links to Phillippines too, where there is a jihadist war going on. no proof as yet, but if it's not Isis directly it seems like he was emulating them.

       For his personal reasons we can only guess. If he was crazy enough to pull off the shooting, then why not crazy enough to be ISIS symphatizer or even something worse. At the moment there's no way for us to know for sure why he did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       US could and would deny it for multiple reasons. Intelligence agencies would seem weak and failed. Policies and security protocols would seem weak and failed. ISIS would enjoy the success of mission accomplished and US would suffer a public loss. Etc. They could later however say it was ISIS and use it as a nice war promoter and go bomb some poor country.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I don't think ISIS was behind it. But it's a small option in my mind.

       If he was the shooter, wouldn't you say he is at least a bit of a crazy person? And if he was crazy enough to shoot all those people, then it wouldn't be that weird to be ISIS emphatizer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was a nice war promoter, all the plans to invade Iraq were already in good speed according to some sources. So it was beneficial to admit it. Also it would be extremely hard to deny that such a coordinated attack wasn't any terrorist organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they don't have plans ready this time, then it's not beneficial to admit it, yet. Also it would be so much easier to just deny it this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he did the act of shooting alone, but wasn't acting entirely alone. He had somebody helping him pull it off. That's what I currently believe. But I'm open for any good theory.

       They said they did it. More often than not there is evidence they did it when they admit. Doesn't mean the FBI didn't collaborate with them. 23 guns seems like something you'd arm a small army with, could've had bigger plans.

       94% hit rate on their claims even recently + a 0-day claim of involvement + no alternative theory from anyone. I don't need to know who the shooter was, and I don't know what ISIS is, but I'm still betting on it.

       Confusion is definitely part of it. They want to portray themselves as more powerful than they are, it's a huge propaganda point (while simultaneously always needing more soldiers for the cause). I read some of their inane magazines, they rarely play it small. It's a mix of religious psychosis, magical thinking, conspiracy everything and some astute observations of US role in fucking up the ME (I think all the nonsense is amplified by the facts on the ground, US foreign policy sucking).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mateen was an interesting example, in which they claimed him and he claimed them but no correspondence of any kind came to light. Bottom line is they're murderous assholes who should not be trusted when they claim anything, just as we don't trust the governments charged with running them.
