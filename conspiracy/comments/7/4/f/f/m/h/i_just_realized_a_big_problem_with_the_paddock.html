       I saw an interview with his brother where the brother claim that Stephen got rich gambling - specifically slots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what?  It is impossible to be good at slots.  There is absolutely nothing you can to get better at slots.  If you play slots over time you will lose.  That's how casinos make their money.  That is why people with a gambling problem go broke and end up in debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often times when someone claims they have gambling winnings it is a way to launder money they obtained by other illegal means.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this proves a conspiracy.  Simply that the idea that he made money playing slots is hard to buy, and the idea that he became wealthy playing slots is preposterous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where did this guy get his money?  Some sort of illegal activity.  It seems he was leading a double life.

       interesting read, breaks down a good deal of whats known about him and his gambling habits.  article says the average payout is around 91%.  Good players can raise those odds.  Paddock played for big comps and to offset any losses.  You spend 10K, lose 1K but get comped rooms, shows and meals you're coming out ahead depending on what kind of comps you're getting.

       Worked at one of the larger casinos, you can't beat the slots. You can't beat any of the games, they watch everyone so closely the moment they thought you were "beating the game" you'd get kicked out. And any time of "sleight of hand" bullshit you see in the movies won't happen. Those cameras are good enough to zoom in on a dollar bill and read the serial number off the bill from across the casino floor. I've seen it with my own eyes.

       I've made a living gambling for more than 3 decades now.  I beat the casino and I know many other people that beat the casino.  Slots, video poker, blackjack, poker, sports betting and even baccarat can be beat.

       Slots are solitary games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody pays attention to the people playing slots. Even if they win, big, they are just a lucky-random-someone to everyone else in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poker is a very face-to-face game. To make a lot of money on it, you either need to play
       <em>
        A LOT
       </em>
       or you need to win big while playing at the big boy table. Either would be remembered by
       <em>
        SOMEONE
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes if you won big at roulette / blackjack / etc.. People remember the guy sitting/playing at their table who won $100k right in front of their eyes.

       A person who said he was a former neighbour for about seven months claimed Paddock was a regular at a nearby local bar who'd routinely come in to for a few drinks and to play the video slot machine there. Said he himself and one of his crew were former marines who often visited the same bar for drinks after work and had met and had had numerous friendly conversations with Paddock every so often. Although he and his workmate sometimes discussed guns with Paddock present he showed no particular interest or any kind of specific knowledge about them. He also maintained that Paddock was an easy-going guy who happened to favour Trump before the election. Obviously he doesn't believe the official narrative. This was on a call-in show that the only follow-up has been that the police very much want to talk to this guy.

       Or bet on sports.   I made a lot of money at the different books in LV.  If you devote all your energies to this it can be quite profitable, but it means watching sports 24/7 and shuffling back and forth to catch the middle when one book has 1.5 points more or less on an over/under etc.

       if you watch a slot machine for a day and havea rough idea what has been put in it without paying out then you increase your chances dramtically. its mentioned somewhere how that is how he got to know his gf, her job was literally to let him know the slots that were ripe

       Casinos always comp regulars.  Paddock wasn't paying for shit at the casino - not his room, not drinks, not food.
      </p>

       That tells you a little something about how casinos make their money, and how likely it is that someone can become rich at one.

       This isn't really accurate. My mom used to work in the cash cage at several casinos in reno. Nearly everyone asks which machines are about to hit. She would give everyone an "insider tip" you dont have to be right very often to make several times your wages in tips.

       I think that's the point your mom made. She could give everyone a "tip" and even if a fraction won she would make an actual tip. But there are fast many more not making a thing. That's why most people know he couldn't have made even what we think he's worth, off just slots and real estate.

       Some video poker slots have a jackpot which rises and WILL pay out before it exceeds a set maximum.

       You
       <em>
        can

       make money from them consistently with enough patience, but certainly nowhere near enough to support the kind of lifestyle Paddock supposedly had. It would be a massive waste of time for someone with his wealth.

       This would make sense of reports of Paddock watching other players and then jump on their machines after they leave to go to the bathroom or whatever. If he sees a jackpot getting high it might be the game to play.

        At the Atlantis in Reno, Mr. Paddock would often move to a machine when somebody using it got up to take a break. “That would annoy people and he did not seem to care at all,” Mr. Weinreich said. “He acted like ‘these machines are for me.’”
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Paddock was also a “starer,” Mr. Weinreich said.
       </p>
       <p>
        “He loved to stare at other people playing,” he said. “It was not a good thing because it would make other VIPs in the high-limit area uncomfortable.”

       The house always wins, trust me, my grandpa spent all of his retirement money on slots before he died. Sometimes he would win like a thousand bucks or something but more often than not he would lose that much or more. The new machines are a joke, they do pay or but you almost never get an actual jackpot unless you bet max and every line, which can be like $5 per try or more. You can't make money exclusively on slots, the casinos design them like that

       You can 100 % consistently make money on very specific machines if you have enough patience and discipline. I don't know how many of these machines are still around these days though.

       Video Poker = Slots . I personally know people who live the life of a "professional slot player" .. It's a constant transfer of money between the player and the casino. It's a lifestyle littered with "comps" that give the player the illusion that they are living a luxurious and profitable lifestyle, but it's a numbers game and the casinos will take most players money a majority of the time. However, there will always be players who end up on top over the years, these people are certainly "outliers" in terms of probability and Stephen Paddock may have very well been one of these people.

       Yes.  Although I would add that simply making 1$ over years at slots makes you an outlier.

       Most of these involve old coin based slot machines. I don't think I've seen one of those in years. What you see today is machines that accept bills or tickets.

       I read most "professional gamblers" in vegas used to play a specific video poker machine (look for a specific payout on 3 of a kind on certain machines).  No way to make $ on slots long term, but video poker isn't a slot there is some skill, although I doubt vegas would allow any machine on the floor that doesnt have a house edge.  I also think he got rich before retirement and is a gambler in his retirement years is my take.

       Im just gonna say it but you're wrong. his brother said he made most of his money from real estate. He won jackpots on slot machines but he didnt earned every dime he had. i used to work at a high end country club and caddied for many very wealthy people. not a single one of them had one source of income. they had several that added up. im sure the case is the same with this guy.

       I heard one report saying a casino staff member specifically remembers Stephen on one slot machine for 8 hours. I'm sure this is a lie it's slot machines no one is paying any attention to the old fucks sitting at them. Still waiting for one CCTV video or image of this guy even at the casino playing or walking halls to his room at his hotel

       I have a friend who used to write slot software (now leads the IT dept. at a local casino). According to him, it's much more than just RNG and math. He never gave me many details but he did say that, for example, the systems he worked on were rigged to never pay out high amounts two spins in a row -- whether the spins were on the same machine, or machines near each other. He also said his systems were rigged to make a row of slots appear more lucky to draw crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did this software many years ago, so it may have changed now (laws have tightened on this stuff, I understand).

       That stuff is highly illegal and your game would be rejected from the approval agencies and never make it to the casino floor. It's one of the most highly regulated industries.

       Not discrediting your theory as I too think this guy had an external shady source of income. Just telling you there is ways to be good at slots.
      </p>
      <p>
       My uncle is good at slots. He surveys the slot area and checks for the slot addicts. Its easy to recognise this people. He studies them and using their machine choices he decides which machines pay up and which ones are not worth even touching.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has various methods for deciding. One of the most obvious one is this. When he sees someone playing for a really long time and not winning much. He takes note. If he leaves without winning mayor price my uncle steps in and plays in the same machine. He almost always wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       We not rich and casinos are forbidden in my country, but whenever we go abroad we always go to the casino and make decent cash. So I know for a fact there is a way to make money on slots.

       I dont think you and "dncidapsyop" are aware of the man's actual wealth. It's not impossible to win and profit from slots, it's impossible to gain that level of wealth playing slots.

       Personally I believe he said that to fuel the white privelage narrative. His second interview is full of rambling and defending his money. I think they are all agents of some kind, brother is now a ghost or was already dead. Anymore info that comes out on paddock is just red herring, further narrative. There were clearly multiple guns shooting from different locations. This throws the paddock story "out the window", so to speak.

       Ya and the other narrative besides slots is video poker. Technically those are both house games, tough to play implied odds and become a professional.

       Well, you are wrong. You just ask the attendants what machines are set to pay off (meaning both higer payout percentage and hasn't hit in a while). They'll tell you in the hopes of a tip if you win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing that increases your chances of winning by a lot.
