<p>Also, wouldn’t they be extra careful in making sure everything added up? </p>

<p>Just genuinely curious. I find myself skeptical when seeing all of these theories, but I would like to better understand the motives behind the skepticism rather than questioning everything for the pure sake of being skeptical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my question is then, how do we ever know what to believe and is there a purpose in questioning it?</p>

<p>I say this because if it did happen, and people did die, it is extremely sad and I would not want to take away from that. </p>

<p>And again, what about the coach at my school who was killed? And what about the people in the hospital trump has visited? People must have died, this coach was well known and liked and his family is devastated. I also just don’t see how thousands of people were there and no one would come out and say “hey this never happened”.  Surely many would.  </p>

<p>It’s just behind frustrating since we have such a hunger for the truth and may never get it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh people died. Go watch that extremely graphic footage then compare it to Boston.  Yo will see the difference.  </p>

<p>To put it bluntly it is not easy having to think for yourself and it sucks when you learn you have to because the media is lying to you. Having my daughter woke me up.  I have spent a lot of time trying to get a grip on truth.  Slippery fucking thing and I will admit I did not know what to believe at first. It sucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay. I was confused because people mentioned actors which made me think that people think the entire thing is fake/no one died. </p>

<p>So for example people think that there was a shooting and people died, but that the way it happened/who did it is not the way they’re reporting it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has demonstrated or established that real shots were fired let alone that anyone was shot or killed. There is a Liveleak video going around that is being promoted as horrific and graphic aftermath but which really shows nothing of the sort. The power of suggestion is a strong form of mind control, where if you claim that something extraordinary happened, repeat it enough, and show any images that may imply that this thing happened, it will be enough proof for many people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was actually a coach at my school killed there. How else would he disappear, what is the explanation for that if you’re saying no one died? </p>

<p>I did see a liveleak video of dead and barely alive people on the ground covered in blood. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t all the people there, 22,000, come out and say hey this didn’t happen? </p>

<p>The Liveleak video doesn&#39;t actually show anything. People (like me) who believe these things are faked and staged, we also believe that they film scenes like this to use the power of suggestion to make people believe there was really a shooting. If you look closely there&#39;s no gunshot wound, no bullet damage, no medical personnel, and nothing that couldn&#39;t easily be faked on a low budget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be crisis actors. Could be that paddock was the guy who is dead on the floor of that room. A lot of moving parts go into a false flag. The body in the room had gloves on. This could have been an attempt to hide his fingerprints from being on the weapons when he wasn&#39;t the real shooter. The guy hey interviewed as his brother seemed to know very little about him. The &quot;shooter&quot; looks as average as a 2001 Toyota Camry as far as 60 year old white guys go. I&#39;m not saying that there is definitive proof but once the puzzle pieces start to line up, the picture begins to make sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the ones lately are suspect.  Columbine feels real to me when I look back over the footage. Try and watch those docs I shared. Other ones like the DC snipers ya crazy people do stuff.  But these big over the top terror events...</p>

<p>I will tell you this and I have spent months/years looking at it.  Video, documents, articles a lot of time.  </p>

<p>I strongly believe the Boston Bombing was staged. As crazy as that sounds. I believe those two boys thought they were taking part in a drill. Watch as much as this as you can.  This guy does a great job of pointing the real terrorists out and giving possible reasons why people would take part in something like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll definitely watch them when I have time. </p>

<p>And what do you mean they believed they were taking part in a drill? Didn’t one hide in a boat or something too?</p>

<p>Also, it was mentioned that the actors could go to jail if they leak the truth. Suppose a bunch of them leaked the truth, wouldn’t the trials for their arrests cause more and more people, the people involved- judges, cops, etc- to know the secret too? Or what if they tell family members and the family members leak it?</p>

<p>I just can’t believe that In all these situations, these supposed actors haven’t come clean to the public. </p>

<p>Definitely not sure where I stand, I guess in the middle, I just really have no clue what to believe anymore. </p>

<p>I first accepted this notion when I watch a lot of sandy hook hoax videos. I was pretty convinced at first that it was a hoax. What are your thoughts on sandy hook?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same thing.  Staged, Sandy Hook or Newtown is a weird place. The police dept is a corrupt hellhole with cops dealing coke and steroids. St Rose of Lima church has housed more than a few child molesters &amp; even a meth head priest.  80 years ago a militant NAZI moved to town and set up some kind of training camp before the town outlawed it. Counsel on foreign relations and other wealthy political people and an old State Hospital with a creep factor off the scale. lol</p>

<p>Truth is stranger than fiction. Couldn&#39;t be more true when researching these topics. I think people should be aware of these things but not let them consume you. Just don&#39;t let them fool you.  It&#39;s all very terrifying, especially now with Antifa/BLM and that sort of stuff happening.</p>

<p>How do you come forward when they control courts, police and media? The only person who would talk to you would be alternative media. Once you watch a noble lie you can research all the dead people who &quot;came forward&quot;. They stopped the search for children so they could empty a weapons locker that had grenades in it. They kept grenades in the same building as a daycare. Then denied it and that was it.</p>

<p>OK rant over, it is nice to see people becoming aware of this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who stopped a search for children for grenades? Is that from sandy hook?</p>

<p>And what do you mean all of the dead people who “came forward”? People who were announced dead but weren’t? 
And what do the people who are claimed to be dead but actually aren’t do with their lives? Like all the children in sandy hook, were they just made up names?</p>

<p>It’s certainly interesting but I guess the main thing that stumps me is how so many people could keep quiet. I realize the courts and legal systems can be controlled but with social media you’d thing someone could get the word out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sorry for confusion.  OK city bombing is where the grenades and weapons were.  There was a day care in the federal building and 20 or so children died.</p>

<p>If you came forward your life would be ruined, also you are part of a group that was already vetted and you have signed documents and have been told it is legal, which it is kindof.  Look into smith-mundt modernization act or war powers act.  They can legally lie to us now.</p>

<p>Here is a short one to watch.</p>

<p>But the Boston unbombing video is quite convincing so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He covers it in unbombing i think.  They skipped triage and went straight to operating rooms.  Which I assume were controlled.  Usually people get checked out before they into OR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A false flag is when those who orchestrated or committed the act are different than who they appear to be.  Imagine some warship literally falsely flying some other king&#39;s flag while plundering a merchant vessel, so that people get the wrong impression about who&#39;s at fault.</p>

<p>Some things which are commonly accused of being false flags include:</p>

<ul>
<li>mass shootings - often people believe that they&#39;re intentionally set up by the government, in order to push a case for gun control.</li>
<li>terrorist attacks - people may believe that the terrorists were in cahoots with, or purposefully provoked by, some Machiavellian western leader, in order to push some kind of protection racket which involves people ceding the leader greater amounts of power.</li>
<li>war crimes by regime forces in foreign countries - if these are staged by third parties, then they can be used to enhance the case for an invasion/intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason a false flag can be kept secret is that relative to the amount of social impact of the event, the number of people involved does not need to be huge, and often the people involved wind up dead which makes it easy to clean up loose ends.  Plus, if psychological pressure and provocation is involved, people may not even know where to look.</p>
