    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Consider the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He started his career working as an accountant/auditor for a defense contractor. He kills two birds with one stone: He learns about the shadier aspects of the arms industry and the finance mechanisms behind it. He realizes he can make a ton of money by going into the arms business for himself. This is the start of Steve's "secret life".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What's the best way to wash dirty gun money? Gambling of course. Steve was a careful guy though, and realized gambling alone wasn't enough to keep suspicion off of him - so he started investing in real estate. Oh, and he bought real estate in cash. That's not what most real estate investors do. They finance at least SOME of their investment. He didn't (at least the properties we know about)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Steve had guns. A lot of guns. Enough guns to outfit a militia and he'd been buying them for decades. More guns than a smart guy like Steve would ever need just for himself. His multiple houses were nothing more than inventory depots for his product.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At some point Steve got into business with ISIS. Maybe before he met Danley or maybe after. He may have even used her as a cover to get in good with the militants in her home country of the Philippines. Regardless, something changed in the past year in his business relationship with ISIS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's no secret that ISIS has been losing ground and money rapidly over the last year and probably got desperate. Instead of attempting to convert Steve to Islam, they blackmailed him. They told him he would have 6 months to a year etc. to plan and carry out an attack on their behalf or they would kill his entire family and girlfriend. If he did it then they would leave him alone. So what does he do - go to the cops? That option waved bye-bye when he started selling weapons to terrorists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         An affiliation with ISIS but NOT an adherence to their doctrine would explain a lot of things that don't add up in this story:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         He had never shown any signs of outright hatred or aggression towards the type of people he planned on killing.  This is a partial reason why he did the deed from far away (most radicalized mass shooters like to be up close so they can see their victims). He didn't hate them - it was just an ugly job he had to do.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Authorities have made it clear it looked like he was trying to escape. ISIS fighters go down shooting - they don't run.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This would also explain why ISIS is taking responsibility for the attack but not providing evidence. Either the evidence shows they blackmailed him (which isn't as good for their PR/recruiting as claiming they converted him) or almost all of their communications were heavily encrypted or rarely occurred at all digitally. Remember, Steve was smart as shit and would have covered his tracks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This would explain the reports about random people throwing firecrackers on the ground to distract people as well as the "brown lady" that told people they were "all going to die tonight". This was Steve's ISIS "support" team that was there to assist but also ensure he went through with it. This would also explain the ridiculous amount of extra guns and ammo in the hotel room. Perhaps ISIS originally planned on having someone else up their with him but plans changed last minute. Perhaps they had to bail on their bomb plans as well.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I might come back and edit again but let me know what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit 1: Steve apparently lost a ton of weight over the past year and we already know he was prescribed to valium for the past 3 months. These are signs of a guy that's being eaten away internally by stress

       ISIS are Mossad agents in Syria and Iraq, not in the Philippines or the US. I will replace ISIS with CIA and have another go at this.

       The Philippines angle is kind of inconsequential. My main point is he got involved with ISIS at some point, just not sure how.

       How did ISIS sneak into the 32nd floor, even though Paddock had cameras wired to give him a live feed of the hallway and himself, break the windows and set up guns to specifically fire full-atuo and in a "toss one gun away and grab another"fashion, then somehow escape down from the 32nd floor without being at least traced? Why is ISIS a super secret spy organization now who doesn't want to be discovered? ISIS wants to be martyrs, remember? Their militants are willing to die. They suicide-bomb. This doesn't make any sense. Besides, Paddock had about 30-ish guns? ISIS buys them by the pallet, 30 guns means nothing to them

       I never said they did. In fact I said in my post they never actually showed up in the hotel but were possibly planning to originally before something changed

       I'm confused if you are saying he escaped or how he possibly thought he could escape.

       Most people that commit large scale attacks don't like people to know about it beforehand....because then it tends not to happen

       They would be buying them in the US if they were planning to use them for attacks here. Buying illegal guns in the US is a lot easier than smuggling them in.

       The sheriff in yesterday's press conference mentioned that something in October 2016 caused Paddock to start his gun-buying spree, but didn't say what it was.
