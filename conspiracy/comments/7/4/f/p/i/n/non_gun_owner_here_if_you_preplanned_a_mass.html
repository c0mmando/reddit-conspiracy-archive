        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to work in the (low budget) film industry and did some action films. Guns are HEAVY. They are really heavy and so is ammo. If action heros actually carried real guns, they&#39;d be walking not running.</p>

<p>Therefore if you are preplanning a mass shooting, surely your objective would be to remain as inconspicuous as possible. Turning up to a hotel with minimum 10 cases would be noticed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, surely it would make more sense to bring 3 guns of the same type - 2 back ups in case there was an issue with the main gun. The ammo needed would be reduced, so would the weight and amount of luggage.</p>

<p>So why would the shooter take 20 guns with him? Am I missing something as a non-gun owner?</p>

<p>Edit: thanks so much for your replies, I&#39;ve learned a lot. Also this is my first proper post in this sub so also thanks for being so nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that the fire from the video was a little more excessive than how one is trained in the military on lmgs. 3-5 second bursts or there abouts. A trick they taught you is hold for as long as it takes you to say &quot;die, motherfucker die&quot;. But this is on a weapon designed for sustained bursts, so it&#39;d make sense to have multiple weapons, but even so 20 is very excessive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you could totally walk in and out of a hotel repeatedly with a bag or two at a time over the course of days, but then they should have a dozen or more tapes of him walking in and out with a bag or two.  They should have ample footage of him going in and out.  </p>

<p>A still frame from <em>any</em> of those tapes couldn&#39;t possibly compromise an ongoing investigation (since the media has already released his name and image).  But the only images of him that have been published are totally unrelated to the incident.  The security tapes are obviously a matter of public interest, so the only reason they wouldn&#39;t release even a still frame from <em>any</em> of that supposed huge amount of footage would be if none of that footage exists.</p>

If this indeed was a lone wolf scenario, why would he have tons of guns and ammo at home when he&#39;s buying out a presidential suite to commit mass murder?

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I admit I was being a dick off the start. But these holes aren&#39;t really holes to me. Asking &quot;why did he have so many guns and ammo&quot; isn&#39;t a question - guy wanted to kill as many people as he could. Of course he&#39;s got a shitload there! He planned on shooting much longer but his camera system was obstructed by the security guard so he finished himself right than.  And no I never ever once said or thought that this guy thought he&#39;d get away. He was going to kill himself once police located and closed in on him - which is exactly what the narrative says. Everything makes sense - the only &quot;hole&quot; I&#39;ve heard that is questionable is eyewitnesses stating more than one shooter. People may think that because there would be sound coming from the gun, bullet whip, and bullet contact. 3 separate noises from shots raining from 334m away. I&#39;ve been scouring conspiracy since this happened because I firmly believe the gov runs false flag events to push agendas the population wouldn&#39;t let happen. When this happened I thought it was the case - but the more I read the more I believe this guy did it himself to go out with a bang. 
I think Boston Bombing, 9/11, and Sandy Hook were false flag events. 
I do not think Vegas was a false flag event.</p>

<p>So end of argument because we aren&#39;t going to get anywhere or convince one another to think any differently. I think your idea is farfetched and unplayable personally - and you think I am wrong personally. </p>

<p>We got our points across - have a good day ✌</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so personally I don&#39;t believe in that theory at all (in fact currently I believe pretty strongly in what msm is presenting us). Which is surprising but the evidence in videos adds up to me. I also only heard of one camera and that was on the room service cart in the hallway. Also I haven&#39;t heard if its confirmed that it was on or not. So where are you getting that he streamed it overseas? The wiring to the gf makes sense I mean.. He probably loved her, might as well try to set her up for as much success as possible. The multiple guns thing is quite weird. Your theory makes pretty good sense but you don&#39;t need THAT many guns. In my opinion he&#39;s at way more risk bringing those guns due to getting caught before the event. You know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone rational!  </p>

<p>Good call on the more guns higher risk. I&#39;m thinking he just wanted to be super prepared to keep shooting and not have to worry about barrel heat or jamming. That is still a ton of extra guns regardless - But really overpreparing is plausible to me. </p>

<p>Some reports saying he also a camera on himself that was being streamed overseas. I&#39;m sure this would be confidential to public if it was until further notice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yessir. The part that is missing is that the security guard was shot at the 9 min mark.   My guess is that the security guard was able to hamper the shooters hallway camera system. As soon as he lost visual control of his back he took his own life to ensure he didn&#39;t get taken alive.  If the Police were able to breach there is a small but real chance they could incompacitate him without killing him </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But he prewired cameras into the hallway, streamed himself overseas, and prewired money to (his gf?).  Super well planned to think this dude planned for months in advance to make this happen. 
Arms deal gone bad and he decides to shoot 500 people who happen to be across the street just doesn&#39;t fly to me. </p>

<p>I think he had a shitload of guns and ammo ready to go in case the Police couldn&#39;t locate him amongst the chaos and he had more time to shoot. They did and he ended it much quicker than he thought </p>

He was going to do one more sale take the money and run, he planned on leaking info on FBI in the Philippines once safe. FBI finds out about his plans, tells there good buddies ISIS theres 100k worth of guns in a hotel room overlooking a concert. The room was already wired with cameras he did not do that, this was a room the FBI used multiple times for shady dealings. The LVMPD jad been tracking paddock since 2015 with suspension of arms dealings. This was an FBI leaker that got cought before he could leak.</p>

<p>But they where not Kamikaze style killers, they where hitmen. That&#39;s why they left just Paddocks body to be found. The real shooters dipped out in security guard clothing (My guess on what they wore but had disguises on). They left the guns because they where not the point, This was a set up to get paddock alone before he fled the country. The shooting was an extra bonus to help push for tighter gun control and laws that will start to require places like Casinos to search everyone that enters. Donald Trump is not the only 4D Chess Master. Why did the FBI take all video evidence from the room and wont release it? This is not their first time, and it wont be their last.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the FBI would, Or is required to release any footage of this kind of stuff in such a high profile situation. Definitely not this so  anyways. </p>

<p>I read somewhere he also had a camera taping himself- I&#39;m hoping that once all details are sorted out and things go public that this video is released. If no video is ever released about anything showing him shooting than I&#39;d be pretty skeptical </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: this is full-on my pet theory derived from all the random shit weve already seen filter through.</p>

<p>Party A: sellers, not small timers either. My pet theory is gun running for CIA/FBI, think Mena, Ark.
Party B: facade buyers, actually terrorists or whathaveyou.</p>

<p>Party A goes about setting up routine gun deal. The fact it was many stories up in a Vegas hotel doesn&#39;t change much imo. These are big dogs, I could see them doing business in places they are guaranteed not to be disturbed, like a presidential suite.</p>

<p>Party B sets the date, maybe it has a hand in choosing the room as well, customer service and all- only a slight joke. Party B also wants a ton of filled mags as part of their bundle. </p>

<p>Date arrives, Party A has been setup in the room a couple days already ensuring everything&#39;s in order/there. Party B arrives, apprehends and murders Party A so it looks like suicide, killing spree ensues. </p>

<p>The guy was a pilot, was affiliated with govt most of his life, exceptionally wealthy, and regularly gambled tons of money- money laundering 101. </p>

<p>The biggest clue imo was all the guns and such at his house. This would lead me to believe he was an illegal salesman/runner. The fact none of this was covered up or cleaned out of his house leads me to believe HIS party is the party that got played.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems as though the hallway footage should be released at some point since it shouldn&#39;t be gory or anything and is what disproves third parties. Might take a while though and we&#39;re also talking about a lot of footage since he checked in several days prior. I&#39;ve read he purchased his stock all legally and over several years through multiple legal, retail outfits, but don&#39;t have a source on hand to link to. If the serial numbers on the guns he had match to those sales I don&#39;t think there would be any reason to forge. </p>

<p>Good question on if any party would have influence over the cameras. Don&#39;t know who owns Mandalay, but they would certainly have footage that was immediately subprime by the Feds. It would be a red flag if there are significant gaps, but I do worry that one broken or mis-timestamped camera is going to have everyone yelling conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but would you load up all that ammo into magazines?  It seems like a good common sense rule for illegal gun deals would be to not get shot with your own product.  I personally would not allow easy access to ammo with the guns I just sold.  Packed away in an easy to carry box?  Sure.  Loaded up in a lot of magazines?  Not so much.</p>

<p>That is just my thought though.  Since I am not an illegal arms dealer I have no idea what the typical protocol would be for such a deal.  Maybe there is a lot more trust between seller and buyer in these deals.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the logic is if someone is going to kill you, they are going to kill you, magazines and ammo cases are more things to carry, more space, loaded mags take up less space. I think this was exactly what it was supposed to be, a massacre, but there&#39;s a lot more to the story and more people involved. </p>

They don&#39;t overheat that quickly, usually well beyond 500 successive rounds fired (he fired 280 from what I&#39;ve seen). When all your magazines are loaded already, it would take about the same amount of time to reload as it would to switch guns, and the more guns the more confusion (what&#39;s empty, what&#39;s full, etc.).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video testing an AR-15 to failure. 800+ rounds, and yes Stephen was using 50r mags not 30s, but Stephen also has longer pauses it seems to me, comparing the first 300 rounds.</p>

<p>Casinos have security for the gambling venues and anywhere alcohol is served, not chilling at every entrance and hallway.

    <div class="md"><p>4 rifles is all he actually needed. 2 in each window would&#39;ve provided ample insurance against overheating and jamming. Plus it looks like almost all had either a foregrip or bipod, which negates the &quot;so he doesn&#39;t burn his hand&quot; argument. Plus those 99¢ gloves from Walmart he&#39;s wearing would make operating a rifle pretty damn challenging.</p>

<p>The part I can&#39;t get past is why he had so many <strong>different</strong> rifles. Some had vertical grips, some had bipods. I saw 3-4different kinds of optics, and at least 2 different barrel lengths. Shooters are particular, and like their gear set up in a specific way. You practice and gain proficiency by using the same firearm over and over. If you&#39;re shooting from that altitude and that distance, you want consistency. You want to see the same sight picture no matter which rifle you&#39;re looking down. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. And that EOTech he had would be worthless at that range. The reticle would obscure everything.</p>

<p>If I was planning what he did (<strong>which I never would because I&#39;m in complete control of my faculties</strong>), I&#39;d go in with 4 identical 18&quot; ARs with Trijicon ACOGs (2 in each window). I&#39;d also bring a Benelli and my sidearm to ward off the breech team (source: I shoot tactical classes and competitively). You could fit all of that into a single guitar case, and then have the suitcase full of mags like he did. Thus it wouldn&#39;t draw suspicion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I haven&#39;t read far enough into it, because I&#39;m not sure I can find logic in it. Sure, it makes sense to have that many weapons in an arms deal. And I&#39;ve read about the $100k vs. the approximate value of the weapons and ammo. But it&#39;s hard to estimate the value of an AR. You can buy a complete 16&quot; complete AR from Palmetto State for $400, or you can drop $3k on a Noveske without sights. There&#39;s just too much variance there.</p>

<p>The big unknown for me on that theory (unless I&#39;m missing some details) is this: if a deal went bad then why open fire on the crowd? Why not pack up and move onto the next buyer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m stumped as to why that would happen - just that there are a lot of those posts. </p>

<p>What does support that though is the actual range of guns he had up there, as if he was offering a selection. Someone suggested that the (alleged) arms deal was hi-jacked by terrorists or other agents who did the massacre.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an opinion about it really but there does seem to be a lot of strangeness here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could see that being the case. Maybe one of the three letter agencies wanted to, for whatever reason, have an event like this occur. They know this guy is an arms dealer, so they know he has virtually no online presence/identity. So, tell the guy exactly what to bring, ambush him, do the deed, and get out. The getting out undetected part is the part that is a little far-fetched, but the rest would totally fit with the strange facts. </p>

<p>This is interesting. What about reports of shooters at other casinos at, or about, the same time as the main shooting? That makes me think it was pre-planned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is the biggest flaw in the theory, which is why I don&#39;t 100% buy into the theory. Then again, there is that old saying of &quot;hidden in plain sight&quot;. One thing I can say is when I was training in loss prevention, my manager and I were out walking with the customers. He was teaching me how to stay hidden from the customers, as well as not to worry and freak out by second guessing myself if I think someone that I&#39;m watching, knows I&#39;m watching them. To show me that I shouldn&#39;t worry we walked around our electronic department and walked up next to a mother and daughter, we were standing a good 3-4 feet away from them, and we were describing what they were wearing, we were also talking in our normal voices. They didn&#39;t pay any attention to us, not even a glance even though we were right next to them and talking about their clothing. He was trying to show me how people won&#39;t care about random people unless they are dealing with them directly. Maybe it was something like that. No one was directly dealing with any of these people, so no one really cared about them. </p>

<p>My opinion is that, whatever will prove this to be real of false is the CCTV footage. If they want to disprove the isis claim, they could easily release the camera footage from his hallway at the time of the shooting. If isis was not involved, this theory is easily debunked. However, on the flip side, the CCTV footage could prove isis was there. They aren&#39;t releasing anything, so it&#39;s just fueling the isis speculation. </p>

Tons of people coming in and out of hotel rooms is not unusual. Huge amounts of luggage is common. People often carry large sums of cash, so even that wouldn&#39;t arouse suspicion. Also, there is an airport in very close proximity which allows public and private flights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he was a stooge for the FBI, not sure in what capacity, gun runner for illegal profit or gun runner to catch ISIS operatives. According to many other people&#39;s posts, Paddock was also laundering money through casinos, changing $1million into chips, playing a few $hundred in hands, then cashing out a check for clean money. Other people have said Paddock wanted to get out, sent $100,000 to his gf in the Philippines to get set up and was planning on spilling the beans on what the FBI was up to once he had escaped. Personally I think it was one of two options, he was involved in an entrapment gun sale to catch ISIS, the found out, killed him and then committed the shooting because ISIS. If so where are they now? Where is the footage of these people in the hotel going to Paddock&#39;s room. The second option is, the FBI were just illegally selling guns for profit thru Paddock, found out he wanted to blow town, set him up and killed him, and performed a false flag attack to further a gun control agenda. Either of these is plausible but until I see footage of supposed ISIS operatives in the hotel I&#39;m inclined to believe we have some seriously dodgy FBI agents out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres just gotta be an easier way to make profit for FBI than this amount of dog and pony show. Maybe the isis contact, paddock&#39;s killer,  and the actual shooter is actually the &quot;security guard&quot;. Meaning there is no guard. But there was a second man. Since the deal got messed up, paddock was dead, a guard had to be invented (not sure why though),  the narrative was being concocted on the fly. I think option 1 sits easier with me, personally. 
Combine that with local  leos, clueless civilians, hotel staff  who are not in on the actual deal - you have a whole lot of FBI running around, trying to plug the holes and do damage control, while just trying to make shit up as they go along. I wonder if Comey said he wasn&#39;t fully on board with this, so he got removed asap and away from internal info. Too much was already in motion to back out of the deal or make significant plan changes. </p>

<p>That would also somehow explain cash to girlfriend, maybe. The payment wasnt enough or they realized it was being traced ? (gf) is just a cash mule, possibly one of many.  This would make paddock undercover fbi, buyer of weapons on behalf of isis. His gf is also fbi undercover, was working on trying to trace the money overseas. </p>

<p>But bc of fuckup, she is being recalled back to us, money trail lost, paddock is dead, mass shooting happened, and you have an isis guy that fbi just handed guns to to kill their countrymen (unintentionally). An unheard of amount of bad luck and incompetence that creates a problem bigger than anyone could&#39;ve imagined. Meanwhile, Comey is saying, &quot;didnt i tell you it was a dumb plan?!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part I don&#39;t get if this is the case is supposedly he purchased these all legally from gunshops. If I was making a deal with ISIS i wouldn&#39;t want my registered guns ending up in an attack. I suppose him buying a lot of guns would cover any oddities to those around him having a lot of guns in a safe or something.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s weird we aren&#39;t hearing of how often he went to the range and shot target practice, and which ranges he went to. We also aren&#39;t hearing any specifics from them questioning marilou danley, there&#39;s no way she doesn&#39;t notice that many guns, there is even one report from a gun store owner that he&#39;s seen danley with paddock in the store before.</p>

<p>Throw in the vague timeline, the absence of mention of the two singular gunshots from the other thread. If they heard them on the street, they heard them down the hall.</p>

<p>I feel like we had the whole 9/11 narrative by now days later. We had footage of Dylan Roof within days.</p>

<p>This seems like it shouldn&#39;t be that complicated, something is being obfuscated.</p>

<p>Also, if Paddock switched windows then the sound could be vastly different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to your point about &quot;if it went bad, why open fire and not just pack up and leave&quot;...my theory is it was a setup. They knew he was an arms dealer (hence the guns + his deliberately hidden past) whomever wanted the event to occur knew about it, set up the deal, met him and killed him/framed as the patsy.</p>

<p>the fact that we haven&#39;t seen CCTV of him ANYWHERE over the time he stayed (check in, dining, leaving, entering, walking down the hallway) ...anything...is troubling as well. It wouldn&#39;t disprove my above theory, but maybe he was always WITH someone so they can&#39;t show it yet? </p>

<p>that&#39;s only bc this is r/conspiracy. he could just be a lunatic, but I like to logically ask these questions and find holes if they are really there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve ever fired a bump-stock before, so that&#39;d make it very difficult for me to answer the second question you asked.</p>

<p>The first question: figure I can comfortably empty a 30rd. mag in ~7 seconds and remain reasonably on target (30 yards on a full size B52 silhouette target). Extrapolate that over 1100&#39; and I&#39;m thinking if I want to be accurate enough to hit a crowd it&#39;ll be more like 15 seconds per mag. Add in time to reload and/or move between rifles or windows, I&#39;d say an average of 90-105 rounds/minute. So call that 1000 rounds. <em>Maybe</em> 1200 if I&#39;m not concerned about accuracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I noted to someone else, a man-size target at 500 yards is pretty small. It was night time (yes I know it&#39;s never really night in Vegas but still dark), plus the flashing lights from the concert will fuck with your eyes when one is looking through a magnified sight and the other one isn&#39;t. You have the distractions from the music, and the airport is right there. He had a lot working against him from a sensory perspective. That&#39;s why I think <strong>my</strong> rate of fire would be around 1000-1200 in 10 minutes under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Even if you&#39;re firing at a group that large, there&#39;s no benefit to spraying lead all over the place if half of it is way off target (even a 5.56 gets muzzle lift). If the objective is maximum casualties within a finite timeframe, a moderate level of precision is just as, if not more, effective than balls to the wall speed.</p>

<p>Also, maxing out the ROF will lead to a hotter weapon, and more chances of jamming (either a mag jam or a jam in the rifle). Sorry for the stream of consciousness answers.</p>

A man-sized target is quite small at that distance; add in the darkness and flashing concert lighting, and it&#39;s pretty difficult. At that distance and that rate of fire, to yield the hit counts he did would require a lot of practice.

    <div class="md"><p>He would likely need more than 4 rifles. Ar15s are great but they don&#39;t function very well when you&#39;re pumping 100 rounds through it on full auto. After 1, maybe 2 100 rd mags, that thing is going to overheat or jam. Guns get hot very quickly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firearms are just like brakes on a car: they heat up really quickly, and cool down to operational temperatures quite quickly. Cycling between 4 rifles is sufficient for cooling, especially with the railed handguards which allow for decent heat dissipation.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it all matters that he wanted to shoot a lot of bullets quickly and keep shooting bullets as long as he could. I have a semi-auto SKS I think my mags hold 35 rounds each. if I spill out 2 clips as fast as I can the gun is too hot to keep shooting without causing damage to the gun and potentially jamming it. switching between rifles is the key to keeping them cool and functioning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Plus id expect to see flash suppressors. This whole thing doesnt flow logically. Too many guns for a guy who supposedly planned things to great detail. I also don&#39;t see the purpose of 2 vantage points, not for a single shooter.  If the goal is to murder, he only needs one vantage point, not 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you, but can anyone comment on this;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If he had all these guns/mags and ammo why the very long pauses between bursts of fire?</p></li>
<li><p>Wouldn&#39;t you have all (let&#39;s just say 10) guns loaded within arms reach and just unload the contents of those 10 rifles consecutively (3min) and then reload the rifles with another 10 mags (3min) and fire those empty again? There would have been no gap in firing greater than 10sec until the reload of all the guns. Potentially up to 2000 rounds in well under 10 minutes. </p></li>
<li><p>The gap between firing suggests he could have used only 1 rifle it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p></li>
<li><p>If you were going to set up for maximum collateral damage you would do the above and it would probably only take 30min to set up for if the 20mags were brought in loaded and you only needed to smash out the windows. </p></li>
<li><p>Why does he need to be there for a WEEK if he was going there for the purpose of mass murder on a specific night?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The gaps are the big mindfuck for me. The gear he allegedly had in that room would&#39;ve allowed for sustained fire until the moment someone showed up at the front door. People didn&#39;t initially react to the first burst--you wouldn&#39;t give them 30+ seconds to figure out what was going on disperse. You would drop the spent mag or rifle, get a fresh one, and keep firing. Reloading an AR takes all of 2-4 seconds if you&#39;ve done it before.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m thankful it wasn&#39;t worse, but that many weapons and that much ammo should&#39;ve yielded a <strong>much</strong> higher body count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually. </p>

<p>The guns can over heat and jam. He could have set ten guns by one window and ten by the other. Sit there and use each gun till it cannot be used any more. My guess is like 5 mins of shooting for each gun? Then switch to the other windows and other guns.</p>

<p>Maybe he did way more damage than expected and decided to back out. Maybe the funneling of the crowd out of the stadium was successful. And he thought there weren&#39;t enough targets to make using all the guns worthwhile. Maybe he decided he did enough shooting and was going to try to escape. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any of that. But I can think of several reasons when your committing to the mass murder of 20k people to bring 2@ guns. As sick as it sounds, that&#39;s one of the issues that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were room service receipts showing that he ordered food for 2 guests. Maybe he had an accomplice that was going to participate in the shooting and backed out. 23 is a lot of weapons though. He was shooting with bump stocks simulating full auto so the barrels can overheat. With multiple guns he can just grab the next gun without reloading. They haven&#39;t stated how many weapons had bump stocks and if any were full auto anyway. 23 does seem excessive, but the plan could have involved more people that decided not to participate for some reason.</p>

I could see having a pistol and shotgun for close range encounters, a long range scoped rifle for long, calculated shots, and then two high capacity semi auto rifles, one would mainly be a backup in case the first malfunctions, and then TONS of preloaded mags. Any more guns than that and your just making more work for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Guns are HEAVY. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My moms fiancee has two ar15s.  Both have sites on them and an addon for the barrel.  I just took the one and put it on our bathroom scale and it was 10.5lbs.  The other one has a foregrip to it and that one was 11.1lbs.  </p>

<p>I would not say that is all that heavy individually.  But that is 100 lbs collectively not counting ammo. </p>

<p>Here is the part you are missing about this guy.  First.  He is fucking nuts.  He might have planned this out meticulously, but he is still fucking nuts.  Even when he is planning something like this he can get a bias viewpoint of what is going on.  In his head he might have thought he was going to shoot as many as possible from his room.  He maybe thought being that he was so far away and so high up he would go unnoticed for much longer.  So he might have thought he would need more guns both as a backup for jams and even to let them cool down.  For all we know his plan might have been to leave the room, kill as many people as possible, get in his car full of explosives and then go mow through the crowd on the street and eventually blow up a casino entrance.</p>

<p>He was obviously very disillusioned about what he was going to do.  I guarantee you in his mind he was going to kill far more than he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of get it. This guy decided he was going to have some &quot;fun&quot; with a shooting spree. He wanted to use all of his &quot;toys&quot; and see how well they worked on living targets. He spent all that money and time collecting those guns and knew he would never get to use them again. He&#39;d either escape and never come back or be dead by the end of his killing spree, he knew this. In both situations he would never have the chance to shoot those guns again and that probably made him sad. So he made extra effort to have his entire collection available for the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that this guy was a psychopath. His father was one and his brother describes him as unwilling to go out of his way for anyone. Eric Harris at Columbine was too and did a similar thing--he significantly slowed his rate of fire long before he had too. There&#39;s a great book by Dave Cullen on this. He had some evidence that this was likely out of boredom. Psychopaths think killing will be a thrill, but it wears off quickly.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve narrowed it down to 2 rooms. Let&#39;s say, a high probability of one room due to the camera setup and the security guards testimony.</p>

Having that many meant he either wanted to shoot for hours or he was just so insane he thought that he needed that many. Maybe shoot 2 at once? Maybe rig a system to shoot all at once? Maybe have different gun sounds to make people look for the potential other shooters first? No way to tell now that he&#39;s dead. </p>

<p>If you pre-plan a mass shooting, you&#39;re either a criminal mastermind or a crazy asshole. If you don&#39;t actually need twenty guns but you bring twenty guns, I&#39;m willing to bet you&#39;re a crazy asshole and not a criminal mastermind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns aren&#39;t that heavy.  And as someone that has recently worked in a high end hotel, you don&#39;t question the luggage.  Dude was a big spender, if my big spender comes in, I am taking care of him no problem.  There are tons of gun shows, and ranges in Nevada, so gun cases aren&#39;t like WTF level is going on here.  Also he could have slowly done this over 5 days spreading out how much to bring up there.  He also could have dissasembled them in transit, also not particularly uncommon.  People come in with 10 cases of stuff all the time at hotels.  It is not uncommon, and if you are the bell guy taking that person to his suite (which the bell guy is going to be perfectly aware of the guy&#39;s MGM status) you aren&#39;t asking ANY questions, just hoping or a nice tip.  As to the amount of guns, if you told me that I needed to shoot a thousand rounds out of a simulated auto fire rifle and that it needs to be accurate, I would have a lot of guns with me.  Hotter the barrel gets, the more inaccurate its going to start to get and more problems you might run into.  I don&#39;t know anymore than any of you of why this happened.  But some of the &quot;oddities&quot; people are finding aren&#39;t oddities at all.  I&#39;m guessing he had no clue how long it would take for people to notice is my guess.  Imagine that he is actually at a Bassnectar concert or something.  He might have gotten away with it for longer.  He obviously didn&#39;t anticipate being found so soon because he still had a lot of ammo.  Also if you watch the compiled/synched video the weirdest part to me is the long pauses in between volleys.  Its way too long for just a simple reload, and way too long to just simply walk to the adjoining room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only thing I could think of would be heat. </p>

<p>Those guns aren&#39;t designed for that rapid fire, so after 40-50 rounds going through it in 15-30 seconds would cause some extreme heat. </p>

<p>If I was to go plan something like this, then the shooters set up is probably perfect. Multiple rooms so you can fire in one, gun gets too hot and room is too smoky, move to the next room with a cool gun, then back to the first over and over. </p>

<p>Now I think 20 guns is way to much. You would think with THAT MUCH ammunition and weaponry he would go at it until killed, not turn a barrel around and off himself. He would want to go down with a fight. </p>

<p>So yeah there are some oddities with having that many guns, and then just saying &quot;ok I did some damage time to off myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Gun fire stopped what almost an hour before they went into the room? He had cameras set up so he had to know there wasn&#39;t really anyone close he could have kept firing and done more damage, killed more - since its apparent that is all he wanted. </p>

<p>I think there had to be at least one other person in the room with this. I dont know if that means there were 2 shooters, or one person to reload and set up the guns. I think once the security guard came to the door they got spooked, one was killed and the other ran. </p>

<p>Yes, they are. Major difference between a Colt milspec AR-15 and an M16 is the fire control group. Upper and barrel are essentially identical, and the lower has only minor differences.</p>

There wouldn&#39;t be much difference between taking 5 or taking 20, just a few extra suitcases that only need to be moved from the house to a car, then the car to the room not lugged over many miles by foot.  Two, Options, he had bought a lot of guns and was well versed in how they worked and what he could do with them, for a few days up in that hotel room he could have decided at his leisure which ones felt right, were most manageable in his situation, how to best set them up, etc.  And again, there was nothing to lose in bringing extras.  Three, he was planning to keep switching between guns and shoot for longer but lost his nerve, it&#39;s weird to humanize him but emotionally the adrenaline might have worn off after ten minutes and the weight of what he was doing sunk in he just figured enough was enough.  Four, he may have been expecting accomplices.  I&#39;m not basing this on anything concrete but what if he was expecting two or three other people to show up and do this with him, people he may have contacted online or elsewhere who he thought would be willing to go through with this along side of him but who failed to show up when it came down to actually committing murders.  20 ish guns between four people would have seriously upped the firepower but wasn&#39;t to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had too many guns with him period. It is fishy to high hell.</p>

<p>This is a man who choose an excellent position, covered his flank fairly well, had live feeds to let him know if someone was coming, knew how to modify his weapons etc.</p>

<p>Why, oh why, would he bring so many damn guns then? There is zero benefit to doing so. One or two back ups I can see, but it would have been far more discreet and effective to bring spare mags instead of so many guns.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t add up. He&#39;s smart enough to pull this shit off but too stupid to know that more bullets would have been better than more guns?</p>

<p>I can think of one other reason to have multiple guns- cool down. He can use one for a bit at a near auto rate, then let it cool down by switching to a different one. THat way he wouldn&#39;t be ruining his guns within 1 minute of firing. Even so, you&#39;d not need more than 2 or 3 to achieve that.</p>

<p>But seriously, I&#39;ve been watching all the eyewitness videos and it is pretty clear there were multiple shooters from different locations, as evidenced by police scanners and victim testimonies. Strangely enough there&#39;s commenters saying to believe the official story, but they are all accounts with no history, no likes, no subscribers, nothing. </p>

<p>The primary weapon sounds like a M240, and matches the fire rate very well. When I first heard of the shooting (only knowing the high number of causalities) I immediately thought LMG, as such as weapon is ideal for this kind of thing. </p>

You wouldn&#39;t need more than 4, and frankly I wouldn&#39;t bring more than 2 ARs chambered in 5.56. A couple decently maintained Colt ARs would eat all the ammo he brought without jamming. I wouldn&#39;t even worry about overheating the barrels if you swap them out every 100 rounds. For a single shooter 23 firearms makes absolutely no sense, regardless of experience level. Optics? At that range you&#39;re just hosing the general area, counting on volume of fire to result in casualties. You are NOT aiming, even if you aren&#39;t in Bubba mode with the bump fire stocks. No need for more than a simple red dot if that- iron sights would have done just fine at that range. Most of those weapons weren&#39;t there for Paddock.</p>

The deal went south and whatever you see in the room may or may have not been planted on him by the receiving end of the trade and or the Gov. <strong>No doubt in my mind that the full auto you hear is a M240</strong>, and the &quot;reloading pause&quot; is the swapping of barrels as they get hot after numerous rounds. How was he shooting so many rounds consistently without drum mags? Belt - Yes. An AR does not shoot that slow with a bump stock or as an automatic. The receiving end fled after taking Paddock out. The Gov then had a crime scene to play with or they left it as is IDK, all I know is it was too damn sloppy on whoever left it and there was no reason for those guns and I don&#39;t think they were used to begin with in this attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make good points, apart from the weapons weight, have you never seen military combat drills where they are running and shooting short bursts in order to keep the enemy down? We used to drill that kind of stuff a lot.</p>

<p>A normal rifle with mag and everything will be around 5-7 kilograms, which really isn&#39;t that much. I used to run around with a sniper rifle on my back and my AR in hands, both weapons used 7.62 cal bullets, and I really had no problem booking it through forest terrain with those weighing me down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Total flaw with many of the suppositions drawn here. That top level organisations couldnt fake poor quality cctv footage to show whatever they want.</p>

<p>Of course that might take them a few days of planning what we should &#39;see&#39; in any footage, then of rendering it and releasing it....</p>

<p>Oh look. Thats how long its taking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the logic is if someone is going to kill you, they are going to kill you, magazines and ammo cases are more things to carry, more space, loaded mags take up less space. I think this was exactly what it was supposed to be, a massacre, but there&#39;s a lot more to the story and more people involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yessir. The part that is missing is that the security guard was shot at the 9 min mark.   My guess is that the security guard was able to hamper the shooters hallway camera system. As soon as he lost visual control of his back he took his own life to ensure he didn&#39;t get taken alive.  If the Police were able to breach there is a small but real chance they could incompacitate him without killing him </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great logic in your entire comment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the FBI would, Or is required to release any footage of this kind of stuff in such a high profile situation. Definitely not this so  anyways. </p>

<p>I read somewhere he also had a camera taping himself- I&#39;m hoping that once all details are sorted out and things go public that this video is released. If no video is ever released about anything showing him shooting than I&#39;d be pretty skeptical </p>
