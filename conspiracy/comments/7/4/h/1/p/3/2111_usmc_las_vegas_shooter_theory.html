        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There were multiple shooters in the Las Vegas. Now, I am judging my findings from the videos and not what the FBI is telling us. like the FBI as any speck of credibility left in the department(they don&#39;t).</p>

<p>first off i want to start with the video of the taxi cab driver. now we all know that there were a series of shots fired in the first 3 seconds of the video. shortly after a series of louder more blunt sounds came ringing through the air and into the crowds.</p>

<p>those first shots fired were i believe the diversion shots coming from paddocks room(wether you believe it was him or not it was still his room). those sounded more as the &quot;BUMP STOCK RIFLE&quot; he so had in his arsenal. from watching the first videos of the shooting people were standing around while paddock let out those diversion shots which were 5.56 sized rounds. a few of those rounds would need to be used to take someone out. let alone a bunch of drunks not feeling a thing. Witness said it sound more like fireworks, meaning it wasn&#39;t as apparent as the next rounds. </p>

<p>the next rounds fired were the ones that were going to cause the damage. 7.62 belt fed automatic weapon the M240b, now i spent my career in a cage with these fucking guns. countless ranges. PMCS. GCSS. fuck man i did everything with and for these weapons. i know what these sound like. i know how blunt the weapon sounds when firing. and i know the devastation it can cause especially to an unsuspecting crowd. no 5.56 round would put a gaping hole into someones body. but a 7.62 is meant to rip through and cause as much harm to mankind as possible. In some vides witnesses were saying that the exit wounds were massive. some doctors even saying that it could have been a .50cal but i used to work on those guys too and you would need a mount and so much other things just to get it going..... the m240 bravo comes with its bipod. and even though they are crew fired weapons. i know many machine gunners who wielded those beast like a mameluke.</p>

<p>nonetheless this is obviously just a rant on my thoughts as an expert in military grade weapon</p>

<p>Edit 1: I forgot to mention. That when they were &quot;reloading&quot; they were just switching barrels off that 240b</p>

<p>Edit 2: everyone remember that there are two shooters inconsistencies are bound to happen during those louder bursts of rounds when the 240b was going along with echos and such. Who&#39;s taking in account the original statements made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking as well. Anyone whose spent time around weapons would know that firing a bumpstock, 5.56 round at 300 yards would be a tough feat for even an experienced shooter, let a lone a 64 year old with no real training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to see someone&#39;s been thinking the same as me. Aside from the theories of the motive everyone&#39;s talking about , the actual physics of the shooting don&#39;t make much sense.  That long, sustained firing is only achievable by a belt fed machine gun. And especially aiming down, with a bipod would had made bump firing even more difficult. </p>

<p>Your 4th floor shooter had the balls to keep shooting hours after on live TV at 55 seconds. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Wovk2OOBsBc">https://youtu.be/Wovk2OOBsBc</a></p>

<p>Started shooting during god bless america.. the nerve. </p>

<p>I personally disagree with just about everything you&#39;ve said. If anything, not only is the rate of fire not the same, at times it&#39;s quicker then a 240, Closer to a 249.</p>

<p>Multiple shooters, I don&#39;t know. Probably not. Theres literally not a shred of evidence other then confused shocked eye witnesses that also thought it was fireworks or sound issues on stage. Now a hot mic repeating gun fire....that makes sense.</p>

<p>Either way...the second shooter was almost definitely not on the 4th floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone even asked about the caliber of bullets removed from bodies or found at the scene?  Wouldn’t that confirm the belt-fed vs AR murder weapon question right away?  For sure this info is already known but not reported, to my knowledge.  How can that be?  How can people not even ask these questions?  If the rounds are from belt-fed 240, that guy Paddock isn’t even the shooter.  Maybe the real shooter(s) were staged on the roof, roped down, shot the windows IN (first shots heard in videos) offed him in the chest, shot up the concert with belt-feds, staged the room, shot him again for “suicide”, shot the security guard through the door, then scrammed out the windows with the 240 just as they came in.  Spec-ops teams train for this kind of operation all over the world, every damn day.  SWAT teams too.  Call me nuts but it’s no more nuts than 59 people dead from a 64 yr old rich gambler shooter with no motive, and a criminally insane FBI organization hovering over the investigation and tampering with evidence/investigation via leaked photos of the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/q8EomJzXP1I">Here</a> is a video that will give you somewhat what an AR-10 would sound like with bump fire. Granted this is what it would sound like next to the shooter, not what it would sound like downrange in an urban environment. </p>

<p>One other thing worth noting: you see how the bump stock works... the stock stays seated, his finger firmly stays in place against the plastic guard of the bump stock, and the rifle itself moves back and forth... that’s why bipods aren’t very compatible with bump stocks, as they would prevent the rifle from moving if used properly. Also trying to use a scope with that recoil would be nearly impossible after the firing pin strikes the primer of the first round. </p>

<p>You talk about exit wounds being massive? A 5.56 is a ballistic round, it, in fact, will leave much large exit wounds than a 7.62. You can see this in google images, just type &quot;5.56 wound&quot; you will see both real and virutalized images demonstrating this.</p>

<p>Then you go to say &quot;a few of those rounds would need to be used to take someone out. let alone a bunch of drunks not feeling a thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Lol wut?</p>

<p>Also, I do challenge your expertise, and ability to listen. I&#39;m not sure how often you&#39;ve shot or heard a 240, but that shit sounded nothing, and I mean nothing like it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a machine gun has a constant rate of fire. All of the recordings I&#39;ve heard and seen show that the rate of fire is variable.</p>

<p>How do you explain the discrepancy? Or do you have recordings where a constant, unchanging rate of fire is apparent? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t explain why ONE gun in the middle of a volley of shots speeds up and slows down. Not at all. That is not what a machine gun sounds like. </p>

<p>Hell, lacking any video/audio of a constant rate of fire in LV, I would also be interested if you have samples of any other machine gun with a variable rate of fire. Doesn&#39;t even have to be a 240. Any modern machine gun will be sufficient. Machine guns have a constant rate of fire, or if degraded due to heat, it slows down only. It doesn&#39;t slow down and then speed back up like in the LV attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The SAW is like 10 years newer then a m240..</p>

<p>Plus the IAR was almost canceled because infantry squads are losing suppressive fire capabilities. Today&#39;s wars that&#39;s not as critical. The IAR replaced the weapon, not the capabilities of the SAW. </p>

<p>Not quite sure where your going with that because it really just goes back to contradicting it had to be a belt fed weapon. </p>
