       Here is a good bulleted list by Unbiased America on the newest known facts about the shooting. Nothing still seems to be adding up. Are they as confused as we are, or are they hiding something? Is there another attack still in the works they are trying to stop? Who are the accomplices? What was the motive? Why did it take so long to breach the room (one that he supposedly shot through the door of) and why would he kill himself after a brief encounter with a security guard he could have easily killed? Still so many questions.

       VEGAS SHOOTING UPDATE: MORE NEW INFORMATION HAS COME OUT
by Kevin Ryan
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of new information to report today on the Vegas attack.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In a news conference Wednesday night, many new facts were revealed:
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       • There were 58 deaths (not including the suspect) and 489 people were wounded; 317 have been discharged from area hospitals; 172 remain hospitalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       • A slightly modified version of the timeline released earlier was presentd.
10:05pm - First Shots
10:12pm - First 2 officers arrive one floor below and determine the shooting is coming from directly above them
10:15 - The last shots are heard
10:17 - Officers arrive on the shooter’s floor
10:18 - Security officer tells police he was shot outside shooter’s room
10:26 to 10:30 - Officers begin clearing rooms on shooter’s floor
10:55 - Officers arrive at shooter’s room
11:20 - Officer’s breach shooter’s room, find him dead
      </p>
      <p>
       • A military veteran in the room below Paddock informed authorities that the shooting was coming from directly above.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The security guard who was wounded outside Paddock’s room was unarmed when he approached.  He faced well over 200 rounds of fire, but remained even after being shot, and helped arriving police until they demanded he get medical attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       • It’s unknown exactly when Paddock killed himself.  He was dead when officers breached his room.  No gunfire was exchanged between police and the suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       • No suicide note has been found, though a note was found that police have not revealed the contents of.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The cameras that the gunman set up to monitor the hallway outside his room were displaying the hallway live to him, not recording them.  Meaning this cameras do not have viewable video of the shooting on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Some weapons found in the hotel room were jammed, but most were not.  3 rifles were fitted with hunting scopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       • 1600 rounds of ammunition were found in Paddock’s car, and thousands of unfired rounds in his hotel room.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Also found in the shooter’s car was ammonium nitrate (the same chemical component used in the Oklahoma City federal building bombing), and 50 pounds of tannerite, a less powerful explosive powder that detonates when shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Paddock was gambling for several hours before the shooting.  He was not seen with a companion while he was gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Paddock booked several condos through Airbnb at a building called the Ogden one week before the shooting.  That was during the Life Is Beautiful concert, headlined by Chance The Rapper, Lorde, and Wiz Khalifa, in downtown Las Vegas.  Paddock may have intended to target the Life is Beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The sheriff gave phone numbers for people to call if they have information on the shooter, Stephen Paddock. Within Nevada, call 311.  Outside the state, dial 702-828-3111.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Sheriff Lombardo also made several pointed statements that, while not specific, may have been either informed speculation, educated guesses, or indications that he knows something but isn’t ready to give details:
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       • The shooter had a “secret life” much of which may “never be fully understood”.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The concealment of his secret life was well thought out.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Something may have happened in October, 2016, that caused him to start purchasing more weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Authorities have a number of working theories, but aren’t ready to publicize them.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The sheriff described Paddock as disturbed and dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       • When asked whether there is "evidence of domestic terrorism", the sheriff said no.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The local investigation has uncovered no motive.  Paddock’s ex-wife and brother provided no information on a possible motive.  Profilers are baffled.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The FBI is not yet revealing whether a motive was obtained from yesterday’s interview with Paddock’s girlfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       • It is not yet determined whether Paddock had visitors in the time before his attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Paddock planned to survive and escape, but the sheriff did not provide what evidence led him to that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The sheriff assumes, based on all the effort that went into this, that there were accomplices.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The girlfriend is cooperative, assisting, and not in custody.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Other news sources have reported new information in the last day:
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       • Associated Press: Analyzing Paddock's computer, cellphone and other electronic devices, investigators have found no obvious ideological motive, no clear connection to extremists or activist groups or outward display of mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       • CNN: 35 people remain in critical condition
      </p>
      <p>
       • Local news sources - Paddock may have tried to blow up huge aviation fuel tanks by the McCarron airport, about 1,000 feet from his firing point.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Fox News sources say authorities doubt whether Paddock intentionally targeted the aviation fuel tanks, saying they may have instead been incidentally damaged by Paddock shooting toward the crowd.  The tanks are in the field of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Chicago police are investigating reports that Paddock may have booked rooms in a hotel overlooking Chicago’s massive Lollapalooza festival in August.  TMZ claims Paddock requested “view rooms” that would look over the festival, and his rooms had clear sightlines at the festivals’ main stage and entrance areas. Paddock apparently never showed up, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Daily Mail: Paddock had reportedly experienced significant weight loss in the lead up to the shooting. He also developed an obsession with his girlfriend's ex-husband, Geary Danley, with whom she had been married to for more than 20 years before they finalized their divorce in 2015.  DailyMail also disclosed that other high rollers were concerned about Paddock drinking a 'constant stream of booze' whilst he was playing.  They described him as a 'heavy, heavy drinker' and wondered if his high alcohol intake contributed to his mental deterioration.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Reuters: Paddock had severe allergies to cleaning products, makeup, and perfume, according to his brother Eric.  He often wore gardening gloves to prevent rashes from contact with cleaning chemical residues, the brother wrote. Stephen’s girlfriend Marilou Danley was sympathetic in dealing with Paddock's allergy-driven quirks, often not wearing makeup or perfume when with him.  Casinos also obliged Paddock’s request to not use chemicals when cleaning his room.
      </p>
      <p>
       • New York Times: As a reward for his loyalty and gambling, Mr. Paddock stayed free of charge in the 32nd floor elite suites of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where he staged his attack.  However, Paddock was not considered a “whale”, the term for the highest spending gamblers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Times also reports that the night before the shooting, Mr. Paddock made two complaints to the Mandalay hotel about noise coming from his downstairs neighbors: Albert Garzon, a restaurant owner visiting from San Diego and staying directly below Paddock, said security guards knocked on his door around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday and asked him to turn down his music, country songs.

       When reading this, I wondered if the security guard was in on it.  I'm not familiar with Vegas hotels, but I would assume they have cameras in the hallways and would have footage of his attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we aint seen no footage yet.  Of any of these hotels.

       It seems likely to me that they're afraid of tipping off whoever else might be involved by keeping their cards relatively close to the chest.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I'll bet even people in the FBI are speculating whether or not this is a deep state "staged event" or whatever people are calling it

       There isn’t a square inch of space where a camera can’t see in a Las Vegas casino. They should have the most detailed footage of every move this guy made during his stay. Outside of his bedroom obviously.

       I have cameras on every floor in my average apartment, I'd be absolutely shocked if they didn't have some in at least the halls of the nicer floors, like this guy was on. I'd imagine they plan for all possible contingencies, like someone getting too drunk and pissed at losing money that they decide to destroy some hallway or something

There are probably no cameras in the hallways.

       Been to mandalay a few times. Was there a few months ago. I don't remember noticing cameras in the hallways of the non-casino floors, at mandalay or luxor where i was staying. Maybe just outside the elevators

       They have cameras just not obvious looking ones.  They typically have them at the end, halfway and near stairwells or elevators.  3 star hotels have them.  My best friend owns a video surveillance company. He said most likely Mandalay had them but whether they were active is different story.

       "Whether they were active" -- they should be, and would be active. But you just made me realize that eventually we will be told that they were conveniently inactive at the time.

       And those 200 rounds, they said he emptied them all into the hallway...? Didn't look like it.

      <p>
       How long does it take to fire off 200 rounds into a hallway, anyways? I've never fired a gun so I don't know. Seems like kind of a waste of time and resources to dump all those rounds into an empty hallway when you know that your position is comparised &amp; time is running out.

       The bump stock claims to do up to 800 rounds a minute, that is only 15 seconds of spraying the hallway.  I agree it seems like a waste but he had tons of ammo and I think some sort of drum feeding the rounds.  I think the 200 number is suspicious myself...

       Right.
 But they mean 800rpm in theory, right? not taking into account friction, the gun heating, jamming/reloading ect.

      <p>
       Like that's just one of the "specifications"...?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never shot a gun but would imagine shooting 200 rounds in 15 seconds would be kinda rough. Especially on the old shoulders. Of an old man lol

       Or the barrel.  I read that after 30 rounds, you need to let it cool.

       Yes, you are correct, if he didn't have a drum (which they say he had) that would take some time...Remember, he had 23 loaded guns, he could have had three or four Semi's on him...

       Gunners dream. Not sure how he spent 200 down a funnel like that and barely hit 1 guy. I saw there is tons of cover, but I'd expect to see more rounds in the walls (fishy) (#199missingrounds-ish?)

       Seeing the types of guns, sights and his current state, elements like visability , wind, elevation play a role at a distance.  Having modified guns have an impact and shitty bullets play a role too.  In close quarters with a hallway you have higher rate of success

       Through a door/wall when you're shooting above the person who likely hit the floor as soon as they realized what happened and probably started moving away immediately. Yes. Much higher chance of success. Sure.

       200 or so rounds of automatic gun fire was direct at him. The shooter had a camera in the hallway and could see him. Yet he was only hit once in the leg.

       I meant “directed” not direct. Even then, 200 rounds and only one hits him in the leg in that small vicinity? It seems far more likely we aren’t being told the truth rather than 199 rounds missing him....

       Even if you tired to dive out of the way it wouldn’t matter. The shooter was firing at a rapid rate of fire. The bullets would easily rip through the walls and doors. I’d assume the shooter would have shot in more than one spot. At that rate of fire and lack of cover you’d think the bullet spread would be enough to hit the security officer more than once.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, if that’s the truth and the security officer is innocent then I’m glad he got so lucky.

       That's just it, we weren't there. People get lucky all the time. There's no reason to say it's fishy that they only got shot once.

       I disagree. We weren’t there, and therefore I am asking questions considering the official narrative seems less likely than other explanations.

       bullets coming out at 10-14 a second from the videos i see. If you hit in the leg you also hit in the stomach and chest and maybe head. Guns kick up, and when its that fast the bullets are very close together. You can draw with one.  One hit from an automatic wep is just a bit lucky.

       He could have taken a bullet in the leg then went back around the corner. It doesn’t seem like a great idea to just stand there while he shoots at you. I’d have to think the guy tried to get himself to a safer area.

       I think they're just estimating high on the #of rounds he fired through the door at the guard.  200 rounds would take several realoads of the mags that he stockpiled in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of the first 30 or so, let's say, 1/3 of them hit harder parts of the door or jamb or lost too much energy to do any more damage.  Another 1/3 were just way wide of the guards actual location.  If the guard was a decent distance down the hall from the door I can easily see only one of the remaining ten rounds hitting him, at which point he probably retreated to safety.  Then, if there really were 200 rounds shot, the rest were shot at an empty hall

       Some of those mags looked like 100 rounds mags. Plus he had 23 guns. Several reloads wouldn’t be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your 1/3 estimates are complete conjecture. What do you mean “not do any damage”? I’d bet a close range round like the ones used could pierce a door and easily have enough energy to impact someone. Another 1/3 was wide of the guards location? How do you know, that’s a complete guess. And even if true that would leave 133 rounds to hit his general location.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again at that rate of fire, the spread of bullets would incredibly close. It just doesn’t seem possible.

       If he's firing shots through the door, its possible he got hit facing the door but ran for cover around the corner.

       Much bigger target, and presumably the security guard would attempt to get out of the way. It's weird, but I don't think the two are directly comparable.

       Why? Security guard unlocks the door, shooter hears him, turns around and fires. Security guard, who hasn't even really opened the door or entered the room falls back down, gets hit in the leg, crawls back. Shooter continues to shoot at the door, because he thinks they're coming to get him now, unloads 2 or 3 clips at the door.

       You can see the door had at best a few dozen rounds through it, probably a clip or less. If you count his shots in the ten minutes of bursts, he fired maybe a few hundred rounds, not a few thousand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are the authorities grossly exaggerating what was fired. He empties a clip, then takes a break for some reason, fires another clip, etc but no way he shot thousands of rounds.

       I too believe this hard.  Shoot oneself in leg.   Get away.   But... 200 rounds?   Also..police say sec guard continue to help police go room to room after he is shot.   Until police insist he seeks medical.

       A barrage of machine gun fire with approximately 200 bullets would tear down a wall, or at least make an art statement. It can't be avoided just by going down or hiding. It just comes and you're dead. Ask the victims if they could react.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also my curiosity still stands, why no footage yet? You may say that in the room corridors that are no cameras, bullshit! You think there isn't a whole squad of con artists in Las Vegas working 24/7 their ass to rip off dumb people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hotels have those cameras and security not for shootings, but to prevent robbing, con-artists, prostitutes and what else the sin-city can come up with just to taste that sweet money.

       I really think this guy suffered from some sort of mental problem that went unnoticed, like depression. Seems like he had a gambling and a drinking problem. Possibly trying to drown his sorrows.

       If that was the case, it seems unlikely that he would just send her $100,000 (or $127,000 as some reports say) for her to purchase a house in the Philippines.  Some reports said that the money was for her to "buy a house for her family".
      </p>

       She claims that she was first excited about getting the money, but then worried that it meant he was planning to break up with her.

       Depression doesn't trigger bomb making and massive gun hauls up to the 32nd floor.  The guy had help and I am pretty sure anyone would find this guy insane and depressed for what he did.  He was a rich control freak who was insecure.  But we won't hear good stories about him because who the fuck would go public sharing those stories after such a horrific event?

       Never said it dead and never said it meant he didn't have help. I was just making a point about his mental health maybe not being what some might have thought it was.

       Just saw an article pop up that said his girlfriend admitted to him having night terrors sometimes. Deffinetely seems like he had issues.

       The guy killed 50 people out of the blue.  I would say he had mental issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we looked at the population as a whole and identified those with depression that have night terrors - we would see a high percentage.  I do believe mental health is the primary cause in most instances.

       Maybe he just saw "O" by Cirque du Soleil at the Bellagio and knew he was never going to experience anything better than that so he ended it with ... the biggest mass shooting in American history? It sounded okay until the end. But "O" at the Bellagio is unlike everything else I've seen, in addition to being far better.

       I listened to a 30+ minute talk his brother had with the press yesterday.  The dude most definitely did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have a gambling problem.  A problem arises if you're doing something that's
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       for you but you keep doing it.    According to his brother at least, dude was fucking
       <em>
        rich
       </em>
       off gambling, so I wouldn't say he had any sort of "problem" gambling - considering he apparently won a shit ton of money doing it.  No gambling problem.  No drinking problem according to his brother either.  Wasn't "drowning" anything as far as the current data seems to show.

       The brother said (paraphrasing) "He was rich.  He literally bought our whole family houses and made sure we were all well off.  Vegas comped him literally everywhere he went because they knew he was one of their high rollers.  This makes no sense to me.  $100,000 to him was
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       .  He would blow that in one night because he always made so much more than that in the casinos."
      </p>
      <p>
       His brother didn't make mention of any real estate.  The way he made it sound all the money he made was because he (Stephen) was just such an awesome gambler.

       Approach it like a long distance run - not a sprint:  Just take in a good amount of it bit by bit, slowly but surely - pacing yourself.  I've been on this a good portion of the day, then got off the internet, went and did a good long work out, came back, did some more research on this stuff, and now I'm about to go on night time bike ride stroll through the neighborhood.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of confusing stuff for sure though.  I'm expecting for more and more information to be slowly but surely revealed as the days and weeks go by, so I'm not trying to "figure out everything!" right now - and I know I won't...so yeah.  I'm just taking in what I find here and there for now knowing that more and more will likely be revealed as time goes on.

       I find it interesting how many times that brother contradicted himself. First day says his brother is not a gun guy, next day, oh yeah my brother bought bumpstocks and we go to shooting ranges. Then he says his brother's gambling was like a job to him, did it "mathematically". So does he mean he counted cards? You literally can't make an income on slot machines, the house always ends up winning in the end.

       His brother did mention real estate.  Talked about the tenants and such.  He apparently had a small stake in at least one property they flipped.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm waiting to see is more about the line that he paid CASH for one of the properties.  He was an accountant.  Most accountants wouldn't tie up any more cash than needed, as most investors use borrowed money.

       It sounds like they are trying to explain away a lot of our theories. The gloves worn for an allergy, the camera set up just to watch the halls and didn't record, the note not being a suicide note, severe weight loss in the time leading up to the shooting, living a "double life, etc.

       I was also wondering about gloves, but a number of people stated that those guns get very hot. Could it be to makw sure he could continue firing? Although that would imply that he had training with those weapons, or at least would have shot them regardless. 
 Where would he be able to do this? Out in the desert? Alone? With instructor? He must have, I mean shooting a handgun repeatedly for someone who is untrained is pretty exhausting. I would think he must have, in order to sustain repeated fire for a long period. I'm not sure though, never shot that type of a gun. Please feek free to correct me or clear it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also curious about lack of ear protection. Would his ears not start bleeding after a couple of minutes if this? That in itself would be an incredible physical stressor, especially for a 64 yo wo prior experience. Yet he pushed on for 10 minutes?

       I don't think the gloves have anything to do with heat from the weapon. They look like cotton gloves. Those would be basically useless for heat. The gloves are the kicker for me. It allows no fingerprints therefore making it easier to pin on the "shooter"

       It's not at all uncommon to wear mechanic gloves to shoot. Guns get hot on semi auto, nevermind fully automatic. Your hands sweat and it makes reloading and holding steady a lot harder.

       My theory is he had a brain tumor that started growing in 2016 and made him go crazy. I'm basing this on the pictures I've seen, his sunken eyes are very similar to others I have know with brain cancers.

       Oh agreed...but a sign as to why. If it turns out it was mentally illness he was wayyy too meticulous in my opinion. If he just wanted to commit suicide and take as many people with him as he could this was the largest suicide by cop attempt in history.

       could be just a last hooraah, he knew he was going to die and didn't want a slow painful cancer death. maybe he had always dreamed of killing a bunch of people and but knew that wasn't a very productive thing to do in life( got his kicks from gambling instead), he was the son of a sociopath after all. Saved the killing thing for his bucket list, knew he was sick and probably very sick at that and just said 'fuck it', I'm going out with a bang.

       yep, I saw that too and I saw that that he was drinking heavily as well, this seemed to possibly be a recent change for him though I don't have confirmation of this just seemed to be an implication in the article.

       Or perhaps someone approached him and offered to make sure his family is taken care of, in exchange for his "services", but that doesn't make sense. He didn't have kids, not married, and no-one described him as devoted family guy. Plus, there would be an indication of medical exams, visits, maybe even meds indicating he was being treated for something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if his med records have not been disclosed yet, there would be at least something pointing to something like that. I dunno. It both makes sense and doesn't.

       my guess is that he was the type of guy that never went to the doc, but you get sick enough and you know damn well something is seriously wrong especially if you're having pain or neuro symptoms. brain cancers have some overt signs that things aren't right and as it progresses you are in serious, debilitating pain (watched my mom and an acquaintance go through it).

       he didn't talk to his brother, hadn't talked to him in 6months in fact. this guy kept to himself and it doesn't seem strange to me that he wouldn't tell anyone and sent his GF away as well.

       I dont think he was as meticulous as you give him credit for. For instance, why the long gaps in between volleys of rounds? Wouldnt a meticulous person have each of his many guns loaded and lined up to switch out quickly? Thats the reason to have so many to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the escape plan, or lack of. He wouldnt be able to take all those weapons with to start with.

       Someone who was at the concert mentioned in a video, if the shooter had been there for all that time he would have noticed that the best time to get the most casualties was at the end of the concert when people were leaving towards the crossroads, that he would have easily killed 8 times the amount of people if he had waited. Scary.

       One fact I know of is that he didn't fuel up one of the 2 airplanes he owns  and dive bomb into the concert and kill thousands.If body count was the primary reason he would have chosen a professional sports stadium,not a puny facility like this.But banning private aircraft isn't on the agenda,yet.Hmmm,what is on the agenda menu?

       If that is even remotely true,he supposedly had about an hour after shooting the security guard to at least try an escape.Better odds of getting away than trying after you squeeze one off in your mouth.Unless the Sheriff is really trying to hint that he didn't really commit suicide.He decided to quit the massacre at that point,what was he waiting for?

       Speculation:  He started shooting, security guard come to the door, he sees the security guard on his cameras and fires at the door, security guard flees but isn't downed, he panics thinking he will be arrested and not wanting to be taken alive ends his life.

       Will have to see what evidence is provided that he intended to escape and survive the attack.

       Panicking  seems to be a survival trigger until logic can prevail.If I wanted to escape but not want to be captured alive I would bring the loaded hand gun with me after making sure that the guard was finished off.Then I would at least know I could blow my head off at anytime I felt capture was unavoidable.Just another aspect that doesn't make sense.

       If everything the official reports say is true then this guy wasn't the type of person who was going to panic. You don't plan an event for months and buy 42 guns and then systematically mow people down at a concert...only to panic because a security guard was at your door and you shot him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was planning on escaping then this event would have to have been for ideologic or political reasons. Usually when people try to kill as many random people as possible they don't plan on escaping off to an island somewhere.

       Yes I find it quite odd he would be panicking at that point about an unarmed casino security guard and throw all of his meticulous plans into disarray.Ya,meeting Tattoo on fantasy island  is just that,a fantasy.Seems blizzare that anyone would think they would be on the road to freedom after pulling that off in one of the most surveillance heavy environments in the world.Crazy.

       Extremely unlikely in the situation were talking about. Fight or flight mode. This man had just killed dozens of people so that adrenalin was pumping for a very long time at that point. Shooting one man thru a door in a hallway probably wouldn't make him say "omg what do I do now?! I'll just kill myself and scrap all my plans of escape."
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you about adrenaline and rational thinking. But this guy apparently remained cool as a cucumber while he killed dozens of people across the street.

       My theory is he waiting for someone else to do their part of the plan, whether it involved using the car with explosives as a distraction, or whether someone else was supposed to be shooting with him too...  It's a pretty big deal they won't say his plan of escape.

       I don't see how a car exploding in the parking lot is going to distract the SWAT team already assembled and ordered to take this guy out.They were on an assigned mission and on the move.LVPD would have plenty of peripheral officers to approach that problem.

       Except that it took them about 45 minutes after he stopped shooting to secure the floor and breach the room. If the plan called for a distraction right after Paddock stopped shooting, then it makes a little more sense.

       The cops were there around that time, yea. But it took another 45 minutes for SWAT to show up and breach the door.

      <p>
       The cops were clearing the floor of all civilians during that time, at least according to what we've been told.

       I am 1000% convinced he planned on escaping that room. If he was committed to dying in this ordeal, he would have purchased supplies to barricade all doors and make it virtually impossible to enter the room.

       He wouldn't have to drive to a second location. He could've had it parked under the casino, gone down and shot his car (which is what they said that chemical would do- ignite if it was shot) and there you have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I've now seen the location of the car reported different ways. So I'm not sure where the evidence is on where the car was.

       Also, OP didn't mention the sheriff commented something to the effect that perhaps the shooter killed himself during the breach.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also left out any mention of there being a gun shot between when the security guard got shot, and them breaching the room. I was very bothered that no one asked about that specifically, or perhaps they did, I couldn't hear the reporters question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is a key point, the timeline shows that there were police and the guard there the entire time after the guard was shot.

       That's the one question i was screaming at my laptop wondering why no one would ask..

      <p>
       And how the fk can you be a reporter and not ask " Why is it that his escape plan must be kept secret"  Or   " will you reveal his escape plan after the investigation is complete"  It's a pretty big deal.

       I'm still trying to wrap my head around what kind of person did this yet eludes FBI profilers. There is something about his "flipping a switch" that is going to be bizarre. I mean we have seen disgruntled employee's, political activists, etc. His motive falls somewhere far from these. Or he would fit the bill.

       It doesn't seem he had anything specifically against country music or the fans. Sounds more like he had made up his mind to target a concert from above a year earlier. Didn't seem to matter what genre, just that he had a clear angle of attack from above.
      </p>
      <p>
       He made multiple trial runs at various events, Life is Beautiful and was even considering Lollapalooza among others. Route 91 must have been the best option he'd found all year so he took it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That destroys the "he hated country or trump supporters" angle.

       People are really reaching to find a motive. Any motive. Four days after the fact, someone on the news pointed out that since his father was crazy it must be genetic and that was what made him a mass murderer, nevermind that genetic mental illness rarely (never?) suddenly appears at 64 years old.

       Yea well when you left it ajar was there a mass shooting going on? To me ajar means he had it propped open with the metal bar that every hotel door has not that it was wide open, either to help with smoke removal or whatever but either way I did hotel security for awhile and never bothered people whose door was open however with a mass shooting going on Id be allowed to approach and knock on the door to make sure everything was alright he just didnt get that far before being shot at

       The door was ajar. He shoots 200 bullets through the ajar door. Which would push the door further open. An hour later, the cops finally show up. In order to get in, they must blow off the door with explosives. WTF.
Not to mention the absurdity of going on a carefully planned sniping rampage with the door ajar in the first place.

       The security guard has a master card key that they used to clear the rooms. Why did they breach the door with explosives? Why did the sheriff state the Security Officer noticed the door was ajar? Between 1015-1115 the shooter closed the door and locked/barricaded it? Sounds like he didn't shoot himself until right before they were going to breach

       Its SWAT if a door is barricaded/holding an active shooter they arent going to calmly approach  the door and swipe a card, they approached most likely behind a riot shield and breached it

       I've heard two different things regarding Jesus Campos and what he allegedly did while trying to help. The first thing is mentioned by the OP, stating that Campos was shot outside of the room, and Metro eventually encouraged him to get treated. OP also claims that the police went around making sure the floor was clear, whereas others claim that Campos did this on one leg. I'm skeptical of Campos. If he exists, he has to be tied in with something much bigger. I'm not ruling him out as a suspect. I've also wondered if he's potentially here illegally (again, if he's real), and if someone will use his alleged involvement and acts of heroism to support something in favor of DACA. Either way, there's something weird about this character in particular. I've been to several casinos. It's uncommon for a security guard to inspect a room for a noise complaint unassisted. Even on the floor, you're almost guaranteed to see security guards paired up.

       I meant “directed” not direct. Even then, 200 rounds and only one hits him in the leg in that small vicinity? It seems far more likely we aren’t being told the truth rather than 199 rounds missing him....

       I disagree. We weren’t there, and therefore I am asking questions considering the official narrative seems less likely than other explanations.

       Yes I find it quite odd he would be panicking at that point about an unarmed casino security guard and throw all of his meticulous plans into disarray.Ya,meeting Tattoo on fantasy island  is just that,a fantasy.Seems blizzare that anyone would think they would be on the road to freedom after pulling that off in one of the most surveillance heavy environments in the world.Crazy.

       The bump stock claims to do up to 800 rounds a minute, that is only 15 seconds of spraying the hallway.  I agree it seems like a waste but he had tons of ammo and I think some sort of drum feeding the rounds.  I think the 200 number is suspicious myself...

       bullets coming out at 10-14 a second from the videos i see. If you hit in the leg you also hit in the stomach and chest and maybe head. Guns kick up, and when its that fast the bullets are very close together. You can draw with one.  One hit from an automatic wep is just a bit lucky.

       Except that it took them about 45 minutes after he stopped shooting to secure the floor and breach the room. If the plan called for a distraction right after Paddock stopped shooting, then it makes a little more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to know why they feel like he had a plan to escape.
