       In October 2016, 5+ million share of OSI were purchased by insiders. What else happened in October? Something happened to paddock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insider activity for the past month shows purchases of 393,000 and sales of 875. That is 92% of insider activity in the past 6 months has been busy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is OSI? They manufacture scanners? Know who owns them? Soros.

       You may be right on the OSI systems connection, but you are 100% wrong on the Soros connection to OSI.

       He owns 0% of OSI Systems.   He once owned 11k shares, which is less than 1% of the total shares of the company.

       Look at OSI's stock graph since 97 on yahoo finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a run up prior to every major shooting. Even a run up to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no real market for these scanners before 9/11. The demand is being manfactured by creating terrorism. Sick bastards.

       From a trading perspective, the expected net result of a shooting at a casino would be as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Casinos and Hotel stocks would likely go down somewhat, with the casino/hotel involved being the hardest hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Body scanner manufacturing and general "security providers" (hardware/software/contract security personnel/consulting services) would likely go up.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are
       <em>
        EXACTLY
       </em>
       the bets that
       <em>
        WERE MADE
       </em>
       , and they were not small bets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The $42M put option buy on MGM especially sticks out. if you buy at -the-money or slightly-out-of-the-money puts, and the stock drops even a little, you can make 50% easy. If it drops a lot you can make 5000% easy  (and vice versa, if it goes up it's easy to lose 100% of what you put in very quickly).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there is a "term" on options. They are insurance policies that are only valid until a certain date. The closer that expiration date is when you buy the option, the cheaper they are (and you stand to make significantly more % on your money if your bet proves "right"). If the options purchased (in mid August) had an expiration date of, say, October or November, that would likely maximize the amount of profit made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the various insider purchases / sales on MGM and OSIS raise a lot of questions. $10M sell of MGM stock by the MGM CEO in August? Most CEO's avoid doing this like the plague because a huge insider sell usually tanks a stock's price (market assumes the insider knows something and follows suit in selling). They usually just have a large-but-regular "auto withdraw" that is set up ahead of time to occur on future dates - the market doesn't react to these sales, as they are expected and considered normal.
