    <div class="md"><p>Look at OSI&#39;s stock graph since 97 on yahoo finance. </p>

<p>There is a run up prior to every major shooting. Even a run up to 9/11.</p>

<p>There was no real market for these scanners before 9/11. The demand is being manfactured by creating terrorism. Sick bastards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a trading perspective, the expected net result of a shooting at a casino would be as follows:</p>

<p>Casinos and Hotel stocks would likely go down somewhat, with the casino/hotel involved being the hardest hit.</p>

<p>Body scanner manufacturing and general &quot;security providers&quot; (hardware/software/contract security personnel/consulting services) would likely go up.</p>

<p>These are <em>EXACTLY</em> the bets that <em>WERE MADE</em>, and they were not small bets.</p>

<p>The $42M put option buy on MGM especially sticks out. if you buy at -the-money or slightly-out-of-the-money puts, and the stock drops even a little, you can make 50% easy. If it drops a lot you can make 5000% easy  (and vice versa, if it goes up it&#39;s easy to lose 100% of what you put in very quickly).</p>

<p>Also there is a &quot;term&quot; on options. They are insurance policies that are only valid until a certain date. The closer that expiration date is when you buy the option, the cheaper they are (and you stand to make significantly more % on your money if your bet proves &quot;right&quot;). If the options purchased (in mid August) had an expiration date of, say, October or November, that would likely maximize the amount of profit made.</p>

<p>Also the various insider purchases / sales on MGM and OSIS raise a lot of questions. $10M sell of MGM stock by the MGM CEO in August? Most CEO&#39;s avoid doing this like the plague because a huge insider sell usually tanks a stock&#39;s price (market assumes the insider knows something and follows suit in selling). They usually just have a large-but-regular &quot;auto withdraw&quot; that is set up ahead of time to occur on future dates - the market doesn&#39;t react to these sales, as they are expected and considered normal. </p>
