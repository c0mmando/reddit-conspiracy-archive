       Does the room look a bit too tidy to anyone else? If you’ve ever shot a gun you know how dusty/smoky it can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be some sort of evidence that multiple guns were used having shot ~1000 rds of ammo. Is there dust and soot/smoke on any of the curtains or furniture?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there anything from the leaked photos to say this took place inside the room that I’m missing?

       The camera angles are too tight, they should of used a wide angle lens (yes I have one of those)
      </p>
      <p>
       I go to the gun range quite a bit, I could def see a lot more casings on the floor but hypothetically, they could of gone out the window. By the time these photos were taken, no smoke or cloudiness would of been there, especially with 2 windows blowing in constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how the guns are laying in his suicide photos, I'd have to say those just don't make sense, if they (government) want to portray it that way, then let them, but that isn't a natural laying of firearms.

       Unless he's got an overgassed system the casings should be ejected directly to his right or slightly backwards (ideally about 67 degrees from barrel/direction he's shooting) which would mean that unless he's hanging out the window the rounds should be inside the hotel room. He might have been standing in front of the curtain which could have caught a bunch of the casings though...

       This is true. I am a left-handed shot so I get a lot of casings that ricochet and fall down my shirt. There should def be plenty more casings in the photos BUT we don't see the other window, we see the window that would of been towards the left when looking at MB

       I'm left handed too my AR15 came standard with a small shell deflector which deflects the shells sideways quite a bit. And this is a very common gun that a lot of people own.

       Never mind that there are zero documented instances of bullet damage to anything and gunshot wounds to anyone, when it should be as extensive as it is convincing. Even the photo of the patsy does not show any entrance or exit wounds or brain matter, as well as the fact that the blood pools and separates rather than oozing into the carpet. Others have pointed out that the shell casings are placed on top of the blood substance after the fact.

       No, no.....you could test that yourself at home.  Put some pencils on the carpet in your house, then poor some water or make a mix and poor it into the carpet.....watch as the stuff doesn't jump up onto the casings (pencils) all on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the lack of damage or wounds, I think you're out of your mind.  If you haven't watched that video yet, you should.  They could not have arranged for all of this.  Those people were stone cold dead.  Pressing on necks to check pulses, sends more blood out of that girls mouth.  She doesn't choke up or look to be holding her breath at all.....that's just ignorant.  She is toast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop spreading that garbage, there is nothing except your imagination that supports a claim like that.  This is why we are inundated with hollywood movies, so now you won't accept reality because you're expecting blood splatter the way zombie movies portray.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the hospital pictures?  You think they faked that too?  Nurses all happy as pigs in shit to play along with fake blood and actors coming through?  No documented wounds there?  They just had a fun old time for cameras?

       Obviously the people in the video aren't actually just good Samaritans walking around checking pulses; they are in on this scam. The video doesn't even show any gunshot wounds or bullet damage. Go back and watch it and point to any convincing image that couldn't possibly be faked. Red stuff dribbling out of people's mouths is about the weakest "proof" of a massacre happening that I can think of.

       you can tell by the lack of non lethal bullet wounds during the live video footage.  and the lack of sounds of terror as all the incoming rounds striking people.  there is none of this screaming "i just got shot" and trust me that is the proper response to non lethal wounds.     nope all you see is a lot of standing around.   if someone was throwing rocks at those people they would have stampeded out and that didn't happen.
