       First, the "chest wound" is not a chest wound, when he shot himself he had his head down and when he fired there was blood splatter down under his chin on his shirt. The gun is where it is because the police kicked it away, standard practice even if the perpetrator is already dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "13 tattoo" on his neck. It is just a shadow and skin wattle. There is no tattoo.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no evidence of a second shooter. The Bellagio video claims that someone shot into the building, shattering glass. If that were true someone would have been able to confirm that by now via picture or video. Also the theory of another shooter at Mandalay Bay, someone would have been able to verify that windows were broken out on a different floor by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claiming that the video with all the bodies proves it was fake because there's no obvious wounds and the blood color is wrong. Having been shot myself in my shoulder and been around people who have been shot, I can tell you entry wound are small, exit wounds are bigger but from that distance there may not have been any exit wounds. As for the blood color, it is absolutely a vivid red color like that and especially when it pools and coagulates. Dried blood is more of a rust color. If you've never seen a large amount of blood please don't muddy the waters by claiming it looks fake. It does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were people standing around non chalant during the shooting? From the videos you can hear people blaming the noise on fireworks, electrical noise, one guy even claimed someone had hooked into the sound system and was playing a prank. Point being that a lot of them didn't believe it was really happening. There were 22,000 people there, the videos show just a few not reacting, really just a small fraction of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claiming there's no video showing people actually being shot. It isn't like the movies, there's no dramatic fall and blood flying into the air. You can be shot and not even feel it, you'll just keep running. I'm sure people are getting hit in some of those videos but you wouldn't be able to make it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe he had help, but we have to dig deeper and stop propagating this bullshit narrative about the neck tattoo and about fake blood, and about a supposed chest wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I miss anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       From u/SpinPHD480
      </p>
      <p>
       The light flashing on the 4th floor during the shooting is not a second gunman. The light can be seen blinking before and after the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photos that look like other windows are out at the Mandalay Bay are not blown out windows. They are from the back side of Mandalay Bay and can be seen in any picture taken of Mandalay Bay before the shooting, including google street view. I believe they are vents.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Txroadwarrior mentioned the note. The current narrative on the note claim it is NOT a suicide note. So what is it? Any theories on that? Could be something innocuous, or it could be a warning or a very short manifesto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, follow his thread for evidence there MAY have been multiple active shooters that night. Read the comments, watch the videos, decide for yourself. Personally I don't believe that there were any other shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/sanity98 mentions this possibility :
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it might be prudent to add this thought about confusion about the audio of the gunfire and crowd reaction.  It is possible that the microphones were left hot on stage and very possible that loud bullet shots/supersonic cracks passing would be caught/played through the PA.  This could be a source of why some said that it's coming from the PA/Sound System and may also explain random echoes.  No one seems to have pointed this out and just wanted to offer a possible explanation.  I guess this could be tested and would depend on if the sound guy decided to cut the mics before taking cover.  What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       u/sanity98 and u/primerush both brought up the fact that some news sources have mentioned he may have targeted jet fuel tanks at the airport. Possibly to cause a distraction to escape? Any thoughts on that?
      </p>
      <p>
       u/looshfarmer provided me with this picture which may or may not be relevant. You decide.

       u/akalldayerday has provided us with this photo that purportedly shows the hallway outside the front door to the shooters room.

       No dry wall on floor. No lights out. No noticeable holes. No shots in the hall way.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think that is the hallway outside hit room but that is just my opinion, draw your own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/bannana put it pretty well saying this :
      </p>
      <p>
       people are usually dead wrong about shootings because they have zero experience with them it's very common to have multiple reports of different shooters. gunshots echo in a city setting, they can echo a few times and when people are freaked out they aren't thinking clearly, in addition they are highly suggestible in that phase so one person says 'multiple shooters' the ones that hear it repeat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/akalldayerday provided this extremely thorough article that is well worth the read.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is a video I saw posted on Instagram. 
The video was taken prior to the shooting. The video pans over to the Mandalay Bay hotel and does show that flashing light.

       There was also a new video yesterday which was about 10 minutes long. In the video there is a man who has a gunshot wound to his forearm.

       This is a great post, not that I would want to discourage any line of inquiry, but we can at least play our own devil's advocate and try to at least consider reasonable explanations for what was indisputably a large chaotic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with you on the multiple shooters though. I have seen plenty of indications there could have been more than 1. The other thing I have noticed is a few political mouthpieces giving interviews today that seem to have debunking the multiple shooter theory as their primary motivation.

       I believe it is a possibility there were multiple shooters, but for me at least, the evidence we have now just doesn't support it.

       The sheriff himself has said he thinks he had help, but I have a feeling they are going to keep us in the dark.

       Speaking of the sheriff, I see a restrained like glee? or something when the police are giving interviews. It seems like they are containing excitement about something they know. They don't look confused or downtrodden. They
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       something. I think there is going to be some revelation released when they are ready that is going to blow our minds.

       Of course, help could mean help acquiring the weapons, help learning how to modify and fire the weapons. Help getting the large bags full of guns and ammunition up to his room. Help setting up the hidden cameras.

       Did you watch the video? They are literaly beneath the shooter.. can you please explain what exactly you disagree with in terms of content i posted? Other than the fact that you have trust issues with audio.. did you trust visual evidence of planes hitting the towers?

       people are usually dead wrong about shootings because they have zero experience with them, gunshots echo in a city setting, they can echo a few times and when people are freaked out they aren't thinking clearly, in addition they are highly suggestible in that phase so one person says 'multiple shooters' the ones that hear it repeat it.

       If you consider the fact that there isn't a single instance of overlapping gunfire, I think multiple shooters isn't plausible.  If there were multiple, they would have had to been communicating on who's shooting now, when they're stopping, and who's shooting next, and so on.
       <br/>

       I'm thoroughly convinced it was just one shooter, but I'm not married to that statement.

       what he has failed to account for (and maybe that wasn't the point) was the multiple eye witness reports of shooters (with video) in aria and caesars. the sounds of gunfire that is not echos because the video is from inside. social media has tons of posts about it
      </p>
      <p>
       also i think that if paddock shot 200 rounds at the door, why would an explosive breach be necessary?
      </p>
      <p>
       also, what about the video that shows 2 clear gun shots? this would be around 10:15pm when the automatic shots had stopped except for these final 2 clear shots

       This around 13min goes into some fire overlap that is, to me, pretty obviously an entirely different gun in an entirely different place.

       Not convincing at all.  Go listen to YouTube sounds of being shot at. You'll hear the bullet pop as it flies by before the sound from the gun.  They sound like two different guns when in fact they are the same shot with two different sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you use his sounds he's using and slow it down and look at both bursts he claims are separate, you'll see they are the exact length of time/shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       So imagine the first burst that overlays is consistent in length with a popping of the exact same pattern. Not an echo, but the sound of the bullet passing followed by the report which will travel slower.

       Maybe I'm out of the loop, can you link to the Aria and Caesars videos where they report seeing a shooter. Hearing just is not reliable.

       I've already seen all that Facebook stuff. It was all hearsay, there's no direct evidence.  Nothing in that cache of I formation provides anything concrete. All those people and not one picture or video that shows and evidence of any other shooters.

       Those people, in my opinion, just heard the shots and panicked.

       So how could those videos have very clear rapid fire gunshots going off? The concert was 1000 feet and it was pretty dim yet definitely there sounding. You are correct it doesnt show them, but has the audio and obviously people running for their lives.

       I've been watching combat videos from Afghanistan. The Taliban firing from the mountains well over a mile away and you can hear the shots clear as day. They heard shots and ran, but they never SAW a shooter.

       The Aria and Caesars theories hold no water to me. There is NO evidence of bullet holes or shell casings or anything. The Mandalay Bay was well documented, yet there is nothing but shitty Facebook posts for anything else. No victims, bullet holes, nothing.

       yeah over an hour of police radio of all kinds of reports all over the strip and all kinds of suspicious things happening and reports of suspicious vehicles that police even saw speeding out of there like they were making a break for it.

       reports of shots fired everywhere and witness testimony of shooters on the ground and a key witness that wanted to start a survivor group and died in her sleep at a very young age from "natural causes" pretty freaky that she was saying publicly that there were 100 percent shooters on the ground......then she is found dead in her bed?

       I think he was a part of an illegal arms deal with ties to the FBI. Why won't the LVPD release information pertaining to his motive? Unless it was indicative that the FBI (or that Stephan Paddock indeed worked for the FBI) had ties to illegal arms deals. Which would explain the witnessed multiple shooter claims and also why Stephan Paddock was found dead at the scene. #fastandfurious

       Victims are 100% real, the video of the guy checking pulses was grizzly. Multiple victims are on record saying there were multiple shooters and witness testimony indicates there were two strips of firecrackers set off in the crowd as soon as shooting started.

       Can you link me to the firecracker testimony?
      </p>
      <p>
       And are there eye witnesses who SAW a second shooter or are they EAR witnesses who claim they heard a second shooter? With all the buildings and at that distance the sounds could indicate many shooters where there was only one. I can't take ear witnesses seriously, especially since they most likely have no experience with guns, and the sounds of said guns.

       There are bullet holes in the door, no one has shown a picture of the hallway across from the room so how would you know there were no holes there? (

       There is a post somewhere in this thread showing a picture of 2 investigators walking down the hallway. I don't see any damage in the pic.

       But at the same time there's no way to tell when that picture was actually taken.

       Watch some YouTube videos of explosive door breeching, I just did, the doors have no blast marks like you would expect to see having watched Hollywood movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer that question, the door absolutely looks like it was explosively breeched. Also there is debris scattered all in front of the door as well as the the lamp being broken possibly from the blast, which is done on the hinges side of the door.

       Do they take the door with them, after they leave? Curious where the top half of the main doors is, the amount of debris doesnt seem to correspond to amount of door missing. Shouldn't it be laying on the inside of the room mostly?

       Could be.  But if 200 rounds went through that door it would be a lot more notciable then this. Plates would not be there any more for sure. You would see a lot bigger rips in the table trey cover cloth due to the bullet tumbling after hitting the door or wall beforehand.

       Interesting find! Can't tell what those holes are, but doubtful the hotel staff would send a holey cloth into a luxury suite. Speaking of the cart, shooter sure seem to trust that the cart wouldn't be wheeled away, along with his camera by the cleaning personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if he was alone in the room, why are there two water bottles? Did he order meal for one or two? Investigators are not telling when that room service was ordered and in what quantity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the reason the room, the windows, the cameras, the doors, etc. , are such an information clusterfuck, is because the actions and items position in the room relies on more than one person present, but it's being framed into narrative of a solo person present. The "evidence hole is round" but the "story peg" being crammed into it is square. Sorry, hope it makes sense, it's late here and my brain hurts thinking about this.

       Correct me if I am wrong, and I may be, but that cannot be the hallway outside of that room. Unless it is a picture of those two guys walking further down the hallway past the stairwell. First if you look at the model of the rooms and the hallway the entrance to the second room and the entrance to the stairwell are not directly across from each other. In the picture, however, with the guys in green walking down hallway, those two doorways are directly opposing each other. The doorway to the right has the "exit" sign so I assume that is the stairwell. Also, if you look at the picture of the cart in the dailymail link below its seems like the carpet pattern is different and the door is not as recessed as in the picture with the investigators.

       It is definetly the same carpet I think personally. The hall way is longer because there is other rooms on that floor. This is them heading down to the suite where there is obviously no damage or caution tape. They could have already been cleaned up but that would be a super fast investigation on the biggest mass killing in the US.

       Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few things that may be worth adding:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The light flashing on the 4th floor during the shooting is not a second gunman.  The light can be seen blinking before and after the shooting.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The photos that look like other windows are out at the Mandalay Bay are not blown out windows. They are from the back side of Mandalay Bay and can be seen in any picture taken of Mandalay Bay before the shooting, including google street view.  I believe they are vents.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       Why did he kill himself? Why did he kill himself when he did? He had plenty of time to kill more people. The police said they found things that indicated he originally planned to get away. Why didn't he try to get away? How does one injured and unarmed security guard keep him from escaping? Why bust out a second window? Was there another target?

       I just read an article that claims he busted out the second window to be able to hit Jet Fuel tanks on the other side of the concert venue. He had apparently hit the tanks at least twice but jet fuel doesn't explode from being shot.

       I don't if anyone as confirmed this, but one of the windows was for shooting the concert and the other was for the fuel tanks.  Would be interesting if someone rappelled down or parachuted out down to the parking deck or something...

       I was watching one of the videos where there's a group of people standing around and vaping. Then one (1) single bullet hits a cup next to them and they all flip out. If it was an LMG it would have been a few bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in another video, I saw someone recording from a floor above the floor of the shooter. It was quiet. The LMG sounded like it was in the distance. As if it was down at the concert. Perhaps through the speaker system. I'd say the real shots were various sniper positions based on the trajectory of bullets.

       interesting points.  How many Muslims work in the  Vegas 1,000's and in the Mandalay Hotel maybe 100-150? how many of them would be Radical sympathizers for their terrorist brothers to sneak in and out undetected? some thoughts to consider.

       Perhaps, however lets say a few Radical sympathizer employees could possibly learn the ins and outs of security detail and find a way to move in hardware/terrorists, as opposed to a Lone White Gunman with little access to that info. The Pic of the scene looks too overdressed, wouldn't the Synthetic carpet be covered in brass considering he shot off 1,000's of rounds. the two casings to the which are on the 'dry' area of carpeting. They seem to be almost perfectly placed next to each other not the normal random pattern of casings being extremely rapidly ejected from an automatic weapon

       Good post! i want to bring up the recording of the door breaching.  why did swat have to call into dispatch to tell them to tell thier officers to clear the hall if they were already at the door ready to breach? listen to it again and what he says.  also the way he is whispering just sounds like normal whispering and not an adrenaline fueled kind of whisper.  his voice is smooth and calm.

       yeah listening to it again it isnt as steady as i thought the first go round.  it does strike me as fake however.  i cant explain why but it just seems like he is reading off a notecard lol.  and WHAT he says makes no sense to me why he would waste the time telling the dispatcher that they have to pop this and see where he is and see if they can get a response.  just seems too true to movies lmao

       Okay soooo no second shooter? Out of the number of double digits of people saying they saw a gunmen at the New York New York or the MGM. Or how Facebook is massively taking down peoples post about multiple shooters. How can you say bold faced say there is no evidence? This post is something I want to say but my free speech will be banned from saying it. Have a nice day.

       I thought it might be prudent to add this thought about confusion about the audio of the gunfire and crowd reaction.  It is possible that the microphones were left hot on stage and very possible that loud bullet shots/supersonic cracks passing would be caught/played through the PA.  This could be a source of why some said that it's coming from the PA/Sound System and may also explain random echoes.  No one seems to have pointed this out and just wanted to offer a possible explanation.  I guess this could be tested and would depend on if the sound guy decided to cut the mics before taking cover.  What do you think?

       It's hard to say. Vocal mics for singers and instrument mics have very close pickup patterns. That doesn't mean they wouldn't pick up the shots at all, but I'm not sure if it would have been loud enough to hear in the PA.

       That's a good point.  Even with typical noise-gates, the volume of the shots and supersonic cracks (breaking of the sound barrier) seem to be plenty loud to go through a vocal mic.  But it could be any mic on the drum kit or other instrument picking it up.  Think about the loudness of a snare drum versus a sonic boom.  i don't know to be honest.  There were a few videos posted where it really did seem to like the shots were coming through the PA and would combine with the actual noise from the muzzle to create like a reverse echo.  A volley would start near the stage, get picked up by a mic into the PA and get really loud with the real time muzzle fire sounds in the distance.  The resulting sound makes sense to me.  And it would explain why it sounds like multiple shooters at points with strange echo like patterns and how it seemed like shots where coming from the vicinity of the PA.

       Drums in general are very loud instruments, but snares in particular. A solid snare hit from a few inches away (the distance of the mic) is going to be orders of magnitude louder than a rifle shot that is several hundred yards away. If any mic on the drum kit picked up the shots, it would be the overhead(s). In general though, instrument and vocal mics are designed and set up for picking up sounds that are within a few inches AND in a certain direction, and the better ones have noise cancelling elements that cancel out sounds coming from other directions. My bass rig is set up with a few feet of a loud guitar amp and full drum kit, but the mic on it does not pick up either of those at all (I use a really nice mic.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility though is that in large shows like that where many of the performers are using in-ear systems for monitoring, there will often be one or more "crowd mics" so the performers will have some ambient sounds in their mix. I don't know if these are also run through the house mix, but maybe they were?

       The only thing I disagree with somewhat is that "there is absolutely no evidence of a second shooter."  There
       <em>
        is

       a lot of bullshit being thrown around as supposed evidence of multiple shooters, but I think there is also more than enough fishiness around the issue that it is a reasonable and open question.

       Absolutely there is a real possibility there was another shooter, but I have not seen anything to support that theory.

       Personally I don't believe there were more shooters. But if evidence comes out to prove or at the very least cast doubt, I will be open to it.

       wowee so assertive. mostly good points though except
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when he shot himself he had his head down and when he fired there was blood splatter down under his chin on his shirt
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       yet no blood whatsoever on the lower part of his face?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If that were true someone would have been able to confirm that by now via picture or video
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       yes because we always see video and picture of all aspects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks... what kind of 'confirmation' did you see out of orlando, london etc
      </p>
      <p>
       question, curious why you think there were 2 windows smashed out and sheriff said he planned to escape but didn't?

       No blood on the bottom part of his face.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't shoot himself under the chin, he put the gun in his mouth pointed up to the roof of his mouth and pulled the trigger. There wouldn't have been blood on the lower part of his face.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest. I'm pretty gone off of pills and whiskey and I don't know how to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's Vegas, there is a million cameras, at least one picture of broken glass in another casino would shut me up. But there are no pictures that even cast doubt as to whether there was a second shooter or not. So I will continue to believe there was only one shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there two windows broken? Maybe he broke one and didn't like the angle so he tried another one? I can't speak as to his methods and mental state.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the sheriff claims he planned to escape, it probably has something to do with the arsenal in his car and the shots at the fuel tanks. Escape out of the window would be a feat for a trained soldier, it would not in a million years be a viable option for a civilian.

       Good post!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust a lot of things which is why I'm here. I'll add in some of my speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       After looking into this extensively it really seems like a case of someone who lost it.  I believe the multiple shooter scenario is a red herring while information is somewhat fresh. Either that or this is just a case of someone who lost it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows what is going on in this mans mind before he took the first shot and then after it. He probably stayed in that hotel and looked down on the crowds at that venue several times. He was probably known and trusted in several hotels and casinos in Vegas because he spent a lot of money there.  When you have a good reputation in Vegas you get treated well and receive bonus amenities, no one would look through your luggage ever because it would be insulting. This could change soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will take something clear and precise to alter that this was a single shooter situation. His motives and connections are still unknown, and may never be known, which is where any true conspiracy may lie. This is where we should be looking now.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the final two shots we can hear it really isn't all that odd. You have to try and think from his perspective. I can totally picture him firing off one final shot toward the crowd or anywhere, while also making sure the gun will not malfunction, before shooting himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the note it says "noted" on the bottom. Why? A time stamp for this image could provide more information. It probably wasn't written by the shooter in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also always consider that what we see ANYONE can see. Think data mining.
      </p>
      <p>
       At times like this critical thinking is key. This event will be taken advantage of even if it's a clear cut case of a man who snapped. I hope my observations add some value to the conversation.

       Did you see the video on here where you can here two gun shots about 10 seconds apart and they are roughly 40 seconds after automatic gun fire. That seems to completely contradict MacMill statements reported by the Mail article along with all accounts mainstream is reporting.

       A super-sonic bullet creates a sonic boom which can be loud enough. There are several sounds coming from this type of gunshot.  You may be thinking of the sound of the combustion and gas escape from the muzzle of the gun not being loud enough. I'm talking about the bullet breaking the sound barrier. Good point about the crowd mics aw well.

       there are many other questions yes you did miss a lot....one question I have what about MGM CEO dumping all those stocks right before the shooting and his big bet that the stocks would go down??  He would have been making money at this time so why would he do that if there wasn't a hidden agenda?? like him knowing this was going to happen.....I have my own theory of who was behind this but I don't know if this is the right place to discuss that.....

       Do they take the door with them, after they leave? Curious where the top half of the main doors is, the amount of debris doesnt seem to correspond to amount of door missing. Shouldn't it be laying on the inside of the room mostly?
