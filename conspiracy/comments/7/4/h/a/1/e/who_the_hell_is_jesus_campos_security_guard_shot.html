He also wasn&#39;t able to be at the press conference with Trump because of &quot;injuries&quot;(a bullet in the leg, hmm he couldn&#39;t see the president because of that?). He even continued to try and finish the case after he was shot, and only after cops told him to go home after it was over did he even tend to any wounds. Now tell me, how does a guy that works though a bullet injury need hospital treatment extensive enough for him not to see the damn President? Or even the country! I don&#39;t think this guy exists, to be honest. Can anyone find a shred of proof this guy wasn&#39;t created?</p>

<p>You can hear two to final shots in one video, from a handgun, 10s apart. We can work out the timing of it, but it probably fits with the theory of the guard offing the Patsy then shooting himself in the leg.</p>

That was most certainly the weapon shot out of the Mandalay, yet it isn&#39;t in that room. Maybe it was in the guest room, a room that Paddock didn&#39;t <em>actually</em> book(which there&#39;s no proof that he bought or would buy that room, even though the gov&#39;t is telling us that).

<p>Jesus Campos had a pistol. Had a key to the room and went in. Stephen fired one shot at Jesus and hit Jesus in the leg. Jesus then shot Stephen Paddock in the chest killing him. Jesus is not in the news because terrorists could seek revenge on him and his family.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Jesus was an accomplice.</p>

<p>OR Jesus was an accomplice who regretted helping Stephen Paddock and then shot Stephen so that he would not escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that he was there doing his job and tried to distract a madman from killing a bunch of people.  As for how he was able to continue participating after being shot...adrenaline.  I find it equal parts laughable and frustrating that a bunch of paranoid hacks with no knowledge of the investigation are jumping to wild conclusions because they don&#39;t have all the information 4 days after the shooting.  How narcissistic do you have to be to feel like you have the right to nitpick an investigation of this magnitude this early on?  Law enforcement has to draw their conclusions based on facts and evidence and that requires hundred if not thousands of man hours over many months.  You people think you have cracked the case because you haven&#39;t seen a picture of Jesus Campos and he didn&#39;t meet with Trump or have a gun when he confronted the shooter.  Brilliant.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who make first contact with the suspect should always be investigated. I mean, it&#39;s not like any of these posts are gonna explode and have the nation questioning Jesus Campos. We&#39;re just trying to make sense of it. I mean, I&#39;m not like rock solid on this theory, but I specifically go onto r/conspiracy to hear about... wait for it... conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I don&#39;t know if you have looked at the gun list, but Paddock didn&#39;t have a bipod m204. That was most certainly the weapon shot out of the Mandalay, yet it isn&#39;t in that room. Maybe it was in the guest room, a room that Paddock didn&#39;t <em>actually</em> book(which there&#39;s no proof that he bought or would buy that room, even though the gov&#39;t is telling us that). I believe they will never release the room purchasers to us because it will show that Paddock didn&#39;t buy the other room, Jesus Campos did.</p>
