       There is no image of him anywhere. People have incorrectly attributed a picture of a Venezuelan cop as him, but that's not him. He also wasn't able to be at the press conference with Trump because of "injuries"(a bullet in the leg, hmm he couldn't see the president because of that?). He even continued to try and finish the case after he was shot, and only after cops told him to go home after it was over did he even tend to any wounds. Now tell me, how does a guy that works though a bullet injury need hospital treatment extensive enough for him not to see the damn President? Or even the country! I don't think this guy exists, to be honest. Can anyone find a shred of proof this guy wasn't created?

       If he hadn't gone a knockin, dude could have killed more. He got a bullet for his troubles but don't think that'll stop people from claiming he's a conspirator himself. Throw in the Latino name and suddenly he's an illegal immigrant deep state operative.

       What swat team would let a random ass security guard help them clear rooms anyway? Especially a wounded one and I'm presuming un-armed cuz when I went to Vegas I didn't see any of my hotel security packing unless they carry concealed... As if they were like "we're a highly trained team of operatives who've spent years and years learning how to breach and clear rooms, recognize threats or innocents in a split second but here dude, you can throw the flashbang and we'll all stack up behind you cuz you know, security guards at a fucking hotel have waaaaay more experience with this than us and wouldn't be a liability to our safety/success whatsoever" pfffff, bitch please...

Mr. Campos has sought to remain outside the spot light &amp; did not meet w/ President Trump on Tuesday out of fear. You see Mr. Campos is undocumented &amp; his children are in the DACA program..."

       There is no way in hell this is true. Family worked in Vegas security. The vetting process in these hotels are insane even for a legal American. There is no way a undocumented illegal immigrant got a job at hotel security.  Maybe maybe in the kitchen but no way in hell a security guard. This fishy as hell.

       But why would he be unarmed? He is a security guard for a casino on the Vegas strip for God's sake, I would expect him to have something. Then again, I'm not that familiar with security protocol and this could easily be wrong

       Because security guards are probably supposed to call the police for violent encounters as a way to limit the casino's liability. He probably tried to stop it while unarmed because he was hoping to help save some lives. This almost certainly went against the security protocol.

       I just found out he was unarmed. It is odd. Could be that he was trying to locate the room and the shooter saw him coming on those cameras he set up.

       I'm assuming this guy is a ghost with no social media profile either. Just like the "shooter".

       You can hear two to final shots in one video, from a handgun, 10s apart. We can work out the timing of it, but it probably fits with the theory of the guard offing the Patsy then shooting himself in the leg.

       I don't see why a lone security guard would be sent up to the 32nd floor to stop a psycho shooter with automatic firearms. What about a swat team??? That just doesn't make sense to me.

       Maybe because the security guard was not who he seemed. No background, doesn't even exist on the internet. He was placed by the CIA in my honest opinion, which explains the two pistol shots heard. He shot himself in the leg after killing Stephen Paddock.

       New Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Campos had a pistol. Had a key to the room and went in. Stephen fired one shot at Jesus and hit Jesus in the leg. Jesus then shot Stephen Paddock in the chest killing him. Jesus is not in the news because terrorists could seek revenge on him and his family.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus was an accomplice.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR Jesus was an accomplice who regretted helping Stephen Paddock and then shot Stephen so that he would not escape.

       Was paddock shot in the chest is that confirmed ? If he was then okay maybe I can see this... but if he was shot in the head this guy Jesus is a fucking great shot under pressure.

       My guess is that he was there doing his job and tried to distract a madman from killing a bunch of people.  As for how he was able to continue participating after being shot...adrenaline.  I find it equal parts laughable and frustrating that a bunch of paranoid hacks with no knowledge of the investigation are jumping to wild conclusions because they don't have all the information 4 days after the shooting.  How narcissistic do you have to be to feel like you have the right to nitpick an investigation of this magnitude this early on?  Law enforcement has to draw their conclusions based on facts and evidence and that requires hundred if not thousands of man hours over many months.  You people think you have cracked the case because you haven't seen a picture of Jesus Campos and he didn't meet with Trump or have a gun when he confronted the shooter.  Brilliant.....

       People who make first contact with the suspect should always be investigated. I mean, it's not like any of these posts are gonna explode and have the nation questioning Jesus Campos. We're just trying to make sense of it. I mean, I'm not like rock solid on this theory, but I specifically go onto r/conspiracy to hear about... wait for it... conspiracies.
