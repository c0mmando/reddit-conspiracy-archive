It&#39;s plausible that they told him he was filming a scene for his oligarch buddy&#39;s music video, and they told him to sit there and watch. It&#39;s also possible that they said &quot;oh we have a special surprise for you, a gift from Putin himself!&quot; Then they put him in the room with hidden cameras, and he just sits there because he doesn&#39;t want to offend anyone.

    <div class="md"><p>Alinsky’s rules for radicals. 
1.&quot;Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.&quot; Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. &quot;Have-Nots&quot; must build power from flesh and blood.
&quot;Never go outside the expertise of your people.&quot; It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.
&quot;Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.&quot; Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.
&quot;Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.&quot; If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.
&quot;Ridicule is man&#39;s most potent weapon.&quot; There is no defense. It&#39;s irrational. It&#39;s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.
&quot;A good tactic is one your people enjoy.&quot; They&#39;ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They&#39;re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.
&quot;A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.&quot; Don&#39;t become old news.
&quot;Keep the pressure on. Never let up.&quot; Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.
&quot;The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.&quot; Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.
&quot;The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.&quot; It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.
&quot;If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.&quot; Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.
&quot;The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.&quot; Never let the enemy score points because you&#39;re caught without a solution to the problem.
&quot;Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.&quot; Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions</p>

&quot;Ridicule is man&#39;s most potent weapon.&quot; There is no defense. It&#39;s irrational. It&#39;s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.
&quot;A good tactic is one your people enjoy.&quot; They&#39;ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They&#39;re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.
&quot;A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.&quot; Don&#39;t become old news.
&quot;Keep the pressure on. Never let up.&quot; Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.
&quot;The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.&quot; Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.
&quot;The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.&quot; It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.
&quot;If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.&quot; Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.
&quot;The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.&quot; Never let the enemy score points because you&#39;re caught without a solution to the problem.
&quot;Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.&quot; Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions</p>
