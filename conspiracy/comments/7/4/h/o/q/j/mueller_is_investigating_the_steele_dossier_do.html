       I was taken aback originally by how weirdly specific the Trump/hooker/pee/Obama story is. Do you feel the specificity gives it more credibility or less?

       Well the idea is that it is being used as blackmail. Hence the reason Trump refuses to say anything negative about Putin and why he reportedly had a meltdown when Congress sent him the Russian sanctions bill to sign.

       It was actually paid and contracted by the NeverTrumpers decision of the GOP. There's no evidence of any DNC involvement yet but we'll see.

        In September 2015, Fusion GPS was hired to do opposition research for Republicans who opposed Donald Trump's bid during the Republican primary campaign for the 2016 presidential election. When Trump had emerged as the probable Republican candidate by the spring of 2016, Republican donors stopped funding the investigation, and Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton became Fusion GPS's new clients.

       I don't really give a shit about podesta. He was probably trying to make some money just like all of them are. You can lock him away with Manafort if you want to. But Manafort is a republcian. Unless you think Trumonis so fucking stupid that he would pick a democrat in cahoots with Podesta to run his campaign.

       I don't think so. But if it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       exist, I imagine he was tricked into it. It's plausible that they told him he was filming a scene for his oligarch buddy's music video, and they told him to sit there and watch. It's also possible that they said "oh we have a special surprise for you, a gift from Putin himself!" Then they put him in the room with hidden cameras, and he just sits there because he doesn't want to offend anyone. A lot of people forget that the dossier only said that he
       <em>
        watched
       </em>
       the golden showers. It never claimed that he peed on anyone or that anyone peed on him.

       Well I imagine his reactions would vary drastically depending on whether he paid for hookers to pee on a bed, or if it caught him surprise. If there is audio it should be pretty clear which was which.

       Oh yeah, I don't think that he paid for the prostitutes (assuming the story is true, which I'm doubtful). Putting him into that situation and filming him under false pretenses or without his knowledge would be consistent with Kompromat techniques.

       Alinsky’s rules for radicals. 
1."Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have." Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. "Have-Nots" must build power from flesh and blood.
"Never go outside the expertise of your people." It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.
"Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy." Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.
"Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules." If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.
"Ridicule is man's most potent weapon." There is no defense. It's irrational. It's infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.
"A good tactic is one your people enjoy." They'll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They're doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.
"A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag." Don't become old news.
"Keep the pressure on. Never let up." Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.
"The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself." Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.
"The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition." It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.
"If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive." Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.
"The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative." Never let the enemy score points because you're caught without a solution to the problem.
"Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it." Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions

       The specificity gives it a lot of credibility for me, yeah. It seems "in character", given what we know both about the Russians (who are in the habit of trying to get Kompramat on visiting important people) and Trump (who visited Russia, is clueless, is vindictive, hates Obama, and is very willing to cheat on his wife). If it's made up, it was made up by someone who understands Trump's psychology very well.
