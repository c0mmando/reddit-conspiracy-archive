        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see a lot of people here speculating on motivations and details based on information provided in mainstream media reports. There&#39;s an angle for everyone: lone wolf psychopath; deep state arms dealer; occult ritual sacrifice. </p>

<p>The narrative over the last 24 hours on this sub has went from wild speculation on the latter to more mild speculation about the narrative provided by the &quot;LVPD leaker&quot;. Personally, I&#39;d urge those of you buying into that narrative to refer back to the case of Tupac Shakur, which the LVPD has helped cover up since 1996. </p>

<p>To think they weren&#39;t in on this recent event on some level is ludicrous. They&#39;re one of the groups who would benefit the most when you consider the possible outcome of this: more laws, more restrictions, more security, greater police presence, etc. They have a stake in this game: more funding for their organization.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the media. There does seem to be a growing push among the mainstream that this story doesn&#39;t seem right. ABC News filing for FOIA about Paddock&#39;s employment history with the government is a clue here.</p>

<p>My angle on the media is also simple: no one trusts the mainstream news agencies anymore, so you need to restore faith in them. Let them break a juicy story about undercover arms dealings in the FBI, which pacifies a large majority of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; while alerting the masses that they&#39;re really not as safe and secure from the feds as they think, which means greater trust placed in your local authorities, who are now getting greater funding for their increased militarization.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a two-birds-with-one-mass-shooting thing. Increase trust in the media by allowing them to shine light on an deep state arms deal gone wrong, while also providing the groundwork for increasing local police presence in major cities.</p>

<p>Discuss.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should also note that the FBI, from what I&#39;ve read here and on 4chan, seem to be the more America first group, while the CIA seems to be the arm of the globalists. Another way to take heat away from the agency.</p>

<p>This is such a broad sweeping generalization that it&#39;s almost meaningless. Sometimes the MSM does fact checking and they get it right. Because we live in the internet we are inundated with millions of instances where the MSM has gotten it wrong, thereby allowing people to say &quot;The MSM doesn&#39;t do fact checking&quot; ...when in reality they do, and most of the time they may even be right, but that doesn&#39;t matter because there are people don&#39;t trust their institutions anymore. </p>

<p>We have reached the point where the people in charge, don&#39;t trust the institutions they have taken over to lead. This should end well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good argument - though I don&#39;t buy the media part. The media is history and TPTB have no interest in turning the clock back. Media is now &quot;Social&quot; and we see a power grab for gaining control over it.

    <div class="md"><p>True. So apply the same logic to the &quot;social&quot; media. You create personalities on there, whether real people or bots, who break the news. Instead of on your TV, it&#39;s in your Twitter feed. This is our mainstream media now. You&#39;re telling me you can&#39;t have the modern-day equivalent of a news anchor walking through a crisis scene after the fact filming a 4-minute &quot;on location&quot; video where he&#39;s taking the pulse of people lying on the ground? That does more to build a narrative on social media than anything you&#39;d see on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo do you like conspiracies? I took your conspiracy and put it inside another conspiracy so you can have a mega conspiracy! </p>

<p>Essentially OP&#39;s take is there is a conspiracy (the MSM manufactured an undercover FBI arms dealing conspiracy to build up MSM trust) within a conspiracy (Paddock wasn&#39;t a lone wolf) and we know this because Tupac. Conspiracy-ception! </p>

<p>Sorry but I&#39;m going to need something better than that. The FBI conspiracy doesn&#39;t even have legitimate traction. I haven&#39;t seen any of the MSM touch this 4chan FBI theory. If MSM is using this as its cover up to build up national trust, the first step would have to be them actually USING it as its cover up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is necessarily fair -- I take prozac/fluoxetine to keep my thoughts on track and focused throughout the day, and seroquel xr to sleep through the night without waking up every hour and mellow out a hot temper. Both of these medicines help me be &quot;baseline normal&quot; but without them I would never ever consider harming someone or even enacting violence towards any species. I have gone through many different periods/levels of withdrawal with these medications and others, and even knowing how awfully those affect my thinking and behaviors, I would never expect to feel like I couldn&#39;t trust myself with a weapon. </p>

I wasn&#39;t claiming or trying to &#39;solve&#39; anything actually, I should have elaborated by suggesting that perhaps adverse reactions to anti-depressants(or coming off said drugs) could possibly be a factor in some of these shootings.

<p>Our enemies are less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up […]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters […]. These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, income tax, government finance — [Harold] Wilson, for instance, the current Premier of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually.[29]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. This articulates exactly why we don&#39;t trust the official narrative. Quick add on theory here: After the Port Arthur Massacre, Australia has a massive gun ban. That shooter had a pretty clear motive (at least for the initial murders) and documented mental problems (very low IQ). Soon after, the US gets Columbine; clear motive. The motives get more vague with every event after that (except the Islamist ones). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Las vegas is just a part of the valley.
Las Vegas Metro covers a wider area
Within what a lot of people consider Vegas is a lot of smaller...I don&#39;t know what to call them. Sub-Cities I guess
Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, Paradise (which I believe is where the strip technically is), Summerlin.
LVPD, LVMPD, and NLVPD are all different entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first point was Australia did ban guns all together. And no gun makers won&#39;t profit because they won&#39;t increase production. The guns that are bought during the spike were already sold to distributors. Only the gun shop making the sale will profit off of the OVERSTICKER prices people will pay during a craze, in addition to increased sales.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lurker here, and I&#39;m not looking to argue, just curious; why is every single act of violence immediately labeled as a conspiracy? I mean I was anticipating these posts here as soon as it happened. Surely some of these things must happen for no reason. When you label everything as an inside job doesn&#39;t that lose credibility to things that are actually internally nefarious? Is there a mass shooting or act of violence that you would or have deemed as unaffiliated with the government? Again, not looking to argue, not saying you&#39;re wrong, just looking for some insight. </p>

This one did seem particularly obvious in its missing pieces, bits not adding up, smelling of a cover up etc, almost like the intention was to have people question it. The again there are theories out there that TPTB actually want humanity to awaken, it&#39;s just they know it&#39;s going to happen whether they like it or not, so they want the masses to awaken on their terms, in a negative and controllable manner rather than in a positive, spiritual and collaborative way.

<p>Our enemies are less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up […]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters […]. These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, income tax, government finance — [Harold] Wilson, for instance, the current Premier of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually.[29]</p>
