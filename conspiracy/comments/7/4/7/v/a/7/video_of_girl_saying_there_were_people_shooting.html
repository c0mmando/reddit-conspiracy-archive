Isnt that why you hire actors so they will say what you tell them to say?

       5 years since the Dr Phil uploaded, in that time she's lost a lot of weight and not gotten noticably any older. She moves her lips differently when she talks in the Dr Phil clip too. It could be her, but it's not 100% certain.

       that's total bullshit. Unless there was a gun right close to a mic there is no way you'd mistake it coming from the stage area. Especially not while the band was still playing at the beginning, and I don't know any PA tech who is gonna bolt from the console without muting first so it would have most likely been off for the rest of it, once Jason Aldean books it off stage.

       Well usually they will be using cardoid or supercardoid mic depending on where the monitor placement on stage is. Cardoid are directional and only pick up mostly sound coming from the front t and a little to the sides. A supercardoid will block out more sound coming from the sides at the cost of picking up a bit more sound from the rear. If they had a monitor directly in front of the mic so the performers could hear the. It's most likely a cardoid to prevent feedback. With those kind of mics it's not picking up much sound that's not coming from directly in front of the mic.

       That's absolute bullshit, mics don't pick up noises from 500m away. If they bullets are whizzing by, they don't make lots of noise like a gun fire, you can just hear them breaking through the air.

       It's definitely not bullshit. The sounds are being picked up on everyone's cell phone mics, so why wouldn't the mics on stage pick them up? There are usually condenser mics over the drums and cymbals that are very sensitive.

       Have you ever been to a concert? Do the mics on stage pick up the voices in the crowd or do they pick up the instruments and vocals?
      </p>
      <p>
       The mics used for concerts are very direct and do not pick up outside noise. Regardless - lets just say they
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       somehow pick up the gun shots - wouldn't they be ENORMOUSLY loud? Think about how loud a concert is - this makes absolutely no fucking sense. Trying to even entertain that idea is asinine.

       These mics are only effective for sounds that have a source very close to them, otherwise the mics would pick up on the cheering crowd or the music coming from the speakers, creating a feedback loop.
They wouldn't be able to pick up the gunfire from 300 meters away.

       I'm just reporting what I heard in one of the interviews and it checks out. I'm not trying to disprove that there were multiple shooters, but the theory that shooters were on the ground, near the stage doesn't hold much water. It's hard to say what mics would or wouldn't pick up unless you've been to a concert with gun fire. I haven't.

       I realize that, but there are many types of mics on a stage. You're out of your element here. I have been playing in bands for years and have played the part of a singing drummer. If you want to understand this better, search "singing drummer noise bleed". There's no such thing as a mic that doesn't pick up background noise. Those gunshots are louder than anything there.

       I think everyone is ignoring the fact that the sound could be bouncing off of the stage from the mandalay bay. Seems far more likely than previous suggestions of multiple shooters. Guns are loud.

       I've played live for the last 10 myself, and whole obviously some background noise would be picked up, I doubt it would come through the speakers loud enough for the effect described above.

       Listen to some of the conversations in the crowd, you'll hear multiple people suggest that the sound isn't gunfire, but a PA malfunction. That's because the PA is blasting the gun sounds. Believe it or not.

       Cell phone mics are designed for that situation. Mic's used for live performances have limited distance. Live recordings you here of your favorite artists that are on DVDs and stuff are recorded from the soundboard and intentionally have the crowd mic'd.

       Have you even watched the videos? There's several instances of people saying along "it's not gunfire, it just the PA system." Several people at the front of the stage were saying this. Why? Because the speakers were projecting the sound. It's been mentioned again and again.

       Pretty much every person commenting is clueless to what's actually happening. 50% of the people think it's fireworks. Many near the front think the PA is malfunctioning. One guy is arguing with his wife that "it's not gunfire. It doesn't sound like that." There's a lot of evidence that the PA was picking up the gunshot sounds and confusing the hell out of everyone. Not a single person says, "look up at floor 32!"

       The way that sound works as well could have an effect on what they heard. I think it's far more likely that the sound was bouncing off of different objects; causing confusion, than more shooters near the stage.

       Actors are still people with likes and dislikes. Why can't it be that this particular actress likes country music and lives or traveled to Vegas to see the show?  I'm not advocating that what she is saying is true or false, only that she could actually be a legit victim in this tragedy. Stranger things have occurred that are completely coincidental.

       Not sure TPTB are behind it being the same girl.  I won't say it's coincidence (at all actually), but it does indeed seem like the same girl was on Dr. Phil and also happened to be at the country concert
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       happened to have gotten interviewed by the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she was a plant, she would indeed be spitting the ptb narrative - yet she isn't parroting it, which indicates that she's not a plant.  This means that it...just
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       be a deep ass coincidence that it's the same person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit I don't know at this point...but yeah.  That's the same damn girl.

       There are many possible outcomes, this is where you have to decide what fits and what doesnt, this girl is an actor, she has appeared on a nation tv show, some people have mentioned there was an ad looking for crisis actors in las vegas, this fits the bill for a crisis actor WITH a previous appearance on a fake tv show.

       A lot of assumptions in that thought. Assuming she was even the same girl, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that five years later she ends up at a country concert that gets shot up and because she’s a narcissist, she wants to go on tv. Ever heard of The Improbability Theory? There are many, much more plausible explanations than actor-turned-crisis-actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course there would be an ad for crisis actors— Las Vegas is a major city and they are always running drills for preparedness. Again, a more plausible explanation than a staged massacre.

       Lol sure whatever. They stand on the weakest legs imaginable. No matter how much you try to prop them up. Also for future reference, saying “I’m still right” without disproving what someone else said isn’t a good tactic.

       Not to keep this going, but you cant argue against coincidence, its just a 1 in a billion coincidence, or improbability theory, you are talking about 1 and a billion numbers here, my numbers were verifiable and factual that happened, yours were probabilities and randomness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, she has a twitter account and she is verified as being there and witnessing everything, she seems legit and her story checks out and has been dealing with the situation on her twitter account fairly well it seems although she is very distraught about the response time.

       Link to Twitter plz? And while my argument does indeed revolve around probability, yours revolves around mere conjecture and speculation. You have individual, concrete facts. One Dr. Phil woman; a woman who was at the concert who quite possibly could be her; a supposed ad for crisis actors; a massacre. Everything else is just guesswork.

       Mine does not revolve around conjecture, how can i know actor and an ad placed for crisis actor and this girl being at the right place at the right time be conjecture and speculation? It is verifiable facts, the only thing missing was was her story (now we can verify her story by her twitter) sure you have to speculate about the situation she was in, but all the possibilities i put forth are far more credible and verifiable than your randomness and probables.

       Literally the only claims you've made in this comment chain is that she appeared on TV (true), and that she's a crisis actor, which is obviously

       Here you go, incase you still have not pieced this together. Someone was obviously looking for crisis actors in las vegas prior to this event. Verfied. Sorry you cant piece things together. Anyways, i have provided even more evidence she is the girl on CNN and she is still traumatized by this situation. Check out her twitter account if you still think i havnt provided enough evidence for you.

       That's not an ad for crisis actors. It doesn't even say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies like Crowds On Demand run ads all the time in entertainment cities like Las Vegas, LA and New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are hired by clients who want to make sure they have a crowd to put on a facade of being popular, or to be sure there is a visible crowd for televised events. The appearance of popularity will quickly draw a real crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a friend in Las Vegas who does these gigs regularly. Once she was hired (along with about 30 other people) to "notice " an aspiring magician on the strip, freak out, ask for pics and go gaga over an "improved " trick he performed for his fans. She said no one knew the magician, but the fake crowd quickly drew a real crowd and it was an effective publicity stunt. Other gigs have included making new restaurants look busy and even standing in lines to get into clubs an hour before they open to make it look popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will see ads like that all of the time in LV.

       And this is where you are worng, the government doesnt do this, are you kidding, these are elements outside the givernment but have government connections (or dealings with lucrative government contracts) its actually pretty simple game plan.

       What's funny is I've only addressed what you've written here for everyone to see. You on the other hand, have somehow arrived at the conclusion that I believe whatever the government or CNN tells me, although I've said nothing that alludes to that being the case. Great job trying to paint your false narrative though.

       Well you know what makes you look stupid, if you have read all my comments you would have seen i have corrected my original assessment of this girl to being a crisis actor and actually being a real person caught in the event. But you didnt do that and once again you have proven your laziness in this issue and still want to call names.  But that is fine,  we already know who is the bigger person here and you can keep sticking with your narrow research practices.

       Between the two of us, I'm the only doing any research. Remember your first comment on this post? You were absolutely convinced this girl was a crisis actor just because this post told you to think that. You can't even form an idea or constructive thought on your own. And you call

       I know your type though so its ok, you are the type that just want to shout as loud as you can over everyone because you like to be on the outside watching all the kids have fun. When noone asks you play you insert yourself into the action and get loud and are the guy everyone walks away from because you were never invited.

       This chick was on an episode of Dr. Phil. She's an actress. The episode she was in portrayed her as a super ditzy narcissist, publicly joking about her 7 abortions. How true to life that character is, who knows? But its certainly weird.

       The fact that this is the same girl from Dr. Phil shouldn't be reaffirming in anyone's mind that this is some sort of cover up. Although Dr. Phil is a glorified shmuck medically speaking, his show covers real people with real issues. She was on there for being a narcissist. She wants people to look at her and think she knows what is going on. If you actually listen to what it is she's saying, she repeats the same thing, emotionlessly, over and over without ever actually giving any specific information. If you ask me this woman saw a camera and hopped in front of it to say whatever she needed to to keep the camera on her.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just what I see as a Psych grad student focusing directly on her actions, not what's going on around her. I have yet to be convinced of a second shooter. In my mind the real story is in why this monster did what he did, if he even did it at all.

       I know your type though so its ok, you are the type that just want to shout as loud as you can over everyone because you like to be on the outside watching all the kids have fun. When noone asks you play you insert yourself into the action and get loud and are the guy everyone walks away from because you were never invited.

       Pretty much every person commenting is clueless to what's actually happening. 50% of the people think it's fireworks. Many near the front think the PA is malfunctioning. One guy is arguing with his wife that "it's not gunfire. It doesn't sound like that." There's a lot of evidence that the PA was picking up the gunshot sounds and confusing the hell out of everyone. Not a single person says, "look up at floor 32!"
