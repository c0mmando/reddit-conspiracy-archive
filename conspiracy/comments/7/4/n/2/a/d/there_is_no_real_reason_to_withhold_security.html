       My mom who doesn't give a shit about stuff like this is questioning it all. Her whole workplace filled with accounting women are talking about it too.

       Agreed. Some people are still hesitant to say aloud they question what we're being told but the other day I walked in on my dad listening to the gunshots and YouTube videos of guns. I knew he was questioning the shooting but he wouldn't come out and say it. 
Today I came home again and I told my mom some of these things and she is like why isn't this on the news?

       Alot of people are suspicious but don't want to be grouped as conspiracy nutjobs. I wouldn't go around talking about alot of this, I'm ashamed to say..

       Pretty odd. Casinos have cameras that cover every square inch of the floor. They could read a text off your phone with the cameras. Although that isn't super advance bc my fiance works LP at a high end department store and they could also do that with their cameras, but they don't have facial recognition software like the casinos probably do. They do don't they?

       They have facial recognition yeah. My buddy got banned from SLS one time for bringing ecstasy in to a pool club. They made him give them his drivers license and also took pictures of his face... And this was SLS, not one of the big casinoes like Mandalay.

       What I'm saying is your story specifically doesn't point at all towards them using facial recognition. It's pretty commonplace and normal for when one is banned from a business, that business gets that individual's information and image to let employees and staff know not to let the person on the property. Like if my local bar banned a dude and took his picture, it wouldn't make sense to assume and come to the conclusion its for facial recognition

       Your fiance is embellishing a bit. 1080p fixed cameras, at best, from 20' above the floor aren't reading texts. Your cell phone screen will be like 7 pixels wide. Even the gaming surveillance at the casinos isn't spectacular. I do agree though that they shkuld release footage. It may contain information that could compromise an investigation, but they seem to be claiming it an open and shut case of a crazy guy who went off. I personally think there is way more to the story.

       It's likely he has some motorized pan tilts that would be cable, but it would be difficult to do. Facial recognition is really tough stuff. Most retailers would have analytics that would show direction of travel trends, hot spots, etc, but facial recognition is. It easy stuff to do with current affordable tech. Casinos are also cheapskates and do only what is necessary to keep gaming control board off their case. They may do some analytics if they think there is a return on investment, which I couldn't see with facial recognition.

       There are multiple security surveillance people watching the cameras. They use humans to identify people. Pictures of recent 86's and potential threats would be printed out, and posted for the next shift, etc. Pit boss calls in to watch people.

       That is one possibility. Another is that this entire shooting story has less basis in reality than the original Wizard of Oz. Anybody who watches

       I've thought very critically. That's why I'm reading and watching things. Pretending like you know how a person you've never met should and would react after witnessing a catatrosphic event like that makes you sound like a dumb ass.

       Maybe you're a psychologist who specializes in trauma though. That seems a lot more likely.

       Honestly I'm not really sure why they're expected to be releasing footage? In their minds I'm presuming it would only be showing the obvious and isn't very important, therefore not worth anyone's time to even prepare for the media. Not like a police encounter that can be subject to scrutiny of someone's actions.

       I can see your point. I don't think it's weird for them not to see a point in releasing a tape, I agree with you.

       But every other video of any other crime is played on repeat on every news station, until we're bored to tears of the same footage. Why not now? When they have no new information?

       Oh yeah I think those were released pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basement tapes were recorded by the shooters in the year (maybe less, idk) leading up to the shooting. Basically videos of them planning and whatever else. The last part of the tapes were their goodbyes to their families. There are some partial transcripts of the basement tapes, but the tapes themselves were reported as destroyed in 2015.

       In this world these days, there should be video of his every move, and tons of video on the ground of what was happening.  The only video on Youtube I was able to see when I searched for it was copied many times and released 24 hours after it happened.  You would think in an situation like this there would be video of everything.  I'm still wondering how they got everyone to the hospital.  Wouldn't you need to treat people at the scene?  Where is all this footage?

If so, I don't believe that he would try and better what his dad did by killing over 50 people but maybe he would idk... but maybe he could have been more easily set up to look like the bad guy if the wrong sort of people knew about this

        Look at the comments here, people think that just because there are cameras that nothing bad could have happened. its a deterrant.

       No one is saying anything of the sort. Everyone is just wanting to see the footage that should exist, it being a casino and all...

       There has been talk of the Mandalay being sued by victims. They may not be able to/willing to release the surveillance due to how damning it may be to their security.  If we see images of Paddock jumping 20 bags of ammo and guns like Quasimoto up to his room, that hotel and its company would be broke in no time.

       It's an ongoing investigation. Should they just release every piece of info so sailorchubbybutt can see it? Pretty standard to not release all info from ongoing investigations.

       You know what rich people do pretty often? Pay bag boys to take their bags to their hotel rooms. There are a million innocent explanations for why they haven't released a picture that may or may not exist. My advice, stop overthinking every single
Little detail.

       Lol fair. All I'm saying is everyone loses their fucking minds over every small detail.

       In life, nothing is perfect.

       People don't speak perfectly all that time, people don't act logically all the time.

       People trying to apply logic to a guy who just murdered 58 people and injured 450+ more. It's silly.

       I can see your point. I don't think it's weird for them not to see a point in releasing a tape, I agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But every other video of any other crime is played on repeat on every news station, until we're bored to tears of the same footage. Why not now? When they have no new information?

       The Columbine tapes are out , even.
