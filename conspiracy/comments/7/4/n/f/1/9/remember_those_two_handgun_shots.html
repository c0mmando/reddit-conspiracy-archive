<p>Alright,  bear with me here and strap on the tinfoil. They keep saying about how much of a miracle 200 rounds fired into the hallway was, considering the guard only got hit once. What if he didn&#39;t get hit by auto fire at all?  2 handgun shots. One to Campos. One to Paddock. Nothing else makes sense to me about why those two shots we hear. Now who fired the gun??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>200 rounds through the door. Definitely not 200 holes in doors from what we can see. He had in possession what appear to be 100 round mags at most. One security was worth either dumping 100 rounds, change mag, dump another 100. Or dump 100 rounds from one gun and drop that one and pick up another to dump another 100. All of this for one security guard? Those rounds would penetrate just dry wall that all these walls are made of. No one else gets hit. No one else says they had rounds penetrate into their rooms. Fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did think about this when I was thinkin about his suicide. I also thought about muscle spasms depending on where in his brain he hit. Also wouldn&#39;t the police tell the difference between a handgun and a assault rifle at relatively short range? Not sure though. It&#39;d make sense considering he stayed till he was physically forced into the ambulance. Why the fuck would the shooter stay? to remove any and all suspicion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an image of the door which had maybe 10 bullet holes. I think 200 shots is utter bullshit. If 200 shots went down a narrow hallway and all that happened to the security staff was a shot in the leg, he might as well be a walking miracle. </p>

<p>I think he saw guard shot through the door a few times. Realized a couple of minutes later it was a matter of time before swat moved in and killed himself</p>

<p>As for the second point I haven&#39;t seen that but I could imagine a security guard leading whichever authorities are behind him to where they have to go and running to do it. The worst part of all this hunting is security footage would clear 98% of this whole thing up. The running guard, the hallway shooting, if Paddock was in fact changing rooms. Who was in the neighboring room. All of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my theory too. Campos booked the guest room(come on, Paddock would NOT have booked that room, he had no guests and the same vantage point). I think Campos shot Paddock and then himself in the leg. I do not believe Campos is a real security guard, and I think the bullet in his leg is a pistol bullet.</p>
