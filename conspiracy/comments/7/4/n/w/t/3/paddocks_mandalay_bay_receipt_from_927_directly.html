       Earlier this week someone posted a receipt that shows Paddock ordered room service to room 32135 (32nd floor, room 135), possibly for 2 guests. The multiple guests could be explained away, but the receipt clearly shows date and Paddock's name placing this order on 9/27. If your concern is that there isn't an image of the full receipt, look at the scuffs and ink blotches on the receipt and they match up pretty perfectly.

       Yet the news reports are still saying Paddock checked in on 9/28:

       Is the receipt fake? If not, and he was there a day earlier, why is this not being corrected in reports?

      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine this with the new picture of his valet car checked in at room 32135 on 9/25, he was clearly in his room much earlier than 9/28.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You can see in the higher quality image here that he was at the hotel on 9-25-17 and the entries even include room #32135.

       How does being off by 1 day change anything? I mean, we have shit like reports of shooters in 3 other hotels. Why does being 1 day off, likely a mistake in all the commotion, really hurt any of the theories?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not being hostile to your post at all. I'm just curious how you think this factors in, and why it is important.

       If it's being reported incorrectly, that would raise more questions (why/how did they get the time wrong, were there actually two guests as denoted on the receipt, how long was he really there for). I'm not saying it proves anything at all really, just interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other theories such as multiple shooters, I'm not seeing anything as concrete as this that contradicts the official report.

       There are alot of theories going around about what really happened or why he would do this. One theory is that he was forced to do it. They said he set up cameras but maybe the cameras were set up to record him and make sure he did it without trying to make a run for it. Maybe the fact that he checked in earlier shows other people with him on hotel cameras. I have no ideas. I just want the truth and every little puzzle piece needs to be examined to get a clear picture of the true events that unfolded that night.

       Fair enough. Imho the date difference is just a mistake they haven't had a chance to correct yet. But I'll gladly eat my words.

       According to the valet, he was actually there on the 25th, so that would be 3 days prior to what was said by the MSM, so was he checked in on the 25th, or just there gambling and scoping out.

       I thought the.media said the 26th? But without doubt we got some epic bullshit in this media narrative. I live a mile away from where this happened. I could hear the gun shots and the screams. It was absolutely terrible, and our shitty ass govt is going to just color all over what really happened, and all those poor people dying will just end up serving some deep state objective.

       Wasn't he upgraded to the room he did the shooting from? would make sense why they got the date wrong. "oh looks like he got on this room on X day, so he's been here since then" when really he was in a different room originally for a day

       For room service in most places, if you say it's for 2 ppl they bring you a little cart that you can use as a table, and if you say it's for 1, you get a tray.  I'm not saying there wasn't a second person with him, but I'm just pointing out that there are other conclusions to which you could jump.

       Yep, sry, I guess I glossed over that clause in the sentence.  Personally I'm more interested in the Saudi VIPs upstairs who supposedly were extracted.  I haven't seen confirmation of that fact, but they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       own the hotel, so it's not implausible.

       A couple things that make me skeptical of these receipts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have only seen screenshots of a Facebook post.  I searched to find the original post, and couldn’t find the actual post or even a profile that matched the name and profile picture.  To me, that makes me feel like it could be doctored.  If someone has located the original post from user (not the screenshot of a post), that would help a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there was article posted yesterday that interviewed people back at some senior community center in Mesquite.  The article said the shooter stopped into the cafeteria on the 27th to get a recipe from cook before he left for Vegas.  That means he likely wasn’t in Vegas earlier than then.

       A quick search on facebook and I found the person. His location is LV too. I can't locate the original post, it may have been deleted for obvious reasons.

       I did same search of name on the day the receipts were released.  The receipts weren’t there then either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the profile picture on screenshot didn’t match that persons actual profile pic then.  Lastly, the person on facebook only speaks in Spanish on his profile.   The screenshot were in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying you’re wrong, just for me the receipts have too many questions for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for valet, this post is first I’m hearing about it.  If true, I think this is more convincing than the receipts.  Do you know where this was posted?

       Thanks I’m checking it out.  One thing I am wondering is what would be the benefit of giving us false information on check in date.  Do you think the authorities just got it wrong, or that they are hiding his check in date for some reason.   If they are hiding real check in date, it seems like a weird thing to lie about.

       Yeah I don't know. I guess I'd like to figure out who gave that official thursday 9/28 check in date. If it was the FBI then it's weird. If it was just flawed/lazy journalism, that's less weird.

       It was definitely the authority’s that gave the 9/28 date, because I heard it during their live press conference.   It sounds like he was known to people in Vegas since he was there so often.  I’m waiting for some of those people to confirm they saw him earlier than the 28th.
