       EDIT: Why would Steven stop shooting at all? I mean, he'd set up cameras (supposedly) and had already shot the guard (allegedly) so are we supposed to believe he decided to just give up and an hero?
      </p>
      <p>
       We really need to establish a timeline of events. Specifically, when the guard found his room, when he radioed it in and how long after this point the SWAT team turned up. I've also read that he refused to leave afterwards. "Despite being injured Mr Campus radioed in where the shooter was. He then refused to leave before evacuating guests from rooms on the same floor." Maybe he wanted to make sure the scene was secured and he'd not left anything behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you listen to the police scanner before they breach it sounds like no shots are being fired at them.

       He took a selfie in the hallway which I find to be odd too. Why would Law Enforcement allow him to clear rooms unarmed? If he was shot in the leg why wouldn’t he immediately seek medical attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either he’s part of the plan or the media is being fed/feeding us inaccurate information.

       Right, half the body is left out of the picture. Then a head shot is leaked. I’ve read, Paddock was stabbed, executed, and committed suicide. Not sure which is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the windows would be nice to see and pictures of the other room. However I think someone is in on it and trying to unravel it. Why would the pics be leaked, as well as only give us enough to stir up conspiracies?

       proves he was dead either before or sometime during the shooting. He was most certainly not "dead" after the shooting stopped.

       Some people just want to be hero’s I guess. But he supposedly didn’t know where shots were coming from. So if her was coming down the hallway, paddock could have seen him on the webcam he rigged, supposedly shot 200rounds through the door. I’m guessing 1 of them got the guard.

       Their failure to put him in the spotlight with visiting Trump over the past few days makes me think no. They are guiding/hiding him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Jesus is seeming to want to be secret, private. That is interesting because apparently he just helped to stop a mass shooting in progress. He could be on every news station right now making bank for being a 'hero' . Very bizarre. But I can't see any hints of them wanting to use him in the news just yet to push some agenda.

       We didn't learn about the security guard from the Media.  The first time he was mentioned was on the police scanner.  The First Responders came up to the 32nd floor and found him and announced it over the police scanners.  So this "Security Guard" was up on the 32nd long before First Responders ..long enough to get shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe this ties in with the other video that shows two single handgun shots. One of either Paddock killing himself, or the security guard killing Paddock ..and the second is the security guard with a self inflicted gun shot wound to pretend to be an innocent.  Right now that is the only story that makes sense to me.

       Two strange things. Only recent pic of Paddock is him 'taking a Shot'
      </p>
      <p>
       And the last guy to see him was named Jesus Campos. Or Jesus 'Country.' Sounds like a fabricated 'Savior'.

       Plus with all the crisis actors. Fuck an A this shit is bizarre.

       From video in front of the Mandalay we heard two single shots spaced about ten seconds apart. Then no more shots afterward.  We have that audio , but we can really onlyspeculate on what happened in those final moments of the shooting.

       No one can shoot themselves in the mouth twice 10 seconds apart.  The second shot has to be this "Jesus Campos" guy shooting himself to appear a victim.  Only thing that currently makes any sense.

       It makes sense, a few stories do. Even the one that says paddock shot the Guard then shot himself. That makes some sense. But then again, we are also hearing paddock sprayed two hundred bullets down the hallway. So that completely skews the video of the two shots,  that he was shot once in a standoff with paddock.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of a timeline from the Fed's by now is really making this seem even more bizarre. Usually we get a nice little gov opted cartoon timeline of an event by now on the front page of USA today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far there is smoke and mirrors sans the cartoon.

       Go look at the death photo of Stephen. He was shot in the chest, and the mouth. If there wasn't anyone else in that room with him, and he did commit suicide, he likely shot himself in the chest (likely trying to hit his heart) but survived the first gunshot, realizing he wasn't dead, put the gun in his mouth, then made sure he was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I find it pretty hard to believe that a 64 year old man, (who by the account of his brother from that interview, had cancer and was given 6 months left to live) would have enough strength after getting shot in the chest to the pick the gun back up and shoot himself in the mouth.

       The photo is 100% absolute proof he was dead at some point either before or during the shooting. He did NOT kill himself AFTER the shooting stopped. /pol/ did ok analyzing the photo except for one thing (providing they didn't alter it...)
      </p>

       what's wrong with this picture that proves he was dead before the shooting ended...or even before it began.

       Yeah I get the bullets over the blood thing, but I'm not convinced. There isn't enough blood to cover the bullets, the blood would have been seeping through the carpet, and coagulating around the bullets. The blood spatter following the gun has more indication it was a suicide.

       The jacket closest to his head his shiny clean. It should be covered in blood and it's not. HAD the jacket been laying there when he "killed" himself it would have had the same blood on it that is everywhere else around him....swimming in a puddle versus laying on TOP of it...the other casing is clean too.

       The story with security guard just sounds like utter BS, you come up to the room hearing gun shots galore, the door is propped open, you are unarmed and going to check on whats going on? 200 shots ring thru the door at you and you're only shot in the leg once, a non fatal wound at that, something stinks about all of it.

       I am having trouble with the fact 200 rounds went down that hallway. It makes sense neither tactically nor is there any audio that correlates.

       Maybe those cameras were meant to catch the people coming for him. If that's the case, the footage would have to disappear.
