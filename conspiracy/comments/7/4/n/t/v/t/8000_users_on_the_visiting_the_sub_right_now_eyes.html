    <div class="md"><p>I asked on FB why nobody is talking about Vegas. I can&#39;t believe none of my friends mentioned something since we all love music festivals. This hit incredibly close to home for me and I would expect the same from my friends. I think FB is actively hiding any mention of Las Vegas so people don&#39;t talk about it. So basically I can&#39;t tell if people are asking questions and as it looks right now nobody is. Not even me. They&#39;re taking our voice away. </p>

<p>How do I come to that conclusion? </p>

<p>Well, I strongly believe that most terror events are state terror as amateurs lack the resources in general. That&#39;s my baseline underlined by the history of these events.</p>

<p>If you look at Las Vegas you see so many inconsistency with no satisfying answers with massive shilling trying to guide the discussion and MSM instantly presenting who the culprit was and how it happened tells me that the audience is getting played.</p>

<p>P.S. What&#39;s quite interesting about Las Vegas is that they allowed such an inconsistent picture to develop in the first place almost instantly.</p>

<p>This is part of how these performances are carried out. By releasing conflicting stories immediately, it gets people arguing over the &#39;minutiae&#39; while simultaneously accepting the underlying story.</p>

<p>In other words, if Person A believes that the story happened as reported, and Person B believes that the shooter was a patsy, <strong>but they both accept that people were killed</strong>, the central theme of the story is embedded in their minds. The more they argue the small stuff, the more their brains hardwire belief in the major stuff i.e. &#39;people died&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  Hoax and False Flag are definitely separate terms inside the conspiracy community, but outside the community they are very similar.  Similar enough that people would use them interchangeably without knowing.  Think about it.  A Hoax is something not true presented as something true to fool you yes?  So is that not what a false flag is too?  We say these guys attacked our boat, let&#39;s attack them back right?

<p>You can think an event is a false flag and that it actually happened. Technically that&#39;s what a false flag is.</p>

<p>The most famous example is 9/11. People died on 9/11. No question it was &quot;real&quot;. The part that isn&#39;t real is the story, not the event.</p>

<p>Muslims with no prior 767 experience didn&#39;t fly two planes into two buildings and take down 3 of them. But physical aerial objects(planes, jets, whatever) did fly into north tower &amp; south tower which absolutely killed thousands of people. </p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing the idea of a &quot;false flag&quot; with the idea of a &quot;hoax&quot;. If you&#39;re new to all this and just starting to research I can understand why that would be confusing. Just know that what you described in your comment(shooting happened but not the way we&#39;re told) is literally the definition of a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>favorite? shit, that&#39;s a hard one. I&#39;m from the US so I think I started with JFK, that&#39;s a good one. I don&#39;t really go for the giants (earth populated by lizards). things like assassinations of beloved presidents because they wanted to destroy the foundations of the dark state peaks my interest, it actually matters (unlike alien lizards). I have a deep fear and distrust of my government so my favorites (if that&#39;s the word to use) revolve around it. things like 9/11 are more entertaining to dive into, this being the seemingly lack of completion or follow through in the narrative. Smedley Butler&#39;s conspiracy claim was one that drew my attention and seems to me to be one of the very first examples of proof of &quot;behind the curtain&quot; activity so that one always starts my brain rolling. that one is tough too because there just so little available info on it.</p>
