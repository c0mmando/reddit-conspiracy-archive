       I asked on FB why nobody is talking about Vegas. I can't believe none of my friends mentioned something since we all love music festivals. This hit incredibly close to home for me and I would expect the same from my friends. I think FB is actively hiding any mention of Las Vegas so people don't talk about it. So basically I can't tell if people are asking questions and as it looks right now nobody is. Not even me. They're taking our voice away.

       Yes but your voice is offensive and is fake news and we have to protect the public from fake news and offense. Free speech doesn't include hate speech you know! Or speculation about current events! That stuff is dangerous, you might go thinking the wrong thing! Facebook is doing its duty as a gatekeeper of information!! /s

       That's my thought as well. I'm inclined to believe that the sloppiness of this entire situation is causing a mass of people to start questioning what we're being told. And where would you go to find a community of people questioning the official narrative? Here.

       Hopefully we can help wake some people up.

       Yeah but wait, I thought conspiracy theorists are just conspiracy theorists because they like feeling special and like they know something other people don't know? How are we going to maintain special status if we try to tell other people what we know? Then everyone will know and we won't be special anymore!!! It makes no sense, all these conspiracy theorists who want to tell other people the things they know!!!! /s

       It’s why I’m here. The first time I watched video footage and heard the gun shots, it didn’t sound like an automatic rifle. It didn’t sound right.
I came here immediately and started reading. I’m glad I’m not the only one and I’m really glad that people aren’t buying the official story.

       That's why I'm here too.  I can't believe this.  Is it me or does it seem like the "interest" in these mass shooting stories is fading?  It's like people know deep down that its bullshit. The body counts are going up probably because they're not getting the hysteria they thought they would.

       A False Flag can be anything but made under pretence to fool people.
A Hoax has the same motivation but without at least the claimed targets getting harmed, like Sandy Hook. A Hoax doesn't exclude the patsies and their friends to be killed like Boston.

       How do you come to your conclusions regarding whether events like this Las Vegas 'shooting' are 'false flags' or 'hoaxes'?
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, I like to check out what is being discussed at
       <a href="http://fakeologist.com/">
        Fakeologist

       , where they have a track record of scrutinising

       I haven't made my mind yet if Las Vegas was a hoax but I'm convinced it was a false flag operation. That's my current mode of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I come to that conclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I strongly believe that most terror events are state terror as amateurs lack the resources in general. That's my baseline underlined by the history of these events.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at Las Vegas you see so many inconsistency with no satisfying answers with massive shilling trying to guide the discussion and MSM instantly presenting who the culprit was and how it happened tells me that the audience is getting played.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. What's quite interesting about Las Vegas is that they allowed such an inconsistent picture to develop in the first place almost instantly.

       This is part of how these performances are carried out. By releasing conflicting stories immediately, it gets people arguing over the 'minutiae' while simultaneously accepting the underlying story.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, if Person A believes that the story happened as reported, and Person B believes that the shooter was a patsy,
       <strong>
        but they both accept that people were killed
       </strong>
       , the central theme of the story is embedded in their minds. The more they argue the small stuff, the more their brains hardwire belief in the major stuff i.e. 'people died'.

       Not really.  Hoax and False Flag are definitely separate terms inside the conspiracy community, but outside the community they are very similar.  Similar enough that people would use them interchangeably without knowing.  Think about it.  A Hoax is something not true presented as something true to fool you yes?  So is that not what a false flag is too?  We say these guys attacked our boat, let's attack them back right?  We obviously know if it was a hoax the boat wouldn't have been attacked at all or something, but not everyone knows that distinction.

       Those are not used interchangeably.  Those have very specific meanings that are not close to each other.  Hoax and False Flag are pretty much the same for most people.  For people not into conspiracy theories Hoax and False Flag are similar enough to use interchangeably.  In conspiracy communities they are not.  You can call a false flag a hoax and people will know what you mean.  I can't say "let's go over they are and see what there up to" and be correct still.

      <p>
       You can think an event is a false flag and that it actually happened. Technically that's what a false flag is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most famous example is 9/11. People died on 9/11. No question it was "real". The part that isn't real is the story, not the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muslims with no prior 767 experience didn't fly two planes into two buildings and take down 3 of them. But physical aerial objects(planes, jets, whatever) did fly into north tower &amp; south tower which absolutely killed thousands of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're confusing the idea of a "false flag" with the idea of a "hoax". If you're new to all this and just starting to research I can understand why that would be confusing. Just know that what you described in your comment(shooting happened but not the way we're told) is literally the definition of a false flag.

       I'm a visitor myself. Something is too off with this case and the details to NOT feel curious about it. I smell a cover-up and I've never been into the conspiracy side of things. In my opinion, it's easy to unite on this front at the moment. Too many like myself know something isn't adding up like it normally unfolds in these tragedies.

       I'd honestly have to say this, for sure. Then again, I have no idea what theories are out there. I've stayed away from mainstream media AND conspiracy. I'm really quiet when it comes to politics. I'm a longer type of person. I choose to have no friends and only focus on raising my child and working. I have PTSD and panic

       Don't let anyone here bring you down for asking honest questions or bringing logical debate to an issue- that is what conspiracy theorists are all about. Some people with an agenda, or the overly paranoid or bitter may try to talk shit, but ignore them. The first group is unswayable, and the latter two are probably just burnt out from the constant character attacks on "conspiracy nut jobs."

       inb4 comments about how the people claiming to be real people are shills trying to persuade you otherwise. Idk about you, but it's a friday afternoon, and there was just a major mass shooting. Of course activity is going to peak. Not saying there aren't shills, but it's not 100% shills, it can be organic, too, people. Jesus.

       Simple definition is someone who comments to push a certain narrative. For example; we have Liberal shills who push nothing but positive narratives that surround liberals and negative narratives against republicans and Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that shills exist for a lot of reasons. Corporations, social causes and really anything you can think of that needs to convince the masses of its popularity or its oppositions unpopularity.

       favorite? shit, that's a hard one. I'm from the US so I think I started with JFK, that's a good one. I don't really go for the giants (earth populated by lizards). things like assassinations of beloved presidents because they wanted to destroy the foundations of the dark state peaks my interest, it actually matters (unlike alien lizards). I have a deep fear and distrust of my government so my favorites (if that's the word to use) revolve around it. things like 9/11 are more entertaining to dive into, this being the seemingly lack of completion or follow through in the narrative. Smedley Butler's conspiracy claim was one that drew my attention and seems to me to be one of the very first examples of proof of "behind the curtain" activity so that one always starts my brain rolling. that one is tough too because there just so little available info on it.

       The second he refers to a bust as (what did he call it) "a beheaded JFK"? I quickly loose interest. It's a bust. I'm not taking away from the point of the film but trying to reel me in with ridiculous attempts at dramatizing an inanimate object turns me off. 
  Maybe we could move on to the videos about how aliens are actually demons and every space agency has known this from the beginning.

       It has been like this steady since the las vegas event. Oddly it began a day or so before with 10k+ spikes but I suspect since Sunday it's been fairly organic.

       $hills are present but I don't think it's them.  I think LV woke a lot of people.   So, let's be mindful that the uninitiated are among us and let's help them find the they came looking for.

       There are A LOT of people on my Facebook who keep posting theories and conspiracy stuff , saying how things just don't make sense or add p.. more than I've ever seen before. People are actually more open with talking about it , people I didn't even know even believed in conspiracies. Some even really religious individuals.  I've never seen so many posts on my feed about this than anything else before.

       I have lurked for awhile, but I am now here daily multiple times. I know Sandy Hook was a hoax, JFK was a false flag along with OKC and 9/11 but Vegas pushed me right over the edge. I am being called a "nut job" or "kook" just for talking to some people about it. I don't care, my eyes are and have been wide open. I am honestly ALMOST sad for the sheep, almost.
