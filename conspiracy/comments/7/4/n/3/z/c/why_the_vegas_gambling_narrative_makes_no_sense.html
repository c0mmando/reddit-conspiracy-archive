        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a regular in Vegas and fully understand how the comp system works. First, Paddock is not a high roller by any means. Playing $100 a hand is no big deal in Vegas. Getting a comped room and free meals is also no big deal. Any average player can easily get those offers. Here is where the narrative goes wrong: You can&#39;t check into a comp offer at a hotel without the comped guest actually being there. There are no exceptions to this rule. It stops actual high rollers from using suites for their friends and giving the casino zero play when they stay somewhere else. There is absolutely no way Paddock checked in under a reservation for his girlfriend. Second, the news keeps saying how he was a high roller but they also say he was playing on her players card. Anyone that plays high limit will tell you they hate the stupid W2s generated whenever there is a payout more than $1,200. These are very common when playing high limit. There is no way he was playing high limit on his girlfriend&#39;s player card. If he got a handpay while playing on her card, it would not be paid and his membership would be revoked immediately which could include kicking him out of his current comped suite which was supposedly under her name. Also, any decent player has a host/casino marketing executive. You can go right on the Mandalay Bay website and see all the hosts. I&#39;m sure they are being questioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Video poker pays out (when played correctly) at about 97%.  The way you can &quot;make money&quot; playing video poker professionally is when you include the value of hotel comps.  Sure, on average he is &quot;losing&quot; about 3% of what he plays, but if he does it often enough he can live/eat for free in the hotel which can more than make up for that 3% loss.  The hotel/casino doesn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; money either, because there cost for the comps is less than the &quot;value&quot; of what is comped.  So yes, you <em>can</em> make money, or at least a living, playing video poker by offsetting quite a bit of living expenses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like your original argument, making a claim like the OP did without backing it up with anything factual is more damaging to anyone that&#39;s actually putting effort into proving the same thing <strong>with evidence</strong>. </p>

<p>If <em>you</em> are trying to claim something is true, <em>it is on you to support the argument with facts</em>. You aren&#39;t going to convince anyone of anything by just making claims with no basis. I&#39;m not going to go do research when <strong>what you&#39;re saying hasn&#39;t provided any</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point, which you neglected to respond to, is <strong>how to make an argument that convinces someone of something</strong>. This is why the news source can be trusted, because it <em>cites it&#39;s source</em>.</p>

<p>Wanna look dumb like the OP? Do the same thing, make claims, cite nothing. Oh wait, you do that too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why good conspiracy posts get far more attention, like the post about the guy being an advantage player, building a solid argument, having comprehensive knowledge that actually refutes most everything OP claimed here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74mxve/paddock_was_known_as_an_advantage_player_to_local/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74mxve/paddock_was_known_as_an_advantage_player_to_local/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m picky about what&#39;s even worth entertaining, and I&#39;m not going to entertain arguments based on weak or no evidence, and multiple claims all based on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t proved anything you nutter. No one has posted any proof of source, and no, common knowledge isn&#39;t a source. I haven&#39;t lied about shit, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a weak argument, the question of why he was able to check in under someone else&#39;s name at all (which is what people originally argued) is as valid as why was he able to check into a comped room for someone else. Neither dives into possible reasons, they look for anti reasons, when the bottom line is <strong>he was able to check into the room</strong>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anything is going to come out of either argument without people calling the hotel and finding out how it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Or perhaps, the OP of that other Reddit post I just linked to would know, since he lives there, knows the shooter, etc.</p>

<p>But my point remains, he&#39;s got a weak argument that has no supporting evidence for anything they&#39;ve said, everything hinging on the room being comped, which was leaked via an anonymous source that we don&#39;t know the motives of. </p>

<p>People here will scream <em>fake news</em> when they disagree with it, but then base an entire argument on something that actually could be fake news.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know who claims the room is comped, and with a story this big, I can imagine someone releasing false information just to be a part of it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it being comped or not really proves anything. The room wasn&#39;t in his name, yet he was in it. We simply don&#39;t know what hotel policy made it happen. OP would impress me more of be called the hotel and asked questions that actually tell us how it happened.</p>

<p>I was responding to this.  You asked why a rich person would want something for free and my response was that rich people want free shit all the time.</p>

<p>The biggest penny pinchers in this world are rich people and high rollers get and take free rooms all the time.  </p>

<p>So even if you&#39;re rich, why would you want to spend $5000/week on a room when the casino will give it to you for free?</p>

<p>You might think it&#39;s more logical for a rich person to pay for a comped room but I find that logic highly ridiculous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The room was 500 a night. I get rich people are cheap, that&#39;s not really proof of anything. Before the source said it was comped, people argued &quot;how was he able to check into a room under someone else&#39;s name&quot;, and it being comped doesn&#39;t really change the question, or the fact that he was able to.</p>

<p>My point is simply that OP doesn&#39;t have a strong argument. There&#39;s another thread by an actual professional gambler that claims to actually know him, maybe someone should ask that person rather than wild conjecture of people that likely aren&#39;t gamblers and have no idea why he was able to.</p>

<p>No luxury suite in a high end hotel is $500/night.  It ranges from $1000 to $3500 per night.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s proof of anything.  I&#39;m pointing out that even if a person is rich, they&#39;ll still take a comped room where you feel it&#39;s the opposite.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I get it but your argument about a rich person paying for a room instead of getting it free is not a strong argument in itself.  You could be just as wrong as OP.</p>

<p>The title of the same article that says the room is comped, also says it&#39;s $500 a night. Perhaps they are wrong. Gotta say I trust them as a source more than someone throwing out numbers.</p>

<p>And if they are wrong, there goes their credibility about the Anonymous source their claiming says it&#39;s comped.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4600704/las-vegas-attack-pictures-shooter-stephen-paddock-body/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4600704/las-vegas-attack-pictures-shooter-stephen-paddock-body/</a></p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t matter who says what the price is.  Unless we get to see the actual invoice, we&#39;ll never know because a hotel will charge whatever they think they could get that night for a room so the price for that room could be all over the board.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is that you&#39;re so vehemently opposed to the idea that the room was comped but then you link to a story where the story claims the room was comped.  So, with your logic, the Daily Mail is probably wrong about the comped room but is spot on that the room costs $500/night.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very familiar with betting levels of the different way players are tiered. To give you an idea of the top 1%, the Venetian has a secret mansion inside their hotel that is reserved everyday of the year for only 1 player that plays $1 million per hand Baccarat. This is 4x the typical max bet allowed at other properties which means he is likely coming with a credit line over $100 million per stay. MGM also has their mansions, pretty much every decent casino has villas, and most have speciality suites ranked higher than penthouses. The shooter sounds like your typical degenerate gambler with a $20,000-$50,000 bankroll which is surprisingly common in Vegas. </p>

<p>Second, the news keeps saying how he was a high roller but they also say he was playing on her players card. Anyone that plays high limit will tell you they hate the stupid W2s generated whenever there is a payout more than $1,200. These are very common when playing high limit. There is no way he was playing high limit on his girlfriend&#39;s player card. If he got a handpay while playing on her card, it would not be paid and his membership would be revoked immediately which could include kicking him out of his current comped suite which was supposedly under her name</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the reason is what for? I mean everything is digital now so when you &quot;cash out&quot; your chips back to a currency would be hwne a W2 should really formed. If I won $1200 and lost it all I would have no tax to claim.</p>

<p>My mindset is that of bitcoin. I buy $1000 bitcoin and it goes up in value to $4000. I only need to claim a profit on taxes if I cash out to USD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The IRS wants their money. It&#39;s for wins over $1,200 not multiple wins resulting in a $1,200 profit. So if you play a machine and hit a bonus that for over $1,200 then you have to be hand paid by the casino which includes them issuing the W2 and reporting the win to the IRS. No one likes doing it but it makes sure the tax coffers remain filled. If you have losses greater then wins for the year, you can deduct it when you file your taxes. </p>

<p>However, your point still stands. Maybe the mysterious female he was spending time with in the days prior to the shooting used his Gfs ID and looks similar enough? Who knows. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve checked into a comped room under my dad&#39;s name before. I go to the MGM or Mirage (both MGM properties like Mandalay) every year for the Super Bowl, and sometimes arrive before my dad and in that case he phones ahead and lets his host authorize me to check in. I&#39;ve also done it at the Borgata in AC.</p>

<p>The title of the same article that says the room is comped, also says it&#39;s $500 a night. Perhaps they are wrong. Gotta say I trust them as a source more than someone throwing out numbers.</p>

<p>And if they are wrong, there goes their credibility about the Anonymous source their claiming says it&#39;s comped.</p>
