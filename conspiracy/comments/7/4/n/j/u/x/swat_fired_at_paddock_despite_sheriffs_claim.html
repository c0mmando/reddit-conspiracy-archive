       ELI5 Edit:  Sheriff says SWAT didnt fire during breach, officer says they did during radio call in.  Officer immediately told to switch to a different channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stumbled on this at the end of my other thread, about the second door breach, and thought this was big enough to deserve its own thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff states SWAT did not fire during the breach, and the gunman was self inflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zebra-20, the police officer callsign reporting on the SWAT raid, gives the following, roughly transcribed call after the breach was over.  Emphasis added by me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We don't need anybody else up on this floor, break. This floor is clear, it has cleared by swat team with two breaches, WE DID HAVE ONE SWAT OFFICER THAT DID FIRE, we have negative injuries on anybody else. We have multiple firearms up here, from where they were shooting out of, but we just have one suspect down at this time."
      </p>
      <p>
       He then gets called over to the SWAT 1 channel, to get him off the public channel. Thats the last we hear of zebra-20. Time linked video below.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Its very interesting to hear a direct report that SWAT fired during the breach, but the official story says otherwise.  The officer also says "where they were shooting" but that could just be his assumption that there were two shooters, without having any evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 1: Here is the timstamped video of the direct question "did the officers fire back at all" and the Sheriff, twice, says pointedly "no"

      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: 
I'm also confused about the 200 shots through the door theory.  The visible part of the door in the hallway certainly didnt look like 200 shots had been fired through it.  The sheriff stated that clearly visible gun (because the door is blown off its hinges) was initially seen by police because they could see through the massive hole blown int he door.  Something isn't adding up here.  Photo of the door with bullet holes :

       It's more bullshit to lead you off the trail. It doesn't matter if they fired at him or not, it DOESN'T MATTER!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Would anyone care if they burst through the door and shot off 1000 rounds during an active shooter? of course not, so why are we making it an issue here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether they burst through the door shooting, whether they put a round in the top of his head as he lay dead on the floor to make sure he wasn't going to suicide vest them or pop up and start blasting, none of it matters, it has nothing to do with the real questions.

       How do we know it was a lie and not a mistake? again, what does it matter if they shot him or he shot himself? none of that helps us understand the motive and who might have been involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think stupid angles like this distract from more important details, why waste time on something so useless to the investigation? Maybe the SWAT guy was nervous and fired of a round as they went in, have you ever stormed a room where there could be who know how many shooters with who knows what kind of weapons and who knows what else to kill you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The SWAT guys aren't the problem, they did their job as they were told.

       How in anyway is that useless? If they shot him instead of Paddock killing himself that means that there was a window of ~55 minutes or where Paddock was in the room with ample ammunition to continue his rampage or attempt an escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he didn't kill himself:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Why would he not continue shooting?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why would he not attempt an escape?
       </li>
       <li>
        What was he doing for that window of time before SWAT arrived?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why would they lie that Paddock killed himself if he didn't?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with focusing on little details to help carve out a bigger picture for the more important details.

       Have you shot before? seems he did it without ear protection of any kind, he was also old and weak. He probably was def from all the bullets and in pain from violent recoil, which explains the long pauses between bursts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was in good shape and used protection, he could have gone rifle to rifle in seconds, but he didn't, because using those weapons like that will really fuck you up if you aren't prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't attempt escape for any number of reasons, his conspirators fucked him and left him as the lone target, or he realized his idea of escape was silly and that he was trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as what he did for XX amount of minutes, first of all, the two shots happen shortly after the rapid fire ends, so likely it was only minutes before he tried to kill himself, or otherwise he was sitting there contemplating all that happened and what the options were, was he going to fight it out with police for as long as he could? or was he going to just off himself?

       I've shot 20,000 rounds at a minimum, bump stock creates what I would refer to as recoil, especially an an old man with weak arms and joints.

       No.  It's not.  .223 Remington is literally the smallest rifle cartridge in general use.  It has the lowest recoil of just about any widely available rifle cartridge there is.

       lol wut?  .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO are almost identical.  So much so that generally they are interchangeable.

       And it does not have lots of "energy deposit".  Enough to kill, certainly, but little compared to other rifle cartridges.

       I agree, but he didnt just shoot 200 rounds.  They in fact breached the main door to see if the suspect was even still inside that room.  They thought he could have escaped, thats how long it had been since they heard movement.

       Exactly police are trained to shoot then give aid. You shoot to stop the threat but then you have to render aid. Its silly, but that's how it works for police. Military and foreign countries are way different story. Cannot compare them.

       I’m sure they just knock on the door after he lets off 200 rounds at them during a  terrorist attack  and make a decision in 0.001 of a second that he committed suicide and wasn’t injured with a suicide  vest  on , in Texas mass shooting they sent in a robot with a bomb to make sure he didn’t have suicide vest on after he was down , during events like this they don’t risk cops lives

       I’m sure the just knock on the door of a terrorist that just shot 200 rounds at them , and make a split second decision that he committed suicide and was not injured and waiting for them with a suicide   vest on , shit in Texas they sent in a robot with a bomb to make sure he didn’t have explosives vest on , in extreme events like this they don’t risk police lives

       Early on in the Iraq war there was a big deal about a Marine who was on video putting a round into a person who was most likely dead as they went through a building. It was because they were doing exactly that - pretending to be dead and pulling pins on grenades when they got dead checked. It's not out of the realm of possibility.

       their story is the gunman fired in excess of 200 rounds through the door at the security guard who was in the hallway.  I didn't see any spent shell casings in the hallway.  Do you have photos that show that?

       Wasn't their story that he was dead when they went in? Also, no I saw no casings in the hallway photo. It just looked like entry points all over the door which was broken in half. Perhaps I'm mistaken. The only place I saw casings or shells was above his head, on top of his brain goop, opposite the broken window. I'm to believe they flew 15 feet from the window while he was shooting and then repelled blood as it coagulated underneath them? Honest questions. So much of this baffles the shit out of me.

       If he fired through the door, the casings would be in the room still. The casing doesn’t fly with the round, it’s ejected usually to the right of the shooter, so if all the rounds were fired out of the room into the hallway then the casings would be in the room still.

       Also, the morning after the incident, I specifically recall multiple MSM outlets reporting that LEO had breached the room and killed Paddock. Now they saw it was suicide

       Nothing strange.  It's the SWAT supervisor down at the staging area asking Z20 to come up on SWAT 1 channel.  They probably wanted to be updated with sensitive, investigative type info that they dont want to public to misconstrue.  Nothing strange, just standard procedure.

       The officer.  He seemed so tense, this could have been because of speaking to a crowd while being recorded, but I think there's another element to it. His body language/tone could be saying he's hiding something. Is the one in the grey suit his handler or..?

       The one in the grey suit I believe is hidden behind him as he whispers ,"don't go there" when someone in the crowd asked about the shooter's car. 
Which is also funny because we found that the shooter was checked into the hotel on Sept. 25th, which is earlier than what the FBI has stated.
Nothing is beginning to add up.

       heard that theory but havent seen any evidence on it, there have been multiple angles showing the sheriff, I think we would have seen it.  Also, if the ear piece was loud enough to be picked up in the mic, we would hear other traces.  Still not sure whey everyone on stage reacted and looked to their right

       FBI agent in the grey I believe.  Granted, most sheriff's are lawmen, not PR men.  Many people don't like being in the limelight, esp during such a tense situation as this.  I would look more into what he says than how he says it, personally.

       Lets say "the 200 or so rounds fired from Paddock into the hall" were actually the swat firing inward. If the swat said "fuck protocols, we gotta stop this guy" would it tactically make sense for them to spray through the door possibly using thermal imaging through the wall or any other reason?

       Exactly. And I don't even think 200 shots can be heard total. Let alone near the end through the door. Correct me if there is recording of more shooting please.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly feel like a man with 20ish fully loaded 30rd clip weapons with loaded backup clips could have easily done WAY more damage.  And put WAY more bullets down range. None of this shit adds up.

       If his objective was to kill whoever was on the other side of the DOUBLE doors and he fired an excess of 200 rounds, wouldn't there be bullet holes on both doors?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it possible that the cop was only shot once out of those 200 rounds?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at where he was apparently shooting from, and where the entrance is located, he'd have to go out of his way to fire those 200 rounds, come back to his original spot and then shoot himself?

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCB-8cFRcCY

       Was he planning on continuing the shooting spree on the concert goers, after he unloaded the 200 rounds?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the scanner, the cop says that he has a female that was shot in the mouth???

       It's just a peculiar place to put a gun you don't need anymore in the heat of a massacre. Plus when you consider the odd placement of the other ones. I'm not insinuating anything, just observing. Most people place guns facing upwards against a wall or laying down flat from experience

       I'd have thought that if he's making his last stand, shooting through the door at the authorities, he knows he's not making it out of that room alive. Why would he place a gun down on its stand like that? Surely he'd just toss it down and grab another? Or chuck it out the window?

       I don't know when the photo was taken.  Is it normal to leave guns laying around at the crime scene?  I assumed it was a crime scene photo.  I'm pretty sure they didn't just leave the yellow tape up and call it good either.  I'm more convinced this is all Hollywood bullshit.

       He made is close enough to see the door was ajar right? I don't see any bullet holes in the walls... only in the door. As if he's was standing in front of it.

       No, you're missing the point. The door being ajar was only mentioned once, it's likely whoever broke that story got something wrong because pretty much anyone other story about the security guard talks about how he was sent to the floor specifically then walked up the hall and was shot before he got to the door.

       I didn't hear that part in the press conference. Interesting. All I know is the security company rep the guard worked for said he was shot while walking down the hall, not that he ever saw the door ajar. But most stories about the guard I've seen are generally inconsistent and odd. But the guard has a hispanic name and hasn't given any interviews. The only things he's quoted as saying are "i was just doing my job" and "fine" when asked how he was. I assume he doesn't speak good English and either things are messed up in translation or people are putting words in his mouth.

       Watch the conference. His door was not baracaded, but the stairway door was to the floor. But they didn't advice how.... it was not welded which was confirmed by the sheriff. What's the purpose of a baracaded stairwell... 32ed floor? Even swat officers took the elevator, that's how they ran into security.

       those explosives are meant to breach a door, destroy the lock, why do you expect that it looks like a grenade went off?

       lol I wasn't expecting to see a door completely obliterated, but I was definitely expecting something more like a dent where they placed the explosives, or maybe the deadbolt damaged/destroyed, or a hole near the handle/key card lock (not sure what they're called).

       I've stayed in a suite at Mandalay Bay.  The door in the pic is likely the one off the main hall.  Once you go in, there is a common area with couches that are next to the windows, maybe a mini bar as well.  To either side of the common area is a bedroom, each with its own door and much like a standard hotel room.  Again with windows all along one side.  I bet the breached doors are the interior doors to each room.

       this suite had one bedroom, and a seperate hotel room that connects via adjoining doors.  They breached the main double doors from the hallway into 32135 suite, and the door between the adjoining rooom 32135 inside the suite.

       also if you listen to the first breach, the second after you hear the "charge" go off he comes immediately back on to tell dispatch the suspect is down.  If you look at the layout of the room and where the body was lying he would have not been able to confirm this so quickly in my opinion

       Well, that's just false. It's almost three minutes from the explosion until he radios back and says there's one suspect down, which is more than enough time to for a team to clear the room and check the body.

       I'm pretty sure the cops killed him. My dad was in Vegas at the time. He is high up in the LAFD and was staying at the Orleans because there was a convention for firemen and police from all around. That's kinda interesting in itself that there was probably more emergency servicemen in Las Vegas than any other city. My dad was saying he talked to swat people and police from different parts of the country and they all said the had to of killed him.

       Well I do know that it takes time to get together they aren't just like ready to go. Then they need to be briefed. Then they have to somehow make it through the strip up 34 floors. I could see it taking 30-45 minutes to mobilize and actually get there. What I don't get is during that entire hour why wouldn't he just go the stairwell run upstairs to the four seasons or even down stairs and start screaming about someone shooting by him and get away.

       I don't know, but I know the door jambs are steel and that would be a solid core door.  There like zero damage to either edge of the door.  Its not like a flimsy little wood jamb on a residential house.  You would need to blow the fuck out of it to knock it off it's hinges. I don't see any damage on the other door around where the lock-set is either so it's not like they just shot the other lock off.

       Why is the door placed that way... No way it "blew off" then felt behind the other door in a fashion seen in the photos.... In a crime scene like this, EVERYTHING should be left exactly how it is to preserve the investigation.... so many things not adding up.

       The proofing is for storage and I think those are the shooters rounds not necessarily from the zebra team. If this guy bought mil spec rounds they were likely treated to be water resistant.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the different blood pools - the first one that is dried up was likely the first wound from the back of the head. The second is post mortem pooling from his mouth. You can see the trails from over the right eye and left cheek.

       Also, we can only see what I am assuming is the bottom half of the door, which has a dozen give or take holes in it, perhaps the upper half has many more? Still doesnt explain why those shots arent accounted for in any audio ive heard so far.

       The first reports from hours the sheriff said they were unsure of if he was killed by an officer. I don't remember reading about the suicide untill later.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer simply said 1 member fired. That doesn't mean he hit anyone and could explain why it took hours to say is he was already dead when they entered. Because shots were reported they would have to wait for AARs and debriefs before confirming if the shots fired were the fatal ones.

       Room clearing is intense. Could have been nerves and bad trigger discipline  (a negligent discharge) or got spokes by a jacket hanging on a wall.

       The one in the grey suit I believe is hidden behind him as he whispers ,"don't go there" when someone in the crowd asked about the shooter's car. 
Which is also funny because we found that the shooter was checked into the hotel on Sept. 25th, which is earlier than what the FBI has stated.
Nothing is beginning to add up.

       FBI agent in the grey I believe.  Granted, most sheriff's are lawmen, not PR men.  Many people don't like being in the limelight, esp during such a tense situation as this.  I would look more into what he says than how he says it, personally.
