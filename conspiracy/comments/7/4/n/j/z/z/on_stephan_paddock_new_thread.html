       First, the "chest wound" is not a chest wound, when he shot himself he had his head down and when he fired there was blood splatter down under his chin on his shirt. The gun is where it is because the police kicked it away, standard practice even if the perpetrator is already dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "13 tattoo" on his neck. It is just a shadow and skin wattle. There is no tattoo.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no evidence of a second shooter. The Bellagio video claims that someone shot into the building, shattering glass. If that were true someone would have been able to confirm that by now via picture or video. Also the theory of another shooter at Mandalay Bay, someone would have been able to verify that windows were broken out on a different floor by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claiming that the video with all the bodies proves it was fake because there's no obvious wounds and the blood color is wrong. Having been shot myself in my shoulder and been around people who have been shot, I can tell you entry wound are small, exit wounds are bigger but from that distance there may not have been any exit wounds. As for the blood color, it is absolutely a vivid red color like that and especially when it pools and coagulates. Dried blood is more of a rust color. If you've never seen a large amount of blood please don't muddy the waters by claiming it looks fake. It does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were people standing around non chalant during the shooting? From the videos you can hear people blaming the noise on fireworks, electrical noise, one guy even claimed someone had hooked into the sound system and was playing a prank. Point being that a lot of them didn't believe it was really happening. There were 22,000 people there, the videos show just a few not reacting, really just a small fraction of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claiming there's no video showing people actually being shot. It isn't like the movies, there's no dramatic fall and blood flying into the air. You can be shot and not even feel it, you'll just keep running. I'm sure people are getting hit in some of those videos but you wouldn't be able to make it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe he had help, but we have to dig deeper and stop propagating this bullshit narrative about the neck tattoo and about fake blood, and about a supposed chest wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I miss anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       The note has now been said to contain numbers on it. What could these numbers be?
      </p>
      <p>
       From u/SpinPHD480
      </p>
      <p>
       The light flashing on the 4th floor during the shooting is not a second gunman. The light can be seen blinking before and after the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photos that look like other windows are out at the Mandalay Bay are not blown out windows. They are from the back side of Mandalay Bay and can be seen in any picture taken of Mandalay Bay before the shooting, including google street view. I believe they are vents.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Txroadwarrior mentioned the note. The current narrative on the note claim it is NOT a suicide note. So what is it? Any theories on that? Could be something innocuous, or it could be a warning or a very short manifesto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, follow his thread for evidence there MAY have been multiple active shooters that night. Read the comments, watch the videos, decide for yourself. Personally I don't believe that there were any other shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/sanity98 mentions this possibility :
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it might be prudent to add this thought about confusion about the audio of the gunfire and crowd reaction.  It is possible that the microphones were left hot on stage and very possible that loud bullet shots/supersonic cracks passing would be caught/played through the PA.  This could be a source of why some said that it's coming from the PA/Sound System and may also explain random echoes.  No one seems to have pointed this out and just wanted to offer a possible explanation.  I guess this could be tested and would depend on if the sound guy decided to cut the mics before taking cover.  What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       u/sanity98 and u/primerush both brought up the fact that some news sources have mentioned he may have targeted jet fuel tanks at the airport. Possibly to cause a distraction to escape? Any thoughts on that?
      </p>
      <p>
       u/looshfarmer provided me with this picture which may or may not be relevant. You decide.

       u/akalldayerday has provided us with this photo that purportedly shows the hallway outside the front door to the shooters room.

       No dry wall on floor. No lights out. No noticeable holes. No shots in the hall way.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think that is the hallway outside hit room but that is just my opinion, draw your own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/bannana put it pretty well saying this :
      </p>
      <p>
       people are usually dead wrong about shootings because they have zero experience with them it's very common to have multiple reports of different shooters. gunshots echo in a city setting, they can echo a few times and when people are freaked out they aren't thinking clearly, in addition they are highly suggestible in that phase so one person says 'multiple shooters' the ones that hear it repeat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/akalldayerday provided this extremely thorough article that is well worth the read.

       User u/sllme has this to add :
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a video I saw posted on Instagram. 
The video was taken prior to the shooting. The video pans over to the Mandalay Bay hotel and does show that flashing light.
      </p>
      <p>

        Video of flashing light towards end of video
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also a new video yesterday which was about 10 minutes long. In the video there is a man who has a gunshot wound to his forearm.

       u/saulgould917  has provided me with
       <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/las-vegas-shooting-queensland-eyewitness-to-mandalay-attack/news-story/17c907f4046f30ccfedf831e27e93cc8">
        this link to a "courier mail" article where several people mention multiple shooters.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I will mention that I do not trust this news source and the article mentions dead security guards and one claims to have had the room next to the shooters, I've seen interviews with a country singer who's son was with the babysitter in the adjacent room. So what is the truth? You decide for yourself. What do you believe?
      </p>
      <p>
       u/owlyourbasebelong2us has supplied me with two 4chan archived threads with an anon claiming a much larger plan was averted. Read and decide for yourself.

       Are you asking me to withdraw the compliment? As an aside, what do you have regarding the woman, said to have been his girlfriend, telling someone they were all going to die that night - and then the story coming out that she wasn't even in the country at the time?

       Just so I can feel useful here; the blood in the arteries is very rich in oxygen and when the haemaglobin in that blood is exposed to the oxygen in the air, it forms oxyhaemoglobin - which is bright vivid red. So when you see that bright red blood, it doesnt mean its fake, but more likely the blood is coming from a severed artery. 
Alternatively, blood moving in the veins is rich in carbon dioxide, which when combined with haemoglobin forms carbaminohaemoglobin which appears as that darker or rusty red color you sometimes see.
Source: I'm an embalmer - extensive training on human body/circulatory system/blood etc. Take all info with grain of salt and mix well.

       I'm still wondering if the women who supposedly was warming people or perhaps threatening people they were going to die- what was her purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       In a slightly fantastical world you could say this was a targeted assassination concealed as a mass shooting. The woman could have served as a target ID, as identifying a target in a sea of 22k people may be difficult. Once she identifies the target in the crowd the shooter is able to track the target.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel like this is the case. Just thinking about potential scenarios.

       I'd chalk up that threat to being more coincidence than anything else. A drunk crazy person (there's tons of them in vegas) overreacting to maybe being told to leave or calm down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the shooter was using assault rifles from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay which is pretty far from the concert site. If it was a specific target why wouldn't he use a sniper?

       I believe that was an estimate. I any case if we want to be conservative and say he had 20...hell, let's say he had 5. That's still an unreasonable amount if he's looking to pick off one person.

       Thank you for this sensibility. Some people take things a little too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we don't like to accept the fact that some things don't happen for a particular reason. We forget that we are looking back on this event in hindsight so we place value on certain things happening or small seemingly insignificant details in order to string together a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there a SWAT team in the Tropicana that night? Maybe in the chaos there were false reports of shooters at other hotels leading to the SWAT team and LVPD raiding other hotels. Maybe there was no real reason after all why they did these additional raids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did a lady allegedly say "everyone is going to die tonight" before the events unfolded? Maybe she was just a drunk crazy person who didn't have a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Stephen Paddock shoot up this concert? Maybe he had an agenda. Maybe he had mental issues that finally got the best of him. Maybe he didn't have a particular reason. We forget some people can be irrational.
      </p>

       I know it isn't in the spirit of this sub to post something like this and I think it's important to look at all scenarios but I think it's also important to weight these scenarios based on likelihood, not what sounds the craziest.

       My theory? Stephen Paddock was a person that may have been smart and may have been somewhat wealthy, but he had his own mental issues that he had succumbed to somewhere around October 2016 when he started stockpiling weapons. The fact that he had cameras set up around the suite, a car set to explode, and had tried to blow fuel tanks near the property, tells me that this shooting was part of a more comprehensive plan of destruction. However, the fact that he had so many weapons for one person, the fact that none of the cameras were apparently recording, and the fact that his attempt to shoot the fuel tank (logically) failed tells me that while he spent a lot of time and effort meticulously plotting this event, there was still an element of irrationality/outright bizareness that may suggest he wasn't thinking very clearly. The fact that he had scouted out other locations (the life is bright concert the weekend before in Vegas, Lollapalooza in Chicago) tells me that he didn't even really have a particular agenda towards any particular group of people or location, providing another layer of irrationality.
