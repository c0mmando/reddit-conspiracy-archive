    <div class="md"><p>whenever they bring up what they think &quot;the people&quot; may or may not need, we simply assert the fact that the M-16 is the time-tested and approved weapon of choice for the so-called &quot;Department of Defense&quot;, and therefore it should be the standard-issue weapon to every American, as a means of defending themselves. </p>

<p>of course the statists will argue that its an offensive weapon, </p>

<p>and then we ask why the Department of &quot;Defense&quot; has offensive weapons, and proceed whether the constitution permits a standing army, and whether the constitution permits that army to keep and bear any arms any more technically advanced then what was available to the British military had in 1789</p>

<p>the statists can&#39;t have it both ways</p>

<p>they can&#39;t pretend that our public servants &quot;need&quot; weapons to protect the people, while at the same time denying &quot;the people&quot; their right to keep and bear those very same arms, for the very same reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you are trying to frame the debate in a disingenuous manner (of course).  Americans have the right to bear arms.  That right shall not be infringed.  Placing regulations upon what type of weapons is infringement.  We are actually allowed to own tanks.  Some people do.</p>

<p>Now, the reason that the US has remained a democracy (It&#39;s not actually a pure democracy, but we will use your terms) is because the people have power.  One aspect of that power is that we have the ability to defend our rights, such as the right to vote.  That ability to defend our rights is a direct result of the fact that we can be armed.  If the Second Amendment had never existed, I guarantee you we wouldn&#39;t be living in a democracy today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain in what way am I being disingenuous?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s disingenuous to say the US&#39;s democracy is maintained by the right to bear arms. Given that no other democratic western country has such a right and they are all sustaining their democracy perfectly fine.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t guarantee anything because nothing of the sort has ever happened. There is little to no correlation between gun ownership and democracy. Point out one instance post World War I where America&#39;s democracy was secured only because of armed citizenry. The dynamics of war has completely changed from when the second amendment was made, it&#39;s hopelessly outdated and bares no reflection of modern reality.</p>

<p>thats precisely the point of the 2nd Amendment, probably inspired by the recent American Revolution</p>

<p>if you want to split hairs, </p>

<p>i can show you where the Constitution it specifically forbids the infringement of the peoples right to keep and bear arms</p>

<p>but i <em>can&#39;t</em> show you where the Constitution specifically says that the government can keep a standing army indefinitely, </p>

<p>which is also against the 3rd Amendment which prohibits the government from forcing the people to house soldiers.  </p>

<p>in other words, the people have the right to keep and bear arms,</p>

<p>and the government does not</p>

<p>ISIS is a proxy, much like AQ, owned and operated by Mossad and the CIA. probably not the best example to illustrate your point </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its funny that you mention drones. </p>

<p>do you think that its legal, moral, and/or ethical for the US government to keep a drone strikes hit list?</p>

<p>did you know that John Brennan gave a lengthy speech on the conditions under which a person would be put on a drone strike hit list?</p>

<p>basically, Brennan said person would be added to list for 2 reasons </p>

<p>1) its <em>not</em> for retaliation for something that the person has actually done, but rather its pre-emptive based on something that the US government thinks that person <em>might</em> do in the future </p>

<p>2) the person is an imminent threat to the National Security of the United States, and it would not be practical for the government to officially apprehend the person</p>

<p>also, Obama moved the place where they sit and decide who gets put on the drone strike hit list closer to the White House, so as to reduce his commute time </p>

<p>also, Obama put so many people on the drone strike hit list that at the current rate of killing it will still take 10 years after Obama has left office to finish off every name on the list, presuming Trump doesn&#39;t add more names to the list</p>

<p>so, knowing all that, do you really think the US government has any legal, ethical or moral authority to have a drone strike hit list?</p>

<p>to extra-judiciously execute anyone, anywhere, at any time, regardless and in spite of national borders?</p>

<p>do you really want Trump to have this kind of power? </p>

<p>who do you think Trump might put on his shit list? </p>

<p>if you are opposed to the escalation of arms, as i hope you are, then i hope you speak out on the disarming of the government, police, army etc </p>

<p>because whatever kinds of new-fangled high-tech weaponry that the US government claims is legitimate and necessary for them to use to defend the people, </p>

<p>the actual people that they are ostensibly defending will always have an even more legitimate and necessary for those new-fangled high-tech weapons.</p>

<p>this is the nature of an arms race</p>

<p>it plays out like this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disarming the military is a quick way to get yourself invaded. Arming all the citizens is a quick way to another civil war. Before WWI the guns were a violent analogue to democracy, if you could get numbers on your side you could impose the majority will be force ala the civil war.</p>

<p>Post WWI and in the modern era this is no longer true. Unrestricted access to weapons allows the extreme rich to afford weapons that could wipe out tens of thousands. Then the elite can impose their will by force if just a few of them could band together. No number of coal miners with M16s can defeat a mining magnate with a couple of Abrams tank. The wealth inequality would translate directly to a power inequality.</p>

<p>did you know that the US military spends more on war than the rest of the world combined?</p>

<p>did you know that the US military has over 1000 bases around the world, and has been at war for most of its existence, usually outside to its own borders?</p>

<p>did you know that on 09/10/2001 Donald Rumsfeld admitted the Pentagon could not account for $2.3 Trillion? and that number has grown larger ever since, and in fact is the single biggest contributor to the National Debt? </p>

<p>did you know that the taxpayers have not yet  paid off the debt incurred to fight WW1? that this debt will be handed down to your grandchildren&#39;s grandchildren?</p>

<p>did you know that George W Bush and the Republican-controlled House and Senate decided that it would be fiscally conservative to fund a war in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq by giving tax cuts to the rich?</p>

<p>do you think American kids would be fighting in Syria, or Libya, or Somalia? or Yemen? or Korea? or Viet Nam? or...  </p>

<p>... if it wasn&#39;t for government enticement, incitement, deployment and full support? </p>

<p>is this the world you want to live in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What that alt-right guy said? It makes a lot of sense:
“If you are for gun control, then you are not against guns, because the guns will be needed to disarm people. So it’s not that you are anti-gun. You’ll need the police’s guns to take away other people’s guns. So you’re very pro-gun; you just believe that only the Government (which is, of course, so reliable, honest, moral and virtuous…) should be allowed to have guns. There is no such thing as gun control. There is only centralizing gun ownership in the hands of a small political elite and their minions.﻿”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing my point. They&#39;re a small, loosely organized force that uses primarily small arms and cobbled together improvised weaponry. They&#39;re facing us with all the fancy technology you just mentioned. How have things turned out? Are we wiping the floor with them? Is it a decisive one sided victory? No. </p>

<p>Any revolution here would have similar results. It would be the might of the military against improvised local militias conducting small raids on convoys, depots, etc. A long, protracted Afghanistan-esque conflict. And, like in Afghanistan, these militias would be using small arms (the &quot;useless&quot; AR-15). </p>

<p>One could argue that the Afghan conflict has gone so long because our military isn&#39;t built for such combat. Others would argue that it is because of strict ROE (by the way I&#39;m not making any moral arguments here). Any conflict here would HAVE to include both of these negative aspects. Total war on American soil would amount to government forces (whatever loyalists remain) killing their own civilians (which would create more rebels: once again see Afghanistan) and ruining the infrastructure and industry this economy is built on. ROE comes into effect with both these points as well. </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is while the government has a lot of fancy equipment that an AR can&#39;t compete with, it won&#39;t have to compete directly. Small attacks with small arms in multiple locations all over the country , as seen in Afghanistan (and the US is much bigger), would cause enough damage to at minimum prolong a conflict and at best take away logistical support for all the technology. At that point it becomes a war of attrition on much more level playing field</p>

<p>No shit we sell guns.  You&#39;d have to be stupid to not know that America is a major producer and seller of weapons.  Why you feel the need to yell at people as though we don&#39;t know this, considering you&#39;re doing it on Reddit on a subreddit that talks about government arms dealings daily, I&#39;ll never know..  Doesn&#39;t matter.  </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right.  No one is taking any guns.  No politician is going to be able to ever pass any law that resembles anything close to taking away your guns, taking away your rights as a sane, healthy human being to have guns, or infringing on your ability to legally purchase a gun.  </p>

<p>What is wanted, is regulation so that crazy fuckheads like yourself can&#39;t get guns, because if shit does go down in the slightest, I&#39;m concerned for everyone around you and that you know.  YOU sound like a danger to society, and you must realize that you ARE the danger to society, should you perceive things to be &quot;going&quot; down.  </p>

<p>Lastly, learn your rights, you fucktard.  You have the right to have a gun, not kill people because your tendies hurt.  You don&#39;t have the right to kill people because you feel the constitution has been infringed on.  that&#39;s not how it works.  And remember, dipshit, you&#39;re on the 4th largest social media platform in the world crying about your first-world problems.  Like it or not, you&#39;re part of the problem, and you always have been. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Second Amendment has been eclipsed by the technical improvement in weapons systems since Colonial time.</p>

<p>Nobody expects to park a tank or a missile launcher in their driveway. Even though that&#39;s what&#39;s required to fight the government, should that ever happen.</p>

<p>Armed standoffs between civilians and the American State almost never end up with the civilians winning.</p>

<p>Further, no actual civilian expects to pack up their gun collection in a duffle bag and fly to the current &quot;borders&quot; of the American Empire to fight any foreign &quot;threat&quot;.</p>

<p>The only remaining argument for private gun ownership is sport, and personal self-defense against fellow civilians, or aliens.</p>

<p>My view is that mass indoctrination through modern media has obviated the necessity for a draconian government to seize our guns. If you are really interested in self-defense at the level of the modern world, learn how to hack power, food, and communication supply grids.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually pretty logical that politicians, bureaucrats and the brainwashed are pro whatever makes you more dependent on government. But, for some reason, this is really hard to understand for most of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... they sell them for <strong>war</strong> so they can kill other people.</p>

<p>Not like they sell them as if they’re totally harmless or safe. They sell them so people can wage war. Do you want them to sell them to us so we can wage war on.... ourselves? Is this <em>really</em> the argument you want to make helping your/the pro-gun argument? </p>

<p>The comparison you’re making is stupid. Sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all well and good to say &quot;gunz er bad&quot;, but we must think about the very real-life consequences of confiscating guns from the population. This is especially true in the US context, which is unique for many reasons in this respect.</p>

<p>Its all well and good for Australians to take some supposed moral high ground for their gun control measures after their Port Arthur massacre, but in a line of thinking, they dont have to be as cautious about the democratic backsliding of their government (however comical this assertion is). They have an certain degree of international guarantees, because the biggest kid on the block is democratic- the US (again, this argument appeals to liberals. Addressing the lack of substantial democracy in the West is another topic, which also justifies popular gun ownership).</p>

<p>When the US completes its inevitable, and indeed impending, plunge into overt despotism, there is no other &quot;democratic&quot; force to save them, reverse the transition or oppose their global fascist cruelty. This is already a fact, but it will become much more pronounced and overt.</p>

<p>The only substantial threat to this is an armed populous. That is the point of the 2nd amendment. Only fear can keep the powers that be in check.</p>

<p>If impotent popular sentiment were enough to stymie the hand of oppression, the appeal of the slave would effectively stall the master. This is an obvious fallacy. </p>

<p>On the US national scale, if this were the case, we wouldnt have mass nonviolent protests put down by overwhelming force, like the constant waves of which we have seen throughout the post war era, in particular since Occupy. To the contrary, the elites have hastened the attacks on these popular forces, and they are increasingly accelerating their frequency and brutality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa dude no need for name calling my point is if they want your guns they&#39;ll get them. IMHO the idea of them going house to house is a pretty stupid idea next to logistically impossible. Why not use any number of  weapons/psyops/famine etc.. at there disposal ?</p>

<p>Yall are getting so upset and for what ? </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy thread and I&#39;m just questioning the narrative that is being put forth.  </p>

<p>Maybe there is a larger conspiracy at work here that will end up in the confiscation of most American firearms but without a smoking gun no pun intended why is everyone so certain that they will go house to house ?</p>
