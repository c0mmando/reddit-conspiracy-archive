    <div class="md"><p>I understand it pretty well, how does it go again?</p>

<p>Oh, god imprisons a man and woman in paradise and then orders them not to eat fruit from a goddamn tree. But then Satan, the eternal rebel and hero, liberates man and woman from their prison. God gets pissed and never gets over it. Later he decides to impregnate a woman with himself so that he can be born and once alive he decides to get himself killed as a sacrifice to himself to save man and woman from the original act of eating a fucking fruit that he got so pissed about to begin with. God decided this should all happen after he let dinosaurs roam the earth for a few million years. Makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>The End
TheZerubbabelâ€¢ 3d
I appreciate all the prayers, but...I&#39;m sorry Jesus is not my savior. There is only one savior. And he commanded us not to put other Gods before him. </p>

<p>The name of my savior is Yahuwah. The Yah of Abrhaham, Issac, and Israel.</p>

<p>I, like all American negros descended from slaves that were taken from West Africa, is from one of the 12 tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in any religion or philosophy or anything that is created by man. I follow all 613 commandments and laws from the Most High. Only the Most High can save you. There is no other. Especially the one who calls himself the eternal morning star. Which is Lucifer.</p>

<p>This is my savior.</p>

<p>Isaiah 43:11</p>

<p>11: I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.</p>

<p>â€‹Isaiah 44:6</p>

<p>6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:5</p>

<p>5 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:6</p>

<p>6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:21</p>

<p>21 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.</p>

<p>Isaiah 47:8</p>

<p>8 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</p>

<p>Isaiah 47:10</p>

<p>10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.</p>

<p>Hosea 13:4</p>

<p>4 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.</p>

<p>Zephaniah 2:15</p>

<p>15 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</p>

<p>Isaiah 48:10-12</p>

<p>10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</p>

<p>11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.</p>

<p>12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is The God of the Old Testament, when Jesus claims to be &quot;I AM&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the &quot;I AM&quot; in the Exodus that Jesus claimed to be.</p>

<p>Exodus 3:14 - And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</p>

<p>This is the prophecy of Jesus Christ in Isaiah 53 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53</a></p>

<p>Prophecy of Jesus blessing all the nations of the earth. </p>

<p>Genesis 22:18 -  And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>

<p>Jesus is the last and greatest sacrifice</p>

<p>Malachi 3:3 - And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</p>

<p>The black hebrew israelite doctrine is disinformation to reject Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, organized religion is a tool used to manipulate the masses. The original stories may have held grains of truth of ancient wisdom but what is propagated to the masses is completely tailored to shape ones world view into being a follower. Christianity itself may have even been created by the Romans as a way to pacify revolting jews. Preaching peace and to turn the cheek to ones enemy rather than fighting them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, yes.  Yes there is, and has been for some time.  I consider the <em>theory</em> of macro evolution taught and widely accepted as fact, without observed science in public school to be a direct attack upon society to produce an immoral atheist minority within the greater population.

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly have.  Believe me, I have scoured text books, scientific journals, and listened to many an argument... yet, that&#39;s all macro evolution is.  An argument.  Because there is zero observed science for evolution attributing in any way towards creation.  You have to <em>believe</em> in macro evolution... the same as believing in any religious faith. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is exactly the same as believing in anything based on faith.  Macro evolution is a scapegoat for atheists, nothing more.  </p>

<p>Show me observed and repeatable evidence supporting macro evolution, I&#39;d love to see it.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, what organs we don&#39;t need?  Every fiber of the human body has it&#39;s function.  We don&#39;t have vestigial or &quot;no longer needed&quot; parts.  If you are referring to the appendix, it has a major auto immune function.  If you are referring to vestigial parts... there is no such thing.  Growths &amp; anomalies that are formed due to cause and effect can hardly be used as evidence.  And if you jump to the animal kingdom and say like oh well where snake used to have feet and the hip bones of whales... well that&#39;s bs too because those are essential parts during reproduction for those specific animals.</p>

<p>Like I said, if you have this enlightening observed repeatable science to support macro evolution, the whole world would love to see it, because currently there isn&#39;t one shred of it known to the scientific community at this time that can redefine macro evolution as fact, instead of theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You miss tbe point still. You seem to be claiming creationism is true. This has 0 evidence to back kt up. Evolution however does have evidence, hence it has never been disproved as a theory, and no credible alternative has been proposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be confused in the differences of micro and macro evolution.  </p>

<p>No one argues that dogs don&#39;t come from wolves or against natural selection.  Macro evolution, bluntly, states we all come from single cell organisms.  There is no observed or repeatable science to support this.  It is as wild a claim, as a God, or ancient aliens, or anything else.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again, show me observed and repeatable science supporting macro evolution.  </p>

<p>And, I have to point out how ironic it is that suggest reading Dawkins... when he even claims there isn&#39;t any evidence and jumped on board the ancient aliens theory... insinuating a &quot;creator&quot;.  Time and time again, it seems that atheists will accept anything, even other creators such as theoretical aliens, just nothing spiritual.  Ironic because Dawkins and others claim to be champions of scientific observable evidence... when they have none and when finally backed into a corner they turn to the annunaki for their answers.  Laughable hypocrisy.</p>

<p>I am quite clearly saying, for the last time I digress, that &quot;believing&quot; in creationism is the same as &quot;believing&quot; in macro evolution.  Both require faith, as they do not have observed science to support them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, but see, you answered my question.  That isn&#39;t factual observed science now is it?  Thus why macro evolution is still a theory.  So why believe one over the other?  Neither have observed, repeatable evidence... and again, I&#39;d love to see the so called evidence you speak of.  Because, by in large from my studies it is all conjecture, theory, and documentation of mutation... not documentation of cross species macro evolution.  </p>

<p>Again, I stress the irony in choosing to believe macro evolution and claiming it has observed repeatable science behind it... because it does not.  Same goes for creation via religious context. <strong>No man has been able to factually prove either instance, these are both faith based theories for creation</strong>  </p>

<p>The oldest questions humanity has to offer and when primordial soup science fiction doesn&#39;t work, renowned macro-evolutionists (Darwin, Hitchins, etc) fall back to <em>&quot;well maybe it was the annunaki&quot;</em>  You gotta be frickin&#39; kiddin&#39; me.  </p>
