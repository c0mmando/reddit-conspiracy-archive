    <div class="md"><p>He had ~22,000 potential targets. We don&#39;t know the size of the magazines he used, or how many he used. We know he had 23 guns in the suite, mostly rifles. We know 12 rifles had bump stocks. It looks like at least 14 unused magazines were next to the window he shot from. He had 1,600 rounds in his car, one would think that considerably more was in the room. 58 deceased, 489 injured. Of the injured, you&#39;re not considering how many of them occurred due to trampling or other injury during the pandemonium after the shooting began. Roughly 2.5% of the estimated crowd was killed or injured; by an experienced shooter, at elevation, with assault rifles manipulated to fire at nearly an automatic rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not true depending on the caliber and what mods the guns have some shoot in pretty tight patterns. Even if each round shot 30 feet apart in a big circle you are literally spraying into nothing but people at least for the first 10-15 seconds. It is virtually impossible to miss. Not to mention a full metal jacket round would cut right through me into the guy in front of me into the torso of the girl in front of him. You don&#39;t need accuracy at all when you are shooting fish in a barrel. I don&#39;t find the scenario in the slightest bit hard to believe. There are many details of the official story to date that don&#39;t add up but what you are grasping at is not one of them. Good theory but not accurate enough to hold up. Move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate it. It&#39;s like calling everyone a racist or a nazi. These are extreme claims. The more people call each other shills for disagreeing the less meaning the word has. I think there is even a rule about calling everyone a shill. Where&#39;s the mods when you need them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, evidently the conspiracy subreddit has been taken over by government/media loyalists that get uncomfortable when you question the most provably suspicious things like Charlottesville and Vegas. Ah well. I&#39;m sure those same people will be busily talking Moloch and The Protocols to keep everyone nicely distracted. Typical reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all a bid for gun control.  There wasn&#39;t a drop of blood I saw anywhere - yet - and the same happened at Sandy Hook.  You&#39;d think it would be a mess and there would be triage tarps to determine who&#39;s saveable and who&#39;s not.  Ambulances can&#39;t take 58 shot plus 500 or so injured all to the hospital.  There would need to be a system on the ground to sort out who&#39;s fatally injured and who&#39;s critically injured.  Or did their friends carry them into cars and take them to the hospital themselves?  Where is all this footage?</p>
