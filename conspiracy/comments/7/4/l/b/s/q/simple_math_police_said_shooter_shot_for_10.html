       That's not including time for reloading, swapping weapons, moving locations(there were two windows broken). Not to mention that video evidence proves there were short bursts of fire followed by gaps. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sly Stallone are amateur gunslingers compared to this guy.

       Come on, man.  Not this again.  The "victims" includes those injured, who are not necessarily shot.  If a person falls and skins their knee, then they are considered to be an injury.

       well, you have to admit it is strange to say 9-11 minutes instead of about 10 minutes. this led me to believe they want us to connect this to 9/11 and call for ppl to remember it and get into mood of whatever.

       There is a difference between free thinking and correct thinking.  You are misinterpreting what a victim is.  You are assuming that all the victims were shot, which is not a correct assumption.

       the 578 aren't all gun shot victims.. before you try come up with a theory please know the facts. Also, those magazines that were in the pictures look like the 100 round ones, doesn't take long to empty a 100 round clip on an automatic machinegun

       You understand sustained automatic fire is highly inaccurate, likely to cause weapon malfunction or failure, and that 100-round magazines are notoriously unreliable, correct? Or do you not understand that?

       When there's 22000 people crowded together you only have to point the barrel in the general direction. Your title is giving the impression the shooter shot all 578 people which is not the case.. your claim is there flawed because multiple people can be caught in the stampede at any given time.

       He had ~22,000 potential targets. We don't know the size of the magazines he used, or how many he used. We know he had 23 guns in the suite, mostly rifles. We know 12 rifles had bump stocks. It looks like at least 14 unused magazines were next to the window he shot from. He had 1,600 rounds in his car, one would think that considerably more was in the room. 58 deceased, 489 injured. Of the injured, you're not considering how many of them occurred due to trampling or other injury during the pandemonium after the shooting began. Roughly 2.5% of the estimated crowd was killed or injured; by an experienced shooter, at elevation, with assault rifles manipulated to fire at nearly an automatic rate.

       You don't seem to have acknowledged my point. Doesn't matter who he was firing at. An automatic weapon at 100 feet is inaccurate. Hundreds of meters away...it's virtually uncontrollable.

       They sure are. Which is why it's a good thing he used semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks to manipulate the rate of fire. Oh, and he used bipods and practiced extensively with the guns. You're acting like he never held a gun before in his life, left Cabela's with a trove of them, and went up to the 32nd floor to test them out.

       Do you know what a light machine gun is? Even then, he didn't need to be accurate. He needed volume; from his vantage point, his victims were densely placed and unsuspecting. From the videos, it seems a large number ducked in place rather than flee for the first several minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee(s) of the gun shops he frequented stated that he regularly brought his guns in for cleaning after time at the shooting range.

       It doesn't matter if it's uncontrolled when your entire spray pattern is almost a guaranteed hit due to the density and number of targets all being funneled to one exit.

       That is not true depending on the caliber and what mods the guns have some shoot in pretty tight patterns. Even if each round shot 30 feet apart in a big circle you are literally spraying into nothing but people at least for the first 10-15 seconds. It is virtually impossible to miss. Not to mention a full metal jacket round would cut right through me into the guy in front of me into the torso of the girl in front of him. You don't need accuracy at all when you are shooting fish in a barrel. I don't find the scenario in the slightest bit hard to believe. There are many details of the official story to date that don't add up but what you are grasping at is not one of them. Good theory but not accurate enough to hold up. Move on.

       Its all a bid for gun control.  There wasn't a drop of blood I saw anywhere - yet - and the same happened at Sandy Hook.  You'd think it would be a mess and there would be triage tarps to determine who's saveable and who's not.  Ambulances can't take 58 shot plus 500 or so injured all to the hospital.  There would need to be a system on the ground to sort out who's fatally injured and who's critically injured.  Or did their friends carry them into cars and take them to the hospital themselves?  Where is all this footage?
