       So here's a theory. El Chapo is currently in prison. In May his court date was set for April 2018. He has been complaining about being treated badly and I doubt El Chapo is just going to sit there and do nothing about it. 
This is a map showing the drug trafficking routes used by the Sinaloa Cartel. The cartel traffics their drugs from vegas straight to Paddocks home town Mesquite, which is located right near the boarder of Utah and Arizona making it a good distribution spot.
       <a href="https://imgur.com/FoGnW9J">
        https://imgur.com/FoGnW9J
       </a>
       For Example: On August 22, Mesquite police arrested Jose Galvez for regularly trafficking drugs from Las Vegas to Mesquite.
"Mesquite Narcotics detectives had been investigating 31-year-old Jose Galvez, of North Las Vegas, who was routinely transporting meth to the Mesquite area for distribution, according to a statement issued Wednesday by the Mesquite Police Department.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Throughout the period of the investigation, the suspect had made multiple trips from Las Vegas, each time trafficking a large amount of crystal meth into Mesquite,” police said."

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another bust in Washington where people were getting drugs shipped from someone in Las Vegas and claimed that they were working for "El Mayo" Zambada, El Chapos business parter.

        https://www.heraldnet.com/news/drug-dealers-allegedly-have-ties-to-sinaloa-cartel/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Paddock, a millionaire living a secretive life in a major Sinaloa Cartel distribution city, who also has a ton of guns. Not only that, but he used to own an SR20 plane registered in his name is Mesquite TX. SR20s are exactly the type of plane constantly being used by cartels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who is also from Mesquite TX? Miguel Treviño Morales, the former leader of the Zetas Cartel up until his arrest in July 2013. Which also happens to be right around the time of the last action date of the SR20 owned by Paddock.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we all know of course, the FBI/DEA was giving guns to the Sinaloa cartel during operation fast and furious and allowing them to operate in exchange for information on the Zetas Cartel. 
The DEA conducted massive operations in Texas in 2013 and brought down the Sinala Cartel and its leaders.
       <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/mexico/2012/06/12/feds-horse-operation-sweep-targeting-zeta-cartel-includes-balch-springs-property">
        https://www.dallasnews.com/news/mexico/2012/06/12/feds-horse-operation-sweep-targeting-zeta-cartel-includes-balch-springs-property
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The other city where Paddock had his plane registered? Henderson Nevada. The city that is home to the FBI's largest drug bust in Nevada, where the FBI ran an undercover operation for 11 months and busted a two men trafficking drugs out a Henderson warehouse.
       <a href="http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/nevadas-largest-drug-bust-part-2/80157114">
        http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/nevadas-largest-drug-bust-part-2/80157114
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also got another 26 addresses listed from Cerritos, CA to areas all over Texas. What kind of person makes millions of dollars while living a secretive life moving to 26 different places? FBI contractor or informant with close drug cartel ties?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe El Chap is sick of his bad treatment in prison. He knows he can't escape this time so what can he do? His cartel sets up a deal with their old FBI informant gun runner to meet in the MGM. Explains why there are such a ridiculous amount of guns that were never used. Paddock buys a room to set up the deal. Brings the guns up for the sale and hes beaten by cartel members force him to gun down all those people with the threat of torturing and murdering his family and his girlfriend and leaving their bodies in a barrel of acid. They set up the cameras so they know he goes through with it. Which is maybe why he stopped for a while a few times. Begging to not have to continue any more. Then he leaves a note for the FBI explaining what happened. And that's why they won't release the note, and is also why they are claiming that there were other people involved in setting it up but wont say who.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheldon Adelson who of course has mob ties like any casino owner in Vegas gets told by the Sinaloa cartel that he better go let his pal Trump know that El Chap isn't happy with his new digs and wants some better treatment or else he'll unleash his gruesome cartel on the streets of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Paddocks hotel reservation was deleted and why they wont show any of the footage of him going to the hotel room, because it will also show who met up with him and the FBI doesn't want anyone to know that their gun running informant just got used in a horrific extortion plot.

       Interesting. With all the ISIS, Antifa, White Males with Guns talk I forgot to consider cartel terrorism.  Selling guns to cartel soldiers in a Vegas hotel makes more sense than ISIS or Antifa, imo.  Also fits with the "Hispanic" woman yelling at people that they were all going to die.

       Well thought out. There’s definitely something fishy. Why bring in that many guns and risk getting caught bringing them up if his motive was really to just shoot a bunch of people? Why not bring in 2-3 guns and just loads of mags? Why the pausing in shooting? I don’t think it’s a false flag, but we’re not being told the truth.

       You mean it is a false flag, but not a hoax. False Flag just means the official perp is not who we are being told, but the event happened. I mean, we can see on live leak that it happened.

       Search up the article that talks about the Marines being used to kill Zetas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, consider the documents on laughing horse that prove El Chapo cocaine was found in crashed CIA planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA has used the military to eliminate competition of the Sinaloa, while arming them during Fast &amp; Furious. The Sinaloa cartel IS the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many FBI agents do you co-opt/infiltrate if you're the CIA? 10%? 50%? It's a good cover when the local police stumble on your man. 'Undercover FBI Agent.' Especially when they own the police chief, too.

       Yea kind of makes sense the paddocks look like typical meth heads and typical meth heads make great informants. Probably a bad gun deal and the cartel were the ones who did the shooting, FBI got cold feet and blamed it on the informant that's why there's ZERO motive from paddock
