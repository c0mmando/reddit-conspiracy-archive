       This is the first ‚Äúofficial‚Äù narrative the government has pushed and it is straight from trumps mouth.

       Sooooooooo WTF trump. I want someone who has been saying trump is not part of the elite and he is going to drain the swamp and expose all this bullshit to come in here and motherfucking defend why trump dropped the lamest official narrative of any of these attacks. ‚ÄúJust a sick guy folks nothing to see here whatsoever‚Äù

       Yeah I'm not buying the "just a sick guy" routine. You can't push that along with lack of profile from the FBI. It's one or the other if you ask me. I would think that just a sick guy jives with plenty of profiles.

       Trump is fake cling panicking. He set the shit up. The cell phone hack is going to be worse than any national security leak, and will probably reveal a nuclear level of illegal shit. Trump want to unleash a series of attacks so he can try some kind of martial law and suspend any transfers of power meaning he can‚Äôt be impeached.

       Th guy started his main gun collecting in Oct 2016. Trump wasn't sworn in yet which leads me to believe if this is true, it's actually carryover from Obama.

       Carryover? What the fuck? Obama made trump push a lame ass narrative to cover up his shit.

       Trump is up to some serious fuckery really got now and I am betting it‚Äôs due to the cell phone hack.

       Pro tip:  The president doesn't run the country.  The corporate empire behind him is who and what tell him wtf to do - when to jump and not jump.  He just does what he's told or he and his family will end up like Kennedy.

       Meh.  Who cares really?  Most won't admit they were wrong.  People don't like doing that - hurts their ego.  Most aren't evolved enough to take that step.

       Again though, at the end of the day, anyone who thinks the president runs much of anything is simply doing it wrong.  Whether it's Trump or Clinton or
       <em>
        whoever
       </em>
       , THE PRESIDENT IS
       <em>
        NOT

       IN CHARGE OF THE UNITED STATES.

       Yeah dude I get it. I‚Äôm in a conspiracy board and I‚Äôm anti 14 years old so my mind isn‚Äôt blown that the president doesn‚Äôt call the shots.

      <p>
       Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if trump can be taken out and if he lost 75% of his base he would not make it a full 4 year term. He is worse than a lot of alternatives just based on his retard rhetoric On Foreign and domestic issues alone.

       You use small enough words for a chimp to understand. Explain to me how you plan to go about bringing peace and equality by causing mayhem. All I see in the future of this Antifa shenanigan is multiplying the amount of civil unrest this country already has. Bringing peace with chaos has been tried time and time again and always fails miserable leaving the land in shambles greater than before.

       Isn't that the end goal of Antifas cause? Or are you so warped away from that value and so caught up in the bad news that you're too fucking weak to grow a pair and realize your violent desires are fuelled by your discontent with the world. Focus on making it a little better, not acting like a savage cause you don't like the way things are. Things change here in humanity one way. With actions that reflect desires. If you want to replace the current abomination that refer to as society with something worse, then you need to recheck your values. Things don't get better with war and more social breakdown, they get better with lowering our guns then shaking hands and cutting the bullshit around petty drama.

       How? I'm not trying to brag about it. That was never the main point of any of my arguments. I don't make shit tons of money. I do alright for myself hence "well off", not 'rich af' . But besides that, you keep avoiding the point of the argument because you have no counterargument for my original point about Antifa.

       I bet people make fun of you behind your back a lot when you use words wrong like that in conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact. The people who know you think of you as a pompous idiot and the humor you to your face and they all ridicule you behind your back. You live in a social matrix, you think you are one thing but in reality you are a joke to everyone you know.

       That's hilarious. Just like every dumbass to walk the earth, your simply wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you've said so far deems you as a rage filled simpleton who thinks it's necessary to beat down a person to your own low level in order to beat them in a pointless argument that's more important than life itself to you. Your doing nothing but making your own discontent with every aspect of who you are obvious. Every word you've typed in this pissing match is absent hearted and fake, just like you. Which is why you resort to attempting to bring others happieness down so you can feel content with your miserable life. You're nothing but a textbook bully. And bullys are always miserable, self loathing, weak and lack integrity, just like you. You are the scum of society. If you died tomorrow, those you believe are your 'friends' would be relieved that they don't have to entertain your parasitic existence anymore.

       I was bullied in gradescool, so I have experience in dealing with assholes like you. At this point, it's simply entertaining to give people like you the replies you crave just to see how far you're willing to take it. Your futile words do nothing for your essence as a person is a relic of my past. You are a mere comedy skit in my head.

       immature people have a tendency to reflect their own feeling in their insults. With you, it's more than obvious. It's plain hilarious. Those three sentences you wrote there are an exact reflection of what you are feeling for yourself.

       Isn't that the end goal of Antifas cause? Or are you so warped away from that value and so caught up in the bad news that you're too fucking weak to grow a pair and realize your violent desires are fuelled by your discontent with the world. Focus on making it a little better, not acting like a savage cause you don't like the way things are. Things change here in humanity one way. With actions that reflect desires. If you want to replace the current abomination that refer to as society with something worse, then you need to recheck your values. Things don't get better with war and more social breakdown, they get better with lowering our guns then shaking hands and cutting the bullshit around petty drama.
