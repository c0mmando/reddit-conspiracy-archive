       Google changed the search algorithm to mostly show news sources, and not show conspiracy videos, but it's also making it harder to find the original uploaded sources..
      </p>
      <p>
       With the 10 minute timeline, we should be able to identify when the shooter supposedly started firing at the security guard, and if the video is long enough, it would include when the shooter shot themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's enough info given that we can compare their timeline with the information they released, and see what actually checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have any links to videos where the person stayed close enough from the start to hear the gunshots, to cover the 75 minute window?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: there's links to another post(in the comments) that shows audio of the shooter shooting a silenced (claim) weapon into the crowd during the song before the song the obvious semi auto fire started. Someone replied with a post of video, go to approximately 3:08 to hear the muffled first shots:
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=muiHkkbPpdU">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=muiHkkbPpdU
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems clearly different in this video is how quickly people reacted (instantly) to the louder obvious gun shots.

       I've only found videos sharing them with comments. But i guess there is one from CNN right down by the fence next to the concert venue. It's odd in the way that you can hear the rounds being fired off to the left facing the hotel, sounds like coming from the concert venue, Which matches up pretty well with what the taxi driver was hearing. I will post back if I can find the video alone

       That would be awesome, I'm sorting by longer videos(20+ minutes), then by date, and going to the oldest videos posted and all the videos so far seem to be compilations and news.. it's like the changes to the algorithm actually hid the original source videos. There used to be a ton of unedited videos that were over 20 minutes..

       I literally got done watching that a few minutes ago.. I'd love to find a full video that captures that.. unfortunately that video doesn't give us an idea of when he shot himself in the official timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, if we can confirm that there were any single gunshots in the time window when the police and security guards have arrived(12 minutes in), before they breached(75 minutes in).. that wouldn't agree with the timeline and info they released.

       You noted 10:07 and 10:17, and the video is shorter than the second time you referenced.. also, I feel like if you linked each time reference to that time stamp in the YouTube video, it would make it much easier to check out each individually..

       Those are from the second video, "based on" time from the start of the shooting. You make a good point though - I'll fix that up soon!

       (I had uses the timestamp in the video - just what I was looking at when I made the notes - but you're right, youtube timings would be clearer)

       The second video is 9 minutes long, so I'm guessing you've synced up the second video to the first? I mean, is it 10 minutes after the shooting started? Because that wouldn't match the official timeline that has him as shooting at the guard around that time..

       Something else to note, once you edit in the time stamps, you could see if you and others can confirm how many rounds were shot in each instance.. if 200 bullets were shot at the guard, it would give us an idea of at what point that happened.

       If you download the video, you can use VLC media player (free) to slow down the speed to easily count the shots. If you can't download the video, you can get video or audio capture software, since technically all you need is the sound and time stamps.

       Also, interestingly, this video seems to indicate shots were fired in the first song (as opposed to the start of the second) which, based on the music, could be synced up with it all too

       Not sure if you saw the top voted comment, but they posted this link to video which confirms the same thing.. start at around 3:08

       Not sure why someone would be recording audio only, and it seemed very muffled.. but the video shows something no other I've seen has shown- people recognized the first muffled shots, and instantly reacted to what was obviously gunfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that post was over an hour ago, why is it I still can't see how many upvotes it has? It's obviously big news!

       I truly think that finally enough time has passed, enough information about the "official story" has been released, that we can actually use the information they've given, compare it to video that is getting posted online because they've just realized the relevance..
      </p>
      <p>
       I downloaded a video that was posted today, that shows a strobe light that was flashing 2 hours before the shooting that really kills the 4th floor 2nd shooter myth..
      </p>
      <p>
       I want the truth, and I think as more videos are posted because they realize their video they captured something that wasn't blatantly obvious, we will have more evidence to confirm or deny whether the "official story" is correct, or bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the newest evidence wasn't available until today. I wonder if anyone is reporting this to the FBI, or if it will live and die in our sub.

       Another thing to consider, the official timeline they gave us is based on the first 911 call to report a shooting. Is the 911 call by people who obviously realized much sooner in the newest video, or people who realized once the concert/music stopped?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an important distinction to consider while we try to confirm/deny whether the official timeline and information given actually matches what we have as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, can we still not find a video (not synchronized) that covers at least 13 minutes, if not up to the 75 minutes where they breached the room?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm having a difficult time finding original Rae footage that goes over 10 minutes, most seems to be less than 3.
