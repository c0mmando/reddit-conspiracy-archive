       I've been asked by the moderators to do an AMA here, presumably because a lot of my work has focused on opaque relationships between governments and private entities, and because my adventures have given me access to a lot of very telling scenarios involving secrecy, conspiracy, and state criminality. Here's my bio with further details:
      </p>
      <p>
       Barrett Brown is a writer and anarchist activist. His work has appeared in Vanity Fair, the Guardian, The Intercept, Huffington Post, New York Press, Skeptic, The Daily Beast, al-Jazeera, and dozens of other outlets. In 2009 he founded Project PM, a distributed think-tank, which was later re-purposed to oversee a crowd-sourced investigation into the private espionage industry and the intelligence community at large via e-mails stolen from federal contractors and other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2011 and 2012 he worked with Anonymous on campaigns involving the Tunisian revolution, government misconduct, and other issues. In mid-2012 he was arrested and later sentenced to four years in federal prison on charges stemming from his investigations and work with Anonymous. While imprisoned, he won the National Magazine Award for his column, The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Prison.
Upon his release in late 2016 he began work on the Pursuance System, a platform for mass civic engagement and coordinated opposition. His third book, a memoir/manifesto, will be released in 2018 by Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux.

       I was heavily pessimistic after spending my mid-20s covering U.S. politics and doing a lot of media criticism, which slowly taught me how much worse our press, government, and much of the citizenry is than is evident even to largely well-informed people. I don't have much certainty regarding the future, other than to say that we're entering a period of extraordinarily high stakes that will require honest people who respect the rights of others to start taking full advantage of the internet, which is why I've been intent on getting this pursuance system up and running for last seven years (only getting to it now because of course I ended up getting occupied with other matters, like Anonymous and prison).

       I feel sorry for what happened to you Mr. Brown.  I admire and respect the fact that, despite your recent difficulties, you still endeavor to make the world a better place.

       I feel you have experienced things that would shake the foundations of most people's beliefs and yet you fight.

       That's a part of it, as we're going to be pushing for crowd-sourced journalism of different sorts, but collaboration in this context refers to general human civic interaction - organizing for social and political ends. This is a very broad system that can be used for all sorts of things, including anything that's being done now.

       The U.S.A. today is trending to a majority population of disenfranchised voters and non-citizen residents.  That is moving right along with and is part of the continued wage suppression and reduction.

       The fundamental purpose of the system is to allow anyone falling within our agreed ideological framework - opposition to police state, drug war, and surveillance state, however one defines these things - to combat the institutions that are responsible for the trends you refer to. The specifics can be seen on the website as well as the video we did a few weeks back, which I'll link to from main post in a bit, but broadly, this is a framework that will allow participants to vastly enhance and expand the efforts that are already being made - such as by non-profits, activist groups, and informal movements - while also making it easier to implement new ideas, find people to help with them, and keep everything from descending into drama and inaction.

       A global economic and political system is inevitable, how does what you are proposing empower all individuals on our planet. Will you be proposing as set of individual human rights and environmental rules too protect and preserve the planet we need for survival.

       Hi Barrett, thanks so much for being here with us today.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is thus, on websites like reddit (which were once used to aggregate content freely as it was put out) more and more, small groups are using their foothold on the platform to excwersize subtle/veiled influence over how content is able to flow on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the best example of this trend was exposed via the GI Files from wikileaks, wherein it came out that Alexis Ohanian runs a social media consulting firm called "Antique Jetpack", and
       <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=antique+jetpack&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">
        had offered his services to startfor
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       How do those kind of social media consulting firms threaten the flow of information in the modern age in your opinion, and what do systems such as your new Pursuance Project offer by way of oversight of those kind of veiled forces?

        Hey Mr. Brown. Thanks for doing this. My question concerns Operation Cartel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The operation, or at least any focus on Los Zetas, was officially ceased, but you claimed to be continuing the effort as a solo agent. What happened with this? Last I heard (in like 2011) you were working with at least one reporter to sift through 25,000 emails and at least 60 names, and there was also an unnamed United States District Attorney that might have been implicated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Did the investigation go nowhere? Did it stop or never get published for different reasons? Or, is the investigation still ongoing?

       Even the ones who supported my cause and thought highly of what I'd done both outside and in the prison by challenging the authorities were ultimately cowards who had no problem locking me up in the SHU illegally on the orders of an assistant warden whose feelings I hurt. These are mostly ex-military, of course, and thus accustomed to being able to pretend that they're courageous regardless of the things they actually do.

       Well said. Have been incarcerated due to judicial malfeasance, can confirm. I kept saying "you guys are here on purpose"??? It terrifies me to think they were treated as animals, because it's a learned behavior.

       Sure he is afforded "a little anger" but his anger is misguided. Also, not all military members are willing to kill strangers for money and the fact that you think that is what our military does is beyond ignorant and you're clearly misinformed.

       Hey Mr. Brown. Thanks for doing this. My question concerns Operation Cartel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The operation, or at least any focus on Los Zetas, was officially ceased, but you claimed to be continuing the effort as a solo agent. What happened with this? Last I heard (in like 2011) you were working with at least one reporter to sift through 25,000 emails and at least 60 names, and there was also an unnamed United States District Attorney that might have been implicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the investigation go nowhere? Did it stop or never get published for different reasons? Or, is the investigation still ongoing?

       Nothing came of my efforts. As I noted back then, I never had access to those e-mails, which were in the hands of Anonymous Veracruz or some such thing; my initial role was simply advocating for the operation, which had become controversial very quickly, and conveying developments from the Mexican Anons to U.S. press. Later, I had the notion of working to pair Mexican journalists with U.S. outlets so that those who had info they were reluctant to release in-country could securely send it to the U.S. to be broadcast/disseminated - basically "laundering journalism." I had a meeting to this end with a Mexican reporter who flew up, but soon enough I was raided by the FBI, and meanwhile I had other distractions, not the least of which were drugs, that prevented me from following through on things like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DA you're referring to was brought to my attention by an unrelated individual, and didn't stem from any e-mails, and despite some of the reports that came out, he was never suspected of being involved with cartels. Rather, he seemed to have a relationship with local criminals, and this was something that the press in that city - Asheville, North Carolina - had apparently heard as well, based on my calls up there. But it didn't seem like there was anything to be done about it, so I moved on to other issues.

       It's worth noting that even allegedly professional reporters conflated these things over and over again despite there being a pretty clear record of what I was saying, in print and on YouTube videos. This was more true of OpCartel than many other operations, but it's always the case.

       I've actually looked at some of these matters, such as the woman interviewed who described an incident in which another woman appeared to warn of the attacks. If things like that don't get sufficient coverage and/or explanation, then I'll look into it further. Keep in mind that right now, I don't really work as a "journalist" in that sense; I do a column on pretty broad issues of civic decline, and am doing a book on similar issues wrapped up in my own narrative, so these are things that other independent-minded journalists will have to pursue.

       Reporters tend to be more liberal than the population at large, whereas editors and publishers tend to be more conservative, but it's more nuanced than that, as the reporters are more socially liberal than economically liberal (in U.S. sense of interventionism), and at any rate that bias is less important than the non-political biases and heuristics that define much of what actually gets reported and to what extent. Every individual has ambitions, limitations, self-image, etc, and reporters have to cater to editors and producers, who ultimately define what the press puts out. The NYT is a great example of how this actually works. For all the nonsense about how everyone there is secretly and perpetually working to help the Democrats and whatever, when Judith Miller had a piece that supposedly bolstered Bush's case for Iraq War, they happily ran with it and ignored objections from other reporters about the way she was doing her job - because she'd won awards, for one thing, and because, by and large, an individual editor's greatest concern is his own reputation for getting important stories.

       The nuances of how information flows within the news media as well as other structures has always been my greatest interest, so naturally I have a lot more to say about this subject, as it's very complicated and requires a great deal of actual research and first-hand knowledge to understand, just like mechanics.

       It's a very heady book, if you are curious. I think you'd find value in it. In terms of outlines of modern international political philosophy, it is likely one of the best 'post 1900' sources, aside the collective speeches of Malcolm X, which are presented in a similar style, but eventually become more enlightened as plane travel had been made popular by the 1960's, and Malcolm X was more educated and less bent on exterminating thought opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'Jew obsession', is of course based in fact, but amounts to less than 5% of the book, I would say (as far as I've gotten) - and even then, Jew is merely substitute for 'the unseen enemy'. The parts discussing society, the corrupting influences of international regimes, the systematic brainwashing of conquered peoples, the false illusions of hope presented by soulless governments, etc, largely ring true today, as they did in the times of Thomas Paine and Benjamin Franklin, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of political writings, ignoring Aristotle's didactic notes on Politics, Generation and Corruption, I would put Malcolm X speeches and Mein Kampf in the top minds post 1900, with Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and collective writings being the most enlightened (for Western Culture), and the works of Thomas Paine being the most poetic, and humanist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason the book was banned. Not because you read it and all the sudden you hate Jews, but because after reading it, you learn how a homeless orphan street worker used the power of his mind to change a continent of men. That is not something many can do. Adolf was very brilliant, though lacking all forms of formal education and having something of an obsession with killing people who opposed him did contributed to stagnation, coupled with the limited abilities of communication of the 1930's (as you mention, today is unlike any other time in history).
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same, considering you are writing a Manifesto, I figured you might want to read the one that probably changed more lives than any other throughout history, and at the fastest pace. Propaganda serves a purpose. You won't finish the book with a hatred of Jews, but you might be more prepared to defeat the powers which enslave mankind. But who knows, I guess we all interpret things differently. Good luck in your conquests.

       No. There are certainly some silly assertions made here and there in support of it, but that's true for literally every theory that's ever existed. There's way too many instances of Trump and his people lying about meetings that later end up being proven for there not to have been collusion of some sort.

       The lies are technical lies and minor.  They aren't substantive lies in any way.  (They do have motivation to lie to avoid the shitstorm of allegations that would arise with anything that half-way looks like anything real, to avoid the
       <em>
        political

       Thanks for letting me know that claiming a meeting with Kremlin spies was just about Russian orphans when it turned out to have been brought about after an e-mail re: dirt on Clinton is just a minor, technical lie, and that none of the other things involving Manafort are worth looking into.

       That is a logically fallacious inference.

      <p>
       Innocent people accused of crimes they did not commit have been shown lie, because they feel an injustice has been made against them, and so if they are victimized by lies, and they believe telling the truth won't work, then they lie as well.

       Right now, you can make a list of competent, honest people and/or organizations, particularly smaller and more dynamic ones, and make them aware of our website and ask them to sign up for updates. We've had nearly a thousand people sign up thus far, and expect to have many more over next few months as some interviews and media I've done start going up on Vice's channel and NPR and whatnot, but the larger the pool of participants, the faster we'll see a cohesive ecosystem for reform and opposition.

       All of our code is open source, meaning anyone will be able to host their own instance of the Pursuance System on their own server, using their own domain:
       <a href="https://github.com/PursuanceProject">
        https://github.com/PursuanceProject
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on we will add federation, so that pursuances can collaborate across multiple servers as if they're on the same server.

       It has less to do with being compromised than it has to do with being cowardly, incompetent, incapable of real critic thinking, poorly-trained (journalism school is bullshit, which is why I quit college pretty quickly), and subject to the whims of editors who themselves have another entire layer of bullshit theories about what is and isn't newsworthy.

       The description of Pursuance on the main site is long on ideas but short on technical specs. Could you tell us a bit more about how the Pursuance system works technically?

       Is it a block chain/Golang application?

       Will it go live as a .onion domain?

       Are documents shared by groups stored on user’s machines or on a central server?

       How will you handle unauthorized (by the contract) document sharing?
       <br/>
       For example, if A started a pursuance and then brought on B, but then B brought on themselves as a third user C (under a different PGP key) and then “C” distributed the group’s documents to an outside entity, A would never know that B was the infilrator. (It seems to solve the problem of not being able to find collaborators, but creates a different problem by not knowing who those collaborators are.)

       There will be no TOS as such, in part because we'd have no way of enforcing it. Participants need only agree to a broad statement of principles I've described elsewhere. The settings for document storage are variable; pursuances can handle that and a number of other questions in many different ways, via the settings and via the particular structures they develop and what working relationships between users are agreed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, I tend not to answer technical questions because I myself am not technical, and I want any explanation to be exact and come from the people who are making those decisions because I don't want to put out something that's even slightly incorrect. In previous AMAs, including another that was done on reddit, our project manager was on hand to answer questions; I'd be happy to have him come by and answer these. His handle is elimisteve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer to the broader question about how we'll handle unauthorized sharing is that we don't, because we're not running the individual pursuances, though we'd advise anyone working with sensitive documents to only make them accessible to those they're comfortable having them, as with any other situation. That sort of thing is not something we aim to completely solve; rather, we're giving users enough functionality so that they can minimize risks based on the particular circumstances of what they're doing.

       Steve Phillips here, the project manager/lead developer of Pursuance that Barrett mentioned in his intro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great questions.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First, here is an overview of the technical aspects of Pursuance and some specifics on what makes it unique:
       <a href="https://gist.github.com/elimisteve/5f434892dba623aaae052aafa69456a4">
        https://gist.github.com/elimisteve/5f434892dba623aaae052aafa69456a4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The core feature set we will launch with is: end-to-end encrypted task management (currently under development) + chat + secure file- and link-sharing (provided by
       <a href="https://www.leapchat.org/#PublicPursuanceCommunity-JinglingTidbitNicotineExcerptNutcrackerElongatedRummageUnnoticedAftershaveTweezersDepotUnwrinkledHelmetFridgeJudiciaryWheatNuggetPaprikaSwordAwarenessTacoSulphurJetskiCapsuleDriftwood">
        LeapChat
       </a>
       , which we've recently built and launched!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon after we will add a more fine-grained permissions system (discussed below), karma points (guess where that idea came from?), and a trust score/reputation system.  Eventually we will integrate other tools, like those from Transparency Toolkit, for doing more specialized tasks (like OCR'ing and/or dealing with a very large volume of documents).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fundamentally, the Pursuance System enables you to create a pursuance (which is a sort of organization), invite people to that pursuance (with the appropriate level of permissions), assign those people tasks (manually, or automatically based on their skill set!), brainstorm and discuss what needs to be done, rapidly record exciting ideas or strategies in an actionable format, share files and documents, be notified when relevant events occur (e.g., you are assigned a task or mentioned), and effectively ask for help from others.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not need to specify your email address in order to create an account, but if you do then the emails you get will be PGP-encrypted if you so choose, and even if you don't want to deal with PGP, the emails will still be privacy-preserving, saying things like, "you were mentioned 3 times" or "you have been assigned a task" without providing any details about who mentioned you nor what that assigned task is.
      </p>

       <a href="https://tryingtobeawesome.com/postgrest/">
        PostgREST
       </a>
       .  We're also using WebSockets so that the server can push real-time updates (messages, notifications, and new tasks) to users, and of course the site is HTTPS-only.  We are using
       <a href="https://securityheaders.io/?q=leapchat.org&amp;amp;followRedirects=on">
        very secure HTTP headers

       , that we are integrating into the heart of Pursuance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuance will initially be a responsive web app that works well on any desktop or mobile browser.  Later we will create native apps (using React Native on mobile and Electron on desktop).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes.  The default configuration of the Pursuance System software (running on a server) makes every pursuance accessible via a .onion domain.  Our instance will also be accessible via pursuanceproject.org in addition to the .onion.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While I'm not sure it's possible to solve the trust problem entirely -- if you trust someone you shouldn't trust, they can find a way to abuse that trust, and even if you initially trust someone for good reason, they can be co-opted (e.g., bribed), or have their device seized and used against even
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       will -- there are several safeguards and features we are putting in place to accommodate this sort of concern we've heard from people:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         When you invite a not-yet-trusted person to your private pursuance, you can choose to give them very limited privileges.  Specifically you can make it so they can only view and comment on tasks that they have been assigned without letting them see any other tasks, documents, or messages in that pursuance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         An advanced feature we're adding is the ability to assign tasks
         <em>
          to other pursuances
         </em>
         , which, among other things, makes it easier for people who like working together as a "crew" to form their own pursuance that floats around the Pursuance ecosystem to do various useful tasks for others.  This maintains a clear boundary between different groups (that is, pursuances), but allows those groups to meaningfully collaborate.  I mention this feature in this context because you can use this "task outsourcing" feature to basically create cells of different users in different pursuances, each with their own cache of files and documents that they have exclusive access to.  If you give multiple people access to the same exact document, yes, it'll be hard to know who leaked what (just as it is for the NSA), but at least you can radically limit the pool of people who could have leaked it -- by limiting who has access to it, and do so without limiting your ability to effectively collaborate with them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A feature we probably won't launch with but will come later is a reputation system, which will help with deciding who to assign a particular task to (or you can have Pursuance choose for you, based on which skills you say are needed to complete that task, and who has that skill set!).  And after that we will probably let people show their own per-pursuance reputation in a sort of global profile, so you can see where someone has been effective and trustworthy before inviting them to your pursuance.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       ...and in answering this question, I just realized that having people provide references ("person X will vouch for me") could be interesting.  Hmm...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Will there be an easy method to expose documents to the www? ... Can it be used to publish leaked documents anonymously?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For the foreseeable future we will probably just encourage people to use
       <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">
        CryptPad
       </a>
       , which allows you to create an end-to-end encrypted (using JS) document that can be collaboratively edited in the browser -- great for creating documents that will either remain private or be made public -- and that gives you a read-only link to that document that you can give to the world without allowing anyone to edit.  It's a little buggy, but it's pretty good and is getting better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharing the read-write or read-only links via a private/encrypted pursuance with those you're collaborating with means that even if, worst-case scenario, the pursuance system server you're collaborating through
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       CryptPad get hacked, your data will still be safe; the key needed to decrypt the link to the docs will be encrypted with a key the hacker does not have.
      </p>
      <p>
       A related question we sometimes get is -- can Pursuance be used by a source to much more conveniently do what Snowden and others did?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is -- yes, though this is trickier than it sounds to do safely, because the source of the "document" could include malware in it that, you know, hijacks the journalist's computer :-\ .
       <a href="https://securedrop.org/">
        SecureDrop
       </a>
       (awesome project btw!) handles this by having the journalist/document recipient transfer documents to an air-gapped and not-internet-connected machine before opening them.  That way the malware won't have access to the journalist's data, and won't be able to exfiltrate any data nor phone home at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Snowden would have had the Pursuance System, he could have set it up at a new domain, emailed Glenn Greenwald in the clear, sent him a single-use encrypted link using
       <a href="https://minishare.io/">
        miniShare
       </a>
       , another in-beta tool we've built and quietly launched (and may build into Pursuance) that would take Glenn to the Pursuance instance, and invite him to the particular (private/encrypted) pursuance on that server where Glenn could download the documents once he made an account. :tada:
      </p>
      <p>
       This process would require the journalist to click 2 links, and create 1 account with a fairly long password --
       <em>
        that's it.
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Barrett answered this, but I would just add that the basic legal TOS we will use will be privacy-preserving in nature; we are a non-profit that cares about protecting its users and their (your!) privacy, and have no incentive to do anything but.

       Steve, I'd first like to thank you for working on this system which seems to have a ton of potential. I've been excited about this since I learned about it three months ago or so, and the fact you've open sourced the code has assuaged a number of my fears. I haven't had a chance to really dig in yet, but I plan to.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a logistical note on the end-to-end encryption, let's say I'm part of a pursuance with 100 others, and I want to upload a file that's available to everyone else. If I'm understanding this correctly, I would have to encrypt a separate file for each person with their particular public key (or passphrase/email equivalent key), no? It seems therefore that storage space will scale at O(N x M) where N is the number of users in a pursuance and M is size of the files available to that pursuance. This seems like it could become a fairly big obstacle and you would need to set some potentially low limits on either the number of users per pursuance or the amount of shared storage space per pursuance. I'm wondering how you plan to address this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you currently looking for developers to contribute code, or the development being done more in-house at this point?

       Good question, but we have good solutions to this -- 2, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first is miniLock (
       <a href="https://github.com/kaepora/minilock">
        https://github.com/kaepora/minilock
       </a>
       ).  miniLock is what we're using to derive a keypair from a username and passphrase that the user memorizes.  But there's also a miniLock file format that solves the exact problem you've mentioned.  This file format creates a new random symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file/data, and then
       <em>
        encrypts a copy of that key
       </em>
       to each recipient using their public key.  And these keys are just 32 bytes.  So sharing a 100mb with 10 people via miniLock won't require ~1GB of storage, but ~100mb of storage plus ~320 bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is only necessary when you need to encrypt something intended for a closed set of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally you will want to encrypt data -- tasks, messages, files, and links -- in such a way that new people can see them when they join your pursuance.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do we solve
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       ?  With shared keys!
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get invited to a private (encrypted) pursuance with at least a certain level of permissions/capabilities, you will actually be receiving an encrypted copy of a pursuance-wide key that is used to encrypt some things in that pursuance -- mostly other keys, which in turn encrypt individual tasks or chat rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you want to invite 5 specific people to a private chat room, behind the scenes our code will use miniLock for that.  But when you create a new task, for example, a new key will be generated, encrypted with the pursuance-wide key, and uploaded to our server where only people in that pursuance with sufficient privileges will be able to download it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course none of these keys will be stored in plaintext in our database, meaning not even the person hosting the Pursuance server will be able to passively spy on what people are doing in private pursuances are doing.

       Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So it's essentially using the same session key for the symmetric encryption and then encrypting that key with each recipient's public miniLock ID as a public key. Sounds great!

       There's also another reason for that, it's that asymmetric systems are really slow and encrypting a large file with it is inefficient. Which is why every ransomware uses a different key for each file and encrypts it with their key.

       enemies from using it, and your exact response was:

       You literally responded by saying they shouldn't abuse tech, in response to me talking about how ISIS and other enemies would abuse this system. I'm essence, defending ISIS and our enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You rebutted with "Mass spying and domestic" bullshit that had nothing to do with what you said before. If I'm talking about ISIS and other enemies, that has nothing to do with us domestically. I was clearly talking about them using this as a communications network abroad. Nothing at all brought up this domestic bullshit you're now trying to claim.

       There are a couple, including We Are Legion, Relatively Free (which is just 18 minutes), and Hacker Wars. Another, The Accidental Warrior, will be coming out in a few weeks. But the best primer on me and my case is article by Christian Stork of Who What Why, which goes into all of the things we exposed and which, unlike the Rolling Stone article and certain others, is almost entirely accurate.

       "3) Homeland Security/DOJ teamed up with a group that is part of Anonymous based in Washington, D.C. called “The Protectors.” This group saw a lot of activity during Election Day from the Russians and believe that the voting results projected don’t match the internal and public polls because the voting results were manufactured in favor of Trump in heavily Republican counties in key states, and voting results may have been decreased for Clinton in key Democratic counties via malware that was placed by the Russians when they hacked the election systems of more than half our states."

       The Russians didn't hack our election system. Words have actual meanings, so they didn't fucking hack our election. We have known since 2004 that some electronic machines can be hacked simply by inserting a USB stick. There was testimony given about the machines in Ohio in 2004, they didn't do shit about it. The Russian narrative is propaganda.

       What if anything has changed about the way private surveillance/intelligence firms like Stratfor operate since that 2011-2013 window when their emails were released in an attack coordinated by the FBI, and how do you envision their relationship growing with the US state moving forward?

       The problem is that we don't know; that window is largely closed to us now, with the exception of a few leaks that occurred while I was in prison, including that of Hacking Team (I believe). I have little reason to expect that much has changed, though, given the lack of real consequences even for those involved in the Team Themis affair, which was completely indefensible and was only exposed via a freak occurrence when HBGary Federal CEO decided it would be fun to pick a fight with Anonymous.

       Hi, Barret. Thanks for taking the time to do the AMA. I  would like to hear your opinions on two issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first is what do you think is going on with Wikileaks and Assange? I know you have been critical somewhat of his tweets, and the  change in the way they present themselves has been noticeable.    Is this reflecting the internal changes due to Gavin MacFadyen passing away?
      </p>
      <p>
       My second question is concerning Matt Dehart. Are you familiar with his case and are you involved in any way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again.

       You do not need to know anything about technology to use this system. I myself am not a coder or programmer and I designed it. The bulk of participants will be doing research, organization, graphic design, writing, etc - everything that can be useful in any effort to confront institutions and reduce their ability to brutalize populations at home and abroad.

        The pursuance library will also provide access to written case studies submitted by users. These may cover a particular structure, pursuance, or settings configuration that the submitter has either developed or used, in which case they'll be visible in the library when one views the item in question in addition to being searchable by other means. Other case studies may cover broader aspects of the pursuance system itself.

       I don't have specifics on that yet, and I'm not sure if our project developer Steve Phillips has thought more about it yet; there are a number of ways it can be done, of course. Incidentally, it's one of the more important aspects of all this, as it allows everyone to use pursuance in perpetual best-practices style rather than having to reinvent the wheel, and will foment continual evolution of the structures people use to accomplish their tasks.

       I agree. The Dewey Decimal system isn't really the best, but I do think '100 point scales' are very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, this is outside the realm of what you are tackling, Benjamin liked to organize literature into practical, useful disciplines. In such a way, his readers became better economic earners, leading to more societal power, eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are two aspects to human history. One being Scientific Study, which is somewhat random and subjective, and another being the 'study of humans', which is more evolutionary and can be replicated. It's very interesting to note how one progresses in life from a poor servant boy to a leader of men, to me, and to review their sources of inspiration, and so on. Many fall into the trap that either 'that person' was born a god, or that 'they' are born to be stupid, but in fact I'd many of us have the power to choose whomever we'd want to be : Leader or Servant, but the latter socially encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No Country for Old Men" I think is a pretty good telling of how our past choices dictate our future, which is to say that one can not simply 'become a good person', but they must evolve throughout life to be one. The study of how others have evolved, including yourself, is a story which others should know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding 100 point scales for study, you can use broad categorizations, such as 10, 20, 30... and then merely add a digit for the next level of subcategory 101, 102, 103... 1011, 1012, 1013... and so on, the thus get near infinitesimal deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, by limiting it to 100 points on a given topic (or something smaller) it doesn't become disorganized, and the time of study required for mastery becomes reasons, with large portions of society drawing from shared events and understanding. Likewise, it would encourage some forms of curation, which as the project expands becomes important, otherwise a torrent of crap drowns the scientific, or good. Good luck building your brave new world :)

       In the design of the pursuance system:
      </p>
      <p>
       is the state of a pursuance kept via distributed records?
      </p>
      <p>
       are you using some sort of blockchain to track the mutations of a pursuance?
      </p>
      <p>
       do you have any consideration for a reputation system in your voting processes?  do you support different voting models?

       the collaborative services one would be likely to use to work on a pursuance such as chat, messaging, etc.  - are you implementing these too, and if so how are you ensuring anonymity?

       Aside from accepting the basic premise of opposition to police state, drug war, and surveillance state, users will have a variety of opinions and approaches. The system is intended to allow anyone to create their own pursuance and expand it however they like, accepting or denying participation as they see fit, delegating power as much or as little as they want, and developing agreements and connections with other pursuances as desired. This will allow for a rich ecosystem of experimentation while also ensuring that those who don't want to work with others with particular opinions have plenty of options to do so. So, someone can set up a pursuance and let it expand indefinitely, allowing for majority votes on every major decision, but many of them will be structured in a more regimented way. It's up to each individual to choose which pursuances to be involved in (or to apply to, anyway) and to create their own on along different lines if necessary.

       I really don't know. Despite having been characterized as a "security expert" by outlets like Bloomberg back in the day, I actually know very little about these sorts of things. My background/interests are in history, revolution, politics, media; I just happened to work closely with people who are mostly know for hacking.

       There are a handful of people in the world who now jointly control far more than 50% of the hashing power on the network.  Anyone with the capacity to hack into some computers, or co-opt a handful of people into fabricating transactions on the network, or convince others with this hashing power to join them in a conspiracy, could create  fabricated transactions -- transactions that say that the BTC you sent to your friend was actually sent to the attacker creating this fake transaction, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main disincentive toward doing this is that if everyone loses confidence in the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoins won't be worth anything anymore, in which case illegitimately minting Bitcoins for yourself would be self-defeating; having a lot more coins worth dramatically less per coin doesn't make you richer, it makes you poorer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But notice that this means we're not trusting the math anymore, but incentives.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Bitcoin is in fact not trustless; you're trusting those who control the majority of the hashing power not to conspire to fabricate transactions in their favor.

       This was one of my fears. I also wonder about what happens if a collision is discovered in SHA 256 which I believe is the encryption algorithm. Also, if the government can levy taxes on transactions or create laws that make it difficult to use or transfer money in or out.

       You are right to state that the centralisation of mining is a major issue. However, the dangers you list are incorrect.

       Miners have far less power than many people think. Mining just orders transactions. Miner's cannot create transactions that spend user's bitcoin. Not even a malicious majority. The worst they can do is either block transactions (missing out on those fees) or trick an exchange business into trading a national currency for Bitcoin and quickly causing a one or two block re-org.

      <p>
       The cost of miner attacks actually have huge, direct financial penalties as high as millions of dollars a day. And a low likelihood of success. And then the full node users boot them off the network which basically means bankruptcy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miner's that misbehave, even a malicious majority, are automatically recognised and ignored by full nodes under most circumstances. If necessary, nodes can nuke them by changing the proof of work.

      <p>
       If you run a full node, you enforce the rules and are protected by the math And the incentives. If you don't, you are trusting incentives.

       Bitcoin is not trustless. It is trust-minimising via cryptography, game theory, and network architecture.

       are the best resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The distinctions between different classes of network participants is a fascinating and widely misunderstood area. It's crucial for understanding how Bitcoin works and if the experiment succeeds or fails into .
      </p>
      <p>
       A full node verifies the full blockchain history, verifies that new transactions adhere to the consensus rules, and passes those transactions on. This is how Bitcoin provides individual economic sovereignty - full nodes are peers. When you run a full node, you choose which rules you will follow and enforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mining bundles transactions into blocks and adds them to the blockchain. They do this in a way that makes it extremely expensive to try to rewrite history because to do so you must prove to full nodes that you burned more energy than the rest of the network combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a miner produces a block of transactions, it must be accepted by the full nodes for the miner to receive their reward. Otherwise they have simply burned a huge amount of energy for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is expected that miners will be running full nodes, but that is not always the case. It has become apparent that some skip doing this in some cases to increase profits (at the risk of greater loss due to lowered security).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some confusion arises from the fact that in the Bitcoin whitepaper and in early discussions the term 'node' was used to refer to both types of network participants. The overlap between miners and full nodes was extremely high. The distinction between the two became significant as mining became centralised and too burdensome for most network participants.

       Not Mr. Brown, but the new Satanic Panic is actually a much more effective avenue to crush the voters, not the Establishment. Many years ago I read an article that quoted one FBI agent as saying that "We've found that all men are *****" (I'm not going to write the word). In other words, with the current hysteria, they can easily manipulate the public to destroy itself. Which is what they're in the process of doing. PedoGate is intended to enslave America, full stop.

       There have been some articles on that recently. Short version is that they've just frozen my income from my publisher after having sent subpoenas to The Intercept, my agent, my publisher a few months back. Apparently they're claiming that a book contract with staggered advances is actually an "asset," even though I've already been paying it as income for restitution. I have a lawyer on it, but no telling how this will play out.

       Nope. I'm talking specifically about people who consider themselves "liberal" yet are trying to and have successfully shut down free speech and critical debate on college campuses, in liberal media outlets &amp; across social media platforms. Many people have begun calling this subgroup "neo liberal".

       These are people who insert themselves into category of "liberal" but seek to shut down debates &amp; speeches. How is it "liberal" to shut down free speech? They are called neo liberal by real liberals. Think of it like "neo con" to conservatives. Neo liberals are not real liberals like neo cons are not real conservatives. Keep up with American politics.

       Who's a troll? Barrett or me? I'm not trolling. Clearly nobody here has any idea what it is happening in the name of "liberalism" in America. I have voted Democrat ever since I turned 18 &amp; volunteer for campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ffs, do none of you keep up with what's happening to free speech by so-called "liberals"? They are anti-liberals masquerading behind the liberal progressive banner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your question is near sighted. Political campaigns rely on multi-faceted approaches &amp; ever since superpacs by external forces &amp; foreign money.

       It's obvious why Trump hasn't released his tax returns. But you know this.

       Liberalism... yeah some people take it too far, “stopping” free speech and all but that’s not liberals. That’s fucking crazy, extreme, people who are also, at times, liberals. But don’t for one second think it’s just liberals as the president of the United States is stating blatant lies and attacking the free speech media. That is 10,000x worse than a couple of Berkeley kids wanting to stop an asshole from promoting himself on their campus.

       I didn’t make assumptions - you made it blatant you think liberals want to stop free speech. That’s nutty. People on BOTH sides don’t want to hear what the other side is saying. But they aren’t saying you can’t say it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t seem to have any issues with free speech, I don’t ...but yeah, the liberal media is shutting it all down as you are spewing your bullshit freely. If you get shut down from saying something, let me know when and where and I’ll be there so even you can say it freely. My assumption? That will never happen.

       I believe you are talking about shutting down "fake news" stories perpetuated by the alt-right? Blatant lies, i.e. The birther movement, and hate speech have less protection under our constitution. Which is as it should because it amounts to propaganda to control the narrative.

       JFK and possibly RFK assassinations, 1999 Russian apartment bombings (indeed, no one informed on this can really dispute that it was an FSB operation), a bunch of other relatively minor things, and then of course the long list of CIA operations that they now admit to having conducted. No one who is unfamiliar with this latter base of information should be writing off any theory, but unfortunately there's a huge portion of journalists who consider themselves confident to determine prima facie what the U.S. will and won't do despite not taking the time to consider what it's actually done.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also something that I'm going to play close to my chest for a while, as it involves documented info that's not widely known yet and will be more viable if I put it out in a more formal way, a bit down the line. Actually it's something that my attention was directed to during the Anonymous stuff, based on a tip from someone we approached who had worked for Booz Allen Hamilton.

       There's little doubt that Putin was behind these, and the Smolensk air crash, and the murders of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya and many others. But Putin's motives are always an quasi-altruistic "what benefits Mother Russia" and in that respect his actions can be construed as morally abhorrent, but they are always morally consistent. If only US or UK leaders could claim the same.

       Could you go into a bit more detail on this? Putin sounds reasonable when he speaks (well, the subtitles do), but he is ultimately a national leader, which should put him in the Fuck-Him camp as far as I'm usually concerned. Is he a fascist or a friend?

       Putin is a Russian patriot. By all accounts, he has greatly self-enriched himself as the Russian President from unclear (but obviously corrupt) sources, but his political actions are always aligned with defending and/or promoting a long-term Russian agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       His military intervention in the Crimea, following the US led coup d'etat in Kyiv, is fully consistent with this, as a logical, necessary DEFENSIVE counter-measure:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) protecting the majority population of Crimea who are culturally/ethnic Russians,
      </p>
      <p>
       b) securing the Black Sea Fleet home port of Sevastopol,
      </p>
      <p>
       c) preventing the US from seizing the the large offshore natural gas reserves in the Black Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin's actions in Syria, are similarly a logical, defensive measure to protect Russian interests in the region. Syria has been Russia's regional ally for decades, and the port city of Tartus in Syria is now Russia's only naval base outside of Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you look at the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas etc, their international military interventions have not been "patriotic" in essence, or in long-term US strategic interests. They have been motivated by
       <strong>
        short-term profit for the US elite, the military-industrial complex, and strategic wishes of teh Jewish-American pro-Israeli lobby
       </strong>
       . The interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria etc etc have have not benefited the US (its people, its strategic long term interests) in any way whatsoever.

       I know this is late. But are you suggesting it is ok for Russia to do things morally wrong in the interests of its nation and allies? But not the same for the US to do the same? What a double standard.

       You didn't mention 9/11; the most blatant false flag operation in U.S. history, and the primary fuel for the murderous military invasions of the Middle East (and soon the Far East) and the rapid police state expansion at home.

       He didn't mention it on purpose. The question was which conspiracies does
       <em>
        HE
       </em>
       believe has merit and should be investigated thoroughly...
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, 9/11 is such a shit show. I hate to say that but it's actually quite obvious that because it's been twisted up in so many ways (
       <em>
        memorialized
       </em>
       , even) that I don't think the general population will ever really know what went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone is in the dark about it, either. Whatever repercussions seem to have resulted from 9/11 would've come anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to think about how powerful 9/11 is and how deeply rooted it is in American culture. It's literally become a icon. #NeverForget (NEVER FORGET, NEVER FORGET WHAT?)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just... if I were him I wouldn't mention it either. I'm glad we've got truthers for 9/11, but you guys seriously need to work on shedding the culture that celebrates it in the sickest way.

       It's not going in my book and I've explained very clearly why I'm not going to just throw it out without preparation, so obviously I've said nothing along those lines, which is why you had to just sort of make it up. Meanwhile, anyone is free to decide for themselves whether someone who spends all day posting insults on message boards is more or less likely to end up with a dick in his mouth in prison than someone like me.

       I take a break from it so i wouldn't say all day. But even if that was true, how does it feel knowing that whilst you tied that rope of soap with an extra knot so you didnt get another visit from Big Bubba in the showers i was out as a free man enjoying life and spending all day posting insults on message boards. Part two to my question, How was the cockmeat sandwich? I looked up your picture on google and I'm willing to put money on the fact they tore that ass up and you had no choice but to take it. Did your daddy make you turn your pocket out (from your trousers I mean, don't want to hear about a prolapsed anus after your 5th shower room encounter).

       But wait a minute. You did end up in prison with a dick in your mouth.... So you're wrong on that one friend. I on the other hand have not been sucking dick. Nor have I been in prison for 4 years... So people that are free to decide for themselves and not have a parole officer double check for them will come to the same conclusion. You moron. No wonder you got locked up and achieved nothing for it.

       Hey BB how you doin? 
What's your opinion on the epidemic of fake new? Is it confirmation bias, the echo chambers social media creates, or are the evil reptilian overlords creating escapes that appear utopian to those who indulge in the self congratulation kind of gratification, so they're blinded to the dystopian realities?

       looks somewhat promising for distributed video. It's based on the WebTorrent protocol which offers BitTorrent natively in modern browsers. I'm still a bit wary about how they'll deal with copyrighted and/or illegal material, and I don't know if they've released their code or plan on open sourcing it, but it's a good step in the right direction regardless.

       I'm getting the distinct impression the US is heading towards some form of civil war, given the escalation in mass-shootings, social division &amp; anger. Maybe this is being fueled by increased public awareness through the internet. Do you have any views on this?

       I've been predicting a sort of low-intensity, propaganda-heavy civil war situation for a while now, but it's very hard to say exactly what form it might take, if it will be sparked by some particular event, etc. There are just too many factors in play, and so much of what happens depends on specific events and how they're viewed.

       Hi Barrett! Two questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       In a response here, you mention Pursuance being a seven year effort thus far. Does

       </a>
       of yours from 2010 document an early description of the vision or something similar that you had in mind strictly for Project PM?
      </p>
      <p>
       For several months, I've been hauling a copy of "Flock of Dodos" around the west. At this time, do you know when there'll be a chance to get it signed during a protest or something?

       Persona management, which involves the deployment of fake online people that can be used by an operator via software that facilities ongoing conversations, is the best example. It came out of the HBGary e-mails; CENTCOM later admitted to using it. We found a few patents and other documents that told us a bit more about how it worked and how advanced it was in the years prior. For more info on that and other matters, see

       They are always pro-establishment. They don't have any substance behind their ideology. They have no empathy. They don't sound like anyone you've ever met.

       I think I've ended up in dialogue with fake human bots on here several times. They exist to enrage you and waste your time. I think lots of times 'troll' and 'bot' are one and the same.

       It's barely a thing. I was contacted by one of the people who had run the Chanology campaign after I wrote a piece for Huffington Post in early 2010 predicting that it would eventually be capable of toppling governments. Later, when Anonymous involved itself in Tunisian uprising, he suggested I check out the server from which this was being done, and I started working with them.

       That depends on which one sees our efforts as more potentially dangerous to the other faction. Right now, Russian propaganda outlets like RT and Sputnik promote my stuff because they know I'm mostly the U.S.'s problem, and rightly assume that we'll never gain any traction in Russia given that the populace there is essentially authoritarian anyway. That's a pretty common scenario, though; royal France supported American Revolution for similar reasons of sticking their chief enemy with troublesome internal uprisings.

       This is my question, I'm not even sure we have a full understanding of the intelligence communities limitations based on their perceived resources.

      <p>
       Wasn't AES256 cracked by quantum computing?
      </p>

       Is it safe to say the survailence state has colluded with manufactures to build backdoors into the BIOS hardware? Is there any safe hardware now? I use Dd-wrt firmware on my routers, but Xfinity/Comcast doesn't allow me to put a custom firmware on my modem. VPN seems the only way to mitigate this, however I only went to college for 2 years and creating a fast stable VPN was complicated even for me and I have some training on it. Most home networks don't have resources or intelligence to create survailence state proof networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Microsoft's home group technology is garbage and it seems Active Directory is the way to go for home users, but the learning curve and costs prevent most home end users from using directory services to manage their home network.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a security expert, but I work for the health authority as network engineer. We spend a lot of time sandboxing data to see if it is compromised before we allow the end user to view it. But we have the resources to do it. Most consumer end users have no idea how to make safe data decisions with the consumer grade hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does the average end user begin building an anonymity set, how can they be sure their hardware hasn't been compromised?
      </p>
      <p>
       its fascinating to think we can still maintain an anonymity set with limited resources.

       TOR seems pointless if your the only one on your street (using it) as it can still be discovered via triangulation.

       What do you think of the media propagated alternative journalists like Kim Dotcom, Glenn Greenwald, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Sibel Edmonds and Jeremy Scahill?  Are they government controlled and limited opposition or real genuine whistleblowers in the vein of Gary Webb, Danny Casolaro, Kevin Ryan, and Barry Jennings?

       Some whistleblowers seem to get all the media attention and spotlight while others are straight up killed or ignored.

       I think an interesting story/article/segment would be for you, Greenwald, and Scahill to fly over to the UK and spend two weeks interviewing and probing around in Assange's head and allowing him to do the same with each of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of your combined knowledge coupled with everyones excellent writing styles would make for an amazing article.
      </p>

       Topics could vary and be about numerous people/issues but interestingly broken down and detailed with the data and research we have come to expect.

      <p>
       What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking headlines, likes, shares and page views out of the ass.

       Hi Barrett,

      <p>
       I really admire the work you've done while knowing there are probably large entities that would like to stop you. You even served time over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am leaving my job in the stock market industry because I feel it's only adding to the overall problem and is not fullfilling. As you're building out the Pursuance System are you adding people right now or soon who can help to build this?
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, are you looking to hire? Can we talk?

       Hi Barrett! Thank you for your sacrifice!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a question regarding Pursuance. I may be misunderstanding the fundamentals of your project, but it seems to be a platform for citizens to investigate, share, and discuss potential crimes not given proper attention (?). As I'm sure you're familiar, Reddit was full of participation this past election cycle when it came to the story of
       <em>
        PizzaGate
       </em>
       , which had it's moments, but eventually faded to nonexistence, and is now labeled a prime example of "Fake News". Now, as someone who actually looked into the topic in depth, and was quite surprised by the implications of past cases/coverups, I believe that PG8 actually has some merit to it, yet it is, in the public eye, a witch-hunt. My question is; would Pursuance filter potential 'investigations', and, if so, what would that process look like?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks!

       I've followed a good portion of your story, although admittedly not all. 
Observations:well dressed - well spoken - pleasant...your family must be proud. 
In We are Legion I believe, you were interviewed in a library or office with lots of books.

       Between the Brooks Bros, J Crew, and the copious books, I realized we would probably be good friends. Come to Portland, Maine. It's good here. We can chill and I will nod and pretend I can follow your convo.

       Off-topic,; you pled to conspiracy? I thought it was just for threatening the FBI guy. Did anybody actually use the credit card info accidentally exposed?

       Hi Barrett,

      <p>
       I would like to know what you think about the Matt DeHart case and it's latest developments of trying to keep him in jail an extra year by discounting his time served in Canada.  Also, what can supporters do for those that are behind bars?  What did you wish you received more of (letters, books, cash at the commissary?).

       Do you think this reasoning has any value Mr. Brown (I mean in the abstract as I personally have nothing against transgender persons--however, the ideologies used to prop up such phenomena do strike me as very redolent of Frankfurt School theorizing, in their reverse): To quote from this article on the 'White Horse Dialogue': "To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse." The non-woman is argued to be a woman, thus ultimately undermining the social reality of woman as independent biological reproductive existent and force, a phenomenon which still anthropologically translates into the coherent and operable concepts and units of womanhood that have so facilely, in conjunction with empirical scientific advances, materialized into the world's present human population dynamics and numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The ten thousand [transgender etiologies] are one [woman]."
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical purpose of such illogicality would be natal population control wherever needed: control the logic, control the process, control the empirical outcomes. Traditionally defined biological women and men in their impoverished billions are thus rendered into an amorphous, pullulating blob or chaff called bare life, a human biological terra nullia; what Italian philosopher Agamben has called 'Homo Sacer': the barest human life, the intrinsic organization (and therefore rights) of which is unrecognized and/or unperceived by the advancing liberal ethos of transgender and related non-empirically-based illusory "rights." Such are the future ghost people who will inherit the lands of the biological ones presently treated or declared as ghosts, inexistents, etrangeres in their natal lands; the same logical legerdemain that argues that the Palestinian people do not and never have existed is operative in the declarations that "the ten thousand things are one horse;" "the ten thousand foreign origins of Israeli Jews is one single origin that surmounts that of the non-existent autochthonous Palestinians;" it is the logic that seeks to make biological women strangers to/within their own bodies and social spaces.

       I’ve seen all of the Anonymous stuff about you on We Are Legion and Hacker Wars. I truly appreciate what you have done to stand up for the rights of many. I actually got excited when I saw this a little bit ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is about trying to dumb down Pursuance a little bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is it basically a social networking type platform where there is someone who creates a “group” and that group will have some sort of ID that will be set and able to give to others requesting permission to that “group”? Kinda like Discord but for face-to-face or is it IRC or voice chat? Also, to make it even more simple and dumbed down, will it be like Discord to an extent?

       This is a good criticism that we are taking to heart -- we need to explain Pursuance in simpler terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuance will launch with these features: task management (you can assign tasks to people and give them due dates), chat, and file-sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talk about this, and much more, in my giant answer to many questions here:

       Oh my gosh thank you! I’m a computer programmer (still very new though) but even I needed it dumbed down. I really like the concept of this, and can see that the need for this will be basically anywhere where there is file sharing and/or anonymity is a must, want, or need to spread or share information. I can see myself creating a Pursuance for a few different reasons, or even joining them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last question, very simple: One Pursuance can be connected with another to an extent, right? I think I saw it somewhere but just wanted to double check.

       Yes, soon you'll be able to create a task within one pursuance and assign it to another pursuance.  Participants of each of those pursuances who have sufficient privileges will be able to view/comment on/collaborate around that shared task and any sub-tasks it is broken down into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relatedly, the first people we invite to make accounts within our Pursuance System server will form a talent pool of activists, journalists, researchers, academics, and more that pursuances will be able to draw from.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're always trying to think of more ways that pursuances can collaborate/share resources/etc in the future, so let us know if there's any other promising ways you can think of!

       All of our code is open source and free to use, and Pursuance is now officially a non-profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our instance of the Pursuance System will be free to use.  We are thinking about becoming financially self-sustaining through support contracts, training sessions for non-profits and companies who want to use Pursuance to make their staff more effective, dual licensing (so that companies can fund our software development if they want to add features to Pursuance that they don't contribute back), enabling large nonprofits to directly take donations via their pursuance hosted on our server, setting groups up with their own Pursuance server for a small fee, a combination of the above, or perhaps some other ways we've yet to think of (ideas welcome!
       <a href="https://twitter.com/PursuanceProj">
        @PursuanceProj
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       First we're doing a crowdfunding campaign in the next couple months so we can build out the full, epic vision of Pursuance, so stay tuned!
      </p>

       Sounds like a plan. I’ll PM you on any other ways I can think of about helping you find more ways about funding though. One obvious way (that you probably already know) would be to make it so anyone can donate. Other than that I’m not sure right now. I will definitely be using this though for whatever reasons. I feel like a possible competitor of yours would be Google with their Google Drive capabilities. You’ll definitely see me on Pursuance soon though😁👍🏻

       You have said this is the age of the nonstate actor. I believe you explained that you meant this is the age of individuals making changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I however read it like a lawyer – this is the age of privatization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just outsourcing deep state intelligence to for-profit corps. but pretty much every other governmental function too, e.g., Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), which is slowly figuring out profits are higher from electronic monitoring and GPS devices than private prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       And federal courts are employing private collection agencies to collect things like, for instance, restitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Education is doing the same thing with student loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes lots of money for corps. and de facto removes constitutional protections for individuals since a private party can't violate your constitutional rights. (Well, there is some old case law that says if a private company is performing a government function they can, but appellate courts don't bother with it anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
       So as far as I can tell we really do have a corporatocracy.  Will Pursuance end that?  Individuals making changes?

       A perfect example would be that the government is prohibited from listening to your conversations without a warrant.  But they can demand that phone providers do it and store it and give it to them on demand.  not only are they technically not doing this spying, but they don't even have to pay the private company to in effect do it on their behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really seems to be a running theme in these intelligence communities that what they are doing is so important it puts them above any sort of law and the constitution itself is just this pesky thing to be circumvented wherever it inhibits them from pursuing their secret agendas.

       Yes, actually by the time they subpoena the ISP or  phone provider, in my experience, they have already used malware or some sort of illegal surveillance device to identify your IP address. From that they can find out your provider and then simply serve an administrative subpoena on the provider to get your identifying information. They then use this as probable cause to obtain search warrants for your phone or computer.

       He did mention being on Suboxone... which is an opiate antagonist that mimics the brain's reaction to opiates but doesn't get you "high" (unless you are taking more than prescribed). Suboxone can be used as a taper to get off opiates entirely or patients can opt to use it for the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually pretty impressed he was able to get enough Subs to last him the entire 4 years in prison. Quite honestly, if Subs were allowed in prison (monitored by a doctor), they wouldn't have such a big problem with people sneaking in Oxys and Heroin. There's really no way for someone to "cheek" suboxone as they are dissolvable strips you put under your tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, here's hoping he continues using the Subs and doesn't slide back to H.

       From my experience, less is more with Suboxone. A few years ago, I was prescribed an 8mg strip per day, but after doing research on it and seeing how long it's half life is, I was able to taper myself down to where 1 8mg strip would last me over 3 weeks and I would still get a buzz sometimes.

       Good on you. Tapering yourself down that fast is an accomplishment. Although, I think (as doctors are tend to do), they prob over prescribed you. Obviously, I have no knowledge of your use or willpower. But, I wanted to congratulate you because I could've never done that (and didn't!)

       I'm reading a book by Angela Nagle called "Kill All Normies." She, in small part, connects the rise of far right ideology in online sub cultures to members of anonymous being arrested, and/or being oppressively surveilled into hiding. This may have caused a vacuum of more left leaning voices on popular forums. Could you speak to this, and how has the popularity of these views affected people in your circles? Has it fractured any groups or created conflict?

       The questions to be asking are: What does it mean when the government professes to be protecting the public from terrorism while also spending over a billion dollars promoting al-Qaeda/ISIS in Syria while lying to the public about it through their colluding media? 
What does it mean when the government and media pretend to care about human lives here in the USA while encouraging their terrorists to take over half a million lives (kids, families, elderly people, gay, brown, white, all religions) in Syria? What faith should we hold in our government that they didn't do this? Why the cognitive dissonance? Is it possible that its all about control? Who benefits from all the deception and killing? Cui Bono?

       Make plans early to protect yourselves -- especially against the IRS who will inevitably claim you owe them millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you guys read up on past citizen's investigation groups. Read up on CAJI (Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence) for example, and I definitely suggest reading up on what happened to its leader,
       <a href="http://supremelaw.org/authors/cooper/cooper.htm">
        Bill Cooper
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't overreach as Cooper did, and make sure you keep the internet constantly updated with your situation so you can't be quietly silenced.
      </p>

In other words, rather than arriving at a consensus about what happened, CT will be divided and will waste time endlessly "chasing the white rabbit"?

       Julian Assange just tweeted that he believes that the FBI was behind the Las Vegas mass shootings. Did you ever encounter any morally wrong doings by the FBI that would make you believe them capable of doing something this terrible to American citizens?

       No he didn't.

       There are many fake Julian Assange twitter accounts, and -if you are being sincere- you may have read it at a fake account.

      <p>
       To be sure, Assange's real twitter handle is:

       Thanks. I’ll look for his account. Why would you believe that I’m insincere? I asked you about a government organization that may have problems that you may have encountered. I did not question you and your claims or whether you are sincere. You apparently found problems with the DOJ. How is it a leap to ask about the FBI? Now I’m wondering about your sincerity.

       Why wouldn’t I be sincere? You claim DOJ broke the law and I didn’t question you. Why are you questioning me?

       I feel sorry for what happened to you Mr. Brown.  I admire and respect the fact that, despite your recent difficulties, you still endeavor to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel you have experienced things that would shake the foundations of most people's beliefs and yet you fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe those of us (me) that are pessimistic about the future of mankind can look to your example and decide to fight along with you even if the outcome is uncertain.

       I don't have specifics on that yet, and I'm not sure if our project developer Steve Phillips has thought more about it yet; there are a number of ways it can be done, of course. Incidentally, it's one of the more important aspects of all this, as it allows everyone to use pursuance in perpetual best-practices style rather than having to reinvent the wheel, and will foment continual evolution of the structures people use to accomplish their tasks.

       Wow. Thanks for a comprehensive reply. Can you link me to any further information about these matters? I'm very ignorant about Russian politics, and geopolitics in general in this regard.
