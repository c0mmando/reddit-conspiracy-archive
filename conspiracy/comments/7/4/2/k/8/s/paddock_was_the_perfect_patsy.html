        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just think about it.</p>

<p>At first, I was thinking that if the guy was setup and used as a fall guy then why didn&#39;t they choose someone with a criminal record? Dark skin? Religious? Young? Someone with something many parts of the public can grasp onto and subscribe motives to in order to seemingly expain why the shooting happened.</p>

<p>But what they did is do the opposite for once. They pinned it on a total blank slate. A white, retired boomer with no criminal record and no religious or overt political affiliations. This way instead of the public focusing in on the perpetrator and his or her motives they are forced to focus on <em>guns</em> in general instead.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a dark skinned individual, which stops knee jerk reactions from racists. It wasn&#39;t a muslim, which stops conservatives and Christians from pointing fingers. It wasn&#39;t a millennial or younger, which stops the older crowd blaming it on the youth and culture. It had no criminal record and was a retired boomer. It wasn&#39;t <em>poor</em> and angry because of thisâ€”the man was worth millions.</p>

<p>This man is the perfect fall guy if you want the country to solely focus on <em>guns</em> and gun laws and legality. The perfect blank slate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes no sense. Why would &quot;they&quot; choose a person with no clear motive that would make everybody wonder aloud why and how such a thing could happen?</p>

<p>Entirely too many conspiracy theories boil down to some unspecified &quot;them&quot; being both omnipotently powerful and utterly incompetent at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes complete sense. OP isn&#39;t the only one thinking this. I was thinking about this earlier today as well. The guy had zero reason to do what he did. No motive, nothing. Now the media can say that normal, healthy minded individuals can carry out mass violence with guns. Before they tried to pin the blame on the ability of the mentally ill to buy guns. Now they can say that it doesn&#39;t matter, and that nobody should own them. I&#39;ve already seen this narrative being mentioned in my Facebook news feed. OP is 100% correct.</p>

<p>Well obviously he had a <em>reason,</em> we just don&#39;t know what it was. We may never know. The sad truth is sometimes people just lose it and go on killing sprees. It&#39;s been happening every few months for decades. This is just an especially bad one.</p>

<p>Dude, <em>nobody</em> thinks this guy was normal or healthy. He shot up a crowd of people! He was <em>by definition</em> neither normal nor healthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the idea is to get gun reform, then Paddock is actually the perfect fall guy in my opinion.  If an Average Joe with no criminal history, no signs of snapping, no financial/religious/political motive, all legally purchased weapons, etc. can do this, then the only option is to not let people have guns.  If it&#39;s a terrorist or criminals with illegal weapons, the other side has a stronger argument to be able to protect themselves.  I don&#39;t know one way or the other but I like hearing everyone&#39;s theories.  </p>

<p>now if this was a real event, there would not be photoshopped pictures from the drill from last month.</p>

<p>&#39;they&#39; planned this shooting, it was setup.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a Muslim shooting a gay night club, then the problem is Muslims. If it&#39;s Dylan Roof shooting a black church, it&#39;s racism. If it&#39;s Chicago, it&#39;s just criminals being criminals and we should ignore it.</p>
