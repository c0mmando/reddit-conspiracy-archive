<p>Meanwhile she is outside country in United Arab Emirates so she cant be blamed.</p>

<p>And isnt she phillipino muslim?</p>

<p>Doesnt it make more sense than a guy with no gun experience suddenly having weapons and popping them off like a syrian isis member?</p>

<p>Poloce say paddock was dead when they got in theroom. So they dont really have any way of knowing whether he had been killed 30 minutes before.</p>

<p>He was apparently shot in the chest. How many suicides shoot themselves in the chest?</p>

<p>I dont think any videos from the shooting record one final suicide shot which wouod have been heard on the street if window was already broken. Handguns are loud.</p>

Being rich and the last point would not make it hard for him to acquire an arsenal. Yet, the man had a pilot&#39;s license (much like this Utah man who belonged to a Hindu Temple who has still not been caught after three women and many dead animals  were found on his Idaho property. <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/crime/article159042939.html">http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/crime/article159042939.html</a>-theories have it he has connections and won&#39;t get caught. <a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2017/08/man-wanted-in-murder-case-possibly-spotted-near-mesa-falls/">https://www.eastidahonews.com/2017/08/man-wanted-in-murder-case-possibly-spotted-near-mesa-falls/</a>) which specified that he was in need of glasses for &quot;near vision&quot; (far-sighted, like me? or-).</p>

<p>So if she coordinated with the actual shooter and gave him her id and told him where to go then she would be out of the country when it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an interesting theory that he was used for the room and didnt know the shooters, but maybe the gf did. If that is case should show other people coming in and out of the room. Maybe they acted like they were his friends and then killed him and went ahead with the shootng and then ran out? If other people are involved we wil eventually find out. I expect lots of different theories to crop up in the meantime. </p>
