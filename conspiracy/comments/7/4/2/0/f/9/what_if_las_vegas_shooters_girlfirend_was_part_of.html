       What if Las Vegas shooters girlfirend was part of terrorist squad and coordinated with terrorist who used her info to get into the room and killed Stephen Paddock in room before shooting and left before police came?

      <p>
       Meanwhile she is outside country in United Arab Emirates so she cant be blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And isnt she phillipino muslim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesnt it make more sense than a guy with no gun experience suddenly having weapons and popping them off like a syrian isis member?
      </p>
      <p>
       Poloce say paddock was dead when they got in theroom. So they dont really have any way of knowing whether he had been killed 30 minutes before.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was apparently shot in the chest. How many suicides shoot themselves in the chest?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think any videos from the shooting record one final suicide shot which wouod have been heard on the street if window was already broken. Handguns are loud.

       She had also only been seeing him for under a year. So, a phillippino woman working for ISIS (who also spent a lot of time in arabic countries according to her photos) seduces a rich american guy, then they deliver guns and camera equipment at his suite/room and kill him, taking over the room for an attack.

       True. But it seems that most of the ISIS members in the Phillippines are from Indonesia or other predominantly-Muslim countries.

       On the other hand, ISIS did claim responsibility.

       That's my theory. Also the shot security guard is part of it. The only cover up is that we didn't catch it. Too much concentration on the middle east and not the Philippines.

       I pointed out earlier that gambling is really against Muslim beliefs, and most isis events are done in the name of Allah and assume the extremists would be all about sharia law too. And a lot of Filipinos are catholic. The Catholic Church I went to when I was a kid had a few Filipinos .

       Those others don't know either. Even the cops don't much yet.
I'm on Reddit because I want to.

       It is an interesting theory that he was used for the room and didnt know the shooters, but maybe the gf did. If that is case should show other people coming in and out of the room. Maybe they acted like they were his friends and then killed him and went ahead with the shootng and then ran out? If other people are involved we wil eventually find out. I expect lots of different theories to crop up in the meantime.
