        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">327</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/murphy212.html">murphy212</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>If you are not yet aware TPTB are superstitious freaks obsessed with numbers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUXTzVj5-uE#t=07m11s">here is an introductory lesson by Christine Lagarde</a> (starts at 7:11). </p>

<p>I can also recommend the subreddit r/OccultConspiracy, although it could use more subscribers/activity. And there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3gJZw6X-LA">Mark Passio&#39;s famous presentation</a> on the occult side of 911, where he convincingly breaks down why that date was chosen, the flight numbers, tower numbers, and related symbols.</p>

<p>If, by this point, you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; this to be a thing, if you think breaking ground for the Pentagon&#39;s construction <em>just happened by coincidence</em> on September 11 1941 (70 years before 911), or George HW Bush infamous &quot;new world order&quot; speech <em>randomly occurred</em> on Sept. 11 1990 (11 years before 911), or if you think Lagarde&#39;s numerology speech linked above <em>just happened</em> to take place 911 days before the Nice massacre, <strong>please do not read the rest of this post.</strong></p>

<p>Similarly if you think in Manchester it is by <em>chance</em> that a 22-year old blew himself up on the 22nd at <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-40010124">22:33</a> at -2.2 longitude and killed 22 people (and that 119 people were initially reported injured) ... please do not carry on.</p>

<p>Finally if you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibel_Edmonds#Operation_Gladio_B">don&#39;t know</a> about <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/silencing-a-whistle-blower-gladio-b-and-the-origins-of-isis-sibel-edmonds/5475126">Gladio B</a>, or <a href="https://libcom.org/files/NATOs_secret_armies.pdf">Gladio before it</a>, stop reading now.</p>

<p>But most importantly: if you fall in these categories, if you are unfamiliar with the symbols and hermetic references, please kindly do not downvote. Let us have this <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/6pex2i/i_caught_the_central_planners_playing_a_cheap/">kind of conversation</a>. And don&#39;t worry, my OP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceS_jkKjIgo">won&#39;t give you leperacy.</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, there will be plenty enough shills to downvote this OP, to say things akin to &quot;numerology is not science&quot;, &quot;the date formats are not the same&quot;, or to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">condescendingly regurgitate</a> the &quot;you will find anything if you look hard enough&quot; argument (otherwise known as the &quot;you will find Phi and Pi in a kitchen stool therefore the dimensions of the Great Pyramid of Giza are completely random&quot; argument).</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Hermetic Pattern</strong></p>

<p>The same patterns as in Manchester, as in 911, as in Nice, as in Bataclan, as in nearly all terrorist attacks since 911, emerge in this &quot;Las Vegas shooting&quot;. All the usual hermetic numbers and symbols appear; it is so obvious, it is difficult not to think <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5v7fwp/the_conspiracy_of_trust_or_why_didnt_they_simply/">they want us to realize this.</a> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The attack happened 133 days after the &quot;Ariana Grande&quot; Manchester false-flag attack</p></li>
<li><p>If you count the lobby as the first floor (you should), the alleged shooter was on the 33rd floor</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#39;t, he was on the 32nd; there are 32 paths of wisdom in Kabbalah; 32 is 23 inverted; the hotel opened on a March 2nd (32); the 2nd tower was announced on 05/23/2002 (day is 23, sum is 32); the 2nd tower opened on 12/17/03 (sum is 32); on the 32nd floor 2 windows were broken (322).</p></li>
<li><p>The Mandalay Bay has a total of 3309 rooms, the 2nd tower has 1122 rooms.</p></li>
<li><p>The 2 broken windows are 9-11 apart (not counting the broken windows and counting the broken windows respectively)</p></li>
<li><p>The festival was &quot;route 91&quot;, &quot;harvest&quot;, by &quot;sirius&quot; and 22&#39;000 people were in attendance</p></li>
<li><p>October 1st is 91 days away from the end of the year</p></li>
<li><p>Stephen Paddock is 440 in gematria</p></li>
<li><p>The shooting happened at the foot of a pyramid (with a light atop), facing an obelisk and a sphinx ...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are <em>many</em> other elements I&#39;m not even bothering listing, as I don&#39;t find them conclusive enough ... the <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fozzVO0n4Tw/WdJ8cNDzCOI/AAAAAAACxuU/d-a_hr5S3VoSl137Oiq2QQD1WETIisD3wCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-10-02%2Bat%2B10.50.08%2BAM.png">firetruck 33</a>, the particular holiday on which this occurred ... I think it&#39;s enough.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Like attacks before it, this was not merely an inside job / false-flag attack. It was a ritual occult mass-sacrifice.</p>

<p>One goal is so the sheep who don&#39;t understand this think they are safe nowhere, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">rest learns helpnessless.</a>  </p>

<p>I will say this: combat evil, manifest outrage, but do not fear it, and do not hate them. Imagine how ridiculous, uncreative, sad one must be to be doing this; these people were babies too one day, they weren&#39;t always evil. It is possible to empathize with their predicament; especially once you realize that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/?st=j8bwgdk5&amp;amp;sh=7e15ee41">ultimately nothing can harm you, and there is strictly nothing to fear.</a></p>

<p>Oh, and shills: you can kindly go fuck yourselves :-D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am a schmo.  </p>

<p>But at least I am a schmo who knows that Aristotle was not a materialist according to any of the most common definitions of the term.</p>

<p>20th century science is in fact the outcome of the enlightenment, which the re-discovery of Aristotle&#39;s works brought about.  Without that rediscovery, modern science would not exist.</p>

<p>Platonism quite frankly fucks up everything it touches.  It is from Platonism that all the tyrannical ideologies have sprung forth from, because it is in Plato that imaginations take ontological priority over empirical reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aristotle was refuted before he ever wrote. Read Ecclesiastes, reasoning only from observations leads to utter meaninglessness.</p>

<p>The scientific method is not Aristotelian. It requires a hypothesis (a Platonic form not coming from direct observation) which is then tested.</p>

<p>As bad as Plato&#39;s Republic is, Aristotle wrote in defense of slavery as a natural result of some being inherently better than others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re so far off base you&#39;re in a different stadium.</p>

<p>Aristotle never claimed or implied that &quot;reasoning only&quot; is the method.  Ironically it was Plato who believed that.  Ideal forms the product of pure reason is the true reality while observable, empirical differences are mere reflections of the true reality.  Aristotle held the exact opposite, which is what the modern scientific method calls for!</p>

<p>Plato defended slavery as well.  But you cannot refute anyone&#39;s arguments by pointing to other beliefs they had such as about slavery.  That is spoiling the well fallacy.  It is not relevant, no more than Isaac Newton believing in God has any bearing on the scientific legitimacy of his theories on mechanics.</p>

<p>The modern scientific method is only possible because Islamic clerics stored Arostotle&#39;s manuscripts for 1500 years and they were rediscovered by European philosophers, which directly launched the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.</p>

<p>Aristotle was himself a scientist.  For example he studied biology and utilized an initial form of what we now call the scientific method.</p>

<p>You have been brainwashed by stupid teachers my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we are pn the numerology topic I would like to point out something that I realized a bit ago: The Georgia Guide Stones were publicly unveiled on March 22, 1980.  March 22 = 322.  322 is the number of the Skull and Bones secret society, and in my opinion is a reference to Genesis 3:22 which talks of man becoming like gods and living forever.  I believe that this is the ultimate promise of Freemasonry and their partner societies such as the Skull and Bones....they promise that their members will get to live forever through technology in a NWO.  Also, I think that Christine LaGarde&#39;s famous numerology speech initiated the start of a countdown to a manufactured Biblical end times and that we are just starting the latter half of this end times where shit is about to get real.  Also lately I have been theorizing that the timing of this end times was decided based on the impending return of planet X which will bring with it fire raining down from the skies due to its trailing debris, along with a massive tidal wave due to its gravitation as it passes by Earth.  This, I theorize is a ciclical thing that we have been dealing with over countless millenia, but that secret societies have been hoarding this knowledge for themselves.  I believe that the Mayan calendar was based on this and they predicted planet X&#39;s return to come in 2012 but their measurements and calculations were slightly off hence why it will happen a few years later.  Also, it would make sense to me that project blue beam has been planned for this event....they intend to stage an alien invasion at the same time as a pretext to install a world government to combat this manufactured threat, but they do actually have technology so advanced it will appear alien and we will have to deal with that crap too....and for icing on the cake I dont see why they wouldnt unleash genetically engineered creatures (Biblical in nature) to emerge from the &#39;pits of hell&#39; to make it all the more epic.  Of course it would all be recorded in high definition (maybe with Cern being used as an all seeing eye?) for them to relive over and over for their sick pleasures....Im speculating a little but yeah....numbers.  Thats what we were talking about...there&#39;s a YouTube channel I rediscovered recently that has some interesting shit....Hornby Island Mystery....might want to check that out too...</p>

<p>Also when you realize there are no rules, only repercussions. So if you don&#39;t create negative repercussions, you don&#39;t have to obey any rules.

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to share with you what stood out too me.</p>

<p>First and foremost was the Luxor pyramid and obelisk and sphinx that happened to be overlooking the entire event. And based on the Babylon rising Series by William cooper</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqTmAMKvSls">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqTmAMKvSls</a></p>

<p>This gentleman William cooper had a radio broadcast in the 90&#39;s detailing his research of Egypt, biblical history, occult societies and the history of the power houses throughout time.</p>

<p>He talked about the American worship of Isis/Columbia many years before Isis was a thing in its current context. He also died just after his prediction of a terrorist attack in new york that would have Osama Bin Laden as the “Scapegoat”.</p>

<p>So we’ve got a bit conspiracyish so I might have lost some people.</p>

<p>But lets take a look on Google earth, you can join me and check it out for yourselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/iiRWp2l">https://imgur.com/iiRWp2l</a></p>

<p>444.44 yards (2.22 nm)and 111.11 degrees from tip of the pyramid too center of the Harvest (my computer autocorrect too Harvey..... hmmm) festival.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/SSO2L5b">https://imgur.com/SSO2L5b</a></p>

<p>the same from the Mandalay Bay hotel too stage.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/rEstE0m">https://imgur.com/rEstE0m</a></p>

<p>and curiously enough from the Mandalay Bay hotel too the Luxor Pyramid capstone is 444.44.</p>

<p>An equilateral triangle of 444.44 yards forms between the 3 focal points.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/xUw8WA4">https://imgur.com/xUw8WA4</a></p>

<p>the angles of an equilateral triangle =60.60.60 or 666.</p>

<p>Another thing that jumped out at me was the height of the Mandalay shooter. Being on the 32nd floor this already has connotations of the 32nd degree of freemasonry.</p>

<p>The Luxor pyramid has the brightest light on earth, shooting up into the heavens. The metaphor of illumination and the light bringer are brought to mind.</p>

<p>The date counts have some interesting discoveries. 6Y 6M 6D Is the next total USA eclipse simaler to the last one.</p>

<p>6Y 6M 6W 6D before 10-1-17 was feb-14-11 The Day of Rage and the beginning of Arab spring.</p>

<p>Also I check to see who died and this gentleman passed on this day.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shearing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shearing</a></p>

<p>Shearing was a member of the Bohemian Club and often performed at the annual Bohemian Grove Encampments. He composed music for two of the Grove Plays.</p>

<p>Just a coincidence lol.</p>

<p>6M 6W 6D before 10-3-17 was Feb 14 2017. This was the day they evacuated oroville due too the Dam issue. On the day this happened I checked the date count of when oroville was founded and found that from its founding until its evacuation was 111Y 1M 11D. This is what I call a “Call back” Or a reference to previously researched dates found via Date counts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=1&amp;amp;d1=03&amp;amp;y1=1906&amp;amp;m2=2&amp;amp;d2=14&amp;amp;y2=2017">https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=1&amp;amp;d1=03&amp;amp;y1=1906&amp;amp;m2=2&amp;amp;d2=14&amp;amp;y2=2017</a></p>

<p>Also from 6-15-96 too 10-01-17 is 7777 days which is also 1111 weeks. From the Bombings in Manchester <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Manchester_bombing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Manchester_bombing</a></p>

<p>Stephen Paddock is the name of the shooter. Stephen means</p>

<p>“a first name from the Greek word στέφανος (stéphanos), meaning &quot;wreath, crown&quot; and by extension &quot;reward, honor&quot;, from the verb στέφειν (stéphein), &quot;to encircle, to wreathe&quot;.[2][3] In Ancient Greece, crowning wreaths (such as laurel wreaths) were given to the winners of contests. Originally, as the verb suggests, the noun had a more general meaning of any &quot;circle&quot;—including a circle of people, a circling wall around a city, and, in its earliest recorded use, the circle of a fight.” Paddock means An enclosure for Horses or other grazing animals like sheep or goats. Oftentimes set aside from the regular grazing area and usually a smaller enclosure.</p>

<p>Where does Marilyn Manson come in? Well I hadn&#39;t seen him in the news in Ages and I see a couple interviews of him talking about columbine, which came out on 9-23-17. Now He has a new album called heaven upside down. The first track on this album is “Revelation 12” which is the day of the Rev 12 sign.</p>

<p>So the day before The shooting Mr Manson was crushed under a giant GUN prop on stage.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzVCaxdb6vo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzVCaxdb6vo</a></p>

<p>So he comes out talking about Columbine The first big noted mass shooting in recent times. Then a couple days later is injured by a giant gun. The day after that we experience the biggest shooting in history.</p>

<p>So lets look at the songs he just released before the shooting.</p>

<p>Released Sept 11th..... hmmm</p>

<p><a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/weknowwhereyoufuckinglive.html">https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/weknowwhereyoufuckinglive.html</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s make something clear We&#39;re all recording this as it happens Those diamond-bullet storefront-blood-bank Splinters and stained glass</p>

<p>The world was stripped of its superficial surfaces We don&#39;t intend to just eat the street The asphalt is the good meat And we will sleep on the skin of its nightmares We will sleep on the skin of its nightmares &quot;It&#39;s time to just kill this crowd And scream as fucking loud...&quot;</p>

<p>We dont intend to eat the street. Its time to just kill this crowd and scream just as loud.</p>

<p>Fire fire fire fire fire away Fire fire fire fire fire away Fire fire fire fire fire away Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire away (22 fires)</p>

<p>I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man I love the sound of shells hitting the ground I love it</p>

<p>I really dont have to emphasize or doing any reaching here. This is pretty odd.</p>

<p>The next song off his album released 11 days before 10-01-2017 which is a 111 day. Kill4ME <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/kill4me.html">https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/kill4me.html</a></p>

<p>From the getgo the title is apt.</p>

<p>Your hotel hall won&#39;t be so vacant And I can tell that you ain&#39;t faking Because I take death threats Like the best of them
Hotel hall......</p>

<p>“This is a sacrifice.” Self explanatory.</p>

<p>The North American leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour will begin on September 29, and will incorporate dates at several music festivals, So the tour began and the gun fell upside down injuring him at the start of his tour.</p>

<p>So on further research This album was supposed to release on Valentines day.2-14-17.... Wait a tic. We just saw this date. 6M 6W 6D before 10-01-17 was this day the same day they evacuated oroville.</p>

<p>So since we are on the subject of lyrics. When I google Aldean the first thing that popped up was this song.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-truth-lyrics-jason-aldean.html">http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-truth-lyrics-jason-aldean.html</a></p>

<p>“Tell em all I&#39;m out in Vegas, Blowin&#39; every dollar I ever made, Tell em that I must be into something bad for me cause, I sure lost a lot of weight.</p>

<p>The truth is that I&#39;m asking you to lie, And we both know that it ain&#39;t right, But if you ever loved me please, Have some mercy on me,</p>

<p>Tell &#39;em anything you want to Just don&#39;t tell &#39;em all the truth Yeah, don&#39;t tell &#39;em all the truth I still need you.”</p>

<p>A very odd coincidence.</p>

<p>So we&#39;ve already found that this day is reduced to 111. Notably when they were looking for Marilou danley the shooters wife. They used a picture with 4 ft 11 and 111 pds</p>

<p><a href="http://philippinesreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Marilou-Danley.jpg">http://philippinesreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Marilou-Danley.jpg</a></p>

<p>She apparently has multiple passports and marriages. Odd.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/marilou-danley-gunmans-girlfriend-social-security-number-677033?yptr=yahoo">http://www.newsweek.com/marilou-danley-gunmans-girlfriend-social-security-number-677033?yptr=yahoo</a></p>

<p>But about the 111</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Comparison_of_pyramids.svg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Comparison_of_pyramids.svg</a></p>

<p>The height of the Temple is 111 meters meaning the Brilliant capstone resides there.</p>

<p>The mandalay Bay hotel is 146 meters tall and is 43 stories tall (146/43) gives us the average meters per floor 3.4 meters x 32 floors 108.8 meters is where that estimates the height of the shooter. Which is pretty close to 111 meters</p>

<p>This specificity in positions is not an accident. As this entire part of Vegas is owned By MGM formally Circus Circus with underground trams and tunnels connecting the areas.</p>

<p>And is amplified by the research into distances between the Mandalay, Luxor and the stage. 444.44 yards connects these 3 points which makes that equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>Then you have at least 3 accounts of a woman Telling everyone they are going to die, this woman was labeled Hispanic by this person and dark skinned by another person. She says that they escorted her out. If this is true security personnel would have something to say on the subject.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8erNnK9Xu4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8erNnK9Xu4</a></p>

<p>And you also have this preacher dude Standing in front of the concert doing his spiel. We&#39;ve seen this many times before so its not shocking, but its just an additional piece.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhbhQnzmIQo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhbhQnzmIQo</a></p>

<p>So the daily bible verse from Chabad.org is very applicable.</p>

<p>Chapter 60-65 of Psalms. Psalms is a book of verses written to music. So we have the musical connection.</p>

<p>Chapter 64 smacked me right in the face. Hard, jeez.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+64&amp;amp;version=NIV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+64&amp;amp;version=NIV</a></p>

<p>I take in all news and data points whenever I look into things, A holistic approach is required and nothing can be cast aside as not applicable.</p>

<p>I was startled to read the Tom Petty had a heart attack shortly after the Vegas shooting. The media then went back and forth saying he wasn&#39;t dead and then he was again. Tom petty was one of the founders of tom petty and the Heartbreakers, and he died of a broken heart.</p>

<p>He was 66Y 11M 11Days old on the day of his death and the Vegas attacks. This converts to 66y 345 days 34566.</p>

<p>So how does that connect back to Vegas because a linear connection isn&#39;t as solid as a fractal or spiral.</p>

<p><a href="http://lasvegas.eventful.com/events/tom-petty-/E0-001-096910854-1@2016102020">http://lasvegas.eventful.com/events/tom-petty-/E0-001-096910854-1@2016102020</a></p>

<p>This shows that Tom Pettys last performance in Vegas Was at the LUXOR hotel On his 66th birthday Almost a year from the Harvest that would take place on 10-01-17.</p>
