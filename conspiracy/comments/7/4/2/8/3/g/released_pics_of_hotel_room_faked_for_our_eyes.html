        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You know, one thing that crossed my mind is that maybe the shills in here were waiting to see what we were going to pick apart and what we were suspecting. it just so happens that right from the start speculation about modded rifles with a bump stock were a possibility and the only photo they release of the 23 rifles this guy had just happened to be exactly that. almost seems were being fed a narritive based on what is said in places like this.</p>

<p>Im just trying to think of ways one might stage something like this knowing that there are going to be CTs to pick it apart.  why not hold off on releasing info and wait to see what is being speculated about.  once you know where people are looking you can release info based on what critical thinkers are focused on.    If they have done this before (they have) they wont keep doing the same thing, eventually they will change tactics and modify the game as needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is where im comflicted, we NEED to discuss this stuff but they will always be present for the discussion.  People keep saying how there is a war behind the scenes between the deep state and shadow govt, etc.  I think even this seems a little pushed, see kevin shipp (may be wrong on the name) but he is a supposed cia whistleblower (still alive somehow) that is revealing all this civil war shit and info wars is helping to push that.  I think it a staged event just like any other event previous. </p>

<p>They realize people are waking and starting to wonder&gt; Make it seem like factions are fighting for control behind the scenes&gt; stage FF events and political shouting matches about the same old things&gt; then when things seem so dark we couldnt possibly go on, &quot;win&quot; the staged war and make it look like &quot;america is great again.&quot;  Trump is a total puppet but is ACTING like he is &quot;draining the swamp&quot;, this is all a show for us.  The real plan is to create new shadows to hide in.</p>

<p>funny how tour paid protection neither helps or protects you from this and also contribute to the wild west as you put it.</p>

<p>i agree that there needs to be some better system of tracking guns and buyers but taking away aspects of gun ownership little by little will surely end in complete gun remival, at least thats the obvious goal</p>

<p>See their website here:  <a href="https://danieldefense.com">https://danieldefense.com</a></p>

<p>It’s the same stock. I know, I have a couple of them. I’m not saying a bump fire stock wasn’t used, but I am saying that I’ve seen no pictures that depict one on the weapons that were allegedly used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can comment on is that the the rifles in the TMZ photos appear to have standard adjustable stocks, and one of them is clearly marked DD on the upper, a Daniel Defense trademark. This one also has the standard DD stock. DD is a rifle maker out of Georgia known for making excellent, tough rifles at a moderate to higher price range. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>As citizens we pay for protection. Instead we have armed assholes roaming the streets like the Wild West. So yes, gun control is an appropriate and timely topic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>funny how tour paid protection neither helps or protects you from this and also contribute to the wild west as you put it.</p>

<p>i agree that there needs to be some better system of tracking guns and buyers but taking away aspects of gun ownership little by little will surely end in complete gun remival, at least thats the obvious goal</p>
