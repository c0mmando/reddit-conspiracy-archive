       Then the next day he was sent away to receive “help” and the entire mainstream coordinated together to paint him as a lunatic who was going insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said they would get him, they got him, and still hardly anyone connected the fucking dots. They just blindly regurgitated the mainstream narrative that “lol Ye gone crazy bro”.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest artists on the planet, who is definitely involved with the elites, literally tells us to our face that everything we know is a lie, and people STILL couldn’t do it. They just couldn’t break the conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lost hope a while ago. We’re far too gone. The NWO will come, but I will be gone when it does. Either by suicide or because they’ll kill anyone who refuses to be “chipped” or whatever crazy control mechanism they have planned for us peasants. Either way I won’t be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for trying, Kanye but all it did was get you mkultra’d. I’m sorry 99% of people are too dumbed down to see you weren’t insane, but instead rediscovered your soul and were being 100% genuine.

       LOL Kanye West. Im'a just leave this here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye always had issues. Watch his early Interviews with Sway, you can tell he is not too bright, inarticulate, and more than a little off. He was trying to push a little bit of a gay agenda and about to fall out of the closet at one point. But he reeled it back in when it became clear Sway wasn’t having any.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a team of credited writers on every album and “earning” producer credits for approving a rhythm section on a track, his talent is debatable. He certainly can’t sing. He is not a wordsmith. When Nick Cannon is ghost writing for you, there is a problem. Most of his tracks sound phoned in and have no heart behind the voice. His antics, performing Niggers in Paris 17 times in a row (in Paris), then trying to force a wheelchair-bound concert goer to stand. Going off on rants then leaving the venue after only a couple of “songs”. He certainly isn’t a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Kums” faux robbery experience in France, the failed ticket sales for the rest of that tour. Yes Texas was packed but everything after that, tickets were going for half price and still couldn’t fill %40 of the seats. Prior to going on tour he was begging for money on Twitter. LMFAO He was trying to pull one over on the Insurance company to re-coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what stans think, Kanye is a complete simp. He “married” a woman who drank urine on video tape. The marriage you saw in Italy it is not real on paper. Kanye and Kim do not live together.  Kanye has been linked to Ricardo Tucci (spelling). Sure he “dated” Amber Rose she was cramming fingers in his ass. Kanye even ranted about that at a concert. Kanye at the very best is bisexual but mostly a classic self-loather, closet case with a humongous ego. He claims to still mourn the loss of his mother who died from plastic surgery. Look at his wife. She goes for treatments regularly. He says and does nothing. Because he could care less about his beard.  I am not saying being gay is a bad but think about what goes on in his head.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I am a big bad rapper. I keep it real but - I like the cock and my marriage is a sham?”
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am such a musical genius I put out all the best tracks - i never wrote."
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me started on the failed fashion line. Just look at those clothes. They are not designed. Levis jean jackets from the 80's - No no I am not going to go there. That would take up another wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy was always a ticking time bomb and headed for a breakdown. He did not need any type of MK-Ultra or “Illuminate” shit to push or manipulate him.

       Op paints a picture of Kanye being some victim of MK Ultra for spreading "common knowledge" and says the media is painting him as a lunatic. I am just here to say that is not true. Kanye is considered by most to be that fruity loony rapper.

       Well thanks for sharing but please realize that it actually doesn't matter that you have an opinion on Kanye at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       you chimed in defending a guy calling kanye loony partially because of his fashion line. you guys are hilarious. yours or anyone else's opinions of how 'loony' he is has absolutely 0 bearing on how much truth was in his matrix rant.

       if he was always mk ultra'd then he

       He is just a figure head. Those two things you mention aren't mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       His huge ego mixed with intense self loathing - theres no need for MK Ultra with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy was always a tool. Easily led into pushing divisive narratives. "GB doesn't like black people", "white people shouldn't review black music", and a beef with a then 16yo girl.

       Any celebrity that wants to stay working isn't going to say that. Kanye, his career and home life have been circling the drain for some time now. He has nothing to lose.

       Nice way to reframe everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Kanye said in his rant is true but it wasn't anything any middle-schooler who popped into to r/conspiracy for 20 minutes 2 years ago wouldn't already know.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is saying Kanye is influential, a great artist and most importantly  the media is trying to make him look like a lunatic.
That he somehow has been MK-Ultra-ed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't be further form the truth. Most people see him as a lunatic. He IS a simp, he IS easily manipulated, and he was trying to pull of an insurance scam by getting 5150-ed.

       Damn, you gave yourself away. People who think like you always do.
Let me guess: You hate that 'rap crap'. It's not 'even music', 'they' should just take it back to 'their' side of town. Also, 'it's not race, it's culture' and 'all lives matter'.

       It sounds like you got offended after painting with your wide brush didn't work. You contributed absolutely nothing to any of the points raised in the thread.

       You thought just because someone considers some "artists"names retarded, that makes that person a racist.

       Think about what you did.

       None of that dude's posts make a lick of sense.  Can't type properly for one, and uses terms meant to inflame.  C'mon, who uses the word "simp"?  Same playbook...attack, ridicule, question mental state, mental ability, age, and then a fuck you or fuck off at the end.  There are many commenters like this.  They get easier and easier to spot.  Running out of time, and running out of ways to give the runaround.  Cause they are dumb, mainly.

       It was admittedly lazy but it always makes me laugh with how petty it sounds. An insurance scam? Really? Guess I have to read his full comment as in depth as I need. I don't necessarily believe Ye was new-age lombotimized but the timing of his speech vs his hospitilization at that fateful UCLA facility that's inducted so many other celebrities... Idk. What does he need to do an insurance fraud for? I believe they are doing okay for themselves already

       The timing - ticket sales for the remained of tour were non existent it was hemorrhaging money. Kanye begs Zuck and others for money on twitter. Classy. Within the next couple of days the rant, the day after  pulls more shit and gets 5150. Tour called off and insurance claim filed.

       Very interesting, wasn't aware of all of these details before and not entirely surprised-wasnt a huge Weezy fan to begin with. No wonder it didn't get any play on msm or here after it happened. Just assumed he had pull still at this point. Did he get the money?

       That is true. There are a few versions of her "sex tape" that went around.

       Haven't you noticed on certain "gossip" or even on some rap forums. They'll refer to her as "Kimmode".

       There is more than one version. Check out rap or other celebrity  related forums where the members refer to her as "Kimmode". They probably know where to get it.

       You do realize on every "album" including the debut, there was a team of writers. They are even listed. So now, imagine how "simple" he really is if he needs others to come up with those bars and thinks they are good.

       He's batshit crazy, has an ego that is indefensible, and is an incredibly vulgar lyricist that puts together full teams for his albums. And yet he has produced some of the most forward-thinking, un-reproduceable albums of the last twenty years, ones that still sound fresher than other stuff from the same period. He is an artist in the purest sense of the word.

       this also oddly sounds like a defense of donald trump up until the end. nevertheless i didn't say he wasn't an artist just that i question people who think he really "speaks to them as an artist" so yeah.

       I feel by matrix they meant something like having to do with "archons" and the like, though if Kanye used that word, I feel like he might be referencing how everything we do is digital.

       Not that he's eloquent at all, but I don't think he meant it in any sort of literal sense.  If he related society more to something like The Truman Show I think he would get his idea across better.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's just overexcited about knowing how the system works and that people are sheep who are just complacent enough to keep continually bleeding money upward and believing in what they're told, but of none of it is revelating.  The interesting part is just that he's actually saying it out loud and somehow getting away with it, which usually isn't the case.  He might be dumb, which is why is bites the hands that feed him, but I don't think he's insane.

       In Kanyes case it's a little different. His stint at the looney bin was an attempt to recoup lost ticket sales. He was 5150-ed not because of the rant but because he showed up the next day at his "personal trainers" acting more off than usual - talking about "if police show up someones going to get hurt" . Just a botched attempt at an poorly executed insurance scam. Lloyd's of London is not going to pat that fool.

       In GA a 5150 is obtained by family going to the court and get a court order to have them committed. A 1013 is what hospitals use. But I guess a 5150 could be used by police as well.

       Ah in CA the family doesn't have to be involved. It can be done by a doctor. 5150 is the right term although I used it loosely.

       Ok even if this was true (its not) there weren't any ticket sales after Texas. 5000 seat venues had tickets going to for %50 off and couldn't fill 1/2 of it. The tour was a financial failure. Enter the insurance claim.

       What Kanye said has nothing to do with OPs post. What he said is for the most part true.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is painting Kanye as some type of victim.

       That's because what he said did come off as kinda dumb/uninformed...like the ramblings of someone who is just starting to peer beneath the surface of how our society operates, but hasn't really developed a more nuanced understanding of everything well enough yet to articulate it in a more meaningful capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, it's great that he's at least trying to push some of these ideas towards his audience...but let's not hold Kanye up as someone we should actually look to for serious insight or intelligence/understanding about these things. There are plenty of prominent intellectuals out there who do a MUCH better job of articulating these underlying problems of society because that's what they spend much of their lives researching and understanding...rather than building a clothing/music/media empire or whatever Kanye spends most of his time consumed by.

       Remember too, Kanye was instrumental in the tide of public opinion turning against Bush during Katrina. I will ALWAYS have his back for having the bravery to say "George Bush doesn't care about black people." He was also starting to make noise about a possible future political career. The PTB had legitimate reasons to take him out. And I have to admit, my first reaction to the pics after his hospitalization was "that's not him". It's hard for me to disregard that feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I saying he's not a little looney tunes? Of course not- he clearly has a classic artistic temperament, lots of up-and-down and passion. That's where good art comes from. That doesn't mean he needed the "treatment" he's received, or that it wasn't abusive. A person with apparent mental health issues is vulnerable to abuse of power, because it provides a justification for breaching their human rights in a punitive way. That doesn't make it the true reason though- just cover.

      <p>
       Remember too, Kanye was always a divisive tool. GB doesn't like black people, white people shouldn't review music made by blacks, starting beef with a then 16 yo girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye was foolish enough to announce a possible future political career but realized he can barely articulate or read from a teleprompter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many old interviews were already on the Internet, the sex tape with Oliver Rousteing and Ricardo were around if you knew where to look. All of his personal conversations with them would be made available to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       For people who seem like Kanye fans, you sure do not know too much about the guy or maybe you're just select what you want to know.

       I don't even know how to respond to that. That is so far from what I am trying to do. But I see this all the time when stans hit the conspiracy threads. The average IQ drops significantly, everything is taken as a personal attack on Kanye. Yes it is a rant but everything in there is true and explains why OPs post is inaccurate.

       You can be intelligent and not have an education. Especially in todays climate. In fact, the education system today has been dumbed down beyond belief. They are nothing more that cultural marxist indoctrination centers.

       Kanye is woke. He's in Trumps circle. Wait for the big "you'll see" Trump happening.. and then pay attention to the timing, content, and release date of Kanye's new album. It will be patriot in a monumental way that no one will see coming, you heard it here first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's truly good vs evil.

      <p>
       I'm a former Democrat that broke the conditioning in 2016. Before that, I would've said Kanye is crazy, he's lost his mind. Now I know better. Everything he said should be a huge eye opener, yet people allow their politics to get in the way. He explained why Hillary failed, that she relied on an old system and had no vision, and even said google and Facebook lied. That is 100% true.

       Pick one. Trump is a billionaire elite and president of the fucking US. You can't be "woke" to what is really going on in the world and be "in the circle of the president of the United States."
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you think Trump is anything but following suit with all presidents before him speaks volumes.

       If they can groom and pick presidents why didn't they just alter the votes in favor of who they wanted? That makes no sense.

       Do you have a 401k? Take a look at it lately? Are you looking forward to tax cuts? How's your place of employment doing, are things looking up? Any recent increases in pay? All of these get very high grades for me in my personal experience.

       Lmao "people beat the f out of the establishment"? You are a fucking clown, the scoreboard is like a billion to negative 100 trillion. The Trump win doesn't even move the needle when the elite agenda is being represented and the president is already bought off no matter who wins. The people haven't won jack dick and won't til there is an actual revolution and Trump my friend, was not it.

       They did fix the election, just not enough. If they get caught, and they had plenty of us with eyes open, then there fucked. Civil war screws the pooch. They figured they could take care of the Trump problem through other means, which you're currently watching. Don't forget plenty aren't even that mad since he'll make the cash cow America fatter and it's been getting too lean.

       I work construction, completely different to whatever u do I'm sure. But the working conditions are shit, no benefits, hard labor in the AZ sun. I'm not mad at myself I'm not mad at Trump.. that's some mental gymnastics you are trying to pull. I love what I do and all those no's we're truthful answers. Don't be a fag just cause I'm not a Trump dickrider.

       I'd have to agree. While Kanye may have moments of being somewhat "woke", as this video shows. He is a superstar, they gave him this power. He may have tried to break free and gotten Mk ultra'd because of it. But you are in denial if you think him and Trump are on a different side. This new Anon thread on 4chan sounds like thie biggest bullshit ever. They are just distracting us with false hope which theyve been doing since Trump got elected. Like holy shit when are you guys gonna realize hes in on the joke. Theyre laughing at us

       That's a very intelligent take. But I don't think you have followed Trump as closely as I have. Bush 4yrs, Clinton 8yrs, Bush 8 yrs, and then they wanted another Clinton. She was supposed to win. 24 years of Clinton/Bush out of like the last 32? Cmon man.

       Go back and watch every GOP debate in 2016 (you won't). There's a big happening coming very soon. The same people that were lied to and didn't see Trump having a CHANCE, that believed MSM and all the fake polls, will be the exact same people that won't see this coming either.

       You can be "woke" and be in the President's inner circle. Now whether you want to do something with this info or not is another matter. We describe woke as being onto the elitist agenda, whose gonna know what that agenda is better than the world's most famous rapper whose got ins with the President? I mean come on, be real, Kanye knows some shit.

       The same people who say Kanye is some sort of genius are the same retards who think he would be a good president. With that said I think the guy went outside of his bounds due to having a stressful career and not getting enough sleep. Also the guy is married to a fucking kardashian, all of this conspiracy shit he spitballs is just for media attention and keeping his name in the media. He lost all credibility once he married a hoe that got famous for a sex tape.

       Kanye is an egotistical maniac but that has nothing to do with this and I agree. Kanye has always been quite eccentric but when he starts trying to drop real shit and come at Google the very next day is when he finally had a "mental breakdown".

       it's bots dude, what do you think the 10k users online are doing in this subreddit? that's also why any  time you click on a pizza/seth thread like clockwork the comments are +250 'riiiiight/dae rthedonald2???' and -60 'so here's what the latest development is'. that's why i make sure to click on the threads i upvote as well because we're losing the war in the comments

       I never listened to his music that much, but what if he has some hidden messages in his lyrics that are often overlooked? Maybe something like animal farm, where he was able to disguise the truth with a silly book about animals but still get it published. The truth is out there, maybe not here, but somewhere damn it!

       Yeezy music is most positive and uplifting. If you listened to probably half his albums his message is to believe in yourself and ignore haters.

       It was a decent amount of time before. And Kanye had shown signs of being really unstable for a long time. We know he's bipolar, know he had been taking Lexapro... Entering an SSRI-triggered manic state will fuck your world up.

       no, it was not a decent amount of time before. It happened about 40ish days before this happened.

       Kanye knows what he is talking about, and if you speak out about it you are labeled bipolar or schizo.

       Yes i have a family member who is bipolar that i lived with and cared for most of my life so I am very well aware of bipolar disorder symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Kanye is bipolar or not is irrelevant to me in this rant  (he very well could be i agree with you that he has shown bipolar symptoms)
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye is speaking the truth in regards to what is going on behind the scenes in this country and in doing so is risking his life. I know because I have done the same thing he did (albeit on a much less public platform than Kanye) and have dealt with the same people Kanye is dealing with. I have told my story of exactly what happened on here before and the top rated replies in the couple of times i have are calling me schizophrenic and that i need to take meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been conditioned to deny what the truth is because the truth hurts. And i've got news for yall the people who know the truth think we are all fucking stupid.

       The theme in The Matrix is that people are given a world that has its ups and also downs, so that people have things to get angry about and then do stuff and be happy again. They are complacent with this while having their bodies' energy harvested.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality it's sort of money instead of energy.  Not even really that but ultimately the labor we are complacent with doing.  The infrastructure that we build and maintain for the elite 1% class to enjoy while the rest settle for shitty apartments, iPhones, Xbox, etc. That is what I think is being implied. Spoonfed just enough to keep people shuffling along picking up impulse buys while feeling marginally threatened but ultimately safe in the system's hands if they stick to the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is really what The Matrix is about - not the simulation piece.

       well, I am 100% on board with believing everything Kanye is saying. I've dealt with the same people he is dealing with.
      </p>
      <p>
       to be honest, I've given up on telling people exactly what is going on because we have been conditioned to deny what is going on. you have to figure it out yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, if you want to "wake up" from the matrix you have to understand there comes a great risk with that, and if you do not have a strong spiritual foundation when waking up from the matrix the darkness can consume you.

       The "matrix" is the illusion of time caused by the ancient religious ritual of the 'Week'.  This ritual conditions you mind and body into repetitive cycle of thoughts and behaviors. Your mind is colonized and controlled by this practice.

       No. He’s not. He’s just some dumb, rich by luck rapper that wants more attention than he’s already got.

      <p>
       The reason he said this bullshit is the same reason he told everyone (also at one of his concerts... huh, making bold claims in front of as many people as he can) that he was running for a President in 2020.

       Similar to dave Chappelle and his breakdown and sudden isolation.  Then he comes back hinting at Hollywood agendas, but is very vague. Now all of a sudden his comedy routines have changed and he seems to be a different person. Makes you wonder how many more elites break down when they realize the truth behind the dynamics of Hollywood propaganda. These are just the few that actually get the chance to speak out to the media before they get shut down.  Also makes you wonder about the suspicious deaths of celebrities. IMO it goes further than just Hollywood propaganda being force fed to us. And more to the agenda they have of molding society into a dumb, shallow, mass that can't think for ourselves.

       He's holding back. He used to really push it on the borderline of acceptable humor. Those days are gone it seems. And before his breakdown it was obvious there was some unrest in his mind and he talked about it. I don't think he's speaking up anymore.  Seems like there's indifference there.  This is just my view

       He's batshit crazy, has an ego that is indefensible, and is an incredibly vulgar lyricist that puts together full teams for his albums. And yet he has produced some of the most forward-thinking, un-reproduceable albums of the last twenty years, ones that still sound fresher than other stuff from the same period. He is an artist in the purest sense of the word.

       I work construction, completely different to whatever u do I'm sure. But the working conditions are shit, no benefits, hard labor in the AZ sun. I'm not mad at myself I'm not mad at Trump.. that's some mental gymnastics you are trying to pull. I love what I do and all those no's we're truthful answers. Don't be a fag just cause I'm not a Trump dickrider.

       I do because I know our tax dollars don't come back to us like they are supposed toz but I actually think we should be doing things like Germany and paying like 8 percent more in taxes but gaining free healthcare and college education and better education period and school food.
