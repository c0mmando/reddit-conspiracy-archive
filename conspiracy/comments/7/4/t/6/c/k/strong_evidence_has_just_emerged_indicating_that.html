<p>Has this video been posted yet? It starts BEFORE the shooting began. 3 minutes in, you can hear 3 single gunshots. These seem to be the first shots. Shortly after the shots, word apparently begins to spread through the crowd that someone has been shot, and people begin to flee. A few moments later, you hear another distant-sounding snap, instantly (within milliseconds) followed by a duller thudding sound of automatic gunfire. The fact that the automatic gunfire begins instantly after a shot from a different gun and most likely a different location is proof of more than one shooter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steve is an arms dealer 
Terrorist flip gf arranged huge deal with ISIS connections.
Unbeknownst to Steve, this was actually a set-up to commit a terrorist act.
Flip gf arranges &quot;transaction&quot; to take place in hotel room overlooking concert.
Vegas hotels have no cameras in hallways on each floor (look it up, most likely it is because they know heaps of their clients are scum who don&#39;t wanna be filmed doing whatever it is they are doing, so they only keep data on which floors people visit, not who they visit on each floor).
Steve wires 100k to flip gf as payment for setting up the deal.
ISIS connections book room on the same floor.
Steve brings up the guns for display - for 300k, you get these guns + ammo + explosives in my car + more guns later in my house.
ISIS terrorists kill steve up close, making it look like a suicide.
Smash out window with hammer they brought.
Use Steve&#39;s guns + ammo to commit terror act.
Security guard comes up
Shoot him through the door using cameras that either Steve put there or you put there.
Security retreats.
Slip back to your room and act like nothing happened.
Eventually SWAT arrives and finds Steve dead.
Case closed, insane rich old white guy.
Steve was an arms dealer who frequently washed his money in Vegas.</p>

<p>Okay so, when a weapon gets fired the bullet travels at supersonic speeds and hits the target literally before the sound does. So what you are hearing is the sound of the bullet BEFORE the sound of the gun firing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For someone inferring they know the physics behind the event it&#39;s strange what direction this is being led to.</p>

<p>The first sounds are as you stated the bullet-snap, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3TxgypJtAE">shown in this video</a> yet there are no muzzle reports. In other words the gunfire is not heard. </p>

<p>It is later. When the observer is even further away from the scene. It&#39;s also heard in other videos on scene.</p>

<p>It suggests two separate sets of physics at play. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLHU-_OhT8g">You will notice here in this video</a> you can hear the bullet-snaps before the muzzle reports. As you stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are hearing is the sound of the bullet BEFORE the sound of the gun firing, not two separate guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this isn&#39;t what we are hearing in the video. There are bullet snaps without muzzle reports. Later there are muzzle reports from a further  distance.</p>

<p>This suggests a few different things but is not easily written off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. Glad we cleared up miscommunication.</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://www.thehighroad.org/index.php?threads/how-loud-is-the-supersonic-crack.390160/">this shooting forum</a> notes the exact sound in the earliest shots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t tell you dB, but can tell you that an AR15 with silencer (i.e.: muzzle blast suppressed) sounds like an unsuppressed .22LR, as does roughly a .30-06 bullet passing nearby fired from 300m away.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also puts the bow shock at 300m. Which if true suggests there should be a bullet snap heard with probably all of the muzzle reports. Unless the shooter firing far from the crowd, second shooter, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a bullet is fired from a suppressed weapon, a witness can mistake the bullet bow audible shockwave whip-crack for the weapon muzzle blast audible wave, which is a separate audible event. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_bow_shockwave">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_bow_shockwave</a></p>

<p>The OP video is one of the first ones which seems to be very hard evidence of something amiss with the storyline. Many posts have been trying to push the earliest sounds as &quot;firecrackers&quot; but it sounds very distinctly like bullet-snap, and even has people running from it (reacting to it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you view the rooftop footage notice the casualties are concentrated in a single area.</p>

<p>Also check the list of injured/deceased, there are numerous <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/861680/Las-Vegas-shooting-victims-list-who-are-dead-injured-death-toll-latest-names">off-duty cops, military, &amp; teachers.</a></p>

<p>Currently there is a limited amount of evidence to piece is together properly. So far judging on the visual evidence, it seemed like it was targeted to one area. If the guy was indeed hit first, it seems like it he was specifically targeted. Also interesting it was a VIP section.</p>

<p>The number of military, police and teachers may be coincidence, but then again if a large network of people were together and it was concentrated to one area, again it <em>could be</em> indicative of targeting.</p>

<p>Even if the area was simply concentrated on for some other purpose, the early body drop from distinctly different weapons fire suggests that first person was targeted.</p>

<p>The discrepancies in sounds/physics also suggest something wrong with the official narrative. Ballistics would solve it immediately. But it seems to suggest two shooters or at least different weapons being used.</p>

<p>Doubtful they are going to present ballistics. The media / state agency options seem limited. Either try to push a very convoluted narrative and ignore all evidence or adjust it and release as little details as possible. Given the investigation went to the Feds it could in theory be covered up under &#39;National Security&#39; but that leaves the media cleaning up the mess with a hacksawed story. </p>

<p>Tripathi went missing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Tripathi#cite_note-HelpUsFindSunilTripathi.com-6">a month before the bombings</a> and then his body was pulled out of the river.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A body was found floating in the stretch of the Seekonk River behind the Wyndham Garden Providence hotel on April 23, 2013.[13][14] Using dental records, it was confirmed to be that of Tripathi. The cause of death was not immediately known, but authorities said they did not suspect foul play.[15] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, the timeline doesn&#39;t make any sense. They quickly stated no foul play suspected (after pulling the body out of a river)<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/us/sunil-tripathi-student-at-brown-is-found-dead.html">x</a>, and then the next articles pushed the narrative into blaming reddit and claiming &quot;suicide&quot; as a cause of death.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/hb_me.pdf">Suicide is not, a cause of death</a>. It&#39;s a manner of death. If listed as a cause it must show the actual cause, &quot;suicide by drowning.&quot; (Wherein drowning is the cause)</p>

<p>There is no cause of death listed for Tripathi. There&#39;s no explanation to where he was 1 month prior before being found by crowdsourcing after FBI released an image resembling him - one being a former classmate. No explanation into what actually killed him. No explanation into <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2301824/Sunil-Tripathi-case-New-surveillance-video-shows-missing-Brown-student-leaving-home-day-disappearance-brother-reveals-22-year-old-suffers-depression.html">the note found left behind in his residence</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police checked Tripathi&#39;s online activity and bank accounts, but reportedly found no leads. They did come across what they have characterized as a vague note in the student&#39;s apartment, but will not go into details. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI is involved though, they have a habit of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/oklahoma-city-bomb-sting_us_5993c045e4b04b19336162fd">using literally mentally-retarded people</a> in their sting operations. Which makes anyone who believes their narratives about as intellectual capable as their intended marks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice it&#39;s only <em>you</em> who has made the claim of &quot;how many people are in the room.&quot; The OP is talking about two &quot;shooters&quot; one of which can be in another location or using a different weapon. Adding &quot;room&quot; is a straw man argument.</p>

<p>The physics of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74t6ck/strong_evidence_has_just_emerged_indicating_that/do10dlo/">why the video suggests multiple shooters/weapons</a> can be found in this post.</p>

<p>Very simply: Earliest shots only have audible bow shock (bullet snap). Later firing has both bow shock and muzzle report.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3TxgypJtAE">This is what bow shock (bullet snap) sounds like</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLHU-_OhT8g">This is what muzzle report &amp; snap sounds like</a></p>

<p>Bowshock without muzzle report suggests a silencer or a gun at an extreme distance. Muzzle report without bow shock suggests indirect fire. Given that muzzle report is heard in all the other videos and even in this one as the camera man moves away from the scene, there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t be present in all shots.</p>

<p>If a higher agency gets involved in local investigations there are often &quot;national security&quot; implications aka: cover ups.</p>

<p>The FBI (and other fed agencies) <a href="https://law.yale.edu/mfia/case-disclosed/fbis-secret-gag-orders-challenged-ninth-circuit">also issues gag orders to private companies preventing them what they can disclose</a>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking.</p>

<p>Would an arms dealer keep explosives in his home along with guns and ammo? If that&#39;s the question, I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking why he had explosives in his car, I&#39;m not sure. It
may have been part of the deal, along the lines of &quot;This are the guns and ammo I&#39;m able to give you as many of as you&#39;d like, and if you make a purchase now, I&#39;ll throw in the stuff I have in my trunk for free.&quot; Obviously just spitballing here, but it may have been something like that.</p>

<p>If the deranged lone wolf theory is true, I&#39;d be very curious what his plan was. I doubt a man who was supposedly smart enough to become a gambling millionaire and nifty enough to secretly procure all that weaponry would simultaneously be naive enough to think that he could get to his car unhindered after shooting hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire out the window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I’m just trying to wrap my head around all this info. I keep making the mistake of thinking arms dealer as a Hollywood type God of War type deal. He might be an arms dealer but the weapon add ons like extended mags, flash suppressors, and bumps aren’t something a arms dealer would include in the sale. I’d want all stock unmodified guns just so I would know that the weapons are all original and functional and then customize personally. I’m just trying to think like an arms dealer would which is difficult for me considering I’ve never even shot a semi auto weapon. Sorry bud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all good, mate, we&#39;re all just thinking loudly here. I didn&#39;t mean to be critical, I just wanted to understand your reasoning.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure there are dealers of all shapes and sizes out there. I&#39;m also pretty sure that a majority of the illegal arms dealers are directly linked to the MIC or the shadow government in some way.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If it was a planned to be a direct transaction then and there, then the customers would have likely ordered the weapons precisely as they were found for a specific purpose. If they wanted muzzle brakes or suppressors or what have you, an arms dealer would set you up with all of that.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that it might have been more of a showroom type situation. &quot;These are all the toys I can offer you. If you decide today, you&#39;ll have a crate of 500 of these wherever you like by the end of the week.&quot;</p>

<p>But again, just spitballing here.</p>

<p>Yes. To control the narrative. There&#39;s also a reason why millions of documents are created annually in the name of &quot;national security.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information_in_the_United_States">Official Secrets Act &amp; &quot;National Security&quot;</a> in the US.</p>

<p>If a higher agency gets involved in local investigations there are often &quot;national security&quot; implications aka: cover ups.</p>

<p>The FBI (and other fed agencies) <a href="https://law.yale.edu/mfia/case-disclosed/fbis-secret-gag-orders-challenged-ninth-circuit">also issues gag orders to private companies preventing them what they can disclose</a>
<em>&quot;FBI’s Secret Gag Orders Challenged Before the Ninth Circuit&quot;</em></p>

<p>The FBI <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chuck-grassley-lambasts-fbi-for-gag-order-on-watchdog-investigation-into-james-comeys-firing/article/2635641">even gag ordered its own employees</a> which Chuck Grassley of the <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chuck-grassley-lambasts-fbi-for-gag-order-on-watchdog-investigation-into-james-comeys-firing/article/2635641">Office of Special Council and Judicial Oversight Committee</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you assume that everyone involved has to be aware of the fact that they are involved in a criminal coverup?</p>

<p>If your superior officer tells you not to look into a certain angle, you won&#39;t look into it. If you do anyway, you&#39;ll be fired. If you become a whistleblower you get killed or ostracised.</p>

<p>Very few people need to be controlled if you want to control a whole agency, as long as it is hierarchically structured. Some of those who cooperate with the puppet masters don&#39;t do so willingly but do so due to blackmail.</p>

<p>There is more evidence to support the notion that official investigations of high-level events are often faulty or deliberately fraudulent, then there is for dangerously incompetent research by internet sleuths. Both are a problem, but one is a significantly more dangerous problem than the other.</p>
