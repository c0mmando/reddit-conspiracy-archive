    <div class="md"><p>How long ago was that? 4chan doesnt really have cp, anymore. It&#39;s scary to realize that to be informed, one must find themselves in the bowels of thr internet. That&#39;s how obscene the msm has become. That&#39;s how suppressed information is. I have to resort to maybe stumbling across furry pron if i want to know who seth rich, or emerson luzzatto is. Also, info has been posted on pol, not b alone. Inb4, i&#39;m a pedo.. i&#39;m a girl who was 12 on mIRC in 94.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also troll and larp. I dont see why you wouldnt, you clearly fit right in. 4chan is also one of the only places where people can be truly anonymous, (provided you have a mac changer,) yes... There may be &quot;nudism,&quot; threads, but they exist here, ffs. Look up alt.tasteless archives. The internet, used to be a helluva lot worse, even your terrifying 4chan. Instead of gore and circlejerks (both literal and metaphorical,)  there are now jpop idol threads, gore, circlejerks and the occasional data dump... The latter which depending on content may be fuckig imperative knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go on 4chan. Go to /b/. Go to /pol/. Find out for yourselves. There are other chans, that unlike /b/, have remained nameless. I dont know them. I lurk and laugh at trolls, and i enjoy some of the political discourse.  Again, i am a girl. I grew up on the internet. You cant offend me. Ere go, i can and will go where there is new information, whether it is brutal or tragic... Bc it needs to be fucking SEEN, for anything to change. </p>

<p>The latest pedo thread that took over 4chan? Was based on james alefantis&#39; and his weird friends hashtags and skippy&#39;s cryptic pasta emails. Tell me not to look while these fuckers cuckold their children? And murder them? And then use fucking hashtags, like #killroom or #chickenlover or #babyslut? Excuse the fuck out of me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I answered the way i did bc while there is the occasional thread, there arent threads that people recall when thinking about b. It&#39;s not how it used to be, i believe people doubt him, bc those ppl, like myself, go on b and dont see cp. Legal weird morally questionable shit, yes, absolutely, but by and large, you will not find cp by &quot;accident.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4chanAnonSUPERinsider here. There will be a thing that happens within the next 2 days to 2 years that will really blow your dicks off. It will involve some kind of personal electronic device that has been compromised, angry people, a terror plot, pizza, a briefcase, the CIA/ FBI/ ATF/ OPP/ and a costco executive membership. This is going to really shake things up. Trump will allude to it by saying something outlandish, vague, and confusing in a press conference. </p>

<p>This type of thing only works if you have an audience that wants to believe you. </p>
