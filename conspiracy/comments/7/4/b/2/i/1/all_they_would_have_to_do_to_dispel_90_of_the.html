<p>Who gives a shit what&#39;s high on their list of &quot;to-do&#39;s&quot;? I didn&#39;t suggest it was their priority either.

<p>Exactly. These events keep people spinning around in circles, having ultimately pointless arguments about what did or did not happen. Every few weeks, another &#39;shooting&#39; or &#39;bombing&#39; or &#39;scandal&#39; keeping the lemmings glued to their screens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Why are we entitled to a hotels security footage?
&amp;nbsp;
2) Partially disassemble an AR, and you can prolly fit 4, 5, 6 in suitcase.  Pay bellhop a couple bucks and your bags are in your room waiting shortly after.
&amp;nbsp;
All I&#39;m saying is lets focus on relevant questions....</p>

<p>I don&#39;t find it hard that someone <em>could</em> bring up that many guns. That&#39;s super easy to believe. What&#39;s unknown is that he did it alone, or that he was even the one that brought them up. Release that footage, this question gets put to bed. This investigation is infuriating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who thinks it&#39;s a hoax? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a hoax. I went to high school with several people who attended the concert, one of which died (I didn&#39;t know her but have friends who remember her from school). </p>

<p>Who gives a shit what&#39;s high on their list of &quot;to-do&#39;s&quot;? I didn&#39;t suggest it was their priority either. The conspiracy theories are mainly &quot;this shit isn&#39;t adding up&quot;. And I question anyone who&#39;s not an investigator who at this point says &quot;Yeah this shit adds up perfectly, nothing odd here&quot;. There <em>are</em> conspiracies, right? There <em>are</em> outstanding questions, right? It&#39;s <em>odd</em> for them to wait this long to release information, right? Yes. We knew everything about 9/11 within hours, and that was a <em>much</em> larger attack with less evidence left behind.</p>

<p>Why would you think they&#39;re interested in dispelling anything?</p>

<p>Exactly. These events keep people spinning around in circles, having ultimately pointless arguments about what did or did not happen. Every few weeks, another &#39;shooting&#39; or &#39;bombing&#39; or &#39;scandal&#39; keeping the lemmings glued to their screens.</p>

<p>It amazes me that more people can&#39;t see through this charade. Or, at least, it used to. Until I learned about <a href="https://imgur.com/7aiWIye">people like Mencken</a>.</p>

<p>Would someone rather be tried for a hoax, or put on trial for wanton mass murder? Let me think for a second...</p>
