       It could be faked but unlike the Boston bombing "victims" this looked legit. Might not be but it seemed like it was real but IDK.

       Yea the liveleak video I’m guessing is what you’re referring too, I saw it as well, not saying people weren’t shot and killed but the whole thing doesn’t add up. Too many holes in the story

       I don't think dispelling conspiracy theories is high on their list of to-do's. Most of them would probably be like, "Wait, what?
       <em>

       thinks it's a hoax?"

       Who thinks it's a hoax? I don't think it's a hoax. I went to high school with several people who attended the concert, one of which died (I didn't know her but have friends who remember her from school).
      </p>
      <p>
       Who gives a shit what's high on their list of "to-do's"? I didn't suggest it was their priority either. The conspiracy theories are mainly "this shit isn't adding up". And I question anyone who's not an investigator who at this point says "Yeah this shit adds up perfectly, nothing odd here". There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       conspiracies, right? There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       outstanding questions, right? It's
       <em>
        odd
       </em>
       for them to wait this long to release information, right? Yes. We knew everything about 9/11 within hours, and that was a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       larger attack with less evidence left behind.

       Why would you think they're interested in dispelling anything? Do you not think stuff like this can't be faked? I think it would be fairly easy to fake this so called surveillance video, so it really wouldn't prove much of shit

       Yet all it takes to convince people that shots were really fired is a popping sound and a ham-fisted video with some fake blood in it, completely devoid of images of gunshot wounds, bullet damage, or medical personnel.

       So there seems to be a lower standard proof on that side.

       Ok, as soon as I'm done working I'll post what I'm talking about. Just because some people haven't seen all the vids doesn't mean they didn't take place. I don't believe the official narrative for one sec, but this crisis actor shit is insane. It would be easier to just kill people then pull off a cover up like that..

       Exactly. These events keep people spinning around in circles, having ultimately pointless arguments about what did or did not happen. Every few weeks, another 'shooting' or 'bombing' or 'scandal' keeping the lemmings glued to their screens.

       While they haven't released the footage, they have stated he brought the weapons in suitcases over the days he was there. Along with housekeepers stating the only abnormality they noticed was the large among of shitcases. Out of curiosity which conspiracies rely on him not bringing suitcases up to his room.

       Yeah that's true. IDK why I even made this comment. I don't think there's a crazy "conspiracy" as in; this never happened or it was staged.. I do know there's things that aren't adding up. They're being shady with the investigation way more than 9/11 or Sandy Hook, etc. I find this troubling and I think it's probably because they think another attack is coming. That makes the most sense.

       1) Why are we entitled to a hotels security footage?
&amp;nbsp;
2) Partially disassemble an AR, and you can prolly fit 4, 5, 6 in suitcase.  Pay bellhop a couple bucks and your bags are in your room waiting shortly after.

       I don't find it hard that someone
       <em>
        could

       bring up that many guns. That's super easy to believe. What's unknown is that he did it alone, or that he was even the one that brought them up. Release that footage, this question gets put to bed. This investigation is infuriating.

       Who thinks it's a hoax? I don't think it's a hoax. I went to high school with several people who attended the concert, one of which died (I didn't know her but have friends who remember her from school).

       Who gives a shit what's high on their list of "to-do's"? I didn't suggest it was their priority either. The conspiracy theories are mainly "this shit isn't adding up". And I question anyone who's not an investigator who at this point says "Yeah this shit adds up perfectly, nothing odd here". There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       conspiracies, right? There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       outstanding questions, right? It's
       <em>
        odd
       </em>
       for them to wait this long to release information, right? Yes. We knew everything about 9/11 within hours, and that was a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       larger attack with less evidence left behind.

       Yet all it takes to convince people that shots were really fired is a popping sound and a ham-fisted video with some fake blood in it, completely devoid of images of gunshot wounds, bullet damage, or medical personnel.

      <p>
       So there seems to be a lower standard proof on that side.

       Exactly. These events keep people spinning around in circles, having ultimately pointless arguments about what did or did not happen. Every few weeks, another 'shooting' or 'bombing' or 'scandal' keeping the lemmings glued to their screens.

       It amazes me that more people can't see through this charade. Or, at least, it used to. Until I learned about

       Of course it wouldn't be easier to actually kill people. That's a common refrain, but completely nonsensical if you think about it for like one minute.

       Would someone rather be tried for a hoax, or put on trial for wanton mass murder? Let me think for a second...
