       <strong>
        [Update: not a single piece of conclusive evidence is presented here. Some videos suggest and imply injuries and gun shots, but not a single gunshot wound or injury of any type is clear from any of these videos. If you have better evidence, please post it below.]
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This event is devastating and I don't want to jump to false flag / conspiracy theories, but I've looked at a tonne of videos and I can't see a single person getting shot. There's not a single video with a wounded person (where you can actually see the wound), and no camera footage of the killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind 59 died, but 10x more were injured. Surely someone captured something on video? In a crowd that size, you'd be able to see people being dropped by live rounds, you'd hear glass smashing, ricochets -- a whole lot of evidence that is oddly missing. What's going on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Something just seems very odd.

       Oh man, I realise this is incredibly insensitive. Is there any way that it can be proven? You'd think with an event of that scale, with that many phones and videos there'd be some evidence. Do you know of any that can debunk my post?

       There's no video of it. She says he was shot in the head, she says entry and exit wound. She also says he's still alive, and yet you never SEE the wound.

       Here, I think I actually put up one of the same image twice overwriting the first shot of it, but it was probably the worst shot of the four anyway. It's a blurry video but you can see it's definitely a gunshot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth mentioning the dead woman next to him, the camera doesn't focus on her at all so I didn't try to screen it but she looks awfully rough...

       among many weird things, this video weirds me out the most. i sincerely do not want to be insensitive and i think the majority of people asking questions don't but... why does he just kind of take over the situation as if he is some authority and then say he's just an innocent bystander and his mom is a nurse? he walks up to the first guy and says something like "i see no entry wound i see no exit wound. i don't know how to treat!" but he's not a nurse or emt but he "knows nurses"? then goes on to say "he's breathing with me i see him breathing". i honestly thought he was suspicious of the whole thing. then he seems so shocked at the lack of first responders, and granted maybe they haven't arrived yet but it seemed to have been looking enough for them to arrive. also some of the victims are alone and i just don't understand that... they likely didn't attend alone, maybe their friends or family ran off in fear and became separated,.. it  just seems off but again, i don't want to judge anyone and i can't imagine how i would react in that situation. i also don't want to disparage the gentleman filming this. he seems to say some odd things and seems very confused by the situation, maybe he's just a person trying to help out in a chaotic situation and that is admirable. i think the worst part of the video is the end where he's speaking to someone involved with the concert. he pleads with this man to turn on the lights and that he's trying to get the victims some help and the man responds saying everyone there is DECEASED.... i just can't understand, even in a scary, stressful, shocking situation that ANYONE would make such a definitive statement like that. i mean, take them to a hospital. Do not assume they are no longer alive. i think something is odd about it, maybe it's hard to judge reactions during a time like that. i don't know what to believe but i sincerely send my deepest sympathies to any of the victims and their loved ones. it's just all so odd and i can't wrap my head around it.

       Thousands of bullets were raining down overhead just minutes before this. The video in question is of a civilian doing his best to perform START while alerting medics about people who were still alive. This dude probably has little to no experience, but I still can appreciate him doing everything he can to help these complete strangers. Not everybody has medical training or experience, but everyone can find a way to assist those that do possess such skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: To answer OP: You can clearly see a man with a chunk of his skull missing going through the final phase before death often called "Agonal Breathing." You can see a chunk of his skull sticking out of the back of his wounded cranium. Those were his last moments for sure, poor guy. I hope we actually get some information about all of this soon.

       Yea man I also wonder if you would mind offering us more information on the people you know that you know passed away from that event. We don't mean to pry or call you a liar outright. That's not what I'm trying to do at least. But maybe it would help some of the doubters like myself if you could provide us with additional info (whatever you can) on the people you know that died. (again - so sorry for them having passed like this)

       But yea man, just wonder. ANYTHING at all you can offer up to the community to prove legitimacy?

       This is the 2nd person I've seen on r/conspiracy in 2 days who knew of this girl, sister of a White Sox Minor League Baseball Player. The first was a very polite guy who knew of her from the University of Arizona.

       So, a 5 month old account which has never posted in r/conspiracy until today, with a first post stating they know 3 people out of 50 out of 22,000 that passed away in this shooting, is asking if I'm in the FBI?

       Nah man, no need to solve it. It happened. Just trying to separate the wheat from the chaff now. In my opinion the real people who pulled this off are too connected/too powerful to be found out.

       All sarcasm aside, sorry for any loss you are feeling with the loss of that girl. I just found it odd that you're the 2nd person who's known of her that I've seen post in 2 days (one kid from her college yesterday, and now you from her hometown). Respect.

       Why is it odd? This is my first visit here and it is solely because of the event, and all of the ridiculous poorly thought out conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's proof that this is real: a small town of 600 in my state lost a woman in this shooting, news has covered it, several interviews, her name is Carly Kreibaum, of Sutherland, Iowa. You can't fake that shit in a tiny town. If this person were not dead from this attack there is no way it wouldn't come out immediately. You can call it "false flag" and blame Soros (I prefer to blame the gun industry since they make the most money off of these things, you know, (follow the money"), but these were not actors in a movie.

       Not here to add anything about the shooting but I often reformat my devices and forget logins and passwords. All my devices have different logins and I've been on reddit for nearly 10 years. Sheesh that makes me feel old.

       SultanPepe, good on you for asking questions. What you will soon learn is that media fakery is still a taboo topic, even on r/conspiracy. If you are interested in serious discussion on topics like this,

       This is par for the course on this sub. You will get more traction claiming that humans evolved from ancient aliens than you will by simply pointing out
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-bmS1aResY">
        how obviously fake
       </a>
       these major media events can be. Madness, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why fakeologist is a good place for those with open minds, who don't just want to rehash the latest episode of 'history channel' nonsense. They have been covering LV lately from the media fakery angle. It makes
       <strong>
        WAY MORE SENSE
       </strong>
       than the Alex Jones style 'mk ultra'/'he was a patsy' angle.

       didn't see anyone hit or otherwise injured. Even though the video clearly states graphic content. Did you see any in particular that show someone getting shot?

       that one's harder to explain. There's a few odd things though:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are those people casually chilling? there's bodies littered all around and they're just chatting?
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are about 10 shots in rapid succession, why only 1 bullet impact?
      </p>
      <p>
       It also appears as though this is long after the event. Everyone is so casual.

       well thanks for sticking at it, I honestly appreciate it. I've trawled every source I can get and am completely unconvinced there was an actual shooting. Something went down, big time, and based on this thread alone there are a lot of people who think they saw stuff they never saw.

       You gotta realise that all the context in your mind is not present in the video. If you watch the footage, start to finish, it could have been taken by anyone at any time, anywhere, and have been completely faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you actually watch it, with as much careful skepticism as you can, it actually seems really fucking silly.

       an aside, I think if this is some kind of hoax / fbi / whatev job, they will definitely have a fall guy and a body. Isn't it weird that in a casino with every square inch of the venue on camera there's no footage of him in the week or so he was staying there?

       There was a video that was up for like 10-20 minutes. I was one of the 500 or so views. It was of a civilian who ran body to body checking pulses. People looked dead, eyes open, wounds bleeding etc. I didn’t study it enough to tell you real or fake but here is the link.

       No my friend. There is not to my knowledge any images of anything being shot.

       Imagine that. Nothing getting shot at a mass shooting.

       People say you can hear ricochets. Ok, you still never see any gunshot wounds, real medical response, or even any bullet damage, which would be extensive.

       That's pretty unconvincing. The deadliest shooting in US history and there's still no images of bullet damage or gunshot wounds. Not just to people, but to the surrounding area. We see some blood running down that guy's arm. That's a tiny tiny tiny thing to point at and expect that one thing to suffice to prove that so many rifle rounds were fired and that many people were hit and injured.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are acting these scenes out. This is why it seems staged and blocked. The "injured" man's behavior was also bizarre.

       Dude I'm with you here. In all the videos I've seen so far I've not once seen any truly damning evidence of any injuries. And all of these deaths can easily be faked by way of latex makeup (costume design) or just laying very still. No one in the medical field was around and those who were supposedly dead well until I see a video where they put a heart monitoring machine (not sure what it's called) on them and it shows the heart has stopped working then I'll believe it. Now I'm not saying that people weren't truly injured or killed but I highly doubt it was as high as they say it is. But if I'm wrong please provide me with proof and I'll admit my wrongness

       Just so we can get you on track: The video of the man checking people's pulses does show at least one head wound VERY clearly. (Probably more but I only watched it once.) You can see that he is laying in his back going through the final stage before death: Agonal Breathing. The cameraman tries ask where he is hit and realizes the individual is barely conscious. This prompts him to look for wounds where he is greeted with a large hole in the back of the male's head. It is slightly obscured by his hair and the blood, but the most clearly part of his wound is a piece of his skull that has split and torn up at a 90 degree angle. It's pretty obvious to make out.
      </p>
      <p>
       People really did die man. I doubt the official story, but as a person with medical training, I can't sit back and watch all of these users state "There are no wounds!" There are clearly many wounds in that video. We need to know why this happened, not act like it didn't occur at all.

       Here's the thing: Most users would gladly do it, if it weren't for the fact that they would have to rewatch that madness! There's no way you can get me to watch that man's final moments again. I'll give you a roadmap so that you can get that evidence yourself though! Then we can get back to what matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to the video we've all been talking about; the one where a civilian is checking pulses. Watch for about a minute or longer until you see the man laying on his back come into frame. He has spit that sputters on his lips which is an indication of agonal breathing. You can see them sputter about as he takes his last breaths. Cameraman will then try to identify the wound and raises his head in the process. At this point the chunk of his skull will come into view. It is roughly located at the towards the top most part of his cranium but looks like it made up a part of the back of the right side of his skull.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get even more morbid and detailed, it appears as if the bullet entered the right section of the back of his skull, from an upward angle, probably 3 inches or less away from the brainstem which would have killed him immediately. This man got severely unlucky, and definitely passed right after he was filmed.

       I was describing why he was still alive in the video. Of the bullet had hit his brain stem it would've killed him outright. It did not, and that is why he was still alive for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already explained why I'm not taking a picture of a dead man and giving you my best analysis as to where that man was hit based off of the wound in the back right side of his skull. Perhaps turn up your brightness next time on you go looking for the wound, because it is there and plain as day.

       You have every ounce of evidence that I have. We are talking about the same video. If you can't see the wound then maybe you don't have the experience to be looking for one.

       Evidence was posted in the form of a written statement. If you want to see some sort of macabre diagram of Another human being's exploded skull then you will have to look elsewhere. The skull chunk is like the most obviously gorey element of the film. Can't imagine most people will ever forget seeing it.

      <p>
       Just for you though, user, I'll watch that video one more time and give you a timestamp that will give you the best view. I won't be posting any sort of link, but I will do that much for you. Brb.

       You can apologize now for acting like a pompous tool bag, here's the full version. Here's all the identifiable injuries you need to see that there were in fact victims, this is not a hoax, it's bigger than a hoax and you are trying to muddy the waters over this incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, you are just lazy and need a bid because you like being spoon fed.

       I know what you mean im sorrt for the victimes if this is actually legit .

       Ive seen one video where a guy standing up seems on the left seems to get shot but its not very clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree about the liveleak videos i really dont see where people are seeing a chunk out of the mans skull.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also seems very eerie the way theres people casually sitting next to the gates and other videos where people stand there smoking cadually and where the couple seems to be walking on the beach when gunshots are clearly heard. People are saying they were drunk and in shock. I dont know but ive been drunk as fuck and pretty sure my fight or flight modes are still on.

       Have you been all day, drunk, in the sun at a country music festival, in the desert? And even without extenuating circumstances, some people won’t believe they’re being shot at until they see someone go down. I bet a bunch of people thought it was fireworks or whatever until they caught brain matter or arterial spray. When your wonderland gets interrupted by a reality that you’ve never known, tell me about how people can act.

       Go back slow down the video and look, its definitely not his ear it's too far up.

       It really feels like you want so badly for this to be a hoax that you're just gonna deny anything you see anyway. I'm sorry that no one has an HD recording of themselves getting shot in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is conspiracy, so you're allowed to theorize all you want, but I think you're seriously reaching, presenting no evidence besides lack of evidence (and denying the evidence presented to you) and it's seriously really insensitive.

       What I'm saying is, every body in this thread was certain they saw something. They posted the evidence and it was not what they thought they saw. Unless you have something clearer I can't change my mind. If you have something, post it. Im saying it's full of shit because no one has pulled through

       Want to speculate endlessly about black ops, MKUltra, multiple shooters? Was it an ISIS gun deal gone bad? Which alphabet agency was involved?

       All fine questions to ask according to the shills patrolling this narrative.

      </p>
      <p>
       You know what happens when 50 actual people die? Families are outraged and demand answers. They file lawsuits and FOIA requests. They generally raise hell and kick up dust for all the parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real families would be demanding to know how the Mandalay Bay Hotel let one of their guests do this. They'd be sued into oblivion.

       What they don't do is get on tv, smile and remember the good times, take their go fund me accounts and quietly fade into the background to speak on paid gun control circuits around the country.

       And is there a shred of evidence that the victim's families are acting any differently than the families in what you would consider fifty "actual people" dying?

       How the fuck could Mandalay Bay get sued for this? Should they have put up spy cameras in every room just in case a suicidal massacure was looming?

       Are you that stupid? Hotels get sued when people trip and fall.

      <p>
       I don't think they need to put spy cameras everywhere because I'm certain there was more than enough security to identify an actual threat already.

       Always remind me of that bit in the final Narnia book (The Dwarves refuse to be take in):
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came about 12 dwarfs, Jill, Eustace, and finally Tirian.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dwarfs are sitting in a tight circle nearby. Lucy and Tirian approach them, and it is quickly clear that the dwarfs believe that they are sitting inside of a dark stable, not basking in a sunlit field in an open country. Lucy and Tirian try different methods to show them where they are, but the dwarfs are too convinced that they are in a dark stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aslan appears and greets everyone, and tells Tirian that he has done well. Lucy asks Aslan if he can do anything about the dwarfs. Aslan goes to the dwarfs and makes a beautiful meal appear before each of them. The dwarfs only taste bitter, nasty food--and eventually start fighting one another about whose food is better. Aslan says that the dwarfs refuse to allow themselves to be helped.

       an aside, I think if this is some kind of hoax / fbi / whatev job, they will definitely have a fall guy and a body. Isn't it weird that in a casino with every square inch of the venue on camera there's no footage of him in the week or so he was staying there?

       This is par for the course on this sub. You will get more traction claiming that humans evolved from ancient aliens than you will by simply pointing out
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-bmS1aResY">
        how obviously fake
       </a>
       these major media events can be. Madness, really.

      <p>
       That is why fakeologist is a good place for those with open minds, who don't just want to rehash the latest episode of 'history channel' nonsense. They have been covering LV lately from the media fakery angle. It makes
       <strong>

       than the Alex Jones style 'mk ultra'/'he was a patsy' angle.
