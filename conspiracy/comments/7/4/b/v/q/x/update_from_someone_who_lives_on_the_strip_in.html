<p>The casinos are now checking bags &amp; some have metal detectors etc. </p>

<p>Every single person I have talked to 100% thinks there was more than one shooter. </p>

<p>When it happened I was across the street not directly in the concert area but a guy running for his life came up to us saying his friend got shot in the face and that there were at least three shooters and they were snipers. He specifically told us that there were two on the roof and  and maybe on the ground. (I understand he was in shock and maybe could have made some of this up or thought he saw more than he did but still something to consider) </p>

<p>Trump is here today </p>

<p>Also there is facial recognition software in all of the casinos not to mention there are thousands of cameras everywhere that don’t miss a beat so why are there zero videos to be released yet? Every single local is convinced that there was more than one shooter. I went to the doctor today and the doctor and two nurses even brought it up and said they don’t believe what we’re being told. I have never seen so many people go against a story the way this has happened. Especially people you would never think would question something like this and they are .....? </p>

<p>I was eating at Whole Foods yesterday outside talking about what happened with my friend and a random guy from Canada interrupted our conversation to tell us what he thought. And of course another person saying this is all bullshit.  </p>

<p>Lastly my Uber driver told me his best friend works at Crystals (high end shopping area next to Aria) and that there was definitely a shooter there and that his friend &amp; employees had to lock themselves in the back of the store because there were actual shots being fired in the building.  </p>

<p>Oh yeah the side of Mandalay Bay that faces the highway that you can see has random windows missing which I’m sure has nothing to do with the shooting but thought I would add that if that helps anyone </p>

<p>It&#39;s an open investigation, rarely are videos released when an investigation is still in progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Just when I thought this couldn&#39;t get any darker, you have to make sense like that. I think that&#39;s a possibility but if I had to place my bet then I&#39;d guess that the authorities have reason to believe that the group who pulled this off are going to hit again soon and they don&#39;t want to trigger a mass panic. I find it surprising that nobody is pointing out that this happened just days before we might initiate an all out attack on North Korea. With all of the threats coming from North Korea, is it really so crazy to believe that they have assets in our country that are more than capable of pulling this off?</p>

The Cobra Ball ballistic detection aircraft has been flying a lot in the last week out of Japan, so it seems we are waiting for another missile launch at any moment. But your original theory could be right as well, the proliferation of camera phones making it harder and harder each time to cover stuff up.  And considering that they think he had help, there was 30 pounds of tannerite and 1,600 rounds in the vehicle he was planning on escaping in, there very well could be more planned.</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the evidence of another shooter? Keep in mind, I&#39;m specifically referring to the people saying there were shooters at other casinos. Within a few minutes of the shooting at Mandalay, there were tons of videos on social media showing the automatic gunfire.</p>

<p>People are going to try to say that there was a cover-up of other Shooters at other casinos, yet there isn&#39;t a single cell phone picture or video of any of this going down at all? I just don&#39;t buy it</p>

<p>Firing at and disabling a helicopter would have been a great way for him to increase the body count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U haven&#39;t spent time in Vegas have u? It would be grossly irresponsible to send out an air response. They are many innocent people in those resorts. Chances are he would have shot at the helicopter and caused a crash. Not much an air response could have done that wouldn&#39;t have caused more casualties. Stop and think these things all the way through before u speak. Also, they didn&#39;t know where the shots were coming from. The shooting lasted 10 minutes. Air response would have gotten there long after it was over. Not a logical response. Or even a safe one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of the &quot;why aren&#39;t they releasing videos and evidence&quot;.  Why?  If there is an active investigation, they are going going to tip off who they are hunting for if these people think they got a clean getaway&quot;. Why do we see this releasing of video all of the time, perhaps it has to due with the laws here vs every other country but America where these events happened.  Also I don&#39;t think they are going to jeprodize an investigation to appease a few thousand people on Reddit.  Hey folks, here is all of the evidence, now we&#39;re screwed because everyone is now tainted and we will never get a jury, for example.</p>

<p>Look at a drug investigation.  Do they raid a house when they get a single buy?  No they get multiple buys, learn if they are just small fish, or associated with a larger network, then they collaborate with the other investigations and go after the big fish of they are.  This takes years to happen.  Maybe if everyone would stop assuming, speculating and accussing for a week or two, not 1 hour after it happened, we might be able to have better conversations as evidence is released or more of the story comes out.</p>

<p>Maybe?</p>

<p>Personal view is, he wasn&#39;t alone and they&#39;re actively seeking a group of people (may even have some already) but by announcing it publicly it&#39;d jeopardise thingsand let them know they&#39;re after them. Again, just my theory...</p>

<p>Maybe he was an arms &#39;dealer&#39; and wanted to expose what was going on hence the wire transfers and camera setup inside the room? Plus the suicide note. But even that is all due to the fbi/lv anon on 4chan saying it was a false flag. (which very easily could of been planted by the fbi to get us riled up about something else, I mean the dude said watch were gonna leak it might be other powers at play. I mean every shooting nowadays that is random is questioned to be radical Muslims, how hard is it to predict a reporter will ask that.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the &quot;shots in multiple locations&quot; stories go, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to me. Shots were coming down from high up in Mandalay in an open space, loud sounds of gunfire bouncing off the buildings. If you don&#39;t see where it&#39;s coming from it&#39;s going to be very difficult to know. It&#39;s not hard to believe that people at another casino might think the gunfire was a lot closer than it was, and it might be happening there instead/also. </p>

<p>My friend who was there escaped to Tropicana, and was locked down by SWAT for hours despite there being no threat there. He didn&#39;t say anything about something happening there. But at the time, law enforcement had no idea if there were actually multiple shooters and still an active threat, so with people freaking out everywhere, not knowing the source of the shots, possibly mistaking first responders for attackers, reports would come in all over the place and they had to take extra precautions. That&#39;s probably why employees at Aria were locked down too. </p>

<p>The main problem with this is - if there were other shootings in other areas, why haven&#39;t we found reports of gunshot victims anywhere other than where it happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t save any, but over the last couple days I saw a ton of social media posts of people who were at the concert or on the strip near the concert when it went down and they were all saying there were multiple shooters, didn&#39;t understand why the media wasn&#39;t reporting on it, and basically they were positive or very sure it was not just one shooter.
Lots of friends and non conspiracy people I know also were questioning this thing and asking about multiple shooters, while some do believe there was more than one shooter. And these are people that normally never question the official story. I don&#39;t know, but the feel I get is that more people than normal just don&#39;t think this adds up and feel like we&#39;re definitely missing something, and multiple shooters seems to be one of the moat common theories.
Ok. I just spent 15 minutes scrolling through the history of a group chat to find an example for you. Now mind you there are plenty of other people saying similar things on social media. Just start digging.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for looking, but this is the same shit posted up yesterday. There&#39;s one video from the Aria, I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called, of people running in through some doors. That link to posted is from the person who shot that video I think. The video really isn&#39;t anything concrete. It appears to be some people scrambling into the building, to me it looks like a panic. Until there&#39;s something more solid like evidence of bullet holes or shell casings or a report of someone being shot in that area I&#39;m not going to be convinced of there being a shooter there.</p>

<p>I think these reports of shooters at other casinos are people who were confused, their casino was put on lock down after the event at the concert. They were told there was an active shooter situation, so they then thought that meant there was a shooter at their casino. But it was just preventive measures that the casino security took in response to the concert shooting.</p>

<p>Which is still very much unproven but probably can&#39;t be fully ruled out yet. What I&#39;m interested in is how he was able to effectively handle such complex weaponry. His girlfriend would know if he practiced in ranges, right? Wondering if there are gun experts out there who have commented about whether that much damage could have really been carried out solely by an old rookie shooter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s complex about what he used? He didn&#39;t use a heat seeking missile. He used rifles. Easily learned off of youtube. It takes only a minute to learn the AR15 battery of arms. Put weapon on semi and pull the trigger. It stops shooting? Look at the bolt. If it&#39;s open, reload. If it&#39;s not, tap, rack, shoot. </p>

<p>He was firing into an extremely target rich area and he fired a lot of rounds. It makes sense that he was incredibly effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not buying into any conspiracy talk, but I can see the possibility of multiple shooters. We have no proof of that yet though. As far as the idea of his amount of damage goes, it&#39;s not very difficult to spray into a crowd and cause this kind of carnage. As far as we know he wasn&#39;t really aiming, he didn&#39;t have any known specific targets. Anyone who can handle a gun would be able to do that. Also don&#39;t forget that many of the injured weren&#39;t hit by bullets but were rather injured in the mayhem of people running to safety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point, sir. I must be getting older. I look back with fondness to the &#39;Pics or it didn&#39;t happen&#39; era. </p>

<p>Either way, my $.02 -  dude was a spook and the deal burned bad (Fast &amp; Furious style). </p>

<p>I&#39;d personally love to see the OT the cleaners &amp; tail waggers are gonna have around this one. I&#39;ll surely benefit. </p>

<p>Furthermore &amp; FWIW - I solidified my opinion around the aircraft(s) first, chased money from there. Those tail #&#39;s - well that&#39;s suspect? Volant LLC - what&#39;s that? An NPO with youth focus in shared addresses? Fully calc&#39;ed beaten zone is impressive for an accountant (with just the worst planning skills).....  Plainly sloppy shitshow. I&#39;d expect more from such a meticulously maintained 1-2 operative cell. At least the male washed his $ quota to his benefit. Risky, though.... should&#39;ve spread the love around the reservations. </p>

<p>.... but, by golly - they killed Americans again. You don&#39;t have to be E-Team or Tavistock lite (international house) to find the humor here. I couldn&#39;t write a more perfect story. I&#39;m fact,  it&#39;s almost suspect in the amount of sheer folly. A double-x is, I&#39;m afraid, outside of their apparently limited skilksets.</p>

<p>Note to feds- just in case : I&#39;m of sound mind and I love my life.  Besides,  I will see you coming because you clowns can&#39;t even pull a simple bamboozle any more. Fuck, bring back Cheney or something. You are further discrediting the cess pools you came from. Pretty soon, that gun control thing you&#39;re going for is gonna look a lot like that election you took a crack at. Soon, we just might be coming to ask you some things. </p>

<p>See you soon, I hope! </p>

<p>Love,
(YKW, right?)</p>

<p>winky face, dickheads.</p>

Yeah, the media and the government lie, but posting speculation about arms deals gone wrong and supposed money laundering doesn&#39;t really add up either. It really seems people are desperate because this dude didn&#39;t fit their mold of the bad guys, which to a lot of those dumb fucks is anyone not white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also a local here.</p>

<p>Of course that part of the Strip is closed down. Its an absolutely massive crime scene that took place in one of the most popular tourist destinations on Earth. And similar reasoning goes for Why the videos haven&#39;t been released yet. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

<p>I personally do not question the single shooter narrative, because there hasn&#39;t been any even remotely convincing evidence that there was more than one shooter. Especially consider that the claims of Shooters at other casinos has yet to be verified by any cell phone pictures or footage. Contrast this to the shooting at Mandalay Bay, where there were half a dozen videos on social media of the gunfire shortly after. </p>

<p>I <strong>do</strong> think that the shooters motives are going to be a very muddied water. It&#39;s an extremely bizarre series of events and I&#39;m curious to know what information comes out in that regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you hear the initial weapon report which is a total of about 15 or 20 rounds which sound very close. Then you hear the sound from far off in the distance which may initially be the sounds of the bullets impacting hundreds of yards away. The concert grounds were reported to be 400 yards away. BUT, the sounds in the distance continues well after the shooting stops. 8 or 9 seconds is what I estimate. AND there are MANY more rounds fired that the 15 or 20 that were fired from the initial barrage. I estimate as many as 50 or more! The &quot;close&quot; shooting ends at 1:14 mark but the &quot;distant&quot; sounds continue until 1:21 mark. So you are telling me it would take a bullet 6 or 7 seconds to travel 400 yards and strike a target in the concert venue??? AND that you would hear 3 times as many bullet impacts than were originally fired???? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm ok good point. I listened again and initially I heard what you&#39;re pointing out. Though after a few more listens, I think there&#39;s still only one report.</p>

<p>He starts shooting from 1:08 to 1:10, then we hear impacts until 1:12 where he begins shooting again. Around 1:15 the sound muffles but I think this might be caused by whoever is holding the phone. Regardless of the muffle, it sounds as if the shooting stops around 1:19 and we hear impacts until 1:21.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG, now you are saying it is caused by her muffling the phone??? She is clearly holding the phone up and recording. So not sure how she could muffle it, but even muffling the sound, those shots are VERY close and it would not significantly diminish the sound of the rounds going off that close to her. Truly, to me, that sounds like those rounds are at ground level, very close to her. If there were rounds being fired from inside a hotel room, 32 floors up from her location, they would not sound that loud. The sound would dissipate outward from the window into the surrounding atmosphere 32 floor up. If you figure 10 feet per floor, that is 320 feet in the air. The height of Mandalay Bay is 480 feet. He was apparently very near the top. Those rounds sound like they are being fired very close to her location,  not 300 feet up. Sound waves traveling through air travel longitudinally from the source. So a significant portion of the sound from the muzzle would travel directly forward. Particularly if he was firing from inside the room. If he may have had the muzzle sticking out of the window, the sound wave will travel peripherally but it is still 320 feet in the air and the sound would degrade considerably, it would not be that loud. But that is a whole other argument. Spin it how you want, I know what I hear and, from what I hear a very large percentage of the general public are agreeing with me. I&#39;m not going to argue with you any more. The evidence speaks for itself!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. I cannot deny, that security gate stuff is really weird, bit I&#39;d like to address the gunmen first.</p>

<p>The victim thinks that there may have been at least two and at most four shooters excluding Paddock, and he thinks that some bullets were being fired horizontally. I don&#39;t have perfect information so I certainly cannot jump to the conclusion that he is wrong, but by that same token I also cannot jump to the conclusion that he is right, but I want to imagine a hypothetical where what he says is true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with Las Vegas so I&#39;m using <a href="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkHvbXELoCFBjWhVb7_r94kF6Qjv5bft1DBAM4X6WNtQH1CJ9CI9AZ9OXw">this image for reference</a>. </p>

<p>To me, it looks like there are too many obstacles blocking the line of sight between the ground floor of the Mandalay and the destination of the festival, too much to make it possible for shooters to be located there. But this man recounts being fired at horizontally, so where were they? Were they literally shooting from the boulevard? Seems very unlikely. Were they planted in the audience waiting to draw concealed weapons amidst the chaos? The victim claims he ran about 200 yards away in a straight line from the source of Paddock&#39;s position and hid behind a car. He then recounts bullets traveling by horizontally, as well as the approaching sound of gunfire. It is highly unlikely that these bullets could have originated from across the boulevard, so they must have been fired from within the show grounds.</p>

<p>So in this hypothetical we have at least two and at most four gunmen located at the festival. We also have plenty of footage and photography from the festival. But what we don&#39;t have is footage of even one additional gunmen, let alone two, three or even four, and I find that to be very unlikely.</p>

<p>As for the victim&#39;s story of gates being closed at 10PM and policemen denying any kind of access or assistance during an active shooting is very, very strange and I hope that it is investigated thoroughly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I would think that sooner of later we would see some sort of footage of shooters. But, in the midst of the shooting, I don&#39;t think too many people would be filming. Most would just duck and cover or run for their lives. Especially if they felt they were being attacked from near them at the ground level. What we also don&#39;t have is footage of the shots coming from the supposed 32nd floor windows, even though there is many videos showing the hotel and the 32nd floor windows in the background. Don&#39;t you think there should at least be some muzzle flashes coming from that location during the shooting?</p>

All 2-4 of these shooters not only evaded any kind of footage (and there&#39;s plenty) but they also completely evaded capture. A small venue occupied by 22,000 attendees as well as police and we do not have any visual confirmation of even one extra gunmen, let alone two, three or even four? I find that very unlikely.</p>

<p>Now the muzzle flash. Paddock is in a dark hotel room and it&#39;s 10PM at night. Our eyes adjust to the dark in order to take in more light. The cones in our eyes are very good at adjusting to light and can fully adjust in as little as five minutes, but the rods in our eyes can take up to 45 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness.</p>

<p>So picture this: we have a 64-year old man in a dark room relying on his eyesight in order to effectively use his weapons. What is going to happen when the muzzle of his weapon flashes even at least once? Same thing that happens when someone takes a flash photo of you: flash blindness, followed by blotches of colour that obscure your vision for minutes until your cones settle down again. There was no muzzle flash because Paddock had literally turned his hotel room into an arsenal and very likely had the foresight to be using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_suppressor">flash suppressor</a>. Just as the wiki page states, the flash suppressor is primarily for the benefit of the shooter, not so much as a means of concealment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are three distinct sounds in a gunshot, the muzzle blast, the sound of the bullet breaking the sound barrier (usually the &quot;crack&quot;) and the sound of the impact. Generally, the sound waves for the muzzle blast and the sonic crack travel in a similar direction as the bullet (as they&#39;re made by the ignition of the charge that propels the bullet and the actual bullet itself) not &quot;perpendicularly&quot; or &quot;directly forward&quot;. Your understanding of the physics here is way off and it&#39;s impeding your ability to make a rational assessment. Also, saying a &quot;a large percentage of the general public&quot; agrees with you is an unsupportable statement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually like, you know, watch, the actual.. images.. in the video you are talking about so much you will see, really god damn clearly that the person recording GETS INSIDE OF A VEHICLE AT 1:15. Being as it is a solid object, and assuming or now the windows are closed, many models of cars have significant reductions in sound volume compared to outside. For example in my 300 you usually can not hear the engine noise of another car passing at typical urban road speeds. </p>

<p>When sound hits an object, any object, that energy causes the object to vibrate. The heavier it is, the less it will vibrate. The stronger the sound (aka higher energy) the more it can cause it to vibrate.</p>

<p>However, what you are implying is that you basically can not hear a gunshot from 300ft away if it&#39;s not aimed at you. Thats just not sensible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what I am implying at all. I didn&#39;t say you couldn&#39;t hear it. I am simply stating that the sound of the gunfire, in my opinion, is much louder that it should be if she were sitting in the car a ground level and the shooting is occurring 300 feet up in the air above her aimed in another direction. That the gunfire sounds much closer that if it were 300 feet away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read the comment by <a href="/u/KeepCalmFFS">/u/KeepCalmFFS</a>? The soundwaves travel in the direction of the bullets. Paddock is aiming down at about a 45 degree angle. Now factor in that this weapon&#39;s report could be anywhere from 140db to 165db, louder than a jet engine at take off. In other words, even from 300ft away it&#39;s going to sound very fucking loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I will address your questions as best I can. The only places really in his sector or arc of fire were the edge of the Luxor (Primarily the parking lot), the concert venue, whatever is immiediately north of the concert venue (Either staging for the venue or maybe some sort of logistics/storage yard?), the Shrine of the most holy redeemer (church) and a motel and some commercial buildings just south of the venue are in range. I think the latter were out of his arc of fire, however; I do not think he would have been able to hit them.</p>

<p>The weapons he was using are not <em>inherently</em> exceptionally difficult to aim as something like a medium machine gun would be. Bump stocks/gat cranks or similar equipment <em>would</em> make it harder to control them, if he was in fact using them. However, he was shooting at a giant mass of people, not clearly targetting specific individuals, it was next to impossible to miss. </p>

<p>However sites farther than that are not likely to have been struck and if they were, likely any rounds in that area would have little power behind them left. And we know EMS was staging casualties at the church, which is directly in his field of fire, and (as far as I can tell) he had direct line of sight of. But at nearly 600m You are at the bare edge of effectiveness of a 5.56x45mm. And depending on the rounds, chances are they would not even go that far anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most semi automatic weapons arent that complex, and its been proven hes a known &quot;gun guy&quot; with tons of weapons at home so this probably isnt his first rodeo at at least shooting weapons like this and he may have even shot modded ones before</p>

<p>Now as far as how he was able to effectively shoot and injure so many people, well firstly most injuries probably occured in the mass exodus of people trying to escape and knocking other people down or people getting trampled but besides that the shooter is in an elevated position(and high ground is usually where you wanna be when engaging someone) plus its a thick mob of people not moving at the start all he would have to do is aim anywhere near center and he would hit some people plus the recoil is gonna help spread the muzzle around more giving more spread to the bullets being shot</p>

Not &quot;every local here thinks there was more than one shooter.&quot; Of the multiple people I knew that actually attended the concert, nobody has said that. Hell, half of the people there were drunk as fuck. It was absolute chaos. Most people had know clue where the shots were even coming from. I listened to the scanners for hours and heard all of the &quot;shots fired&quot; reports at Aria, Luxor, and NYNY. Then I heard them say &quot;code 4&quot; which means all clear, talking  about NYNY. There hasn&#39;t been one shred of believable evidence of shooters anywhere other than Mandalay Bay. No signs of bullet holes at ANY of the locations you mentioned. Nobody injured and no footage, while the Mandalay Bay location was well documented. If people shot up all of these locations like you claim, there would be SOMETHING. Unless you truly believe somebody orchestrated fake shooters running around shooting blanks, then it sounds like a crock of shit. I&#39;ve sent the countless FB posts, trust me. Most are laughable at best. </p>

The strobe coming from that window in the cab driver&#39;s video is the same strobe you see in the girls instagram video.

Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/YZ12xTxs6Ok?t=42s">this</a> again, starting at 0:45 you hear gun shots that sound like they&#39;re quite far away, then at 1:06 it sounds like the shooter is right above her, even though she only moved ~10 feet. It may also play into the other theory where someone at the event said there were firecrackers being lit right before the shooting started to create confusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i was on the strip during the incident and at around 11:30pm, Crystals was barricaded (pieces of wood placed inbetween the handle bars of the swinging doors) and nobody was allowed to enter. The cop inside the building told us Crystals was closed and we needed to head back onto the strip without explaining to us why. As a little crowd was forming from outside Crystals, an Air Force vet banged on the glass door and yelled at the cop to let us in. &quot;He said we can&#39;t be out here, everyone&#39;s scared.&quot; When he said this time I certainly didn&#39;t know what he was talking about and we googled &quot;las vegas news&quot; as the cop allowed me and the crowd to enter Crystals. That&#39;s when we found out that there was a mass shooting happening and the active shooter was still on the loose. So as we entered the building, everyone is in shock and we stuck together as we were escorted by a cop in an eerie echoing inside of a building to the top floor of where the tram goes for safety.</p>

<p>So. IF there was a shooting or shooters at Crystals, why would cops allow us back into Crystals for shelter while with the current information they have, allow us into Crystals for shelter. The whole place would&#39;ve been quarantined off well before i even got onto the walkway towards Crystals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually convinced that was it, but not one single spent casings can be seen in the released photos- at this point in torn, I suppose there&#39;s a chance - but the way the shells were spread around that room, it looked like a fucking staged set up bunch of shit - an accountant? The most meticulous of our species, and a man meticulous enough to for at minimum 10 months plan and pull off the most devastating event in the past 10 years- alone- ... and yet at a time when he should be the most focused and in mode of battle, he suddenly starts rolling around in ammo on the floor ? Gtfoh- this whole thing stinks to high heaven- this guy got murked- release the survelience video - or bust </p>
