       I haven’t seen this much hostility towards theories since Russia/Trump first started. There is no constructive debating going on it’s just name calling and tearing down people who are trying to understand what happened. If you think the theory on the shooting that it was ISIS related and the shooter was an undercover FBI agent is “ridiculous” then give your own theory on what is going on. Just going for ad hominem attacks on the OP makes you look dumb. No one knows what happened or why, quit acting as though you do know because you don’t, none of us do. That is why we should have constructive debates giving information and evidence and our own theories as to why some guy shot at and killed people.

       Exactly OP. Though I don't totally mind it, the more hostile and combative, the more it signals to me that user has a pre-determined motive or purpose in here. Generally the real user base here can interact as grown-ups.

       Yes, the echoes from the nearby buildings would make determining the direction of the shots difficult at times. However, there is no overlapping gun fire in any of the videos. If there were multiple people shooting that would not be the case, especially if they were in separate locations.

       I just remember hearing the gun shots and it sounding like multiple different guns.  There were high pitched shots and low pitched shots, and some that sounded like they were coming from different distances.  I don't discount that it could have also been an audial illusion, but I also very much don't discount that there might have been more than one shooter.

       He didn't say there was for sure another shooter. He said there could have been more than one shooter. The only way to disprove someone saying something could have been the case is if you have evidence against it.

       Right, but at this point we have one dead shooter, no windows blown out other than the suite he was in, and no videos with overlapping gun fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea there were multiple shooters only plausibly held water until about dawn on Monday. We have to ask for concrete evidence at this point.

       You both have a point. But you already know the answer to your initial question... the evidence is some unconfirmed witness accounts as well as some inconsistencies on the police scanner. It's not concrete but it's still possible.

       None of the inconsistencies go beyond people on the  ground being confused about where the shots were coming from.  There is no evidence of over lapping gunfire which is a major problem for the idea there were multiple shooters, not to mention the fact there are no other windows blown out.

       That is a reasonable statement. But sorry, it's still possible there were two shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there were 2 shooters in the hotel room, who killed Paddock and then fled. If the cops showed us the footage from the room, we'd know Paddock pulled the triggers, but according to them none were recording...

       Even under these circumstances you shouldn't use name calling.  Why?  Because there actually
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been enough events that do in fact use crisis actors with wholly staged scenarios.  It's no big surprise that some people get confused and think that many of these events are staged.  Some in fact
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one seems to be pretty real and non-staged.  However, even within the context of real events, TPTB can and will manipulate the narrative by lying and placing certain people in certain locations during interviews, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Events can be entirely real, or entirely faked, or a mix of both so that there are some elements that are real, and others that are staged within any single event.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems real people got shot and killed here, and for anyone calling this a staged event, I would simply say that A) it seems
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       people did get shot here, and B) some events can have both staged and real scenarios.

       Deadliest shooting in US history, should be an insane abundance of multitudinous photos of bullet damage and gunshot wounds, and medical response. But instead you use name-calling. Sounds legit.

       Many regular non-conspiratorial people are starting to smell the rat with this event, which is why there is an obvious concerted effort to repeat the lie so that at least people think that people were really massacred. Though it has not been established that real shots were really fired, anyone who questions this is met with personal attacks, references to Liveleak footage which shows neither gunshot wounds nor medical personnel nor bullet damage, or the usual vague and unbacked claims that "I kno someone who died."

       Just go and look at my history and how I was mercilessly attacked for having an unbiased honest opinion. Sure I may have defended myself a bit, but my overall point was to just spark a realistic discussion with light conspiracy under tones.

       We have shills of course, and if a shills larger purpose is to disrupt they may participate even if the shooting doesn't directly further their goals.

       the issue is that a certain segment of the conspiracy community has been coopted by neocon talking points and have taken up the left/ right dichotomy that they previously rallied against.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "alt-right" conspiracy group group would like to attribute the event to ISIS or ANTIFA, as per their narrative.  Much like "the left" would like to attribute it to the accessibility of guns.

       Right, but at this point we have one dead shooter, no windows blown out other than the suite he was in, and no videos with overlapping gun fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea there were multiple shooters only plausibly held water until about dawn on Monday. We have to ask for concrete evidence at this point.
