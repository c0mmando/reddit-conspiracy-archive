    <div class="md"><p>Lol no we don&#39;t. It&#39;s always conveniently nonexistent or the cameras were broken at the time. </p>

<p>Just off the top of my head, the CCTV snapshot released at the Ariana Grande bombing HOAX does not even prove that the alleged Muslim culprit was at the venue at the time. </p>

<p>But yeah, you&#39;re right, there should be dozens of CCTV videos.</p>

<p>Fun fact: there&#39;s not even footage of any person or thing being shot. I haven&#39;t even seen an image of a bunch of bullet damage at the scene. Think of that being true, at the &quot;deadliest mass shooting in us history.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems like it could just as easily be &quot;conducting research&quot;. You ask the broad questions, get some answers, hone your questions again, etc.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m not going to go out of my way to prove something so absurd when you can just watch the damn videos.</p>

<p>And besides, the videos of people taking bullets, you would simply say that&#39;s faked as well because that&#39;s clearly what you want to believe. People taking bullets isn&#39;t like you see in the movies where their arm is blown off and blood starts spewing out all over the place. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is absolutely no clear evidence to indicate it was a hoax where no one died; just a bunch of circumstantial nonsense. And I find the notion that a massive cover-up/hoax perpetuated and kept secret by hundreds to thousands of civilians, &quot;crisis actors&quot; and local police to be delusional.</p>

<p>I do believe the mainstream media twists facts, misreports, and pushes narratives that aren&#39;t always entirely truthful. I also know the government keeps things from the general population and has done some shady shit. But I don&#39;t believe Sandy Hook was a hoax where nobody died, no. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that you took logic as me calling you dumb lol.  The photos look to be taken on a cellphone and probably taken before the scene was fully and professionally documented.  SWAT member probably took the photo&#39;s to confirm the shooter was down.  Sends it to his chief, but you know one of them probably just showed his buddy.  Who sent it to his girlfriend.  Whats so crazy about that? Leaks happen. What is going on is they are investigating the largest mass shooting in modern US history, and 3 days in you want all the details of the case given to you.  I&#39;m not claiming to know what happened.  But you believing you are entitled to sensitive police matters screams &quot;I&#39;m an armchair investigator and you aren&#39;t being fair&quot;.  It&#39;s like being mad at the coroner for not being able to talk about the injuries of the victims because they hadn&#39;t alerted all the families.  This isn&#39;t just a school where you have a roll and know exactly who was in there.  Its VEGAS.  Everyone was from everywhere and there were 22,000 people there.  There is so much to investigate and day 3 you are crying like a little bitch because they won&#39;t show you their highly sensitive job details.  Guess what buddy, if you wanna know so badly, and be on the in, go join a fucking police force.  But don&#39;t come here crying like a baby because they won&#39;t release an open case&#39;s evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slightly off topic question--If San Bernadino was a false flag, do you think its a possibility that TPTB chose Muslims as the perpetuators in order to prevent the right wing from thinking that it was an anti-gun conspiracy? So that it would distract the right wing by allowing them to use the incident as an anti-muslim argument, while it <em>also</em> strengthened the left-wing&#39;s resolve in their anti-gun agenda? This way, they are fueling division through creating a false flag that contained two separate aspects of political discourse (Islamic Terrorism and Gun Control); each of which strengthens a political agenda on both sides. This would then result in higher tensions between both parties, as both sides would gain a political talking point from the San Bernadino attack that would reinforce their respective agendas. Divide and conquer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theyll release footage, but will it be manipulated?  The shooter was dead already when the shooting actually took place.  When do you think the windows were popped out?  (Both)
It would of made more sense to get a lower level floor for him, but it provided better cover being higher up the building.  They would have been able to see the black op go down.  What if a military drone was actually doing the shooting and the staged suites we already setup? The windows could have even been setup to break with timed trigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a full-on skeptic but this shit gets so old that it is obvious that this is complete fishy bullshit. The incident is over. If the official narrative is that he acted alone and yada yada yada then release all footage of everything. It&#39;s Vegas, there are cameras on everything at all times. If there are accomplices or people under investigation then they know that they are under investigation and they know that law enforcement has this evidence and they are fleeing the country regardless. Why not open-source this investigation if there is one and put out all the footage for everyone to see. If it went down exactly like they say it did then let us see it and it could be easily put to bed. Fuck this shit. They are lying up a storm to cover their asses. This is the most ham-handed crap I have ever seen. Pics or GTFO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slightly off topic question--If San Bernadino was a false flag, do you think its a possibility that TPTB chose Muslims as the perpetuators in order to prevent the right wing from thinking that it was an anti-gun conspiracy? So that it would distract the right wing by allowing them to use the incident as an anti-muslim argument, while it <em>also</em> strengthened the left-wing&#39;s resolve in their anti-gun agenda? This way, they are fueling division through creating a false flag that contained two separate aspects of political discourse (Islamic Terrorism and Gun Control); each of which strengthens a political agenda on both sides. This would then result in higher tensions between both parties, as both sides would gain a political talking point from the San Bernadino attack that would reinforce their respective agendas. Divide and conquer.</p>
