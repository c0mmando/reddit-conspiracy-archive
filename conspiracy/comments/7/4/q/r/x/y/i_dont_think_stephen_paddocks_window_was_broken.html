       I've analyzed the most high quality image we have of the Mandalay Bay hotel during the shooting that took place on the 1st.
       <a href="https://imgur.com/jKoKtds">
        This
       </a>
       is the image. Zooming into the image, you can
       <a href="https://imgur.com/w5JVvPf">
        easily identify the floor that Paddock was on
       </a>
       . In
       <a href="https://imgur.com/0CnHirm">
        this
       </a>
       zoomed image, you can see the curtains flowing in a right direction, overlapping the frame of the building, out of the guest room, but not Paddock's.
       <a href="https://imgur.com/KQ8Iw64">
        This is my interpretation of why Paddock's window could NOT have been broken at the time of the picture
       </a>
       . Furthermore, two pistol shots heard in
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74htbb/video_from_outside_mandalay_bay_2_single_hand_gun/">
        this
       </a>
       video (3:25 and 3:35) show a weird story. If that was the gun that killed Paddock, why were two shots fired? I think the security guard, Jesus Campos may have something to do with it. We need to ID this guy quick and make sure he doesn't "die in surgery" or never have his face shown. What if the bullet in his leg was the second pistol shot? What do you guys think about the images i've posted?

       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wmQFu">
        Here's

       a picture of the windows in the day-time.

       I have seen a picture of him posted on twitter hailed as a hero. It was a selfie he supposedly took (I say supposedly as there is no verification it was him, or if it was taken on the 1st)

       4 years in the USMC, and fired enough weapons to know that tempered glass is actually quite strong, and when you shoot it, even if you puncture it, it may only leave a spidered bullet hole, which isn’t enough to shoot from.

       Is it possible the tape and the hammer were for putting a weapon together? I saw a video where you needed a hammer and painters tape to construct the gun, in order to be careful not to scratch the paint.

       No. What you saw was someone hammer pins into a lower. They used the painters tape to not damage the paint. If this dude was literally assembling lower receivers in the hotel room, he's an idiot.

      <p>
       Even if the rifles were broken down in two pieces (upper and lower) foe transportation, no tools are required to put them together from there.

       Agreed! I can take my uppers and lowers apart with almost no tools. A pen can push the pins out where the upper and lower attach. Your fingers alone can push those pins back in easily

       Actually both hammers are different.  I've seen those hammers before and one is a short 2lb hammer and the other is a long 3 lb hammer.  Close but not the same.

       For my work, we use some of these bigger hammers and the 2lb one and 4lb hammer are very similar.  Some brands have the shorter 2lb one, and the 4lb version is just a bit longer.  In the picture that was posted, it does look like one hammer is slightly longer than the other.

       Well those were just kinda generic pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do work in the construction trade and work around a lot of other contractors of various trades.  These 2-4 lb hammers are very common.  They have short ones and longer ones and they come in many colors.  But yes, those yellow ones in the original picture in question, are very common.

       I haven't really read it in detail, but it seems like those hammers wouldn't do much unless the windows were heavily shot through.  Which could be a possibility.

       Pehaps you could say "they appear to be the same" instead nof they "are" the same. You don't see how your poor choice of words can cause others to come to the wrong conclusion? Just admit you intentionally jumed to a wrond conclusion becuase you wanted the evidence to fit your agenda.

       I doubt he broke the window with a hammer. Windows with contact with an exterior have two panels of glass at least, this being a high end building It would have even more, plus it could be laminated which makes it almost impossible to break

       Usually these type of facade systems use one insulated glass unit the inside comprised of a lite of glass (most likely tempered) with a 3/8"-5/16" airspacer and another layer of glass (the airgap between the two that's created by the spacer is filled with inert gas and used for its R-value for temp insulation), then the extruded aluminum frame, then another insulating glass unit on the outside, but the lite of the IG unit on the exterior is usually laminated glass for a building like this. It's tough to get through by just punching or falling into accidentally (there's layers to it), but if you shoot it and/or hit it with a sledgehammer, you can get through it with force.

       I work in the glass/glazing business, we do building similar to this but on a smaller scale.  First, what u/einbierbitte says below is partially correct.  The insulated glass in an aluminum extruded frame is a bit off.  There should only be a single insulated unit in an aluminum frame.  A typical makeup would be 1" insulated unit (1/4" inner lite, 1/2" spacer and 1/4" outer lite) in an aluminum frame.  In the daytime picture you can see where the inner pane is still intact on the left window behind the exterior pane.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess would be it would be Heat Strengthened at least to reduce the heat stress from the tinting on the exterior piece.  The way it breaks makes it look Heat Strengthened.  If it was tempered it should have completely shattered.  It is not laminated glass though, based on the pictures.  Even if the exterior pane of the insulated glass unit was only 1/4" laminated, he would have to beat the piece out of the frame to get a clear shot.  For those who don't know, laminated glass is what's in your vehicles windshield.  It's two pieces of glass fused together with a plastic interlayer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The insulated units are typically 3/4" to an 1" bigger than the opening, so when the unit is glazed in, it is captured on all four sides.  It's tough to tell in the daytime picture, but it does not look butt glazed, where the glass butts into another piece of glass and is only captured at the head and the sill.  Unless he shot it out, but seems like he used a "hammer like" tool.   If this was laminated glass, it should have held in the frame until is deformed enough to fall out as a single piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how much force is required to break it... not that much.  Even for a guy his age it should be pretty easy.  I would be more worried about getting cut than anything.

       You definitely could be right that it was a system with just the 1 IG in an aluminum frame, which would mean it's even easier to get through than I said. We did some Schüco systems like that for smaller projects, but what I worked on was mostly considerably larger buildings, both private and gov't, using a proprietary facade system. With those we usually used a setup more like what I explained using aluminum frames and 2 IG units and laminated, so I assumed that's what they probably used, but could be wrong since I haven't seen any good pictures of the windows, really. In my experience even the laminated glass isn't
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       tough to get through once it's been penetrated at at least one point, especially if you're actively trying to get through it.

       u/einbierbitte my assumptions were based mostly on the time it was constructed, late 90's...  I've used of triple glazed units, but never two IGU's.  We did a Coast Guard base in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, that had to have triple glazed blast mitigation units and impact resistant framing.  The Coast Guard standard specification assumes every station needs to survive a Category 5 hurricane... even in Michigan.

       What I thought was also interesting in the video with the 2 single shots is you hear a girl next to the person taking the video saying "there's glass falling from Mandalay Bay" right after the shots. You'd think at that point glass wouldn't be falling anymore. Maybe those 2 shots were the breaking of the windows

       It’s funny, I asked my mom what she thought and she actually came up with this on her own. And she’s not usually too skeptical. I think it’s entirely possible this is what actually happened.

       there is a inconsistancy in the windows it should be dark like the other blown out window. 
for those before you ask i took the image
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/undefined.png">
        you supplied us
       </a>
       and i left the layers out in the open i do admit it would be really easy for me to edit this photo and tell you all that theres nothing here and I could easily edit the photo in a way to make it look like there is something to this post. But if you want to take it upon your self you can recreate the image by..

      <p>
       -brightness contrast 100 / 100 
-invert

       Damn. The window is perfectly intact. Also another thing to look at is the daytime picture of the windows I posted. Notice how only the bottom half is smashed? Wouldn't Paddock have a shitty view with only the bottom half opened. Also, if he did that, he would have had to be okay with large shards of glass maybe falling on his head while shooting.

       if true yeah and no it would just make this even more fucky. it would make him appear to be the only shooter but we dont know who was in that room before the breach and we dont know where those other shots in the cab video would have come from ( roof? ) i feel like everyones over looked a roof shooter theory

       Possible but doubtful.  I looked at the concert venue from Google maps and he couldn't shoot at the crowd as a whole. Is there a video of the whole shooting. It might be possible to do a poisson distribution that could tell us alot

       If he was inside the window 2-3 feet his wouldn’t have been able to see the target. 10 degree line of sight due to height of shooter and distance to target. He would’ve had to have the barrel right at the window line. If he sat back he would’ve been shooting through the floor.

       I believe he was shooting off the couch. Either way, if he was close enough to the window to line up that 10 degree line of sight, everyone would’ve seen muzzle flash.

       The math doesn’t add up. Not high enough to be far enough to hide muzzle flash. If you watch the videos out there that show Mandalay when the shooting was going on, there’s zero muzzle flash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, if you want to skip this all entirely, someone in another thread proved the windows were even broken when the shooting started.

       I don't think the extended mags shown in some of the photos would work with the bipeds shown in the photos. A standard 30 round mag, sure, but the extended mags are too long to allow him to use a bipod. He'd need to be standing or kneeling to use them. The long bursts had to be 100 round mags and there's a lot of those stacked up in the corner.

       Has anyone said anything about the sound profiles of the weapons used?  Bc AR15 with a bump stock don't sound like the guns heard on the concert crowd and cab driver videos.  That sounds more like an M240 SAW, or an equivalent.

       I checked the original image and I'm pretty sure the right window is also damaged. The bottom half of the window is definitely a lighter grey tone as the rest of the window. This side of the hotel isn't lit as much as the central part of the hotel, so the curtain might not reflect as much light as it does in the left window. Also the line of the facade below the windows seems to be broken up below the right window.

       The question I have, that I haven't seen answered, is wtf does it take to break one of these windows? Do we know the type and composition of the glass?
      </p>
      <p>
       Few reasons I want to know that. First off, how hard would it be to break with a hammer? Then, would an errant bullet from a .357 or a .223 be capable of breaking this kind of window? How about 7.62? Also, what kind of break pattern could we expect from these windows? Is it like safety glass where it would star and shatter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we could infer quite a bit about the authenticity of what has been reported if we just know what kind of windows we have here.

       Well the first misconception people have is they think the windows are bulletproof. They aren't. As for the bullets breaking the window, I wouldn't be surprised if the .357 was the only gun that could break the window completely without ricochet.

       Totally agree, and I do not have this misconception. I do think structural glass like this
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a bit more durable than other types of glass though. And probably double paned, at least? That is why I am asking for an unequivocal explanation of what kind of glass we have here. Until we know that, we can't know what could have broken it. A lot of theories depend on the composition of that glass.

       A good google tool is adding a "-Shooting" tag or a "-Paddock" tag. That usually removes all of the bullshit and lets me actually see stuff that matters. I really couldn't find anything on window panes other than they are more than 18 years old. The Mandalay was built in 98.

       So this shows that one was broken at the time of this photo and the second wasn’t? I think timeframe of this photo is critical then, because he could have easily just broken the second window in the middle of the rampage. But if it was after he killed himself that the second window broke, that’d be odd. If no windows were broken? That’d be a crazy situation.

       well the cab driver video i think if im going the one shooter route would suggest the difference in volume of the shots heard suggest shooting out one side of the hotel then the other . so the window would have been busted out already no matter what. but now the question has been asked was the other window even broken and so far i cant prove it was has opened the door to new theories and questions

       that's kinda what it suggests considering the narrative is he was shooting out two windows thats why it was hard to detect where the shots came from at first , what i see as a possible correlation is the fact the second room where this window in question resides was in the second room, the second room which the sheriff said swat had to breach because it was " locked " which means pattock wouldn't have had access to that room in the last moments of his life. maybe it blew when they breached?

       no they only "leaked" the ones that would support the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       imagine the shit storm the fbi would get if there was another mass shooting in connection to this one... that type of fall back makes me think there was one shooter but the lack of evidence and secracy surrounding this "investigation" into this case. a case that appears to be CLOSED by all means considering it WAS JUST ONE GUY and hes DEAD. sooo what are they holding back , who are they "protecting" and why.

       Maybe the shooter initially just made holes with that boxcutter to not make noise then at the end just said fuck it and blew the windows out.

       Paddock did his homework.  My guess, he cut out the bottom half using a flat edge and hammer.  He elevated himself on a table 3 or 4 foot back.  He sniped targets until the masses started to panic.  Once they panicked he pulled out the loud bump stock and started shooting.  He paused to knock out more glass or because he saw movement in the hallway.

       Not agreeing or disagreeing with you just adding that one of the videos posted on here yesterday that recorded two single shots being fired had the kids talking about how glass was falling out of Mandalay Bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I'm thinking about it the glass was supposedly falling right around the time he supposedly shot himself according to those kids?

       At around 1:45 she said you could see glass falling when she's talking about what happened. I think that video was made after the picture was taken and all the shots we're hearing were from the window that was broke 2nd. I think the last 2 shots you hear are the 2 shots he took at the jet fuel tanks, hoping to ignite them and give him a distraction to escape. When that didn't work he shot himself. How loud would a pistol be from that high up, inside the room, and inside his mouth? Could also explain why there isn't that much brass on the floor in pictures from the room, he did most of the shooting in the other one. The rifle that is over his leg looks like it has a bigger scope compared to the one to the left of his leg, but it could just look that way because of the angle.

       Because I have a wild imagination...but what if Stephen is the patsy. And the two shots were to shoot the window open, then the actual real shooter used the second window to escape the hotel room. Breaks the glass, girl describes the glass falling, the actual shooter ropes up into the foundation room/4 seasons part of Mandalay Bay.

       Makes sense based on how his guns were modded out. The guns with scopes did not have bump modifications and were set up for semi-auto fire (ie he specifically picked out a target with the scope then shot them). [You can see the difference in the pseudo automatic and semi-auto loadout here].
      </p>
      <p>
       Next: if you're wondering why the pseudo-full auto weapon lacked a scope/bipod that's because of the bump mod. The bump stock works by making the entire front of the gun slide back and forth. Meaning, if there was a standard bipod on it the bipod would scrape across the surface it's on. You can get a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Kq2t5kzMY">
        special bipod
       </a>
       that accounts for this and puts the bipod on a sliding guide that works kind of like a guide for a drawer on a nightstand. For the same reason, a bump stock makes it hard to use a scope. The scope would move back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. if we go with the single shooter theory (which I'm not debating for or against) it'd can be assumed that he obviously had a semi-auto, scoped rifle and thus he likely used it. As sick as it is, it kind of makes sense to start with semi-auto shots until panic started and then switch over when your targets are no longer standing still.

       Not sure I know either.. didn’t know if they were cleaner or something? It’s just bugging me out that I was standing there looking at the suite he was in. Also thought maybe someone could find it useful for something or at least interesting to see the perspective from the floor.

       There are many dark (in this version) windows in the hotel. One vs the other window being dark is meaningless when there are dozens of dark windows - unless all of those windows were broken, too. If dark in your image means less light, then the shooter likely would have had the curtain pulled of the way letting light out. What do you think? And OP? u/Zenyx_ Is there some other reason the darkness/brightness in these windows is different from the others?

       Couldn't the brightness difference between the two windows just be due to shooter having the light off in his room? Also u/Zenyx

       Okay so we concluded with this thread that some time after the photo was taken, he broke the second window. Nice we figured out what chronological order is.

       Why are other non-broken windows dark like the broken one? Seems like the dark vs not dark with these filters doesn't determine whether or not a window is broken.

       Right. It's just inverting colours so light is dark. It's essentially saying "there is no light in the window therefore it is not broken".
Not conclusive for me.

       No it's not we have a reference window I think we all agree is blown out in op pic . But the one on question does not appear to share the same anomaly, so I put the invert layer to help our eyes see consistentsies since most of that image is dark I inverted it so most of it was light then you can spot the dark spots which would signify a broken window in the case of the 32nd floor in this section of the hotel. With that said we can infer because of the two photos of analyzed the one window we all kind of agree is blown out is blown out but the second window isn't .. we can refer back to the color photo when we see dark spots in other parts of the hotel and quickly dismiss them as just being lights on unless you care to point out something I missed. Thanks . I gain nothing from being right about this if I am , with that said I like many others are in pursuit of the truth . If  you don't see it or agree I really don't mind it's no offense to me o just hope I explained how this kinda teeters my own belief to that window not being bashed out .

       But why do other windows not conform to the paradigm? There are tons of windows that look identical to the "broken" one under your filters. How do we know it's even broken therefore? Or that the other one is NOT broken?

       I think she's suggesting she SAW glass falling I assume they've been tucked off for at least a minute or two by the time the video shot they're fairly close but still probably a few minutes from this . I assume they ran for cover almost immediately after hearing shots or seeing glass I'll rewatch the full version in comments  later and get back to you I may be wrong

       she just confirms she saw glass falling , not that there was two windows bashed out. I'm trying to see if there was two busted out. Even if you don't find it useful many others do we're just sharing theories and trying to find the truth right? so whats your point my work isn't " AS " useful? okay. thats fine. Many others here including someone gliding the comment found what i have done useful so thats good enough for me I'm gunna keep searching you can stop now if youd like its no skin off my back?

       I don't mean to step on your toes. We're all just searching for the truth. Obviously there was much more going on up there than they're telling us. I just wanted to make sure we're using the right evidence and don't get tricked along the ways

       Just because we can see what appears to be a grey curtain out the window in the color version and it's just uniform and black in he other window . Then when I applied layer it shows a dark anomaly in that window that we see the curtain but we don't see a similar anomaly in that other window . The other windows can be picked out referring back and forth to color version and inverted

       Come on dude, there's no way you can clearly see a curtain there. If you look around, there's plenty of other windows with similarly dim lights: similarly grey in the original and similarly dark in the negative.  Show your picture (edited or not) without text to anyone who doesn't know which windows 'should' be broken , tell them there are 1 or 2 broken windows and I guarantee they couldn't find them.

       There's a video where you can hear 2 pistol shots at the very END of the shooting and a girl says "there's glass falling" There's 11 seconds in between shots. I wonder if the last 2 shots fired were to break the windows.

       The right window is not clearly broken out like the left window is, but I do think, especially in yours, that there is a clear indication something is up in same exact shape as the day pictures.

       No it wouldn't. The story is that Paddock shot out of his room. We were also mysteriously told that he booked the guest room. The one with the broken window. But why would he do that? It had the same vantage point, and audio from the breaches show he was in his suite, not the guest room. I don't think he bought the guest room.

       Official story is during the shooting he broke 2 windows in different rooms.

      <p>
       This guy is saying the pictures could show that depending on the timing of the picture only 1 window was broken during the shooting with another being smashed afterwards for whatever reason.

       Yep timing is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       One huge thing that goes in favour of this theory is the row of lights on top of the stage are off. There is a video of a guy going round looking for survivors, during this video is when those stage lights are switched off. At no point in this period (and it's a pretty long video) are any more shots heard. The shooting was over before those stage lights were switched off.

       The window on the right, in the non-edited version, looks fake even without the photoshop confirmation.  The blowout goes past the window border onto the facade that borders the window.  It's noticeably farther than the window should be.

       Those sounded like. 357 rounds to me, but I'm no expert.  I have a .357, but hearing it close up and far away are different.  Although hearing the bursts in the first video I saw I immediately thought it sounded much more like a M240 and nothing like an M4 (What was originally speculated as his rifle of choice).  Was reassuring that I've read multiple people also claim they thought it sounded more like a 240 than any rifle he had in his suite.

       Wow. That's facing the correct direction and everything... On Mandalay Rd. facing west, that's exactly where the windows should be broken and it's very clear that they are not. My only possible explanation is that they used an old photo by accident. There's cops set up on the strip pretty often.

       Maybe. I did a google image search and in all the cases where it was posted online, was on or after 10-2-2017. And the description in the photo says it was taken by this AP photographer on 10-2-2017.

       Let's assume that isn't a gunshot wound, and only assume it's blood. How could it possibly have gotten on his chest if he was shot in the mouth and head? I think you're on to something.

       When you're shot through the head from the mouth your blood just freeflows from your mouth. I was expecting a lot more blood tbh (a source I can give for this is that senator from Philly who blew his brains out at a press conference).

       I am by no means qualified to speak on such things. Speculatively tho I'm thinking there would be a lot more brains/blood (though I don't know what kind of bullet was used to his head and didn't see any other photos/videos around the body that show brain/blood spray

       Not necessarily. Unfortunately I’ve seen someone shot in the head point blank with I believe it was a .44 magnum revolver, and there were no brains leaking out. There did form a large puddle of blood that looked just about like the one in the pic of paddock. Thick, viscous blood.

       Well I’ve seen it happen before my very eyes. Judging by the resulting pool of blood on a wood floor, the pool of blood on a carpeted floor as in the paddock pick is entirely consistent with what I’ve witnessed. That’s all I need to say on the matter.

       Why would Stephen drape the curtains in one window but not the other? And to add on to that it still doesn't explain the partial break in the window. No way Paddock would have shot out of there without breaking all of the glass first.

       Anything could have happened inbetween the gun-fire, the pistol shots, and the SWAT "breach". Also, the SWAT team breached with explosives as heard in the audio. I think the audio was faked, because there are no explosion indications on the door frame.

       Wait a second, are those two single shots at the end the finals shots fired? Then the girl says, as those bullets go off, that she sees glass falling from the hotel. Were those two shots the ones that broke the windows? If so then where was all the previous gunfire coming from?

       The two pistol shots ended the shooting. The woman says she sees glass fall after only the first shot. But now that I took another look at Paddock's dead body, I think he was shot twice, once in the head and once in the body.

       The original story was that he killed himself. Blood on his chest and bullets in his blood pool post-mortem show otherwise. Now the story is that the SWAT team shot him, which just isn't true.

       There is no gunfire at the time they breached the room. Also, I know this because
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74htbb/video_from_outside_mandalay_bay_2_single_hand_gun/">
        two pistol shots
       </a>
       were heard (around 3:25-3:35). Why would Stephen need to shoot himself twice in the mouth? Unless someone shot him in the chest and the mouth and planted the gun.

       Yep. 50 minutes is an awful lot of time to cover something up, especially when the stairway is conveniently "blockaded". Why would Paddock blockade the stairwell and not his room?

       No, I think Jesus Campos, the 25 year old security guard with no social media presence at all(hmm, odd) and only 2 released pictures did it. He had ample time alone with Paddock in Mandalay and I think he killed Paddock with the pistol.

       Yes, I think Campos was planted in LVPD security on the night of the attack and conveniently was "on random patrol" when he encountered 60 minutes of alone time with Paddock. Notice how the media instantly broadcasted that he bought the guest room attached to the suite? The only reason they did that was because of the broken second window. There have been no records released that show Paddock bought both rooms, which leads me to believe someone else purchased the room and shot out of it. Only person that has an alibi and was there is Campos.

       He did it to frame Paddock. Paddock was an arms dealer for the CIA in my opinion, and ISIS claims he switched allegiances and became a muslim with a muslim name. CIA sees this and gets rid of him, while also setting the stage for the US to completely forget about the looming threat of NK and to force legislation that doesn't need to exist.

       Yeah, no problem. To me it's the most logical set of events.
       <br/>
       &amp;nbsp;
       <br/>
       1. Paddock didn't have the gun used in his room (M240 or similar)
       <br/>
       2. We were told instantly Paddock booked the guest room(Why? and proof)
       <br/>
       3. The guest window was the only broken window during the shooting.
       <br/>
       4. Campos had nearly an hour to be with Paddock, and during that time TWO pistol shots were fired. No 200 bullets down the hallway, that never happened(look at hallway pics, no damage)
       <br/>
       5. The story regarding how he died has changed multiple times, indicating something is wrong with the story we're getting(I.e. it's being filtered before release by the CIA)
       <br/>
       Occam's razor tells me that Paddock didn't do it, but it also tells me that Paddock was in bed with the CIA.
       <br/>
       6. Paddock made $5mil gambling in Vegas in 2015(very very very unlikely you even turn a profit long-term in Vegas).
       <br/>
       7. Paddock had a plane that he registered in two addresses(meaning he used it). Turns out the plane was totaled beyond repair 10 years before he owned it, and no flights are on the books during the time he owned it(arms dealing?).

       So what if the main target was the fuel tanks. There’s been all this talk about a larger incident was avoided. That window that was for sure broken at this time was used to shot at the tanks. The tanks didn’t explode so they started shooting at the crowd?? Idk. I know there’s a reason why this wouldn’t make sense and I know it’s obvious but I can’t catch it haha just spit ballin.

       Not sure what it's worth or the reasoning behind it, but - I live in Las Vegas and Monday morning went past MB, there were several windows out on the back side of the building as well. Maybe 4-6? Completely removed, the same as paddocks windows at that point as well. They've all been replaced as of now.

       I don't, hence "not knowing what it's worth". Didn't even think to take one before they were all replaced. This was also before there was reason to be confused about what happened, Monday morning. Totally understand being doubted, though wouldn't be too hard to confirm with any other Vegas local. Couldn't miss it.

       Those windows were black/missing for over a year now. On the night of the shooting someone posted a year old instagram picture with those missing windows on the other side of the building.

       This might mean the shooter was on the roof or at least elsewhere, there were two shots heard that ended the whole thing, maybe that wasn't directed at him but rather at the Windows? 
A lot of questions unanswered and more by the day.

       No, I believe the shooting came from the guest room entirely. I think after the shooting whoever did it killed Stephen Paddock with two pistol shots.

       I think it makes no sense that a guy armed to the teeth, taking out a crowd of people like it was world war III, with cameras in the hallway, would all of a sudden just give up.

       He could have taken out 3 or 4 swat teams if he wanted to. He didn't need to suicide since he would have been suicide by cop anyway.

       What's the area like below the windows? Wouldn't someone have seen or reported the windows breaking and glass shattering? Something like that wouldn't happen quietly and would have to happen at least a little bit before the shots.

       The "SWAT" TEAM carried out the op.  They were already on site for the drills that were taking place!!  Id be suspect of the security guard that supposedly first found the room.  He was supposedly only shot in the leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police stood by until the totally not criminal "swat" team that showed up, and did the staging of the scene.  At that time the hit sqaud shot stephen and watched him die.  Staged the scene and called it in.  This window break took place at the time of "breaching the door with explosives".

       I wouldn't even say that. Too many people would talk then. When you look at the police audio timeframes, the obvious way to get away with this would be through Jesus Campos, as he had 70 minutes to get alone with Paddock.

       Not addressing the broken window question but offering my thought process about positioning of the shooter.  I think merely sticking his gun out the window while laying prone on the ground using the bipod would be impractical.   He'd practically be falling out the window at the downward angle required to fire at the crowd.  (Although this configuration could potentially explain the blood on his chest in his suicide photo if he were to be moving around and laying on glass while firing.  The kick back and constant jostling of long sustained auto fire could certainly mash his chest into broken shards of window right there)  But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what he did was put the bipod on the back of that loveseat/couch thing you see by the window in the crime scene photo and used that as leverage to aim down safely while also being recessed from the window enough to conceal muzzle flash.  this also made it harder to locate him.  You never see any muzzle flash even in the midst of the most intense, sustained barrages.

       Don't know if this is worth mentioning, bit in the photo, there's not much blood around his head if he shot himself through the mouth, wouldn't blood freely pool around his head? Does this indicate that he was dead before he was shot in the mouth?

       Here's what I keep wondering... wasn't there at least someone in one of the rooms immediately around his? If there were, I imagine they would've heard the noise of a giant window breaking next door.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work at a hotel and people call the front desk for the most inane shit, I'm pretty sure someone would've called down immediately like "hey what the fuck I just heard what sounded like a window breaking! And now gunshots!!!" Front desk would've known almost immediately some bad shit was happening, and the approximate location too.

       what if he just fired through the windows? didn't bother breaking them, just firing through it. eventually it would blow a smaller hole to shoot through, then when SWAT breached, the pressure blew the glass out. Perhaps that's why bits of glass were falling according the the girl in the bus stop/two shots video.

       So we know about the broken windows, and that people have reported hearing the sound of breaking glass, with some saying they saw glass falling as well. But what about when the glass eventually reached the ground? Has anyone ever mentioned seeing the glass?

       They specifically said that one of the doors was locked to a bedroom. Maybe the adjoining room with the other broken out window? They had to breach it. This was the second breach they talked about. 
So, how was a door locked from the side they entered on, be used as a separate platform to shoot? It was locked. Normally, rooms can be locked by both sides.

       This is interesting. I tried to come up with reasoning to dispute or disprove any of your photo evidence and can't find anything. And, I'm a pretty skeptical person. The first two photos were sketchy since they're blurred and very hard to see. But, that contrast photo is really really hard to argue.

       Makes sense based on how his guns were modded out. The guns with scopes did not have bump modifications and were set up for semi-auto fire (ie he specifically picked out a target with the scope then shot them). [You can see the difference in the pseudo automatic and semi-auto loadout here].
      </p>
      <p>
       Next: if you're wondering why the pseudo-full auto weapon lacked a scope/bipod that's because of the bump mod. The bump stock works by making the entire front of the gun slide back and forth. Meaning, if there was a standard bipod on it the bipod would scrape across the surface it's on. You can get a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Kq2t5kzMY">
        special bipod
       </a>
       that accounts for this and puts the bipod on a sliding guide that works kind of like a guide for a drawer on a nightstand. For the same reason, a bump stock makes it hard to use a scope. The scope would move back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. if we go with the single shooter theory (which I'm not debating for or against) it'd can be assumed that he obviously had a semi-auto, scoped rifle and thus he likely used it. As sick as it is, it kind of makes sense to start with semi-auto shots until panic started and then switch over when your targets are no longer standing still.

       Come on dude, there's no way you can clearly see a curtain there. If you look around, there's plenty of other windows with similarly dim lights: similarly grey in the original and similarly dark in the negative.  Show your picture (edited or not) without text to anyone who doesn't know which windows 'should' be broken , tell them there are 1 or 2 broken windows and I guarantee they couldn't find them.

       This is very far away from constituting strong proof.

       You definitely could be right that it was a system with just the 1 IG in an aluminum frame, which would mean it's even easier to get through than I said. We did some Schüco systems like that for smaller projects, but what I worked on was mostly considerably larger buildings, both private and gov't, using a proprietary facade system. With those we usually used a setup more like what I explained using aluminum frames and 2 IG units and laminated, so I assumed that's what they probably used, but could be wrong since I haven't seen any good pictures of the windows, really. In my experience even the laminated glass isn't
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       tough to get through once it's been penetrated at at least one point, especially if you're actively trying to get through it.
