       Someone told me a story today and i listened. There was a guy who did years in the military. He did his duty and fought for his country bled and suffered. He was in there at just the right time. Someone came along and recruited him. Back in 1988 , He got a job running coke and guns for some people. Taking those things to far away places Nicarauga California the likes. He did really well and made lots of money. He went AWOL. He was doing the same thing these guys taught him in las vegas. Except he got found out because someone was in deep during the obama admin and got their Pakistani fingers all over a list of active and non active assets. They procedeed with the deal then killed him and had a massacre to send a message. Too many facets at work here to make it clear cut. So many wheels spinning in the mud.

       A few thoughts,
      </p>
      <p>
       He got outsmarted. Didn't realize he was part of the enemies plan all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or he was helping them and they just offed him . Which seems less believable because of the amount of guns. He could of just brought a couple.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all those guns leads me to think he was Allowed to be there. Like he had an arrangement, something he had done before. To deal lots of guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if he is an agent, what do they do after they deal all these guns to Isis, to entrap them? I don't get that.  It Doesn't even seem like the Fed's were watching deal. Wouldn't they have a bunch of agents in the hotel to at least watch out for their undercover agent? a gun deal to entrap doesn't seem entirely true but I can't rule it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have him at least ,and he is a more complex character by the hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lone wolf though? I find that hardest to believe and not just because it is the msm story. He looks way more like a gun runner than someone who commits the massacre themself.
