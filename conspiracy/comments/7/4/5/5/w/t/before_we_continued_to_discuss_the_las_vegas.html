       I just wish for the Russia gate scandal to be over with, not because i support Donald Trump or something like that, but because it's boring, and it has become annoying to see Reddit of Russia gate scandal posts, but yet, there is NOT solid, undeniable proof that Russia colluded with U.S. elections.

       Reddit ruins everything. But there IS solid evidence of collusion with the Trump campaign, in terms of meetings, funding, and potential collusion when it came to the social media accounts. Or, the Russian government acted alone and successfully swayed public opinion, which could also be a factor.

       I am willing to put my money and say that Trump will end his Presidency, whether it is 1 term, or 2 terms, and then the media will forget the Russia gate scandal, because it is no longer relevant to the narrative pushed at the time. I am telling you, Russia gate is just a distraction. Democrat or Republican, it's the same thing, doesn't matter who becomes President, someone else is pulling the strings.

       ..but a distraction from WHAT though? It appears everytime Trump tweets something that gives the media 24 hours to cover and circlejerk around it, a new development in the Russia scandal comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, the news won't give a fuck once he's out. But if the size of this thing goes as far as election tampering then it could be the largest foreign infiltration of our democracy yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the focus should be on the repurcussions of a devastating Russia finding. As in, this could be the beginning of regulations on the internet, primarily social media.

       The boring part is that it's 'popular'. Being a conspiracy theorist is like being a fan of only the most underground, most indie music possible--if other people are into it, it's no longer valid, regardless if 'conspiracy' is involved.

       So glad you sweep a cyber attack on your nation’s sovereignty as “boring”. When you’re done yawning and looking under pizza parlors for pedophile rings, maybe you should read the news about how many current active investigations are looking into what Russia did to your country.

       False flag is where you kill people on your side in order to make the other side look better. The people he killed were likely Trump supporters, therefore he is also a Trump supporter trying to make the liberal look bad.

       I should have worded that better. Should have said "likely to be Trump supporters" because it is a generalization that country music fans are more likely to be Trump supporters.

       You don't have to kill people on your side in a false flag. False flag means there was a coordinated effort to pin the blame on another party.

       If Israel does a covert attack in the Ukraine and then makes it appear like Russia did it..it is a false flag.

       Every time in the past Alex Jones has talked about false flags, it has been the US government acting against the US citizens in order to advance an agenda. Magically this time however, this pattern has been thrown aside in favor of his new pet theory (whatever the fuck it is) because he is carrying water for Trump. Doesn't Jones covering up for Trump make more sense in this situation?

       No, you're just ignorant. False flags have gone back since WW2. Not all of them were targeting US citizens. Operation Gladio used paramilitary forces from places like Turkey to stage flase flags to pin the blame on the Soviets. The current Gladio C uses extremist groups like ISIS to do the same in the ME to target whoever is needed (e.g. Assad and chemical weapons).

       It's certainly an assumption that these agencies would not go to great lengths to fake something like this.

       The argument is that it is harder to control the narrative if it's fake but I just don't believe that.

       Genuinely curious: What would it take for you to believe this was a lone civilian acting alone in a mass shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that's where all the evidence is pointing.  You're asking good questions, but you're answering them with assumptions that sound right on the surface, but aren't necessarily correct. For instance, blood doesn't ooze out of mouths or people aren't showing enough agony. Blood would ooze of of your mouth if you had internal injuries (I.e. a punctured lung) and there's plenty of evidence that shock and the adrenaline rush it brings can cause people to not even realize they have serious injuries, much less show agony.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to be hard on you and again, you ask some really good questions. But it seems like you are looking at evidence with a pre-conceived, rather far-fetched conclusion already established in your mind and making assumptions to align everything we see to confirm that. We wouldn't accept an investigation from authorities that followed that logic, so why are we doing it ourselves?

       I think anyone who immediately thinks it's a hoax entirely is too far gone. I entertained the idea near the beginning, but it doesn't hold up when general logic is applied.
       <br/>
       The best lies have a sprinkling of truth in them. The pure effort to stage a mass shooting at a concert that was already happening is ridiculous compared to the effort of letting an actual shooting happen and simply giving an alternative, semi-believable excuse for the public to distract themselves with while the real perpetrators continue with their illegal dealings as usual.
       <br/>
       It's like 9/11, for example. It wasn't a hoax entirely, but rather a false flag w/ coverup story. The authorities knew that it was going to happen - and even had a hand in bringing it to fruition - but they let it happen anyway and gave the public an excuse and narrative to follow that benefitted those who were actually responsible.

       Show me one video of someone taking a bullet form all the cell phones that were running.  There isn't one.  Everything is staged fake emotion from crisis actors.  It holds up to all logic.  People just hear "58 head hundreds wounded" and get all emotional.  Tell a big enough lie and nobody will question it.  I agree 9/11 was real in that bombs took down those buildings and people actually died.  That was a false flag.  This is a hoax.  Just listen to any of the witnesses being interviewed on the MSM.  It's worse than daytime TV.

      <p>
       You only need a handful of hoaxers to pull this off.  You got the fake gunshot sounds and then a core group of people to freak out start yelling "active shooter" and others to fall down and play dead/wounded.  The rest is handled by the mass hysteria like yelling fire in a crowded theater.  They then send out their staged crisis actors to give media interviews.  Many that are not in on it become part of it as the natural human tendency for hyperbole and exaggeration kicks in.  In this social media age people love attention and will post whatever stories they decide to make up because THEY WERE THERE MAN.  There are some staged events at hospitals but not a single doctor treated a gunshot wound that day.  Just like Sandy Hook and Pulse the lie is so big that nobody can imagine it yet here we are.

       My step sister was at that concert. I'm from Las Vegas. Born and raised. Wasn't there though. I'm in Duluth, MN at the moment (college). Its made more complicated because the media is pretty hush hush when it comes to matters that might compromise tourism. I haven't followed the story much since it happened though because it was pretty stressful. Especially being so far from home.

       It's a hoax.  Terrible crisis actors at every turn being interviewed by the MSM.  The people that got in the back of the cab were terrible actors.  Every video claiming to show bloody victims shows no wounds and has fake emotions.

       Information is slow to get out because this was an extremely traumatic experience for people involved. People who filmed others died that night won't be rushing out to share it because they're not fucking savages.

       In actual crisis situations, most people are experiencing shock and aren't wailing and screaming like in the movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question: If that video was staged, how did they manage to get so many people to play along in Las Vegas of all places, and that not leak or have any evidence the contrary?

       Yes that's the video I watched.  You seriously can't tell that's a crisis actor?  Some guy just comes in and declares everyone dead.  They said there were head entry and exit wounds but did not show them at all.  Not a single wound was shown in that entire video unedited.  It's now being pulled down and edited to give it more credibility but you can't hide that guy's feigned emotion.

       What exactly are you basing these opinions on? 90% of the people that experienced this were shit-faced drunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I edited this video myself out of respect for victims. Want to see an actual wound? Take a look here at the 22 second mark.

       That is what a bullet wound looks like when it grazes someone's skull. Any closer to his head and it would have looked different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if they went through all that trouble to stage this, you would think they would give us MORE info, not less. Right now they are saying very little at all. No "staged" videos circulating on the internet and news.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the above videos are indeed fake, they would have at least gone through the trouble of distributing them -- but instead you can only find them if you dig for them.

       That video is everywhere.  They control both the mainstream media and the alternative media.  It's not like they don't consider free thinkers when the do these things.  That's why they muddy the waters with "multiple shooters" and "someone knew ahead of time and was warning people".  Exactly like the JFK assassination had all sorts of false conspiracies to keep people distracted.  My opinion are based on jokers like this guy giving the exact scripted media lie and is obviously lying and deceiving.  This is simple discernment:

       Free thinking doesn't mean we disbelieve everything, it means we are free to think how we choose. It means we look at the available evidence and make decisions based on that, not what we're told to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't trust the accounts of any "witness" shown on mainstream media. They're so hungry for ratings they'll bring in any shmuck off the street with a story, false or otherwise. In the absence of an actual witness, they won't hesitate to hire someone - that's the business they are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe all opinions are equally valid, yet not necessarily equally true. I believe we should question others, yet evaluate the opinions of others based on their life experiences.

      <p>
       You will be hard-pressed to find a single person who's had any real training in crisis or ballistics to say these videos are fake. I've had both. Innocent people died Sunday night.

       Plenty of people who were there are on video saying the gunshots were fake as they were happening.  It's a country music concert and I'm sure many have shot guns and are military.  As an example: 5:10 in this video:

       This is just ONE of the innocent victims. Perpetuating this as a non-event is just disrespectful to those who have lost family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, there will be conflicting accounts. People that were there were drunk and partying. It was a loud event. People who probably had family members die in their arms are still in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hoax theory just doesn't stack up. The scale of deception required at an ongoing, live event in one of the busiest cities in America, would require a conspiracy campaign of unrealistic proportions.

       By "dead and lifeless" I assume you mean laying still on a video that is clearly being created by an actor and a bad one at that.  They are going to put a ton of SimVics out there for you to get all emotional over.  That video had no actual wounds.  Just a bunch of fake blood and people playing dead.

       Also, man, I apologize if I'm coming off like I'm attacking you. That's not my intention, I believe we should literally question EVERYTHING, especially things of this nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, this particular story is tragic, and it pains me to see people claiming that all those people who actually died didn't really die, that it's all a hoax - that their lives meant nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been glued to my computer since Monday morning. I work from home, haven't gotten much work done. I wanted to know the full extent of what's happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know for certain we don't have all the info. I don't know if they've released 100% accurate info. I don't trust that they didn't fuck up, and have to skew some info to cover up that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do know is that people died, and with current avail. info it appears to be a single gunman, from two different vantage points. He very well could have had someone in there with him, perhaps even firing a second gun, but both of them were not firing at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooter could very well have a shady past. He could have connections to government, but he definitely massacred a bunch of innocent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this because I've watched too many videos. I seen bodies, and matched them to reported lists of victims. I've checked their facebook pages and have read the heartbreaking comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were real people that died for no reason. We may never know why, but to claim the whole thing is a hoax and they never died is just wrong.

       Yes everyone has a friend's uncle's sister's former college roommate that they know who got shot and they love to share it on social media.  Everyone who was there loves to share "We are safe! everyone thank you for your concern".  The people close to the deception have no problem becoming part of it willfully.  You only need a core of actors to create the entire illusion using the media.  The fact is there were no doctors doing surgeries on gunshot wound victims that night at the hospital.

       Nope I'm just comparing the citizens that are brainwashed by government/media propaganda in both cases.  When someone says something that offends people's emotional sensibilities they are just told to "seek hep".  It's the mantra of the brainwashed masses.  The same exact thing would have been said to a German citizen saying their government was exterminating Jews in Nazi Germany and you know it.

       To believe the level of "brainwashing" that happened in Germany by the Nazis is comparable to the level of it in the US right now is the height of ignorance.

       I'll agree with you here, many societies assign dissention to mental illness and it's generally detremental to a society.

       That being said, I don't think your use of this is an appropriate comparasson to say, the USSR or, as earlier mentioned, Nazi Germany.

       I don't know it, but you might be right- I would direct you back to my first point that the comparison is inherently flawed.

      <p>
       Beyond that, you are actively making it less likely that people like myself, a Jew, would take your point seriously by being as it is so hyperbolic as to compare Nazi Germany to the current US poltical climate/manipulatation, however you define it.

       The US simply sprinkled all the Nazi scientists throughout the government when we won that war.  Our government "deep state" is essentially the same thing.  The media is wholly controlled by the state.  We are in the same climate of propaganda but they are actually much better at it here.

       Since you are a Jew I'll just take the time to tell you good luck in the time of Jacob's trouble.  God will be with you as you are his chosen people.  Soon you will know that Jesus Christ was your Messiah when Moses and Elijah return to witness to you.  It would be ideal if you would accept him now and become part of his body though.

       Were you there, Bernillary? We were, about halfway up on the left side there where you first walked in. We didn't hear any popping until the music stopped, but even then, we didn't think gunshots. We were thinking technical issues with the PA, or fireworks like we heard one guy say. Even when we saw people starting to run, it didn't sink in that it might've been a gun.

       No, I was not there, and condolences to you for what you experienced. My opinions are based on the videos I've seen, many uncirculated, as well as training in the military (combat, crisis, medical, weapon systems).

       I've spent probably 30+ hours over the last few days digging. This was a terrible, senseless act of violence.

       He wasn't there. He's constantly failed to offer proof of being there and changes his story when caught out in a lie. The guy is a disturbed attention seeker and seems to be disinfo at worst, or just desperate for sympathy at best.

       That's sad if true. I don't spend a lot of time on this sub really. I just try and hear out all sides and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Situations like this interest me in that you have all types of people sharing info. Lots of people who simply want to disbelieve this happened (often through a deep distrust of gov). Many people simply have questions (which they should). Others may be just a little confused about what they see and hear in videos (and often combined inexperience with firearms in general).

       Somebody made a stupid comment about an owl or something, and all I said was, "People died. Go f*** yourself." But they got mad at me.
Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm curious with your military training, when you watched footage, did it seem like he was reloading abnormally quickly? I don't know anything about guns, but they're saying he had multiple guns, so maybe he didn't have to?

       Leaked images show that he had 100 round magazines and a bump fire stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video evidence is pretty supportive of the images. Bump fire stocks do not fire consistently as far as rounds per minute is concerned. When I first heard the videos I was certain he either used a bumpfire or a gat crank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that he was using very high end rifles. I have no idea why he had so many rifles with him, which seems pretty odd. Perhaps the original plan involved multiple shooters that never followed through? No idea, just having that many guns for one person doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also had a ton of ammunition, which seems to indicate that he planned on shooting a lot more than he did. I do believe he took advantage of the situation knowing people would mistake his firing for fireworks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that he reloaded. He could have successfully emptied an entire 100 round magazine, then picked up another rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did hear the inconsistent fire rate. I also heard the taxi video which supports two fire positions with perhaps two separate rifles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports bounce off all kinds of things differently. Any muzzle device he had equipped could also affect the sounds people heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real inconsistency I've seen is the room service receipts showing he was there on the 27th, when reports said he checked in on the 28th.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other oddity is how they changed his girlfriend's location several times (Japan/China/Philippines).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either of those two inconsistencies does not scream conspiracy to me, as this whole situation is fluid with info coming in from many sources without much time to verify.

       No, i'm just not fucking retarded like half the people here. You guys cant even agree what this so called false flag narrative is. One shooter, multiple, now its a fbi sting? You know what the real answer is? nobody fucking knows yet. No information. Who is this guy, what were his motives, what has he been upto? Those are questions not conspiracies. Its natural to want to know what happened, and this really did happen, no actors involved.

       It's pretty simple.  There are three options.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. Crazy guy did exactly what MSM says.
B. False flag
C. Hoax
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a Hoax and it's plainly obvious.  It's interesting that people here mostly know the media lies and there is a NWO.  They just refuse to accept that they could be all over social media and conspiracy sites shilling causing confusion which is exactly what is happening here.

       One of my good friends has a cousin that was killed at the concert. Are you saying that the cousin is a crisis actor? Or maybe my friend who lost a family member is an actor? Who all is involved in the acting, the whole family? Pull your head out of your ass dude. People really did die. The story might be way off, but there was actually death and chaos. Who knows though, I might be a crisis actor too.

       That's not true. There is an official story. Senior citizen with no history of violence single-handedly carried out the largest instance of gun terrorism in US history for no apparent political or personal reason at all. That's the official story.

       As I said, there is no apparent personal reason. If there was an apparent personal reason, it would be apparent. There was surely some reason, even if it was as simple as that he took pleasure in killing or something like that, but that reason is not apparent, there's no clear evidence of it, and the reason cannot be resolved even with all of the information available.

       Unfortunately, the guy you are responding to is doing an extremely dangerous form of diversion. NS appears to be level-headed and logical, but really is just using a form of deflection by pushing away from the original topic by using sensible and calm responses that go elsewhere.

       There IS something to this story that we don't know and that is why we are here in the first place. This wasn't just "something tragic that happened" (which it was). This was WAY beyond that.

       But yeah, I guessed they weren't really trying to contribute in good faith. Their history shows similar "contributions" in their recent comments too. I just wanted to point out how stupid they were being in hopes that it would make anyone reading the interaction notice what they were doing.

       He didn't save any of it and had minimal expenses. When gambling stopped being a source of income, he tried and failed a slip and fall lawsuit. He got a boost from working in Defense early on, but from what I can tell, he sent his last $100K to his girlfriend in the Phillipines, got a brand new CC with 0 balance and high limits(do this before getting rid of the $100k). Use that CC for hotel room, guns, and living expenses for four days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, for a gambler who has one $250K in a hand, he had some money, he just didn't have an exit/retirement plan.

       I agree it is not a hoax, real people was hurt, real people died.
      </p>
      <p>
       However i disagree with the official narrative: one shooter, he committed suicide, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no shade of doubt that it was multiple shooters. And there is only one organization that could have pulled this off... The Government through the CIA, or Blackwater, or else.

       Here I thought you had an irrefutable source for having no shade of doubt. All I have seen is a cab video with the echo of gunfire which leaves plenty of room for doubt. I've seen allegations of a 10th floor shooter, but there are no other broken windows. I am a skeptic, so I am curious as to why you have no shade of doubt.

       Shooting out two different windows that face two different directions likely using two different guns (he had 23 in the room) can create different sound and different echos.

       false flag is literally attacking someone while wearing the "false flag." it doesn't have to be you attacking yourself. IE if I dress up like a blood and shoot a crip, etc.

      <ol>
       <li>
        either undercover fbi posing as an arms dealer or a dealer
       </li>
       <li>
        fbi had awareness and were to set up the purchase but either let it happen or botched it
       </li>
       <li>
        he was outed and killed (or just killed) and the purchasers carried out the plot. they also escaped, leaving "lone gunman suicide" as distraction

       We know who created and backed ISIS in the Middle East, it is normal they would claim responsability so that the Government can keep "the war on the terror" narrative, thus injecting money in it, also this attack creates a state of panic in the population, things that would be otherwise unnacceptable, will appear acceptable if the society is in panic, so terror only facilitates the erosion of civil liberties.

       I figured it was because ISIS is kind of promiscuous when it comes to taking credit for seemingly irrational acts of mass violence.  You know, because if people believe that you control every shadow, then it grants you a particular type of power.

       A hoax by definition is a false flag, but yeah the purist definition of false flag is an actual attack just not by the alleged culprit(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always these posts at every event now. People want so badly to believe that people were actually massacred. Once you establish that there have indeed been entirely fake events in the past -- Sandy Hook, Boston Hoax, San Bernardino, Pulse nightclub -- it takes more than a few badly staged "horrific aftermath" videos to establish that people were really shot by real bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't even seen it demonstrated that rounds were actually fired. There should be extensive bullet damage to the acre or so where people were gathered.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do go through some great lengths to fake these things. Anyone who knows anything about Sandy Hook knows that they staged the Lanza home with crime scene photo ops, even used some fake blood on the bed where Nancy Lanza was allegedly shot 4x in the head, but nothing is ever really shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of suggestion is strong. People running around screaming is not a shooting. Red stuff that may or may not be blood pooled on the ground is not injuries. The sound of popping is not bullets really being fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "NSFL" video going around now of the aftermath shows neither gunshot wounds, or bullet damage. People need to stop being so emotional.

       So, u think they staged this? On the Vegas strip...viewable from the road and from at least 3 resorts hotel windows? U actually think they staged 22,000 people at an event? Right by the airport ..where people can clearly see that venue? That is what ur suggesting? Please tell me that is NOT what u believe? If u think that...fly to Vegas...get a room overlooking that venue then tell me how that would be possible

Even if the shooting had been staged, people got shot. So a hoax, no. But a false flag? Absolutely.

       As someone else mentioned, the pictures of his hotel room look like they are taken from a video game. Also, there should be plenty of camera footage of this guy hauling hundreds of pounds of weapons and ammo up to his room... Of course blurry footage of that will probably be released at some point.

       Arms deal gone bad is a good guess. Also, maybe Paddock was both an arms dealer and a potential whistleblower of some kind involving certain agencies.

       This incident happened, without a doubt. I personally had two people close to both myself and family who where victims of this incident. One a nurse, the other an operator I worked with @ DoD. There is zero doubt in my mind that this was a targeted, well planned attack, but things aren't adding up.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a person who spent time working for DoD contractor, working in urban environments that there is no doubt in my mind that there where multiple shooters. If you look at the ballistics calculations, from the 32nd floor to ground level, it's 387.65 ft. The Madaly Bay stands at 480 ft., taking into consideration of the that the MB has 43 floors thats roughly 11.87 feet per storie, if you look calculate the distance from the 32nd floor to the main grounds area where most of the victims where located it's roughly 325.56m (356. 08 yards).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take the basic ballistics for a. 308 round (one of the reported rifles used)  a .308 round weights roughly 120 grains, and has a ballastic coefficient of .256, and has a 2,820 ft/s when leaving the rifle taking all this information into account as well as METAR data from KLAS, we know the temperature was 89 degrees, the wind was out of the east, and was blowing a little over 5.5 mph, and the barometric pressure was 29.09, and the humidity was 13‰.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking these things into consideration as well as the average yardage from the 32nd floor to 25 different data points using (Google Earth) yard measurement tool the average yards 356.08 yards. Listening to over two hours of scanner feeds,  as well as speaking to old friends who are actively working the investigation there where multiple single shot head wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you do all the calculations you get the following answer using a ballastic calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullet traveled 350 yards, it would have impacted the victims at 1860 ft/s, with a muzzle energy of 921 ft/lb, the bullet would have dropped -23.3 inches (almost two feet) which means the shooter would have to have had knowledge of advanced ballistics. The shooter would have had to hold up 6.3 MOA (if using an MOA Scope) and 2.4 MOA Right, and the bullet would have drifted nine inches.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy is a ghost, there is zero doubt in my mind that he couldn't have been the primary shooter (he may have been a shooter) the idea of a 4th floor doesn't work if you break down the number, however six and eight floor does but I think there where gunmen in the crowd as well possibly disguised as event staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just my thoughts.

       We know who created and backed ISIS in the Middle East, it is normal they would claim responsability so that the Government can keep "the war on the terror" narrative, thus injecting money in it, also this attack creates a state of panic in the population, things that would be otherwise unnacceptable, will appear acceptable if the society is in panic, so terror only facilitates the erosion of civil liberties.

That's why they muddy the waters with "multiple shooters" and "someone knew ahead of time and was warning people".  Exactly like the JFK assassination had all sorts of false conspiracies to keep people distracted.  My opinion are based on jokers like this guy giving the exact scripted media lie and is obviously lying and deceiving.  This is simple discernment:

       As I said, there is no apparent personal reason. If there was an apparent personal reason, it would be apparent. There was surely some reason, even if it was as simple as that he took pleasure in killing or something like that, but that reason is not apparent, there's no clear evidence of it, and the reason cannot be resolved even with all of the information available.

       I figured it was because ISIS is kind of promiscuous when it comes to taking credit for seemingly irrational acts of mass violence.  You know, because if people believe that you control every shadow, then it grants you a particular type of power.
