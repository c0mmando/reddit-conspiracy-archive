       Fair enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one's just a run-of-the-mill inside joke. Without context, it doesn't make sense, and you don't have context because you weren't the intended recipient of the email. It doesn't have to have a sinister super-secret meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can imagine that if I got access to all your emails, or texts, or however you prefer to communicate with people online, I'd find at least a few inside references between you and your friends. They're not going to write out a long explanation: "hey, remember that time when we were at the place, and the thing happened, and you said what you said, and we all laughed." They'll just make some short-hand reference that you'll get but that I wouldn't. And then I'd get a random internet person from 4Chan to provide me with a decoder ring proving that whatever topic you seemed to be referencing actually means "child penis."

       IIRC it wasn't pizza, it was cheese or pasta, in reference to an annual gift basket for which the email-writer was sending a thank you note. Maybe the last time they got the gift basket, they played dominos, and they did really well, and they pretended that the gift basket was a performance-enhancing drug, and everyone had a great laugh about it. That's a boring, bland explanation that isn't nearly as fun as "super secret code words my uncle's friend's FBI contact on 4Chan told me about", but it's equally speculative.

       Yes, because you're trying to coerce me into telling you information like I'm your fucking slave. I couldn't give a fuck what you think of me or what I say, I just think you need to stop pushing for people to provide you with "evidence" when you haven't lifted a finger yourself.

       I totally understand it and I've seen it explained well, but maybe you haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a parent, I still sometimes want to throw parties for adults, but it's not always certain that they'll be okay withaving to hang around my adorable, but admittedly sometimes obnoxious, children. And you can't just say to a person, "oh, in case you're an unfeeling monster who hates children, you should know my kids will be there, splashing in the pool and being loud and stuff." So instead you just drop it in like it's a bonus detail ("entertainment") and let your invitee politely decline on some pretense or other, when you both know the truth is that they didn't have children for a very good reason, and they have no interest in being exposed to preteens even if the pool is heated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've basically written that exact email a bunch of times. Except the heated pool stuff. Don't have a pool.

       Well like I said, it's all about giving your friend an out without making them look like they hate kids. So, instead of calling them annoying, you list their ages (and the ages listed are definitely peak annoying), lest your friend thinks they're young adults or something.

       Along with what the other poster said, it's also pretty common among parents to list their kid's ages in case the person they're emailing with has kids of their own that they might want to bring--knowing the ages of the other kids helps you plan accordingly (are my kids going to play with theirs, or are they going to want to just hang around me?)

       Then Laura Silsby shouldn't have tried to smuggle 30 kids out of Haiti and HRC shouldn't have helped her get out of trouble for it. Simple as that. If you don't want people assuming things, don't do those stupid things in the first place.

       Sure, only since she was SoS she gave her a lawyer that her and bill knew and that himself was later convicted of trafficking. We also know from emails that this was an incident brought directly to Hillary's inner circle. But keep pretending she's got her normal degrees of separation here. It betrays you.

       There's no breadcrumb about hillary sending that guy to be their lawyer. He was not even a lawyer, he was pretending to be one and tricked some people in idaho. Why wouldn't they send an actual lawyer who would not be removed after a few days when it becomes obvious he's a fraud?

       Literally only shills have talked about "the basement of a pizzashop!" and no one making this claim is even trying to find out what it is actually about which really speaks of a mindset that's desperately defending an easy cop-out excuse to not acknowledge the truth.

       There's a difference between Pizzagate (I.e. The alleged pedo ring in the basement of a pizza parlor that led someone to shoot up said pizza parlor) and PedoGate (I.e. Governments pushing other governmental figures' pedophiliac actions under the rug). The first is known to be a bunch of hogwash; the latter, however, has some serious evidence (see U.K. Gov Pedophilia).
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if people stopped using the Click-Bait PizzaGate term, people would look into it.

       <strong>
        totally
       </strong>
       about Comet pizza and torture in the basement.  Throw in the code words, Instagram account, spirit cooking and weird art and that was it in its entirety.

       Pedogate was about elite pedos.

       No, and it's not like people can't go to voat and check the archived investigation. Since you were there the day they named it,what were the other options suggested besides "pizzagate"?

       I realize you're trying to wipe Pizzagate's stupidity from the internet, but the unfortunate part for you guys is that it is
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       well documented. Every wordpress story about Pizzagate from last year, every Voat thread... it's all about Democrats raping kids in a pizzeria basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're trying make people think it's something entirely different out of sheer embarrassment, I fully understand that, but it's a very tall task.

       You're pretty shameless in making my point about how hard you defend yourself against hearing the truth. If you even thought you had any objectivity you'd ask, but you can't do that.

       I was here from the start. Comets basement was barely even top of my mind when I was looking into it, sure I heard it but I thought so what. I was more concerned with Epstein and his creepy island with temples on it. The weird art in podestas place. And yes of course, Jimmy's outrageous "art". The biggest part is Madeline and "cards", the fact that the sketches look just like John and Tony Podesta (yea, even if they're supposed to represent the same guy, you can't deny these sketches look exactly like them, fucking creepy). And the picture of a girl playing cards who looks like Madeline as a teen, is whoa dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, it's just about a basement.

       Furthermore! Pizzagate wasn't called that because of Comet! And if you say so then you're either a shill or misinformed. Pizzagate led to Comet. Podestas emails had all sorts of strange pizza references, such as the pizza related handkerchief (care to explain that one). People speculated that its code words for either drugs, or pedo shit. Pedo shit added up with Podestas art collection. Then the connection Alifantis had with DC Elites became center stage.

       Go to wikileaks, find the emails and put keywords like "65000" "hotdogs" and "pizza", and you will find the email by no other then the lovely and innocent Obama if I remember correctly. I am in bed right not so I cant link to you directly. Or google and you will find a direct link.

       Yeah, it referred to Obama paying $65,000 for hotdogs from a guy who wrote a bunch of other disparaging emails about Obama and would have no way to know anything about what he was claiming.

       Go ahead and link to the email. Tony Podesta left the handkerchief and some realtor asked if he wanted it back. He said no.

       Is this random realtor suppose to be part of the child rape/murder ring that the Democrats were operating out of a pizzeria basement? I'd love an answer to this one.

       Pizzagate wasn't called that because of Comet! And if you say so then you're either a shill or misinformed. Pizzagate led to Comet. Podestas emails had all sorts of strange pizza references, such as the pizza related handkerchief (care to explain that one). People speculated that its code words for either drugs, or pedo shit. Pedo shit added up with Podestas art collection. Then the connection Alifantis had with DC Elites became center stage.

       Because pizza is a term that pedophiles often use. There are some emails that got leak where a lot of their lingo is exposed. "cheese pizza" is often used as a term for child porn. It's code word between them.

       And besta pizza logo used to be a known cp symbol with the center triangle replaced with a slice of pizza. That is until pizzagate blew up and they changed it.

       his pizzagate piece didn't actually have any journalism in it, it was just repeating stuff from the internet. He drew a lot on the besta pizza logo being a pedophile symbol, but still nobody has any connection between that and comet ping pong, and nobody's investigating the owner of besta pizza.

       so if this is fake please enlighten us all to what the "real conspiracies" are... have you looked at all info surrounding the pizza gate theory? There is no way you can look at all the fucking weird shit and not think to yourself that its at least wirth investigating.  why is it some stranger can call the cops on me and say i was doing something illegal and they will swarm me and do what they will but when there is actual fucking strange and creepy and sick shit going on, it isnt real and there isnt anything worth looking into.  wtf kind of double standard is that?

       You must have misread me or I wasn't clear.  Pizzagate is real and it's just the tip of the iceberg of the satanic pedophiles that are worldwide.  What I'm saying is there are a ton of shills here that act like it's ridiculous and a false conspiracy so threads like this always get shilled hard.

       ahh yes i misread that lol i agree about the shills, i dont even argue anymore tho.  its ok to disagree with me but the second an insult is hurled you are assumed to be a shill trying to waste my time and ill stop responding.  thats not to say i never post stupid shit or decide to be a dick for fun once in a while but when someone tries pushing thier ideas down my throat as if its the only opinion i should have, then i know lol

       I guess I live in a fantasy world where people weigh evidence for themselves instead of accepting spoon-fed conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       From their own source: "Police have issued two efits that they believe are descriptions of the same man"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Snopes goes ahead and says that it surely is the same person. We all know Snopes is unreliable, but those sketches are legit.

       Wouldn't it be reasonable to think that if the descriptions of that one subject are so different from one another that there were maybe more than one person involved? 
I'm not saying these two guys kidnapped the girl, but if you look at the sketches you would think they depict two different guys. So why is there only one suspect, officially?

       his pizzagate piece didn't actually have any journalism in it, it was just repeating stuff from the internet. He drew a lot on the besta pizza logo being a pedophile symbol, but still nobody has any connection between that and comet ping pong, and nobody's investigating the owner of besta pizza.
