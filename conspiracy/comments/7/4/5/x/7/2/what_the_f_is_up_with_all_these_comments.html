       Because they are here in this forum. They know deep down that something is not right. They defend a position they were taught but the only reason they would lay with us dogs is to catch fleas. Subconsciously they want to happen upon the correct answer.

       You're missing my entire argument entirely. Think deeper than this event at hand. My complaint is that people here are ridiculing others for merely presenting theories, which is the fucking purpose of the entire sub.

       No, the issue is that you cannot handle anyone who disagrees with you. I don't care what anyone comes in here and says, it's their fucking right to free speech you fucking twat. Next you will want anything censored that doesn't expressly cover YOUR views.

       So... by "discuss alternative theories"... you exclude opposing viewpoints? Those aren't part of the discussion?

       I'm not asking them to agree, I'm asking them to disprove theories with evidence, which none of us have regarding these theories. That's why it's a theory by definition. But when a majority of proposed theories are being refuted with nothing but contempt and ridicule it's cancer to the sub whose purpose is to facilitate the proposition of theories.

       I hear that, but I've been replying to people for over 24 hours now just correcting the record on a lot of facts. Lots of misinformation out right now regarding what we already know. For example, saying 500+ people got shot is just straight up stupid and wrong. So when people make posts like that I get upset cuz its just wrong as fuck.

       They're not poking with anything but ridicule for conspiracy theorists questioning the msm narrative. Sliding threads in favor of the MSM shows they're normies and they can't have any discourse other than defending their own safe space the MSM provides their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't come here to discuss alternatives theory, they come here to reinforce they are right. And there's so many red flags about the official story it reeks of bullshit.

       Lol a guy told me yesterday I was part of a brigade happening in the sub that was putting down theories when I was just pointing out factually incorrect info. It gave me a fucking laugh to be called part of a brigade when I've been in this place as long as I have been.

       I was called a shill the other day because I provided first hand experience that contradicted a point another poster was trying to force. Way too many newcomers are unable or unwilling to accept opposing viewpoints.

       I'm kinda new to big discussions here but I'm not calling people nut jobs or anything. I'm here because this is all odd to me. I'm not surprised there's new people because this is just a stupidly nonsensical occurrence. Can't really figure anything about it. Plus it's the largest mass shooting too so there's that

       Thanks and you are exactly right. This sub has changed in many ways and the mods are certainly one way. However I am currently cutting them some slack due to the traffic right now being quite heavy.
