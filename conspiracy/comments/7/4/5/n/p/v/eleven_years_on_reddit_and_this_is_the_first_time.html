       The New York Times will write something like, “The idea that Las Vegas was a false flag, which is floating around on the darkest corners of the Internet, has been thoroughly debunked.” All of the other news outlets, Wikipedia, and Snopes will then link to this article as proof that it’s been debunked

       They will never pick it up because there's too much video evidence where you can clearly hear it's one shooter. If they were going to do a false flag this would be the absolute worst way to do it. Too many people recording the music

       I'm now wondering if it wasn't a false flag but a botched gun deal.  Also would be curious how big that suite was and why he had two platforms setup sp far apart, couldn't have gave him that much better of an angle from that distance.

       Maybe, could also be for ventilation, IDK.  Still a question in my mind regardless.  Also, if you look at the photo of the windows, there is a support column between them, was the suite so big it covered that nog pf a distance or was it 2 rooms.  Yesterday I was lookong for floor plans or evacuation route maps for that hotel, couldn't find anything.

       Om the 32nd floor or was it higher.  It's a 43 story building, most Casinos I've stayed in have the suite higher up.  Althpugh I'm more than willing to say I'm wrong once I see actual evidence.

       Okay?? Witness reports have varied WIDELY. Some people weren't injured but some people were fucking killed and its disrespectful and ridiculous to claim it didn't happen. Government involvement, paddock being a patsy, someone else did it? Sure maybe I don't know I'm down for those narratives if more info comes out. But nobody got hurt? It didn't happen? Please shutup and get out of here with that shit. It was a gigantic venue with people spread out across a large distance not everybody was in one centralized spot.

       Right but there's a fine line between skepticism and healthy critical thinking and delusion and ignorance. To say the event just plain didn't happen or that nobody got hurt is pure retardation. There are videos, hundreds of eye witness reports, pictures of the aftermath, pictures of hospital floors covered in blood and stories from families who never got to see their loved ones again. I'm all for questioning the narrative but again, there's a like between questioning the narrative and being an ignorant and disrespectful fuck.

       I completely agree with you. People are disrespectful and ignorant when it comes to these types of occurrences. My comment was defending the few that question everything and don't believe the first thing they read. I wasn't trying to get you riled up or disrespect you. My apologies if I did.

       The multiple shooter stuff is a smoke screen. It's obviously being pushed so hard, even here. Prestidigitation to distract from the fact that yet again, we have been tricked with another entirely staged hoax with no real deaths and a lot of people laughing at us and rubbing their hands.

       I dunno, this video is pretty convincing that there were deaths. As someone else noted, a false flag event doesn't always mean no one died.

       Just because it's a false flag events doesn't mean people didn't die. People definitely died. 9/11, false flag, 2000 dead. Sandy Hook, HOAX, no dead. False flags aren't hoaxes. People died.

       I know the difference between false flag and hoax though they're not mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you establish that there are events like Sandy Hook where people are not dying, you must also realize that it takes more than a couple videos showing what could easily be fake blood to establish beyond reasonable doubt that people did die.  We haven't even seen good evidence of real shots being fired.
