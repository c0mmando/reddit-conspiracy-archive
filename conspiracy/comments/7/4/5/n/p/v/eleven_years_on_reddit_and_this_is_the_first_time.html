Some people weren&#39;t injured but some people were fucking killed and its disrespectful and ridiculous to claim it didn&#39;t happen. Government involvement, paddock being a patsy, someone else did it? Sure maybe I don&#39;t know I&#39;m down for those narratives if more info comes out. But nobody got hurt? It didn&#39;t happen?

    <div class="md"><p>Right but there&#39;s a fine line between skepticism and healthy critical thinking and delusion and ignorance. To say the event just plain didn&#39;t happen or that nobody got hurt is pure retardation. There are videos, hundreds of eye witness reports, pictures of the aftermath, pictures of hospital floors covered in blood and stories from families who never got to see their loved ones again. I&#39;m all for questioning the narrative but again, there&#39;s a like between questioning the narrative and being an ignorant and disrespectful fuck. </p>

<p>Once you establish that there are events like Sandy Hook where people are not dying, you must also realize that it takes more than a couple videos showing what could easily be fake blood to establish beyond reasonable doubt that people did die.  We haven&#39;t even seen good evidence of real shots being fired.</p>
