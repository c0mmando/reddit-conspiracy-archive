        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is video evidence of multiple shooters during the attack in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>If you google &#39;las vegas mutiple shooters&#39; there is no coverage from any reputable news outlet. Most news outlets are focusing on the single gunman, or how many weapons he had, ect. But still making a point to note that it was a single shooter. Trump even tweeted about the single shooter. There are also no threads in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> regarding multiple shooters. MSM is dismissing ISIS&#39; claim of responsibility.</p>

<p>I believe these facts show a possible cover-up by the fbi (regarding arms trading), and also how the MSM can be controlled by the gov&#39;t / gov&#39;t bodies.</p>

<p>EDIT: Typos</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows the official narrative is false. And much like most liars, if they lie about one thing, they are lying about something else. </p>

<p>Also look up other mass shootings and see how their is almost always a report of multiple shooters, and eventually just ends up with the ‘lone wolf’ story. </p>

<p>The theory is that these events are carried out by mercenaries or agents of the government and then a fall guy is left at the scene. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how would multiple shooters discredit the government cover up? They could make the guy in the hotel look like he coordinated it for whatever reason which would take the eyes even further off them? Or would that be more suspicious? On here I see lots of immediate suspicion of the lone wolf situations so multiple shooters would be a good way to kinda throw that idea off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because multiple people involved technically makes it a ‘conspiracy’ but definition. And they DEFINITELY don’t want that word being used in the media.  Many people involved makes it look like there was more to it than “just a lone mad man”. The vast majority of people buy this theory right away and start to look at ‘what should we do’ instead of, wait, what the hell happened here?  They don’t want too much poking around so the story has to be simple, short, and focused on the ‘one’ guy</p>

<p>Also the ‘he acted alone’ and ‘he was just a normal person’ really play well into the psychological warfare that has been going on for many years. Makes it easy for anyone to be suspicious or guilty (see something say something). People know to be scared of groups of terrorists or thugs. But if you think your neighbor might just be ready to snap, you are prepared to believe that anyone random snapped. </p>

<p>Vicious cycle. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only seen 1st hand accounts without certainty and some (proven false) videos of lights effects creating illusions of multiple shooters.</p>
