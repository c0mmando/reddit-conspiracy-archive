<p>And why dont see any muzzle flashes from these guns at all? I know bump stock was reported but i didnt see anything on flash hider/suppressor. I dont know much about guns so its probably something simple i missed...</p>

<p>Also side note, this guy was clearly military trained. No doubt about it. Hidden fuckin cameras? special weapon attachments? extreme planning? Every lone wolf i remember wishes they were this fucking efficient...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. You&#39;d think the prep involved with this would be like..line up all the weapons on the floor all locked and loaded and begin. If his brother can be believed, the guy seems like a low key gun nut with a random chip on his shoulder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to know how many rooms are on the floor. They said he had a tablet set up with a camera too. Was it also hidden?  No one left their rooms before this happened and saw the camera if it wasn&#39;t hidden? and the room service people are pretty quick to retrieve the carts, ime. Sometimes they&#39;ve had to come ask for it from me bc I just didn&#39;t put it back out. I stayed at Harrah&#39;s around this time of year, it&#39;s  less popular but still pretty busy on most floors. </p>

<p>Any word from people on that floor? Did he buy out all the rooms? </p>

<p>Just thought I&#39;d add my questions too instead of making another thread about all this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cart bothers me too. The fact that it was there &amp; not picked up by staff. The camera hidden under the plates had a cable running from it to inside his room. How does no one see that? I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s set up in that hallway, do people from other rooms on that floor have to pass by his room to get to stairs/elevator? </p>

<p>The Sheriff said he was getting room service throughout his stay. That could be that he never let them n to deliver his food. I get that part. But man, I still don&#39;t get why they left the cart out there. It could have been the last thing he set up right before doing his thing, so it may not have been out there very long?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice the 2 water bottles. Nice catch! He also used 2 plates to cover the camera.</p>

<p>Why was his girlfriends ID left in his room? From the radio dispatch, they said they found an ID with her name &amp; with the same address as the suspect. Drivers License then? How did she travel without that ID?</p>

<p>I have so many more questions hahaha</p>
