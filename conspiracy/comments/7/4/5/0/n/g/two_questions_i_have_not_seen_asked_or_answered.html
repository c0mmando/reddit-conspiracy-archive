       It appears there was a cart outside the hotel room with multiple dishes and TWO water bottles on it from room service. Does this indicate he was not alone in the room?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why dont see any muzzle flashes from these guns at all? I know bump stock was reported but i didnt see anything on flash hider/suppressor. I dont know much about guns so its probably something simple i missed...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also side note, this guy was clearly military trained. No doubt about it. Hidden fuckin cameras? special weapon attachments? extreme planning? Every lone wolf i remember wishes they were this fucking efficient...

       Either way, he had way too many guns in that room for what he wanted to do.  He only needed a few.  He did a lot of extra work, and most of those guns were probably not even shot.

       From today’s news conference, 47 firearms in 3 locations. Sloppy editing on their part, sloppy reading on my part. I’m trying to keep up but the number keeps climbing daily.

       My biggest question is the sound of the gunfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the gunshots be that loud and clear from that far away? We’re talking 500 yards+ and 30+ stories high. The shots were loud and clear like they were happening right outside the venue.

       You don't know how a sonic boom works. If you fire a gun with a silencer it silences the muzzle discharge you wouldn't hear it, but if someone fires the bullet past you you'll hear the sonic boom.

       I don't think he was that efficient at all. He had an arsenal that could take out hundreds of people and only managed to kill 59. And what did the cameras do? He only wounded a guard. Then he died.

       Yeah exactly my thoughts, he had an Arsenal of weapons. Instead of shooting and taking time to reload, he could have dropped one gun and picked up another of his 30 guns ready to shoot.

       Maybe he wasn't great with the guns. Practiced a little. Thought how easy it was gonna go. Brakes the windows and adrenaline and slight panic kick in. Fumbles around but still manages a massacre. Humans are a fickle thing.

       Agreed. You'd think the prep involved with this would be like..line up all the weapons on the floor all locked and loaded and begin. If his brother can be believed, the guy seems like a low key gun nut with a random chip on his shoulder.

       I think he could've had a mild stroke. Maybe these angry ideas in his head but nothing close to this. Then his head changes and he goes a little insane.

       It happened to my dad. He had a stroke and recovered, but his personalty changed completely.

       I think muzzle flashes are generally too quick for most video cameras to pick them up reliably.

       Thats kind of what i was thinking because it looks like the people see it and point there cameras at it but we see nothing..im very surprised more people arent asking about this though..guess its more common knowledge then i thought.

       I want to know how many rooms are on the floor. They said he had a tablet set up with a camera too. Was it also hidden?  No one left their rooms before this happened and saw the camera if it wasn't hidden? and the room service people are pretty quick to retrieve the carts, ime. Sometimes they've had to come ask for it from me bc I just didn't put it back out. I stayed at Harrah's around this time of year, it's  less popular but still pretty busy on most floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any word from people on that floor? Did he buy out all the rooms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd add my questions too instead of making another thread about all this.

       The cart bothers me too. The fact that it was there &amp; not picked up by staff. The camera hidden under the plates had a cable running from it to inside his room. How does no one see that? I don't know how it's set up in that hallway, do people from other rooms on that floor have to pass by his room to get to stairs/elevator?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sheriff said he was getting room service throughout his stay. That could be that he never let them n to deliver his food. I get that part. But man, I still don't get why they left the cart out there. It could have been the last thing he set up right before doing his thing, so it may not have been out there very long?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't notice the 2 water bottles. Nice catch! He also used 2 plates to cover the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was his girlfriends ID left in his room? From the radio dispatch, they said they found an ID with her name &amp; with the same address as the suspect. Drivers License then? How did she travel without that ID?
