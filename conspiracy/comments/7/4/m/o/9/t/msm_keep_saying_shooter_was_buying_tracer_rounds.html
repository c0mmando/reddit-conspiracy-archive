<p>The tanks were 2000 feet from his window, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d still be burning at that range.  I&#39;ll admit though that&#39;s pure google detective so the numbers could be off.  </p>

<p>If I had to make a guess I would say that it&#39;s some kind of reflection or artifact of the lights in the video. But I know much more about guns then I do about audio visual equipment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Normally</em> tracers are 1:5- meaning 1 tracer mixed into the main ammo used. (In this case it would most likely be ball ammo or M855 &quot;Green tip&quot; steel penetrating)</p>

<p>They are designed to be able to be seen in both night and day. The idea being that other shooters could follow a tracer and see where to send their fire. The obvious downside is tracers work both ways and give away your position. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Normally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was wondering if there were different types, actually. Perhaps one designed to be more subtle? Perhaps one designed to allow you to track your fire in a night-time, well-lit environment and not give your position away? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said normally because some units may change the ratio of standard to tracer.</p>

<p>I was an ammunition and explosives technician in the Marines. AFAIK, There is no variation as far as low visibility tracers.</p>

<p>If he was trying to blow up the tanks, he would have at least shot a full clip into it. The tanks are huge, so it&#39;s an easy target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not going to explode airport fuel tanks with just small arms&#39; fire. That shit only happens in movies. It&#39;s the gasses above the fuel that might cause an explosion, but for that to happen a big venting hole has to be open on top so the gasses can mix with air. </p>

<p>You might explode such fuel tanks with a heavy duty mortar shell, artillery, a bomb dropped from the sky ... but small arms fire, come on, guys ...</p>

<p>Take a (now plastic) fuel tank of a car for example. If it&#39;s punctured for some reason, then gas starts running out onto hot parts like brake drums etc, where it catches fire and flashes over onto the rest of the tank, causing a raging fire and then maybe the explosion. </p>

<p>Hogwash to see how dumb people are. </p>
