<p>But you&#39;re wrong. Little is clear about this case, particularly the questions of if he had any help and why he did it. You speak as if motivation is clear, but it is not. How can you speak as if you know? I don&#39;t know why so many people were killed, but you think you do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one is different, and insanely sloppy. It&#39;s also taken place at such a public event, at a location known all around the World. There are more cameras, more witnesses than we&#39;ve ever had on an event like this. </p>

<p>Part of the answer is to <em>support the rank and file police!</em> We need to give them confidence and bravery to stand up to corruption <em>within their own ranks!</em> They need to know that we&#39;ll be here to back them up. and we must also make them understand that &quot;I was just following orders&quot; isn&#39;t gonna fly anymore.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the ones that are supposed to be there when any shit hits the fan when what they&#39;re actually doing is having a grand old time and raking in a fortune by paying low-life&#39;s and mercenaries to throw the shit into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry Jake, but we have yet to find an effective solution to the all important question of &quot;Who polices the police?&quot; who quite obviously can&#39;t be trusted to police themselves and have vested interest in not allowing anyone else to, either. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m afraid that trying to support the more honest and dedicated individuals we&#39;d like to see them all be isn&#39;t sufficient to overcome the sub-culture of power and authority that exists with their own ranks which is even more corruptible and prone to corruption than just about anywhere else, except perhaps the upper ranks of the military where we find virtually the same kind of situation with it&#39;s own sub-culture of power and authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve gotten away with everything else, lol. Why should this stop them?</p>

<p>While it might be nice to &quot;Not let them (whoever they might be) get away with it,&quot; I don&#39;t think the solution is to &quot;Wait until they do something and &#39;not let them get away with it.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Taking steps to not let these things happen in the first place sound a bit more proactive and productive, to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion they do these things cause they want the 10 percent who can can smell truth,to know we are powerless to stop them. It&#39;s in our face.
