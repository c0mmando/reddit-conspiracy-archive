        <h3 class="title">Paddock was known as an Advantage Player to local Vegas Advantage Players.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">325</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Caster_Oil.html">Caster_Oil</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m posting this because most people would never know this about Paddock. I am a local Vegas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advantage_gambling">advantage player.</a> Almost none of the Vegas advantage players that knew him believe he committed the massacre. I have multiple acquaintances that have Paddocks personal phone # in their cell phones at this very moment. </p>

<p>Supposedly, he was playing his girlfriend&#39;s player&#39;s card on the night of the shooting. From an advantage player&#39;s perspective, he was likely playing video poker to build points for future casino free-play and other comps. This is one of many methods, where the player gains a small edge that makes him profitable over the casino. This also means he was thinking about future comps and free play, likely for the next calendar month, because casino marketing mail cycles are commonly monthly and quarterly.  I find it extremely odd that a person planning an attack, knowing that he may die that very same day, would be focused on playing a player&#39;s card, much less someone else&#39;s card.</p>

<p>I know many advantage players, and typically they fall into one of two categories: &#39;bust-outs&#39; or highly disciplined and profitable players.  The vast majority of advantage players fall into the bust-out category.  Many of the highly disciplined advantage players are currently millionaires, and became millionaires through advantage play.</p>

<p>The media appears to have been pushing the narrative that he was some kind of deranged gambler, who made large out of control, impulsive bets. I never knew the guy, and I have no idea about what he did in his private life.</p>

<p>Just wanted to share information that very few people know.</p>

<p>Edit: I should also add, if an advantage player snaps and goes off the deep-end, the most common outcome is that he gambles away most if not all of his bankroll, and becomes a &#39;bust-out&#39;.  Massacring a crowd of people is not on the spectrum of behavior for most if not nearly all advantage players.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends. Advantage players typically will put a lot of play onto a single card and then not play it again for long periods of time. This induces the casino to give larger comps, because they perceive the player plays less, but makes much larger bets. They want the players business, so they offer more enticing comps. A player that plays their card often, are perceived as more willing players, and are offered less comps.  He may have played his own card, and cycled to his girlfriend&#39;s card. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Booking in her name, and her not being in the country, suggests to me that he had the comp on her card, that he had previously played. He was likely playing her card, to show the casino more play on her card during his visit, which would extend future comps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He obviously wouldn&#39;t implicate her in anything if she was on the other side of the world with an airtight alibi.  The room was supposedly booked in her name on her comps.  The Casino might ask questions why they comped a lady a $2000+ a night suite for 4 days if she isn&#39;t gambling.</p>

<p>If he goes and puts in time on the machines with her card it won&#39;t raise much suspicion for them to send a host to go check to see what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>He could have been meeting with someone, sitting at a machine, someone sits at the machine next to him.  They talk as they play, no one is the wiser.  Who would he be meeting and what they&#39;d be discussing I have no idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just means, using legal tactics to improve your chances of winning more than you lose. There&#39;s a lot of focus on comps (getting free stuff from the casino in exchange for risking a lot of money -- they don&#39;t care whether you win or lose, as long as the money is gambled). The player will look for small house edge games like Blackjack, and then specifically for variations with favorable rules (&quot;house stands on soft 17, blackjack pays 2:1, single deck, surrender allowed&quot; would be good and is hard to find these days), and they&#39;ll have memorized the &quot;basic strategy&quot; (the optimal choices to make in the game in any given scenario).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a casino offers you 25k in freeplay to visit their casino and bet 100k to recieve the comp, you can easily figure out your theoretical  expected return. If machin pays back 95% theoretical says you lose 5k, to receive 25k in freeplay.  This is just for demonstration, but expected profits could be 15-20k in this example.

    <div class="md"><p>LARP. Nobody beats the casino. Nobody. &quot;Advantage Players&quot; are people who donk off all their monies in machines and get a small refund in the form of comps. Example: You put $100,000 into play, the casino gives you $5,000 in comps. They justify their pathetic attempts to beat games that are statistically impossible to beat, by showing off their free buffet coupons. Go watch his brothers video.    </p>

<p>This dude was a loser who thought he could beat the system. He spent thousands of hours of his pathetic lonely life pushing a button over and over and over again. He was a bald, ugly old loser who was delusional. And every time he lost, and walked his pathetic ass back to the ATM, he had to walk by beautiful people who were happy and enjoying their lives. People celebrating things like marriage and spring break. After years of constant losing, and constantly being surrounded by the happiest drunk people in America, he snapped. He decided &quot;fuck everybody and their happiness&quot; and chose to murder them.    </p>

<p>The conspiracy here is that LVPD dont want to release this info because it would cripple the LV economy by painting gambling in a negative light. See, the city only exists because people are stupid and think they stand a chance at winning money. And sure, you can win short term. But its impossible to beat them in the long run, which is what this fucking retard thought he could do, and clearly could not. Just like OP.</p>

If you can count and spread your bets correctly,  you can definitely make bj +ev. It is very difficult but possible.

    <div class="md"><p>The tank and military was overkill and unnecessary. They posed no threat and it all stemmed from a fine  dealing with a firearm. They were not hostile and posed no threat to themselves so the police/military/ATF didn&#39;t need to be involved. The weapons were legal and there was ZERO probable cause for them to provoke hostility the way they did. Please watch this documentary and it will give you a different perspective into the entire situation. 
Koresh was not a provocateur... he went shooting on a regular basis with the sheriff and the sheriff told ATF that he could arrest him away from the compound but they refused and instead did a no knock raid of the compound. Koresh even offered to come down and answer any questions they might have had and even invited them into the house to speak to him. They refused and instead came back with the national guard due to the ATF/FBI lying and saying they had a meth lab (that was to allow the govt to call in military support...with no drugs no military, so they needed a &quot;probable cause&quot; to follow up with the large amount of military and police (local, state, and FBI) presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I flipped on the news yesterday which is rare for me and bounced between FOX and CNN... Both of them were pushing what a big deal buying a $300K house with all cash is. In California and probably LV this is definitely NOT a big deal at all. There are investors all over the place here. The house up the street from me turned into a bidding war in the living room with both parties having all cash on a $650K home. The industrial building across the street from my business sold a few years ago for $2mil all cash. My point: the MSM is working hard to push narratives that dont matter to confuse and change direction from the real story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree. </p>

<p>The guy had plenty of money and the MSM trying to tie that into being some deep dark secret that he had that kind of money is the thought that he was involved with something like a terrorist group or something. </p>

<p>I work for a tax software company. These accountants that are charging you 250 dollars for your tax return, and you are getting back 1300 so you dont ask questions. Yeah they are taking additional fees. So that 1300 you are actually getting back is more like 2200 they are just keeping 900 of it. On top of the 250 they charged for prep fees. </p>

<p>There are a ton of people who literally work &quot;tax season&quot; Jan - April and make 150-200k in that time frame and take the rest of the year off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preparers use what is called &quot;Bank Products&quot;. </p>

<p>Basically it is a service certain banks (not BoA, or Regions, banks specifically catered to this) to allow a preparer to take their fees out of the clients refund. </p>

<p>So client walks in office, preparer says &quot;so what I can do is I can just take my fees out of your refund&quot; The person says ok. See it as no harm no foul since they aren&#39;t paying out of pocket. </p>

<p>Couple hours later the preparer calls the client and says &quot;ok I have your return ready, after my fees your refund will be 1300&quot; the client says &quot;oh wow thats more than I thought thanks so much!&quot; mean while the accountant has done their job and with their skills have an actual refund for 2300 through deductions, or other accountant-ish ways. The client comes in to sign the approval letter allowing the preparer to take their fees out and they efile the return. </p>

<p>Then the IRS sends the actual check to the bank, the bank then removes the preparers fees into a separate account and processes the individuals refund either a paper check or Direct Deposit. </p>

<p>So the client gets the money they were told, which would be on par or more than if they did it themselves. Tax preparer pockets 4-500 bucks and they move on. A typical preparer during tax season for a mom and pop walk in shop will do appx 5-600 tax returns a year.  </p>

<p>This used to be a huge problem with Refund Anticipation Loans (RAL&#39;s) which would allow people to &quot;get their tax refund that day&quot; and then the preparer would get the full deposit from the IRS. So people would walk in then walk out with 8 or 900 bucks cash, not realizing they would actually be getting 2500. </p>

<p>It is a very shady practice that you wouldn&#39;t even know about if you weren&#39;t in the industry. If going to get your taxes done at a local establishment next year - regardless how long you have used them, make sure you review everything carefully. The IRS requires an authorization form to be filed with the total refund, and fees for the preparer but are not required to provide a copy to the client. The refund line on your 1040 can easily be manipulated in software prior to filing. They will typically use a carbon copy to get a signature, or even just cover the lines with their fees intentionally. The bad thing is there is no real way to prove it unless the consumer becomes aware, notifies the IRS, and the IRS then investigates. There have been a few clients of ours put out of business for it. </p>

<p>Usually these preparers are pretty smart to know who they can or cannot get away with it. A single Mom working at Applebees pay check to pay check probably is just going to be happy they are getting an extra 1200 bucks. </p>

<p>TL;DR - Tax preparers have the ability to take additional fees than what they disclose to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NPR had a good story about it this morning. The part that really stuck out to me was:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This apparent silence, the secret life, also defies another characteristic of mass shooters, says Dr. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist at the University of California San Diego Medical School. Meloy&#39;s research shows that some kind of grievance â€” big or small â€” can be a triggering event. The grievance can spiral into planning and preparing some kind of response.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s of course the mystery in this particular case is that there doesn&#39;t yet seem to be any grievance that&#39;s surfaced,&quot; says Meloy.  </p>

<p>...  </p>

<p>&quot;A number of studies have found that a majority of these individuals that carry out mass murders will communicate their intent to a third party before they do it,&quot; he says. &quot;There is at least one person that knows the path that this individual is on. There does not seem to be any evidence of that yet in this case which would be an anomaly.&quot;</p>

<p>Exactly. If he was shouting Allahu Akbar, then that&#39;s one thing. If he had a history of developmental and mental health problems like Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter, that&#39;s another thing. If he left behind some kind of manifesto, like the Unibomber, that&#39;s something. </p>

<p>This guy, this rich middle aged retired accountant who seemingly spent most of his time eating burritos and playing video poker, all of a sudden decided to amass an arsenal of weapons and scope out places to kill hundreds of people. It&#39;s frightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s the case then guns aren&#39;t the root problem, and gun control won&#39;t solve it. Accepting, identifying, and treating mental health issues would be the root problem.</p>

<p>Achieving that would require identifying and reaching out to people who isolate and build up this sort of resentment toward either a part or the whole of general society, which isn&#39;t always the easiest to do. Introversion is defined for a reason, and of course not all loners turn into mass shooters. </p>

<p>And I&#39;d bet that a lot of people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder#Personality_clusters">cluster A personality disorders</a> likely don&#39;t want the government peering into their lives, regardless of how moral we deem their daily thoughts or actions. They may even &quot;snap&quot; and begin to actively resist this sort of authoritative advance by radicalizing, and this would create a sort of feedback loop. The societal outcasts radicalizing against the reactive imposition of order by the state.</p>

<p>Seems like it has something to do with the fact that the room he was in is actually owned by Saudi Royality, and there was a saudi paratrooper team here.
<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/middle-east-air-force-books-entire-hotel-tower-on-las-vegas-strip/">Article</a></p>

<p>&quot;Unlike the W Las Vegas, the Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas is not a stand-alone structure. It is located on the top five floors of Mandalay Bay. The Four Seasons also has 133 more rooms than the W.&quot;</p>

<p>Its possible the Saudi&#39;s may not even know, they may have been infiltrated by a few ISIS members who were able to carry this out, etc. </p>

<p>This will all be ignored by the media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because AP&#39;s will only play another&#39;s card very seldom in order to generate large amounts of free-play. In order to do this, the card can only be played rarely, otherwise it gets watered-down and the free play sent is significantly diminished. Pretty much no other time would an intelligent AP play another&#39;s card for any other reason. It&#39;s extremely odd that he would do this just before committing a massacre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a frequent casino gambler myself. I&#39;m no &quot;advantage player&quot;, but I know a thing or two about what raises eyebrows. In fact just two days ago I asked for a replacement card and they offered me two, unprompted, &quot;in case I wanted to give one to a friend to play for me.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems to me that playing someone else&#39;s card is considered mundane at a large casino, and that probably goes double for a high-volume gambler who basically gets his run of the place. Further, I don&#39;t think anyone here has the background to judge the state of mind of a mass murderer in the hours before a massacre.</p>

<p>So given all that, I think your theory is false.</p>

Advantage players do not think like your normal run of the mill casino patron hoping to hit big. Advantage players are highly analytical. If the Mandalay knew he was an AP, it&#39;s highly unlikely that they would want him playing anything in their casino.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was an advantage player, but ascribing his motives to building points probably isn&#39;t accurate. He played because that&#39;s what he did and had done for years, in very high volume. I don&#39;t think it points to him thinking of the future, nor does it point toward the opposite. It&#39;s just what he did in Vegas.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t play that night, although he played a lot in the days before and he played a few hours on Sunday morning. Only a couple minutes of his play time that morning were on his girlfriend&#39;s card.</p>

<p>As for being a deranged gambler I don&#39;t see it. He had $100K+ swings up and down by month throughout the years, and while he was on a down swing in the last couple months, they weren&#39;t outside of any normal (for him) amounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting point if it&#39;s true. However he cud have been using it to deflect any attention from the hotel; i.e.; why isn&#39;t r comped guest players card in use. If his m.o. is to do everything he normally wud prior to the attack, I wouldn&#39;t expect him to parse out the little details like the futility of using the card or not. It&#39;s just funny to me to think that ppl think he didn&#39;t do it. I mean who else wud do that and more importantly, why? Sure u can find tiny things that don&#39;t make sense or fully add up, but compared to the facts that do...well there is no comparison. I mean does there have to be a conspiracy cover-up theory around every tragic event?? Sure the news outlets constantly feed us contrived talking points and our government does gross shit all the time. But it seems like conspiracy chasers who worship Alex Jones have truly lost their ability to discern what makes sense and what doesn&#39;t. And a guy who is always screaming, &quot;look closely it&#39;s really night time&quot;, even in broad daylight...well that guys an idiot wth no credibility anymore. My guess is that old guy had a brain tumor that altered his personality, just like the U of Texas shooter. That story makes sense to me. </p>
