       Yes a tax return. I have no idea but antifa is a non profit organization i believe. But they are subject to public disclosure i believe. "- A political organization exempt from taxation under section 527(a) must make available for inspection and copying its report of contributions"

       What does Ford get from a Communist revolution? I don't understand any of that or any of these major businesses supporting the far-left. Who is gonna buy your $800 iPhone or new SUV if these people were ever to be victorious? I don't think Americans would be too enthusiastic about spending their universal income BernieBucks on this.

       Well Jesus hopefully you're right. But while we're being crazy I don't see a bright future of personal freedoms and thought in the future that the people they protest want.

       Ok now that we're back to reality all of those things you just said are things you've been convinced by the far right to believe about an all around small group.

       Dude please tell me what ANTIFA stands for then. You keep saying he only believes this because of far right whatever. But have yet to tell him why he is wrong. Point is he is right. Antifa is a communist hate group and I'm not sure what else needs to be proven to show that to you. They go around doing exactly what they claim to not like haha. It's completely insane.

       Because nothing they have done labels them as a hate group and I'm trying to understand where you're getting the Communist label for them either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you want it to be true doesn't mean it is true antifa does not represent true communism and frankly doesn't even represent the autocratic communism that you're so terrified of. They are obviously a representation of a decent portion of this country lashing out at autocratic hate mongers that have taken advantage of a system that has allowed them to flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll take them over the people that they protest against every single day. You have a right to a protection from the government for your diversive nonsensical hate speech but you do not have protection from the citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So stop using the buzzword and dog whistle communism for something that is anything but grow up and figure out a better way to label them or be quiet

       You are literally a bot. So ur telling me they haven't attacked people and injured them in "peacful protests" because they have many times. Once again I've seen them first hand and they wear communist shirts and have seen them use the communist flag. So once again idk how you can deny any of tjay when a simple google will show you all of that. I don't want it to be true, I know it true. Once again I went to an antifa rally just to see what they were on and they were on all of the above. Yelling hateful things to people with alternative views, rocking the communist flag. So yeah sorry to burst your bubble but they are all young ass kids who literally know nothing.

       Dude they go around telling everyone who doesn't agree with them to go fuck themselves and have also attacked people. All for not agreeing with them. Idk what more it takes to be a hate group. I'm well aware what it represented but that's not why they are wearing the shirts and waving those flags. not for the sake of representing fucking Bolshevism, for showing they support communism. Once again I saw this first hand and none of the far right news told me this. Because for some reason you think all people that do not fuck with antifa are brainwashed lol.

       Tax returns of Antifa, lmao. It's fine to have a problem with the Center for Community Change, but at least some effort at accuracy would be good. That organization's as much Antifa as a bowl of cereal is a 4WD truck.

       You are literally a bot. So ur telling me they haven't attacked people and injured them in "peacful protests" because they have many times. Once again I've seen them first hand and they wear communist shirts and have seen them use the communist flag. So once again idk how you can deny any of tjay when a simple google will show you all of that. I don't want it to be true, I know it true. Once again I went to an antifa rally just to see what they were on and they were on all of the above. Yelling hateful things to people with alternative views, rocking the communist flag. So yeah sorry to burst your bubble but they are all young ass kids who literally know nothing.
