        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">70</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/83wonder.html">83wonder</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lots of details about this seem pretty crazy, but I wonder specifically about the questions in my title.</p>

<p><strong>Finances</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paddock was a defense contract auditor then went to work for what is now Lockheed and Martin.  Idk about his Lockheed job, but Glassdoor has senior defense auditor salaries at $80k which isn&#39;t huge.  </p></li>
<li><p>He worked for the gov&#39;t for 9 years and Lockheed for 3 years before going into real estate</p></li>
<li><p>After selling his company and retiring he considered gambling his retirement profession</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like Paddock didn&#39;t have lavish expenses, but a 12 year career in professions that aren&#39;t highly paid (the exception potentially being Lockheed) doesn&#39;t seem like enough to begin a successful career in buying and renting real estate.  I&#39;m sure he could have taken out loans and he was an accountant so obviously he was smart with money, but he owned a lot of property across the country which seems like he&#39;d need some serious capital for.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be interesting if details come out about his gambling earnings/losses.  Casinos track everything so the info is all there somewhere.  Was he winning or losing and what were the numbers?  There is a company called Central Credit that keeps track of gamblers activity, it&#39;d be very interesting to see what it brought up on Paddock.</p>

<p>One thing interesting with both of these sources of income is that you can easily launder money through them.  I wondered about how he got the capital to buy properties in the first place, but the preferred method of laundering through real estate is to take out a mortgage and then pay it before it comes to full terms.  It&#39;s also easily done through funneling money through tenants rental payments and he had many rental properties.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s the interesting bit</strong>  The easiest way to launder money through casinos is with sports betting.  The IRS requires reports of payouts over $10k, unless they come from sportsbooks with rural satellites that do under $1m/yr.  An unusual regulation to close this loophole was recently brought up in October 16.  What was unusual is that a casino <em>licensee</em> brought the regulation up.  <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/nevada-gaming-board-refers-proposal-on-money-laundering-to-staff/">The licensee was <em>Mesquite Gaming</em> who operates Casa Blanca and Virgin River</a>, both of which Paddock frequented.  Was Mesquite Gaming mad about missing out on extra revenue from their customer Paddock?  Might be a stretch but I thought it was interesting.</p>

<p>Do you think all his financial numbers will come out or add up?</p>

<p><strong>Paddock&#39;s Father</strong></p>

<p>This seemed really odd to me, but maybe I just need to take my tinfoil hat off already.</p>

<ul>
<li>Patrick Paddock was jailed for bank robbery in 1960</li>
<li>He escaped federal prison and robbed another bank in San Francisco in 1968, and was described as psychopathic and dangerous on the FBI most wanted list</li>
<li>10 years later he was found and arrested when his picture was printed in a newspaper</li>
<li>He served one year in jail and got out on parole</li>
<li>In 1987 he was hit with racketeering charges and got off with no jail time and a fine of either $100k or $623k (I saw articles mentioning both numbers and don&#39;t know which is accurate)</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems very odd to me that an escaped, psychopathic, serial bank robber that made the FBI most wanted list only served 1 year when he was finally caught.  With a record like that, how did he get off with only a fine when he was caught again for racketeering?  How did he have the money to pay those fines? </p>

<p>This might be a stretch buuuuut... The time Paddock&#39;s father escaped was during Hoover&#39;s reign as director of the FBI.  Is it possible he did some kind of work for them and in return got helped out with future sentencing?</p>

<p>Does any of this seem weird to you guys lol?  Sorry if I&#39;m way off here, I&#39;m new to this conspiracy stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what his father did or didn&#39;t do it was established pretty early by Paddock&#39;s brother that they had no contact with him ever. So while you&#39;re ideas aren&#39;t terrible, I&#39;m sure they had no effect on the shooter. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The shooter was the oldest brother, and was age seven when the father was hauled off for bank robbery. He was apparently the only one of the four brothers that was old enough to understand what was happening, so the neighbors tried to shield him from the event by taking him swimming. </p>

<p>Age seven is early, but by no means does that qualify as &quot;no contact ever.&quot; Early childhood trauma, which this incident might qualify as can be extremely formative - we have no idea the reaction of the bank father&#39;s wife, the shooter&#39;s mom in the time period following her husband&#39;s arrest...could have been traumatic to the children. It would be quite a stretch to think that this kind of event had &quot;no effect on the shooter.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all the things about Paddock, the thing that seems clearest to me is that his wealth was almost definitely due to money laundering, and if not that, then a related illicit means. I&#39;ve never come across someone where there was so little effort made to hide it - which makes it extra odd that those around the case continue with the &quot;professional gambler&quot; narrative. It&#39;s certainly true that casinos give free rooms and such to high rollers, but that&#39;s because they lose so much money. He couldn&#39;t keep going to a casino, winning big (especially at the machines, the most rigidly monitored method), and being comped, rather than booted out and barred. The part you found about the sports betting loophole and Mesquite is a fascinating detail; completely brilliant making those connections. </p>

<p>Also, I agree that going from the FBI Most Wanted list to 1 year served is a super suspicious trajectory. I find it more likely that he was involved in them than not, tbh.</p>

<p>Right!?  The guy literally has the same story thats in Breaking Bad for his cash flow lol.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ya the details around his past and how lightly he got off seem awfully shady to me.  Keep in mind when he was caught he had 1) the remainder of his original 20 yr sentence 2) escape charges and 3) the new San Francisco bank robbery charge.  With all that he served only 1 year?</p>

<p>This might also be a stretch but I saw that and thought if his dad was involved doing something shady with the gov&#39;t it would stand to reason that he could pass some of his traits down to his son.  Combine that with the facts Paddock worked auditing defense contracts doing something undisclosed for Lockheed and things start to seem very suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re sniffing around the right area by investigating his finances. They absolutely don&#39;t add up. I&#39;ve seen his net worth estimated at $3 million. He could have made good enough money in real estate to acquire that given the time period in the real estate market we&#39;re talking about, but he would have needed seed money to get started. And he doesn&#39;t fit the profile of a work-a-day dude that diligently bootstrapped himself to riches through careful investment. So where did his seed money come from?</p>

<p>Plus, the brother said at one point that Stephen could lose a million gambling and it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal. That would be a third of his net worth, if the $3 million figure is at all accurate. I don&#39;t know about you, but if I lost a third of my net worth...it would concern me. The gambling numbers being tossed around - $100/hand poker regularly, $10,000/night - don&#39;t add up with a mere $3 million net worth.  </p>

<p>The picture of his lifestyle and personality that&#39;s emerging fits the profile of someone who was born into money. I&#39;d be interested to hear about his mother&#39;s background. She&#39;s being given a wide berth presumably because she&#39;s elderly, but she was at least somewhat complicit in her husband&#39;s shady dealings back in the day - when they moved to the southwest, she too changed her name for a fresh start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw an article this morning that said he sold an apartment complex in Dallas and pocketed 8 million.  He also owned a number of properties in Los Angeles that he bought before prices boomed, so he could have sold any number of those and made several million as well.  Prices have gotten crazy in a lot of markets, especially California.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read he claimed $5 million in 2015 as gambling profits. Prices have gone nuts in the real estate markets he owned in, so I&#39;m guessing that $3 million figure was just incorrect by the sounds of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;When questioned [...] it became clear that Mesquite Gaming had additional motivation to seek regulatory change: The company’s only competitor in the market, the Eureka Hotel and Casino, located near the Virgin River property, has a satellite sports book that handles less than $1 million a year, operated by William Hill US, which has 104 sportsbooks across the state.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;d be hard to get things past a William Hill operation, but it&#39;s interesting nonetheless.</p>
