    <div class="md"><p>I think at this point in time it’s irrelevant. Whether he drove himself, took a cab, or got dropped off he still shot and killed those innocent people. </p>

<p>From the sound of things he was a frequent gambler at the hotels and casinos in Vegas. It was probably nothing out of the ordinary for him to get a ride or cab there and people think nothing of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, maybe. It just seems like it could be an unnecessary flaw in the plan. The whole thing just strikes me as so meticulously planned that I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;d even take a small risk of someone saying <em>something</em> about this guy with a bunch of heavy suitcases and no companions. It just seems infinitely smarter to drive yourself and make a few trips to the room over a couple of days than to depend on a stranger&#39;s obliviousness+greed. Most cabbies or bellhops wouldn&#39;t ask questions if tipped generously, sure, but why take <em>any</em> risk of that at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or just drive himself, pack everything in his car/rental car, and check in with a few bags. Tote them yourself. Twelve hours later, go get a couple more. Repeat for a couple of days, and you just stocked your hotel room with an arsenal with really minimal risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant taking trips from his car to his room. Take a few bags up at a time, spread the trips over a couple of days, and the biggest risk you have to worry about is someone seeing a bunch of suitcases in your car, and/or housekeeping entering in the 20 minutes or so that it took to get your stuff up the elevator. Just thinking about the options - cabbie/friend, multiple trips <em>home,</em> or one trip to Vegas and multiple trips (sans bellhop) up to one&#39;s room - the latter seems far less risky than the other two, especially if you can fit all the luggage in your trunk after your first trip up to room.</p>
