       Yes, it is getting annoying sifting through all of these "why is no one talking about this" threads.  For godsake people, flip through any of the tabs... New, rising, whatever.  There's more than likely a half dozen recent posts covering the same topics.

       I think at this point in time it’s irrelevant. Whether he drove himself, took a cab, or got dropped off he still shot and killed those innocent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the sound of things he was a frequent gambler at the hotels and casinos in Vegas. It was probably nothing out of the ordinary for him to get a ride or cab there and people think nothing of it.

       Except for the number of suitcases this guy had. If he took a cab, that would strike someone as weird. If he had a friend drive him, who had no idea what he was planning, I guarantee questions would be asked. Doesn't eliminate either of the possibilities, but if I'm this guy, I'm driving myself or renting a car.

       I said this before and think it still holds up. This guy had money. A lot of money. All he had to do was slip a cabbie $100-200 and he wouldn’t think anything of it. Same with a friend and bellhop.

       Yeah, maybe. It just seems like it could be an unnecessary flaw in the plan. The whole thing just strikes me as so meticulously planned that I don't understand why he'd even take a small risk of someone saying
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       about this guy with a bunch of heavy suitcases and no companions. It just seems infinitely smarter to drive yourself and make a few trips to the room over a couple of days than to depend on a stranger's obliviousness+greed. Most cabbies or bellhops wouldn't ask questions if tipped generously, sure, but why take
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       risk of that at all?

       Or just drive himself, pack everything in his car/rental car, and check in with a few bags. Tote them yourself. Twelve hours later, go get a couple more. Repeat for a couple of days, and you just stocked your hotel room with an arsenal with really minimal risk.

       If he drove round trip to Mesquite the best he could hope for was being gone for 3 hours. I'd worry about housekeeping entering the room while I was gone and wouldn't feel confident that a Do Not Disturb sign on my doorknob would be good enough to keep them out.

       I meant taking trips from his car to his room. Take a few bags up at a time, spread the trips over a couple of days, and the biggest risk you have to worry about is someone seeing a bunch of suitcases in your car, and/or housekeeping entering in the 20 minutes or so that it took to get your stuff up the elevator. Just thinking about the options - cabbie/friend, multiple trips
       <em>
        home,
       </em>
       or one trip to Vegas and multiple trips (sans bellhop) up to one's room - the latter seems far less risky than the other two, especially if you can fit all the luggage in your trunk after your first trip up to room.

       If he did self parking he had to get a lot of gear through the casino and to the hotel elevator. It's a good 5-10 minute walk from the garage to a room at the end of a corridor in MB. He easily passed dozens of cameras from the garage to his room. See how long the authorities and MGM sit on these tapes.
