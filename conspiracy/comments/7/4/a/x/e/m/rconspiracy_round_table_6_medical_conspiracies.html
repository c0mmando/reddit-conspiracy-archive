<p>i don&#39;t believe in mental illness because i regard mental illness as a metaphor which has been taken literally for so long that people regard it as an objective fact. to illustrate what i mean, consider the following parable:</p>

<p><em>susan told anthony that she believed that jan was hot under the collar. anthony immediately got out a thermometer and began measuring the temperature beneath jan&#39;s collar. moments later, he perplexedly announced that he could find no evidence that susan&#39;s assertion was true.</em></p>

<p>to keep things country simple: i regard homosexuality as an unfortunate tendency, homosexual actions as sins, and belief in mental illness as credulous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the early 1950&#39;s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Eddy">Bernice Eddy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Stewart_%28cancer_researcher%29">Dr. Sarah Stewart</a> discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomaviridae">the polyoma virus</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, the two were the first to successfully demonstrate that viruses causing cancer could be spread from animal to animal.</p>

<p>Tragically, Dr. Eddy&#39;s warnings regarding tainted vaccines led to the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_Eddy">Cutter Incident</a> in 1954:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1954, while the NIH was testing the first commercial polio vaccines, Eddy&#39;s job was to test the vaccines from five different companies. Testing the vaccines on 18 monkeys, she and her team discovered that the inactivated vaccine manufactured by Cutter Laboratories contained residual live poliovirus, resulting in the monkeys showing polio-like symptoms and paralysis. </p>

<p>Eddy reported her findings to William Workman, head of the Laboratory of Biologics Control, but her findings were never given to the vaccine licensing advisory committee. </p>

<p>Although then-NIH director William Sebrell was notified, he chose to ignore Eddy&#39;s findings and proceeded to license the Cutter vaccine along with the others. Dr. James Shannon, the associate director of the NIH, managed to get the vaccines recalled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernice Eddy also was the first to identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40">SV-40</a>, a cancer causing monkey virus that millions of people were exposed to through contaminated polio vaccines.</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ratner">Dr. Herbert Ratner</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium. </p>

<p>Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. </p>

<p>The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet &amp; Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961. </p>

<p>The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years. In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested. </p>

<p>Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Dr. Eddy not only made two huge discoveries (polyoma virus and SV-40), but she warned the scientific community <em>twice</em> about contamination of the polio vaccine and she was ignored twice!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html">From the book The Health Century by Edward Shorter</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy&#39;s discovery of the polyoma in 1957 marked the real takeoff of theories about virus and cancer. It could be destructive like polio, but produce tumors at the same time. </p>

<p>Although Stewart was later promoted within the cancer institute, she did not in her lifetime win the recognition she deserved. She died of cancer in 1976, Bernice Eddy remaining close to her until the end. &quot;She was a forceful individual who did not let anything stand in the way if she could help it,&quot; said Eddy.</p>

<p>This is an interesting story, but in terms of drama it&#39;s nothing compared to what happens next. At the same time in the late 1950s that Eddy and Stewart were producing cancers in animals with the polyoma virus, Eddy had sneaked back to the polio vaccine. &quot;I did things on the side which I wasn&#39;t assigned to do,&quot;  Eddy said.  </p>

<p>One of them was starting to conduct safety experiments on the polio vaccine in June 1959, from which she had officially been removed four years earlier. In observing cells from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys under the microscope—the kind of cell preparation from which the polio vaccine was being made by private drug companies—Eddy had noted spontaneous degeneration, meaning that the cells would start to die without any apparent cause. </p>

<p>She did more experiments with these cells, and on July 6, 1960, reported to her chief Joseph Smadel, that when she injected preparations from those monkey kidneys into hamsters, the hamsters got cancer. Tumors grew in newborn hamsters at the site of injection; probably a virus in the monkey cells was causing the cancer.</p>

<p>The story that follows is such a sad one, partly because Smadel himself was a distinguished scientist, not just a petty bureaucrat...he was not pleased, just after assuming his new post in viral research, when Eddy threw this time bomb onto his desk: the possibility of a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine. </p>

<p>In August he sat down with Eddy, went over her data, and dismissed the findings as &quot;lumps.&quot; He thought her rumps unrelated to the degenerative changes (vacuolation) that other scientists had observed in the kidney cells of other monkey species, and he dismissed the possibility that the lumps, might be cancer or cause the disease in humans. </p>

<p>He must have been very nasty at the time, for he later wrote to Eddy,  &quot;It is my recollection that I was not even diplomatic in telling you that you had no basis for either statement.&quot; This was not out of character for Smadel, who was generally known as brusque and authoritarian, although his earlier relations with Eddy while he had been at Walter Reed had been cordial.</p>

<p>The Eddy problem landed again on Smadel&#39;s desk when, in October of 1960, she gave a talk at the New York meeting of the Cancer Society. At the meeting she described finding a cancer-causing virus in the monkey cells from which the polio vaccine was grown. </p>

<p>Thomas Rivers of the March of Dimes Foundation was in the audience and later told Smadel what Eddy had said. Smadel hit the roof. &quot;Smadel called me up,&quot; Eddy said, &quot;and if there was anything in the English language—any awful name—that he could call me, he did. Oh, he was mad. I never saw anybody so mad.” Smadel wrote Eddy a letter later that day forbidding her to speak in public again without clearing a written text of her remarks specifically with him. That was just the beginning.</p>

<p>Eventually, Bernice Eddy lost her labs. In successive measures she was denied permission to attend scholarly conferences, her papers were held up, and finally she was removed from vaccine research altogether. </p>

<p>Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community and was discussed in Senate hearings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 1918 flu pandemic that killed millions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic#Aspirin_poisoning">was partly caused by aspirin overdose</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a 2009 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Karen Starko proposed that aspirin poisoning had contributed substantially to the fatalities. </p>

<p>She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the post mortem reports still available, and also the timing of the big &quot;death spike&quot; in October 1918 which happened right after the Surgeon General of the United States Army, and the Journal of the American Medical Association both recommended very large doses of 8.0–31.2 g of aspirin per day. </p>

<p>Starko also suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of events: Bayer&#39;s patent on aspirin expired, so that many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the flu pandemic; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you are doing something that is easy to check, it&#39;s unlikely that someone will actually do the experiments again. So if you fake those results, you can get a paper published quite easily.</p>

<p>Some fields are inherently much easier to cheat with, and basically all the softer sciences are full of p-hacking and low sample sizes allowing shitty results.</p>

<p>But even in harder sciences like physics, some retard that caused clocks to be desynchronized manage to publish faster than light neutrinos. We&#39;re at a point where basically only a few papers can be proven right correctly easily: pure mathematical papers, using automated systems that can check your proof, and computer science (though that&#39;s kinda math as well I guess), since the cost of running an algorithm is moderate.</p>

<p>Now obviously for theoretical physics, the big shit that breaks previous laws is going to be doubted, so other people will do experiments to confirm the results, but the paper still often manages to be published first. For medicine though, you are likely out of luck and big pharma can definitely fake the results of some experiments.</p>

<p>I also talk from experience, in my case I was asked no proof of my results or anything, as long as it&#39;s not news breaking nobody is likely to check. I put honest results because I have ethics, but I definitely see how easy it would be to fake them, especially if you have grants or graduation hinging over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A weaponized form of Lyme Disease <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/10/02/the-politics-of-lyme-disease/">was created and released</a> on Plum Island:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plum Island is 10 miles from Old Lyme, Connecticut and a mile and a half off the North Fork of Long Island.</p>

<p>Michael Carroll, an attorney, formerly a law firm associate of the late New York Governor Mario Cuomo, notes in his book [Lab 257] that Lyme disease “suddenly surfaced in Old Lyme, Connecticut” in 1975 and cites years of experimentation before that with ticks on Plum Island and discusses the possibility of an accidental or purposeful release.</p>

<p>Lab 257 documents a Nazi connection to the original establishment by the U.S. Army of an animal disease laboratory on Plum Island. According to the book, Erich Traub, a scientist who worked for the Third Reich doing biological warfare, was the force behind its founding.</p>

<p>During World War II, “as lab chief of Insel Riems—a secret Nazi biological warfare laboratory on a crescent-shaped island in the Baltic Sea­—Traub worked directly for Adolph Hitler’s second-in-charge, SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, on live germ trials,” relates Lab 257. </p>

<p>The mission was to develop biological warfare to be directed against animals in the Soviet Union. This included infecting cattle and reindeer with foot-and-mouth disease. This became the mission, in a Cold War setting, at Plum Island.</p>

<p>And, states Lab 257, “The tick is the perfect germ vector which is why it has long been fancied as a germ weapon by early biowarriors from Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan to the Soviet Union and the United States.”</p>

<p>“A source who worked on Plum Island in the 1950s,” the book says, “recalls that animal handlers and a scientist released ticks outdoors on the island. ‘They called him the Nazi scientist, when they came in, in 1951—they were inoculating these ticks.” </p>

<p>Lab 257 goes on: “Dr. Traub’s World War II handiwork consisted of aerial virus sprays developed on Insel Riems and tested over occupied Russia, and of field work for Heinrich Himmler in Turkey. Indeed, his colleagues conducted bug trials by dropping live beetles from planes. An outdoor tick trial would have been de rigueur for Erich Traub.”</p>

<p>Traub was brought to the U.S. with the end of the war under Project Paperclip, a program under which Nazi scientists, such as Wernher von Braun, came to America.</p>

<p>“Traub’s detailed explanation of the secret operation on Insel Riems” given to officials at Fort Detrick in Maryland, the Army’s biological warfare headquarters, and to the CIA, “laid the groundwater for Fort Detrick’s offshore germ warfare animal disease lab on Plum Island. Traub was a founding father,” says Lab 257.</p>

I was backing up your life expectancy hoax conspiracy with my anecdotal observations. this cemetery had dead people from recent times and people who died roughly 80 years ago and they all died in similar age groups and none of the age groups are long lives. my point was that in this one case study my findings suggest that all these people even in quite recent of times all die between 24-66 at the oldest which would back up your claim that we are not &#39;living longer&#39; I don&#39;t know why you had to be a dick but your comment was quite dickish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is &quot;life expectancy at birth.&quot; It&#39;s okay to use that in some arguments, but not for arguing that we need to increase retirement age. You don&#39;t want to count all of the people who died shortly after birth because those people didn&#39;t get to retire. In today&#39;s world, everything is safe. We don&#39;t have children working in coal mines and factories, we have all kinds of rules for driving, safety standards everywhere. </p>

<p>When someone says &quot;we need to increase retirement age because people are living longer,&quot; what they are essentially arguing is that retired people are more fit and healthy today, they can do satisfactory labor at 65, and live more years in retirement, which causes a burden on the system. You only want to compare people who lived to 65 in 1900 and life expectancy of people who are 65 today. You can probably find that somewhere and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see that retirement-age people are living longer today because fewer people smoke, fewer people worked in shitty factories as kids, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s trying to red-pill the average population on how many people are brainwashed into accepting a life of slavery with hopes of a grand pension and retirement when the prospect of retirement is an illusion. People blindly accept that we&#39;re living longer without questioning it, without asking for evidence. If we&#39;re told from a young age that we&#39;re living longer than ever before, we just accept the fact as a truth. In his metaphor once the cows are finally old enough and worked hard enough for their big payout and retirement, they&#39;re led to the slaughterhouse and killed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski">Hilary Koprowski</a> invented the first &quot;effective&quot; live polio vaccine, using monkey and chimpanzee parts in to create them.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Sabin">Albert Sabin</a>, the other main producer of the polio vaccine at the time, analyzed Koprowski&#39;s &quot;oral&quot; vaccine and found that it was &quot;unstable and contaminated by an unknown virus.&quot; In response, Koprowski claimed that Sabin was trying to discredit his work.</p>

<p>As it happens, Sabin was also manufacturing a contaminated polio vaccine with a <em>different</em> lethal virus: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40">SV40</a>.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis">oral polio vaccine AIDS hypothesis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Dr. Hilary Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo.</p>

<p>98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. The youngest children received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, WHO denied sanctioning the large-scale trials.</p>

<p>In 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin reported in the British Medical Journal that Koprowski&#39;s polio vaccine used in the African trials contained an &quot;unidentified&quot; cell-killing virus. It was never identified. </p>

<p>However, in 1986 the earliest known blood sample containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville.</p>

<p>Koprowski&#39;s vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the African trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi--the precise area where high levels of HIV infection were identified by researched 30 years later. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people&#39;s mouths.</p>

<p>Bayer sparked controversy by continuing to sell contaminated factor VIII after new heat-treated versions were available.

    <div class="md"><p>From the Progenitor Virus&#39; discovery in December 1966, the ultimate goal of Dr. Oswell E. Spencer and his colleagues Dr. Edward Ashford and Dr. James Marcus was the birthing of a new age of eugenics with mutagenic viruses improving the human race. To fund this program, dubbed the Wesker Project, it was agreed that strains of the virus should be engineered as a military product, leading to the creation of Umbrella Pharmaceuticals as a front for this research. Research on Progenitor strains was conducted simultaneously in a number of laboratories, with Ashford; Marcus and Spencer engaging in independent research.</p>

<p>Dr. James Marcus&#39; research reached reached a breakthrough in 1977 which warranted his coining of the name &quot;t-Virus&quot; to truly divorce the strain from Progenitor. A new strain was created in 1978 when the virus mutated in the bodies of leech test subjects. Using the virus on humans a very different response was seen compared with Progenitor infection. Rather than dying, the infected instead became aggressive, were found to have cannibalistic impulses, lost intelligence and suffered from considerable necrosis.[1]</p>

<p>The nearby Arklay Laboratory also worked on mutant strains of Progenitor, and had done so since its opening with Progenitor &quot;Type A&quot; and &quot;Type B&quot; strains. In the 1970s they also used &quot;t-Virus&quot; as the name of their new strains. This team made their own breakthrough in 1978 under the leadership of Dr. William Birkin. Fascinated by Ebola&#39;s potential as a weapon, Birkin noted that people would be killed too quickly to adequately work in war. A modified t-Virus strain with RNA from Ebola was created, which led to their independent creation of Zombies. Spencer was, however, unsatisfied with the virus the Arklay team was developing, as approximately 10% of people were believed to be naturally immune to the new strain. To guarantee a near 100% success rate in battle, the Arklay team bonded a human egg and reptilian DNA through the virus in 1981, creating the &quot;Hunter&quot;, a creature that would be used in battle to kill these remaining survivors.[2] At some point following this the Arklay team began working on a new strain of the virus discovered in the body of a zombie. This strain enabled the &quot;V-ACT&quot; process, which mutated the bodies of unconscious zombies. Other facilities such as the Raccoon City Underground Laboratory experimented with a further mutation of this strain which mutated the infected into Lickers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As both a biomedical and public health researcher, I have often tried to find a universal connection behind the prevalence of chronic disease and the health of our mitochondria seems to be the answer.</p>

<p>The mitochondria are bacteria that live inside most of our cells and supply most of the energy currency, ATP, through a near motor-like system called Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) along the Electron Transport Chain. Healthy mitochondria elongate, and the surface area of the cristae, folds wherein OXPHOS occurs, increases, promoting more energy potential per mitochondria unit. Similar to cells, mitochondria can divide, move, and former networks in strategic locations near structures that require large amounts of energy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, mitochondria are inherited from mothers. Giving a direct genetic line where metabolic disease, disorders, and energetic inefficiency can be inherited. Many pollutants, carcinogens, inflammatory agents, drugs, foods, and more, promote the production of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) and other DAMPs (damage associated molecular pathogens) which can easily cause structural damage to the mitochondria or mitochondrial DNA (it is more susceptible than nuclear DNA because bacteria have limited protection). As these agents increasingly affect a person, the ratio of healthy to unhealthy mitochondria can change, promoting disease states. Furthermore, the mitochondria in your eyes and brain can be completely different than those in your leg muscles or heart, a state called heteroplasmy (nuclear DNA is homoplasmy, same in all cells). Returning to the maternal inheritance: a proposed theory of maternal inheritance is the &quot;mitochondrial bottleneck&quot; wherein RANDOM mitochondria are transferred from mother to egg. So it&#39;s a chance game on what mitochondria will transfer to child, however if 50% of your mitochondria are healthy and 50% diseased, the chances of child inheriting disease is more likely.</p>

<p>We have all heard of the &quot;beer belly&quot; or the person who just exercises their biceps and triceps but not their calves. What this phenotype comes down to is as the person exercises or drinks the mitochondrial energetic potential in these regions change so the person can support the mechanics of these structures. In the beer belly case though, the mitochondria in the gut organs become diseased and produce scant amounts of energy and cant process the rush of carbohydrates hitting the system, promoting fat deposition. A similar story occurs in the development of Diabetes Type II where the Beta-cells which produce insulin according to blood sugar are chronically inflamed and destroyed by the immune system. The mitochondria in these regions are ravaged and beaten and end up contributing to the destruction of the region. Mitochondria additionally control the on and off switch for apoptosis (cell death) and can be implicated in cancers (immortal cells, the on/off switch is gone!)</p>

<p>The connection between mitochondrial health and these modern diseases following the 1950s is infallible. However, indirectly, synthetic ways of life, the capitalistic societies we live in, and disregard for community health promote environments where mitochondrial damage is inevitable. The real conspiracy I am attempting to illuminate is the disregard for viewing ENERGY as source of disease rather than just MATTER. I consider this as logical, given life in a materialistic society, focused on body parts or organs being diseased, however these organs would not exist without ENERGY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>d121212 is correct. </p>

<p>The major ways are: proper diet according to your needs, exercise, and supplementation (COQ10, other &quot;cocktails&quot; which contain enzymes or vitamins, even metformin has been shown in lower doses to assist)</p>

<p>Depending on the type of disease you have: primary or secondary, the clinical outlook varies. Primary mitochondrial disorders/dysfunction are typically derived from mother and are often full scale deletions of portions of mitochondrial DNA that relate directly to proteins on the electron transport chain. Imagine a portion of the &quot;circle of energy&quot; (circular mitochondrial DNA) breaks, almost the like the ouroboros breaking.</p>

<p>Secondary mitochondrial diseases are lifestyle induced and consequences or comorbidities with common chronic diseases and inflammation. </p>

<p>Primary mitochondrial dysfunction can be readily tested through genetic testing, however secondary dysfunction is often a web of nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA that is harder to detect and can be reversed! There are a few upcoming therapies for primary dysfunction, however the treatment is ideally applied pre-conception through maternal screening. </p>

<p>For example if a mother believes she may carry a mitochondrial disease, she can have the nucleus of her egg be transplanted on a donor egg with healthy mitochondria (the &quot;three-person baby&quot; phenomenon). The mitochondria has very little to do with developmental phenotype besides providing adequate energy and so I do not see it as a three person baby. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to get my diet back on track, but I was eating a lot of raw fermented foods and ginger before.

<p>Wim Hof is something that I actually looked into for a long time and researched. Ultimately, I wasn&#39;t really comfortable pursuing it, but I did begin taking cold showers/ice baths without the breathing component.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;ve been meaning to add to this and then saw your reply/comment. </p>

<p>Coffee enemas. Sounds far out/a bit suss to suggest from a complete random over the internet but I would consider it a huge, crucial addition to the above in terms of allowing your body to fully release a lot of the toxicity you carry around. </p>

<p>Real easy to DIY no  drugs or major medical/scientific knowledge needed either and info abounds on the www.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware there&#39;s no deep or mystical psycho-spiritual aspect to Wim Hof&#39;s method but I guess he sourced a lot of it from Eastern influences but essentially I think it is just yoga/applied/mindful breathing and is comparable to Groff&#39;s &quot;Holotropic&quot; breathwork. At their extremes I would imagine they could allow OBE/astral experiences tho.</p>

<p>For Wim Hof, the main reason why I didn&#39;t opt for it is that I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the huge adrenaline spikes it causes. I&#39;m a little wary of tinkering with my endocrine system in that way. But I do know it can have major health benefits and it is something that I may take up in the future. I&#39;m hoping there will be more research studies coming out soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common sense in the ICU said that we pooled blood draws and only drew as much as we needed and to call the lab to add on tests with extent blood instead of resticking people.<br/>
The studies showed a correlation between length of stay in the hospital and H&amp;H levels and they account this to be in because of phlebotomy sticks.  But, it doesn&#39;t say what contributing factors are taking into consideration (e.g.- kidney injury leads to decrease in erythropoietin production and results in decreased blood marrow production and therefore, a decreased H&amp;H or that an increased production of inflammatory bodies from an infection can decrease RBC production). 
Certainly we want to remove as little blood as possible that&#39;s needed, but there are other factors at play in determining anemia causes</p>

<p>One of those articles claimed that 74ml of blood was lost to phlebotomy on average. Let&#39;s do some math. If we take an average of 5.5L of blood in circulation and we look at 74ml, that accounts for roughly 1.3% of total blood volume. Let&#39;s also say that this person has a HGB of 15g/dL. 15g/dL would mean 825 g/ 5.5L. A loss of 1.3% would be a loss of 10.7 g HGB. This would put the new total quantity of HGB at 814.3. Factored in to 5.5L, 814.3 g HGB yields a new value of 14.8g/dL. That&#39;s definitely a statistically relevant change. </p>

<p>I also looked for scholarly articles and I found ones refuting the claim that phlebotomy has a relevant statistical impact on H&amp;H. </p>

<p>Have you ever tried to fill a pediatric tube? They have to be redrawn multiple times due to their consistent clotting halfway through the draw. Finger sticks make for poor samples. Now, there are new ways of testing that resemble glucometers that I&#39;m all for that also use finger stick with good efficacy. I would gladly see these replace standard vacutainers. </p>

<p>I will concede that, with new information that was not presented in your articles, intensive care patients do lose enough blood to cause iatrogenic anemia. </p>

<p>&quot;Wisser et al [4] found that in an unselected in-patient population of 2654 at a single German hospital, 95 % of patients suffered total blood loss during their hospital stay of &lt;200 mL, which they suggest is clinically insignificant. </p>

<p>The remaining 5 % (all intensive care patients) had total losses of greater than 200 mL and 0.7 % had losses in excess of 600 mL during their stay in intensive care.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Packed red blood cell transfusion is usually required when the patients become symptomatic or when hemoglobin level is less than 7 g/dL, depending upon comorbid diseases. Blood products transfusion has the risks, including infectious and noninfectious complications [4–6]. Several strategies have been proposed in an attempt to reduce the risk of anemia due to phlebotomy, such as utilizing smaller volume blood tubes for diagnostic testing. However, there is limited research investigating whether a reduction in the size of the phlebotomy tube will reduce the incidence of anemia...
Using smaller volume tubes for BMP, which constituted only 11% of blood draws in this institution, did not significantly affect the drop of hemoglobin.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CDC is essentially a revolving door that has completely blurred the lines between Big Pharma and Big Government.</p>

<p>For example, in 2004 <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/breaking-cdc-vaccine-whistleblower-given-immunity-to-testify/">CDC scientist William Thompson expressed his concerns</a> that the agency was engaged in a coverup of the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism.</p>

<p>Thompson attempted to notify his superior at the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Gerberding">Julie Gerberding</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2004, whistleblower Thompson <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/09/10/cdc-whistleblower-this-is-the-real-smoking-gun/">wrote her a letter</a>, in which he warned her that he had sensitive and troubling data about the MMR vaccine’s connection to autism. He was shortly due to present the data at a major vaccine/autism conference.</p>

<p>Apparently, Gerberding didn’t answer the letter, and Thompson’s presentation was canceled.</p>

<p>After Gerberding left the CDC in 2009, she ascended to the position of president of Merck Vaccines. Merck manufactures the MMR vaccine. Get the picture?</p>

<p>Interestingly, in December of 2014, Merck removed Gerberding from her august position and placed her in a new role, a role that never existed within the company before: executive vice-president for “strategic communications, global public policy and population health.”</p>

<p>Did Merck make this move to shield Gerberding, to protect her from a possible scandal tying her to the 2004 MMR-autism fraud at the CDC? If there is a Congressional hearing, will Gerberding be conveniently unavailable because she is overseas tending to her new international duties at Merck?</p>

<p>The flu vaccine is <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/09/05/cdc-caught-in-billion-dollar-scheme-to-to-sell-vaccines/">another major cash cow</a> for the CDC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CDC employs straight PR lies <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/welcome-to-the-medical-matrix-the-flu-isnt-the-flu/">when it counts the number of flu deaths every year</a> in the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, Peter Doshi wrote a particularly damning analysis for the journal BMJ Online (December 2005), stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“[According to CDC statistics], ‘influenza and pneumonia’ took 62,034 lives in 2001—61,777 of which were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CDC created one category that combines both flu and pneumonia deaths, assuming that the pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the flu.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of causes. But even worse, in all the 2001 flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus. Therefore, the CDC couldn’t truthfully say that more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not 36,000 deaths, the usual PR statistic. 18 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu-death statistics: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data show an average of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257 to 3006).” These figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia.</p>

<p>This death toll is obviously far lower than the parroted 36,000 figure. But it would drop much lower, if you added the need to confirm the presence of a flu virus in those cases.</p>

<p>The CDC is a PR agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In February of 2014, a study was published <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/02/polio-like-illness-in-five-vaccinated.html">identifying a “polio-like” illness</a> in five California children. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All children presented with acute flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs that reached peak severity within 48 hours of onset...All had been previously vaccinated against polio-virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2013/05/08/bill-gates-polio-vaccine-program-caused-47500-cases-of-paralysis-death/">47,500 cases of vaccine-induced polio paralysis followed an oral polio vaccination campaign</a> conducted by the GAVI Alliance, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Health Organization (WHO) in India in 2011.</p>

<p>The oral polio vaccine was given to Indian children, despite the fact that in the US, the CDC had dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule <a href="http://www.thinktwice.com/Polio.pdf"><em>because it was causing polio.</em></a></p>

<p>According to Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.</p>

<p>This is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340. It has been demonstrated that by positioning the atoms in sequence, a particle can emerge with all the properties required for its proliferation and survival in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vashisht and Puliyel <a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/index.php/ijme/article/view/110/1065">published their findings</a> in the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> and <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/28/polio-eradication-campaign.aspx">“should have made headlines around the globe.”</a> They determined:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. </p>

<p>Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere [First, do no harm] was violated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the ‘principal if not sole cause’ of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961 [44]. (The virus remains in the throat for one to two weeks and in the feces for up to two months. Thus, vaccine recipients are at risk, and can potentially spread the disease, as long as fecal excretion of the virus continues [45].) In 1992, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an admission that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States [36]. In fact, according to CDC figures, every case of polio in the U.S. since 1979 was caused by the oral polio vaccine [36]. Authorities claim the vaccine was responsible for about eight cases of polio every year [46]. However, an independent study that analyzed the government’s own vaccine database during a recent period of less than five years uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio vaccine. These reports included 6,364 emergency room visits and 540 deaths (Figure 3) [47,48]. Public outrage at these tragedies became the impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization schedules [36:568;37;38].” <a href="http://www.4thmedia.org/2013/05/bill-and-melinda-gates-polio-vaccine-caused-47500-cases-of-paralysis-and-death/">http://www.4thmedia.org/2013/05/bill-and-melinda-gates-polio-vaccine-caused-47500-cases-of-paralysis-and-death/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tale of <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKbakerJ.htm">Judyth Vary Baker</a> is about as extraordinary as they come. Her story starts with a book by <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKhaslamE.htm">Edward Haslam</a> called *Dr. Mary&#39;s Monkey: How the Unsolved Murder of a Doctor, a Secret Laboratory in New Orleans and Cancer-Causing Monkey Viruses are Linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK Assassination and Emerging Global Epidemics.</p>

<p>Haslam tells a riveting detective-like tale that spans numerous decades, resulting in the publishing of his first book on the subject, &quot;Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus&quot;. </p>

<p>After Judyth went public in 1999, Haslam rewrote the book (as he finally had the witness for his theories that he had been lacking) and released it as &quot;Dr. Mary&#39;s Monkey&quot;.</p>

<p>Haslam focuses on the macabre and unsolved murder of prominent orthopedic surgeon and cancer researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_S._Sherman">Dr. Mary Stults Sherman</a>. </p>

<p>Sherman&#39;s body was discovered in 1964 in her apartment in New Orleans. However, the precise nature of her death wasn&#39;t released to the public for over 30 years. </p>

<p>It was prematurely concluded that the killing was the work of a &quot;sex-crazed lesbian&quot; who conveniently was never found. Not surprisingly, it was never released to the public that Dr. Sherman&#39;s entire arm and right side were missing, exposing her insides. </p>

<p>A superficial mattress fire in the apartment was blamed for her severe injuries, even though temperatures of thousands of degrees would be necessary to locally disintegrate flesh and bone while leaving the rest of her body intact. </p>

<p>In addition, Dr. Sherman&#39;s heart and liver were stabbed, and the heart wound was inflicted while she was still alive. Curiously, her death occurred on the same morning that the Warren Commission first began taking witness testimony.</p>

<p>Haslam argues that Dr. Sherman was engaged in a top secret project, ostensibly run by the well-known researcher and surgeon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Ochsner">Alton Ochsner</a>, and included the young Judyth Baker, David Ferrie, and Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Dr. Ochsner, who was fiercely anti-Communist, had ties to the CIA, FBI, and even the Mafia, and was part of the very real effort at the time to remove Castro from power, by any means necessary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that elements of the CIA and Mafia were actively engaged in trying to kill Castro. Their main concern was that a violent death could ultimately be traced to US intelligent agencies, potentially resulting in World War III. </p>

<p>Eventually, more stealthy approach was attempted: perfect a cancer-causing bio-weapon to take out Castro. Although cancer-causing viruses can been discovered a decade earlier, the public was still mostly in the dark about these discoveries, so &quot;inducing&quot; cancer in an individual was still considered to be in the realm of science fiction.</p>

<p>Dr. Sherman was actively involved with this project, as well as the one of the most enigmatic figures in JFK assassination lore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrie">David Ferrie</a>. Ferrie is perhaps most known today as being the first suspect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison">Jim Garrison&#39;s</a> infamous investigation into Kennedy&#39;s death.</p>

<p>Amazingly, Garrison revealed in an interview with Playboy that he suspected David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were somehow involved in a secret cancer project, however that little tidbit has largely been forgotten, and it seems even Garrison himself never realized the implications of this connection.</p>

<p>In addition to being a defrocked priest and a pilot for the CIA and Carlos Marcello (the Mafia king of New Orleans), Ferrie just happened to be involved with Dr. Mary Sherman, one of the most prestigious female scientists in the country. </p>

<p>Ferrie had allegedly developed an interest in cancer research. He filled his apartment with white mice--at one point he had almost 2000, and neighbors complained--and he wrote a medical treatise on the subject and worked with a number of New Orleans doctors on different means of inducing cancer in mice.</p>

<p>He also lost all of his hair, and in light of his curious hobbies, this may have been the result of his dabbling with toxic chemicals. He was found dead only days after Garrison first accused him of being connected to the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>Eventually the bio-weapon was more or less perfected, and it was subsequently successfully tested on (at least) one inmate at a nearby facility. The subject died in 28 days. However, it seems that their efforts were too little and too late, for the coalescence of interests that wanted to remove Castro from power had completely changed their directive and focused their sights on Kennedy instead. </p>

<p>According to Baker, David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were under the impression that they needed to hurry and created the weapon <em>before</em> their superiors got impatient and killed Kennedy instead.</p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was allegedly involved, but more in the capacity of running errands and doing some of the dirty work, as he killed and dissected the cancerous tumors on the experimental mice on several occasions.</p>

<p>Baker, although very young, had already established herself in the field of cancer research. While still in high school, she had induced cancer in mice faster than any public research being done at the time (one week). She attracted the attention of numerous prominent people, including Dr. Oschner, and she soon found herself being trained at the prestigious Roswell Park Memorial Institute in 1961.</p>

<p>Baker and Lee Harvey Oswald were hired on the same day at Standard Coffee, and then one week later they both were moved to Reilly. Their jobs at Reilly Coffee were covers for their actual activities. Baker, as the secretary, was responsible for clocking Oswald out to cover up his extended absences, she still has numerous time cards for Lee with her initial &quot;J&quot; on the front.</p>

<p>Anna Lewis, who was married to David Lewis, another well-known figure in JFK assassination lore, is perhaps the last living person who has gone on record saying she saw Judyth and Lee together and that they were lovers. Here is a video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyN37x3OfHs">Anna Lewis</a>.</p>

<p>As for when things went wrong, Baker claims that a letter she passionately wrote to Dr. Ochsner doomed her future career in the medical world. </p>

<p>She had been extremely upset when she discovered that the &quot;volunteer&quot; the weapon was tested on wasn&#39;t a terminally ill inmate as she had been told, but a perfectly healthy young man. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for Baker, the letter she wrote to Ochsner ended up in the hands of his secretary, violating the secrecy of the &quot;Project&quot;. This infuriated Ochsner and he abruptly terminated his relationship with her. According to Judyth, her promising career was destroyed forever.</p>

<p>After the project unraveled, Oswald (an intelligence asset) began to suspect he was being set up as a patsy for Kennedy&#39;s death, but that he believed himself to be part of a team that was going to try and &quot;prevent&quot; the assassination in Dallas. </p>

<p>According to Baker, Oswald stated that his presence in Dallas meant that one less bullet would be fired at Kennedy. She also claims to have met Jack Ruby, who was introduced to her as &quot;Sparky Rubinstein&quot; and she was unaware until decades later that Sparky was the one who killed Oswald. </p>

<p>Ruby was actually friends with Oswald who had known him since Oswald was a kid. Oswald&#39;s mother, who was adamant that her son was a government agent and also framed for Kennedy&#39;s death, dated numerous Mafia men, including Carlos Marcello&#39;s personal driver, so Oswald had ties to the Mafia from a young age.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been alleged that Ruby <em>called</em> the police station where Oswald would be killed and warned them that an attempt would be made on his life.</p>

<p>Ruby&#39;s fate, however, was anything but merciless, as he died of an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer shortly after his incarceration. To make matters even more bizarre, Ruby actually claimed to have been injected with cancer while in prison to silence him! </p>

<p>This was during a time when such a notion was considered ludicrous by the general population, but it fits rather ominously into Haslam&#39;s and Baker&#39;s narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that Ruby knew of Dr. Sherman&#39;s project, as well as being aware of exactly <em>how</em> they induced the cancer: the subject would be submitted to high doses of radiation with an X-ray machine to compromise the immune system and then a series of painful shots would be administered to begin the process. </p>

<p>Ruby received this X-ray treatment in jail and then received several shots from a mysterious doctor (who was from out of town). When Ruby&#39;s cancer was examined after his death, it was observed to be an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer.</p>

<p>For more information on Judyth Baker and her story, she is featured in part 8 of the excellent series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy">The Men Who Killed Kennedy</a>.</p>

<p>60 Minutes was once set to release a special on Baker, but an order was given to immediately stop production on the segment and it was never completed. </p>

<p>According to Haslam, the frustrated 60 Minutes team told him that they had spent more money and time on this story than any in the history of the program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn’t this number be inflated anyway though? I have no numbers or data for this, but anecdotally, if someone has an illness or injury that would kill them, and they get treatment, more often than not the treatment would work out and they wouldn’t die, so it drastically lowers death rates of the disease. But if there’s complications and the person dies, no matter what the disease or injury was, they would all be grouped as medical errors? I’ve also thought that saying cancer is the top cause of death is just as disingenuous, because there are hundreds of different types of cancers that arise for thousands of different and very complex reasons that have both environmental or genetic origins (or both). Cancer is just the big overarching term for when your cells forget how to kill themselves and keep multiplying, but it’s not one disease, it’s more like a characteristic symptom</p>

This is worth a listen when you have time to spare. 
The 1964 murder of a nationally known cancer researcher sets the stage for this gripping expos  of medical professionals enmeshed in covert government operations over the course of three decades. Following a trail of police records, FBI files, cancer statistics, and medical journals, this revealing book presents evidence of a web of medical secret-keeping that began with the handling of evidence in the JFK assassination and continued apace, sweeping doctors into coverups of cancer outbreaks, contaminated polio vaccine, the arrival of the AIDS virus, and biological weapon research using infected monkeys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those unfamiliar with this topic, he&#39;s referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rife">Royal Rife</a> who invented an extremely powerful microscope in the 1930&#39;s and claimed to be able to use frequency to &quot;weaken or destroy pathogens by energetically exciting destructive resonances in their constituent chemicals.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Rife, the scientific establishment in the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s was even more entrenched and close-minded than even today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rife blamed the scientific rejection of his claims on a conspiracy involving the American Medical Association (AMA), the Department of Public Health, and other elements of &quot;organized medicine&quot;, which had &quot;brainwashed and intimidated&quot; his colleagues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. Vibration therapy is used by therapist.
Sorry this might be a little long. I accidentally may have found a frequency that seems to have ended my FMS overnight. 
I have had chronic achy pain for 40 years. Not joints just fascia. I literally thought everyone hurt until sitting in a class on fibromyalgia while in school.  I never responded well to meds ( or wasn&#39;t willing to put up with the side effects). I usually took a tramadol &amp; just kept moving. 
2/16 I ended chemo and started a drug that gave me joint pain for the first time ever. 12 months later I stopped it almost unable to walk. 
My son races cars and we had just bought a large car hauler. Because I could not sleep I climbed into a little bed over the generator .  I slept the first time for 10 hrs. When I woke up something was different.  The achy pain was gone. A very strange feeling since I live with it everyday. 
It took 4 months to get the other medicine out of my system and get rid of the joint pain but the familiar aching has really never returned. Sometimes I actually missed it because it was apart of me. I have laid on it a couple of times since but really just because.  I have had another reaction to a different medicine so I have about given up on all of them.  I have told several drs and they don&#39;t know what to think except not to stop. These are drs. That know my history and now I have stopped all but reflux medicine.  I was taking meds for chronic migraines but have since stopped them with no problem. ( 20 or so a month).   I hope this wasn&#39;t confusing.  I wish I knew how to tell what frequency it is. </p>

<p>Mate! That&#39;s an amazing story ... imho you should do an IaMA or something about it ... I think you&#39;re correct in &#39;guessing&#39; a &#39;connection&#39; between that generator&#39;s effect on you and it would be well worth seeing if anyone else has had a similar experience</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lol, I actually know what you mean! I had a terrible back pain for over a decade which was &#39;cured&#39; with surgery, and I too <em>kindof</em> &#39;missed it&#39; when it was gone, as, it <em>was</em> a &#39;part of me/my day&#39; and affected <em>everything</em> I did!  IME people who &#39;feel this way&#39; have been through a &#39;personal hell&#39; and escaping from it seems kind of &#39;surreal&#39; ... like something&#39;s <em>missing</em>! Which it <em>is</em>!</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s another demonstration of how well we/our bodies can adapt to all sorts of things</p>

It is really strange for it to be gone.   What is an IME. I don&#39;t really know much about Reddit.   But their is a therapist here in town doing vibration therapy but it is standing and at 20 minute intervals.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody knows this by now, Cannabis was recognized as medicine by experts in the 1880&#39;s.</p>

<p>From Dr. Beard (1889):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>HEADACHE</strong>: I have myself  been a frequent sufferer from this disease, 
and have experimented thoroughly on myself and on others 
with nearly all of the well-known remedies and systems of treatment. 
My conclusion is, that sick headache is much more relievable and curable
 than is commonly supposed.
Almost all cases can be relieved in less than ten hours, sometimes
in half an hour. 
The disease is a very common one. It visits nearly every household.
It is, moreover, a disease that patients are usually obliged to treat themselves.
The plan of treatment which I propose, and which I usually
find more or less successful, is as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Begin treatment early, before the disease is at its height.
This rule is as important in the treatment of sick headache as in
the treatment of a common cold. (See Common Cold.) Commence
treatment as soon as you suspect that an attack is coming on.
Some persons can foretell when they are to have an attack for
several hours in advance; others have very little warning.</p></li>
<li><p>Take 1 or 2 grains (.06 or .12 gram) of citrate of caffeine
dry on the tongue. Repeat the dose in half an hour if there is no
relief. Some can bear 3 or 4 grains (.18 or .24 gram) at a dose.
Begin with moderate doses. 
This is a wonderful remedy for sick headache. I have called
the attention of many physicians to this, and their results confirm
mine. Caffeine is easy to take, is not unpleasant, is not dangerous
in moderate doses. It is the active principle common to coffee,
tea, chocolate, and guarana. It acts in some cases, when just the
proper dose is taken, with magical power. The only objection
to its use is that it keeps one awake if taken late in the evening.
One can take it and go right on about the routine of business.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Take a pill of cannabis indica (Indian hemp), ½ or 1/3 of a grain
(.03 or .02 gram). Repeat in half an hour if necessary, or double
the dose.
This remedy sometimes succeeds when caffeine fails, or when
caffeine has worn out its virtue by long use.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The following pill :</p>

<p>Extract of cannabis indica, ½  drachm (2 grams),
  &quot; &quot;guarana, 1 ½   scruple (1.87 gram),
 Citrate of caffeine, 1 drachm (4 grams),
Mix, and make into sixty pills.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>DOSE. -Take one pill and repeat the dose in one hour if necessary.</p>

<p>TL:DR </p>

<p>I present this as evidence of medical corruption coming from outside the community of Doctors; their recommendations sidelined by conspiratorial agenda. While I know this is mainstream now, it remains clear evidence that severe Medical Conspiracy occurred, and thus, probably <em>is occurring</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Around the same time (1895), Bayer were marketing diacetylmorphine as Heroin for use as a cough suppressant, and claimed it to be a &quot;non-addictive morphine substitute&quot;. For obvious reasons, Heroin is no longer used as an anti-tussive.</p>

<p>I do believe that cannabis likely has wide range of medical applications (particularly for pain relief), and more research should be done and made available, but I don&#39;t think a recommendation from 1889 is particularly strong evidence (at least on its own).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, I would not want many treatments mentioned in that (1889) book. Being pre-antbiotics, he often mentions &quot;try this and if that fails, then maybe this...&quot;</p>

<p>My point as it applies to the topic is that there was (a now famous) medical blackout of Cannabis-as-medicine in the 20th Century.</p>

<p>Dr. Beard further comments that headache affects &quot;every household&quot; and that people are &quot;obliged to treat themselves&quot;.</p>

<p>So, we have had a hundred years of &quot;take an aspirin and call me in the morning&quot; (Bayer again!) When it would have been &quot;take a cannabis pill...&quot;, unless of course it is discovered to fail it&#39;s hype! </p>

<p>I’m not really sure what I believe as far as a conspiracy goes with this, and while I do think that some people do need antidepressants and benefit from them, I find it sketchy that so many people report having to go through cycles of their meds not working anymore and then having to start on something else. It almost looks like an endless, hopeless cycle of meds that someone is making a lot of money off of. </p>

<p>It is my belief that many people go through tragic events and must go through the process of grief and healing.  Speaking from experience, you never really fully heal but there are comforts in (at least in my world view) knowing that there is more than this material plane.  They are always with you, this I know.</p>

<p>What the medical establishment tries to do is become a middle-man of grief by selling you a false remedy.  One that numbs you to the pain or clouds the mind of the memories.  This counterfeit elixir not only robs you of your senses, but of the lessons you are here to learn.  Walk bravely into the epic you chose.  A flat line is not life.  There are peaks and valleys.</p>

<p>Looking back on my time in the Army I&#39;m starting to feel pretty sure that we were being given HGH and steroids.

<p>Having a few symptoms later in life too that resemble what a steroid user would have although I&#39;ve never knowingly done a steroid.  It wouldn&#39;t be the first time the USA gave something to soldiers without their knowledge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure my long term health is sacrifice that my superiors were willing to make to have jacked, quick healing, abnormally violent &#39;supersoldiers&#39;.  Wondering if anyone else in the service in the 90&#39;s looking back on it thinks this might be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/euXpgfMeP-U">HIV = AIDS Deconstructing The Myth Of AIDS </a></p>

<p>AIDS research has failed because it has never really found the cause.</p>

<p>Over <strong>100,000</strong> research papers published on HIV/AIDS and there was no direct proof that HIV causes AIDS.  It took less money and scientific talent to land on the moon.  We have spent over 40 Billion (1995, time of this movie) dollars already.</p>

<p>What exactly is killing the T-Cells that allow opportunistic infections in?</p>

<p>Who was first to say it was even a retrovirus?  Dr. Robert Gallo.  He failed to prove retroviruses caused cancer in his previous decades work.  Also he had NOT submitted his test results (for HIV/AIDS) for peer review before an important conference telling the world that it was HIV that causes AIDS.  Added to that, The Institute Pasteur in Paris claimed that Gallo&#39;s &quot;AIDS&quot; Virus was actually their discovery (LAV) they sent him 6 months prior to a conference in 1984.  Dr. Luc Montagnier (who discovered HIV) has even stated &quot;HIV might be benign.&quot;</p>

<p>April 23 1984;
The press conference that invented the aids virus.  It was also stated they would have a cure within two (1986) years.  As the Press conference was going on... ...the blood test used to detect HIV was being patented, which would earn large royalties for Gallo and his ilk.</p>

<p>The previously mentioned test results were then published a week after this conference in Science magazine.  When it was more thoroughly examined, &quot;Only 44 of 93 AIDS patients tested had the virus (HIV) ~ less than half&quot;  Yet, Gallo claims in &quot;further studies he could find HIV in 90% of AIDS patients tested.&quot;  </p>

<p>Dr. Peter Duesberg Ph D of Berkley (considered by some, the foremost retrovirus analyzer - first to map genomes of virus&#39; etc) in 1987 put out a review claiming HIV is not causing AIDS.  He also claimed HIV is an old harmless virus that has been in humans for centuries.  Nobel Prize winners Dr. Walter Gilbert and Dr. Kary Mullis also question the validity of HIV = AIDS.</p>

<p>Several of these men and women formed The Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis.  The letter they sent was rejected by Nature Magazine, the New England Journal, JAMA and The Lancet.  It was only four sentances long.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is widely believed by the general public that a retrovirus called HIV causes a group of diseases called AIDS.  Many bio-medical scientists now question this hypothesis.  We propose a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against this hypothesis be conducted by a suitable independent group.  We further propose that critical epidemiological studies by devised and undertaken.&quot;  The Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After it was rejected, the Group obtained more than the ten to 12 original signatures - it jumped to 30, than 50, 100, and than 600 (188 of which had advanced degrees).  They have a website and newsletter of their own, but this Group is ignored by the media and publishers of mainstream magazines.</p>

<p>10 Scientific reason why HIV does not cause AIDS;</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>) HIV (<em>like any other viruses</em>) is harmless after antibody immunity.  The HIV test searches for the antibodies that are produced to subdue HIV.  When a person tests positive to HIV they are immune to the Virus at this point.  &quot;There is no known diseases that ever reemerge to cause the illness after the antibodies have done their job.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>) HIV does not kill the T-Cells it infects.  HIV researchers use T-Cells to grow the Virus because T-Cells live compatibly with HIV.  Retroviruses (unlike animal and other known viruses) do not kill cells, ever.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>) HIV does not infect enough T-Cells to cause AIDS.  HIV only infects 1 out of 1,000 T-Cells (and sometimes 1 out of 100,000).  T-Cells can reproduce at the rate of 5% per day.  HIV cannot infect enough T-Cells to completely shift the balance.  Simple math~ </p>

<p><strong>4</strong>) HIV has no AIDS causing gene.  HIV has no unique reason to cause AIDS.  All retroviruses have only three major genes; GAG, ENV and POL and only six minor genes.  50-100 different retroviruses infect every healthy human body.  All are kept under control by the antibodies.  &quot;HIV behaves no differently than other retroviruses.&quot;</p>

<p>*<em>5</em>) There is no such thing as a slow virus.  HIV is said to take 10-12 years after infection to cause AIDS.  This would give HIV &quot;magical abilities&quot; such as; Reactivating, Mutating, Migrating and Hibernating.  A retrovirus has effects within days, or weeks (at the most 3 weeks) - all of them, including HIV.  It is impossible for HIV to take 10-12 years to activate and cause AIDS.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong>) HIV is not a new virus, so it could not cause a &quot;new&quot; epidemic.  Aids cases have increased from 0 (1980) to half a million (1996).  It must be a new infection to cause the recent AIDS epidemic.  Essential Logic: How old is HIV? and where does it come from?  HIV is old (older than America)  and should not create an epidemic now.  HIV has been passed down through every generation for centuries without causing AIDS.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong>) HIV fails Kock&#39;s Postulates...which &quot;are four criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe (HIV) and a disease (AIDS).&quot;<br/>
The organism must;
     1. ...be Found in all Cases of the Disease.
10-20% of AIDS patients have no HIV at all.
Only tiny amounts of the dormant virus are found.
     2. ...be Isolated from the Host and Grown in Pure Culture.
     3. ...Cause the Same Disease when injected into a new healthy host.
Health care workers accidently infected rarely get AIDS unless they use recreational drugs and AZT (their cure...).
     4. ...Must be Found Growing Again in the Newly-Diseased Host.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong>) AIDS has remained in it&#39;s original risk groups for over 12 years... when an epidemic strikes it affects small groups and then multiplies to the rest.  If a disease does not spread...it must be caused by something non-infectious.  AIDS Risk groups:
   Homosexual Males  62%
   IV Drug Users        32%
   Hemophiliacs            1%
   Transfusion Patients 2%
       Total                  97%</p>

<p>If AIDS is truly caused by a Virus...AIDS patients not in the Risk Groups above should be growing above the remaining 3%.  AIDS has failed to spread to the female population also.  HIV Tests on US Army recruits from 1985-1996 show a spread of 50/50.  Yet 9 out of 10 who develop AIDS is Male.  More than half of the woman (and 80% of males) with AIDS use IV Drugs.  AIDS seems to be more related to behaviour and certain medical risks than it is to HIV infection.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong>) The international profile of AIDS patients is inconsistent.  Germ-related diseases affect the same demographics world-wide.  This is not the case when American and African results were concluded;</p>

<p>America: 90% Male 10% Female (97% in Risk Groups)
Africa: 50% Male 50% Female (No Risk Groups)</p>

<p>AIDS hits harder in industrialized nations (America and Europe) because it is believed that more IV Drug use is rampant.  Dr. Duesberg even believes that the AIDS strain in Africa is a different one than in America.  &quot;Different as day and night.&quot;</p>

<p>Philippe Krynem (French Humanitarian) posted in the London Sunday Times (October 3, 1993) &quot;There is no AIDS, it is something that has been invented.&quot;  After spending time in the so-called &quot;epicenter&quot; of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong>) AIDS occurs without HIV infection.  Most people with HIV never develop AIDS.  &quot;The evidence in support of HIV is based <em>solely</em> on correlation.&quot;  Correlation does not prove causation.  If HIV is a harmless passenger Virus we should see: &quot;People with AIDS not infected with HIV&quot; and &quot;People with HIV who are healthy and do not get AIDS.&quot;  That is exactly what is happening.  There are 4,621 (in 1993) documented cases where patients with AIDS do not have HIV.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CDC Definition of AIDS:</p>

<p>Kaposi Sarcoma + HIV = AIDS
Kaposi Sarcoma - HIV = Kaposi Sarcoma</p>

<p>Pneumonia + HIV = AIDS
Pneumonia - HIV = Pneumonia</p>

<p>Dementia + HIV = AIDS
Dementia - HIV = Dementia</p>

<p>This is their definition.  If you have HIV with a certain disease, you have AIDS, if HIV is not present - it&#39;s the fault of the original disease.  There is no HIV specific disease anywhere.  Such a joke.  This definition of AIDS &quot;creates a near 100% correlation between the virus and AIDS.&quot;  &quot;This &#39;correlation&#39; is not objective, or scientific and is <em>deceptively self-fulfilling</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>~ as of 1993
Estimate of Total HIV infected: 28,000,000? 
Total of <strong>Officially</strong> reported AIDS cases 1,393,649 (5%)
HIV Infected without AIDS: 95%
*Estimated *Total Aids cased: 7,700,000???</p>

<p>Only 3% of Africans have AIDS with HIV.  The other 97% are healthy and without AIDS (even though they have HIV).</p>

<p>Some other claims by Dr. Peter Duesberg; &quot;Aids is not infectious,&quot; &quot;Not being spread sexually,&quot; &quot;Not a threat to the public at large.&quot;</p>

<p>The hypothesis is that &quot;AIDS is caused by recreational drug use and chemotherapy treatments (AZT).&quot;  &quot;IV Drugs are the cause of AIDS in 9 out of 10 cases.&quot;  At this point (53min&#39;sh) Duesberg shows a chart displaying the dramatic rise of AIDS cases per year compared to HIV.  HIV is a flat line (for 10 years), unchanging.  Figure it out.  He then shows Cocaine and Heroine use applied to his chart, and the rise mirrors that of AIDS cases.  But once again, correlation =! causation.  Atleast in his examples, the facts are based on reason and science.  He makes his case at 54 minutes very well.</p>

<p>Nitrates used by homosexual men (poppers) as aphrodesiacs is extremely immuno-suppresant.  Rectum tissue is also 1 layer thick (compared to the vagina&#39;s 3 layers) which allows for more for foreign protein transfers.  These foreign proteins have also been proven to be immuno-suppresant.  Also it is known that large amounts of Anti-biotics were/are used by homosexuals which, are as well, immuno-sppresent.</p>

<p>&quot;You can take any group of homosexual or heterosexual men, HIV positive, but not using poppers, cocaine, heroin, or AZT and they will never get AIDS (Aka sarcoma, turbocuelosis + HIV etc).&quot; ~ says Duesberg.  </p>

<p>During the AIDS scare AZT is passed in 1987 for use in killing HIV, even though previously it was &quot;too poisonous for cancer treatment.&quot;  It was tested on animals and deemed &quot;too toxic for use in human beings.&quot;  </p>

<p>AZT is a DNA Chain Terminator, highly mutagenic and randomly targets bone marrow (where Lumphocyte Immune Cells are being made...the very cells needed most by AIDS patients), Kidneys, Liver, Intestines, Muscle Tissue, the Brain and the Central Nervous System.  &quot;AZT causes AIDS defining diseases.  It was designed to kill human cells.&quot;</p>

<p>Sas both my grandmother and uncle die within the hospital 48 hours from their insurance running out and no longer covering their care. Could very well be coincidence </p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this. I have an older mother 55 , not terminally ill. Has several problems. Unlike most patients she has 2 insurance companies. Primary and secondary. Meaning all prescriptions and doctor visits and hospital stays are free and the hospitals are guranteed full payment with 14 days</p>

<p>From a business standpoint she is the perfect patient. Ive seen my mother hospitalized and placed in ICU multiple times almost for no reason whatsoever (coherent, no pain etc). ICU is more expensive btw. Run multiple tests etc. Both insurance companies shell out close to a combined 1 million dollars for her care each year. Even by raising her rates both insurance companies end up taking major losses.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It hasnt been shown to cure anything. But the evidence available suggests it has an effect on on glioblastomas. They think it is acting on the abnormal mitochondria it that type of cancer and triggering cell death in cells that have abnormal mitochondria. The research was halted because it looked like the DCA was damaging nerves. Newer work has given reason to doubt the nerve damage was caused by the dca but its something that is a serious concern. A treatment for cancers like this would be nice but if it causes brain damage then it is harder to justify its use as a treatment or especially to justify testing on humans. That said its an interesting chemical that is worth investigating. You should be more careful when calling something a cure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>all i saw in my admittedly cursory look was glioblastoma, but the effect on mitchondria implies it would have an effect on a few others. the real trouble with cancer treatment is that there are a lot of ideas that show promise but when we get them into bigger better trials they almost always disappoint. what gets me excited is the possibility that we found out why. it looks like our gut bacteria have been eating cancer drugs. if thats really true and is common with many of the treatments we’ve tried then we might soon be able to go back and make a huge number of these drugs that failed human tests work, and we might be able to get results with lower doses of the drugs we already use. this is where i want to see money go.

For safety, I will not divulge names. You can&#39;t imagine the types of fuck-ups that happen with deadly viruses. At one point the freezer went down for a week, for months a senior thesis student mixed supposed antibiotics where no concentration was present.</p>

<p>What is even scarier is that for any vaccine to be considered vialable for consumers, it only has to be effective for 51% of the population. The other 49% could be live, carcinogenic, or purposefully have alternate substances, and pass federal or international regulation. This is the scientific amd medical standard for vaccines. Most normal vaccines babies receive are so automated that this isn&#39;t much of an issue, but everything else is a shot in the dark, if not intentionally neglectful or harmful to the masses. I learned this from inernational biochemists who fabricate the vaccines. It is one of the major factors of why I dropped out of physical science altogether, don&#39;t blindly trust a doctor, they are only there to take your money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe in medicine as well, but I have no illusions over how harmful medicine was in the 1750s when homeopathy was invented.  Considering that medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death, I think some concern about modern medicine is more than warranted.</p>

<p>If a serious medical error hasn&#39;t happened <em>to you</em> that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s your prerogative.   However, I work in hospitals and I personally think you should be a little more wary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re misunderstanding them.  They aren&#39;t defending homeopathy, they&#39;re saying if homeopathy does nothing -- which you agree with -- and the medical treatment does actual harm, then you&#39;re better off doing nothing, i.e. homeopathy.</p>
