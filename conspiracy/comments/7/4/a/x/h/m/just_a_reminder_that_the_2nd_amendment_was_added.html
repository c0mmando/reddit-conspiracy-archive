       In case of a civil war 55 to 70% of the military would side with the civilians.  Not only that but at least 10% of those who side with the civilians will remain at their post and spy for the civilians.

       Tfw you obviously know no one in the military because that was a blanket ignorant statement also only about 2% of the military is in combat roles and majority are anti MIC and if it came down to a civil war would not kill their brothers and sisters.

       Well that's pessimistic. They can at least make them hesitate for every step. The full force of the US military still has difficulties in urban guerilla warfare. And they are better trained than these police playing with their older brother's toys. Add in the fact I don't see air support being used on our own country and it's not as sewn up as you think.

       As a quick counterargument, not a perfect analog. Police in the US kill about a thousand people each year. Only about 70 police die by firearms. It seems like police are handily winning when they're up against armed criminals. I doubt the everyday law-abiding citizen would fare much better.

       Meh minus however many of those people were unarmed and however many took up the gun they had with them when they were confronted out of desperation.

       It's not the same as a coordinated effort. Having to fight street by street with an entrenched enemy is far different.

       No it doesn't. It's a deterrent so that the government doesn't even try that type of thing. If they even tried to do something, two sides armed with guns ends in a fight, and nobody wants to fight their friends and families. If only one side is armed, there is no fight, it just happens.

       In case of a civil war 55 to 70% of the military would side with the civilians.  Not only that but at least 10% of those who side with the civilians will remain at their post and spy for the civilians.

       This is what I keep reminding people. I think generally we'd be safer without them but while we do have guns, they aren't for gangsters or hunters or collecters or whatever excuse you use to justify your selfish politics: they are for holding the government to account.

       I don't see nearly enough dead politicians to justify all this blah from right-wingers. The 2nd Amendment isn't a nicety. Ooh we get to have guns, suck it Europeans. We obligation to protect the American ideal by holding our government to account with deadly force.

       I can’t argue against that. I doubt it would work with modern society / world powers, but I could be wrong. Right now the 2nd is a bastardization of politics and intentions and either needs to be changed, or used how it was initially written about by Madison.

       That's funny. I'm way more afraid of civilians with military weopons than the actual military guarding our country. Last time I checked the military wasn't carrying out mass killings on the American public. Can you tell me the last time that happened?

       If i was sitting in inner city Baltimore in a drugged up neighborhood, yeah I'd be scared. A lot more scared then standing next to a black marine. You're not really doing anything to downplay my point. I'm more afraid of civilians with guns than I am of the military.

       in 1794, George Washington mustered 13,000 militia from four states to enforce the collection of a tax on whiskey.  It was clear from then on that the 2nd Amendment was never again going to protect the people from the President and the US military. The lesson of the handling of the Whiskey Rebellion has been completely lost on every successive generation since 1794 - the 2nd Amendment isn't worth the paper it was written on.

       Why does everyone assume gun control means no guns at all? That would never happen as long as there are people who want to sell weapons. I'm totally okay with a person having a gun for self defense. But at least make them a little harder to obtain. You know it's bad when ISIS tells American supporters/recruits that it's easy to get guns in the States.

       Refresher from the title.  2a was created as a hard stopper to a tyrannical government.  Self defense is an inalienable right, irrelevant to the discussion.

       But here's the thing: I don't see the need for a tyrannical government if that same government has been, and still is, screwing over American citizens for years. If that government saw profit in killing Americans left and right, no doubt they would have already done that. But they don't have to. They're already robbing you, not giving a fuck about what benefits you, and not asking for your consent. And besides that, the people that join the army are joining it because they want to defend their nation. Why on earth would they begin attacking the people they aim to protect? A large majority would be on your side. They have nothing to gain if they side with the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, I think the best thing to do now is wait. If this was in fact a false flag attack, the motives behind it will surface shortly.

       I see things a little differently, it's a slow creep to greater profits rather than a sudden unveiling.  Go back 50-100 years and suggest gay marriage, people would be burning shit in the streets.  Now?  "Oh well."  Tranny rights?  Pro pedo views?  Mass immigration?  Yeah.  It's a slow creep to doom, if you push it too hard too fast, people will freak out.  Most people hardly notice it.  They are marching us to the edge of a cliff, I am pointing to that cliff, and you are trying to convince me it's just for a drink of water.

       So when the government rolls up on us they will have tanks, jets, helicopters, drones, etc.  We will have a couple of AR's, how is our AR supposed to protect us against the full might of the military?
