    <div class="md"><p>This is what I keep reminding people. I think generally we&#39;d be safer without them but while we do have guns, they aren&#39;t for gangsters or hunters or collecters or whatever excuse you use to justify your selfish politics: they are for holding the government to account.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see nearly enough dead politicians to justify all this blah from right-wingers. The 2nd Amendment isn&#39;t a nicety. Ooh we get to have guns, suck it Europeans. We obligation to protect the American ideal by holding our government to account with deadly force.</p>

It was clear from then on that the 2nd Amendment was never again going to protect the people from the President and the US military. The lesson of the handling of the Whiskey Rebellion has been completely lost on every successive generation since 1794 - the 2nd Amendment isn&#39;t worth the paper it was written on.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Refresher from the title.  2a was created as a hard stopper to a tyrannical government.  Self defense is an inalienable right, irrelevant to the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does everyone assume gun control means no guns at all? </p>

<p>We have tons of other nations and historical events to compare to.  They created 2a deliberately, those who do not learn from histories mistakes are doomed to repeat them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But here&#39;s the thing: I don&#39;t see the need for a tyrannical government if that same government has been, and still is, screwing over American citizens for years. If that government saw profit in killing Americans left and right, no doubt they would have already done that. But they don&#39;t have to. They&#39;re already robbing you, not giving a fuck about what benefits you, and not asking for your consent. And besides that, the people that join the army are joining it because they want to defend their nation. Why on earth would they begin attacking the people they aim to protect? A large majority would be on your side. They have nothing to gain if they side with the elites.   </p>

<p>But honestly, I think the best thing to do now is wait. If this was in fact a false flag attack, the motives behind it will surface shortly. </p>
