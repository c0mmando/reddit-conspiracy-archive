       When the DOD can't account for money because of SAPs and USAPs (among other issues) they simply fill in the blank with the missing amount to show a balanced book. For example, they can account for 600 billion spent, but there is a trillion gone. Well, 400 billion gets written in as "Defense Spending "insert bullshit here" ". Over the course of around 20 years, shit starts to add up and we end up in a situation like this. It's been spent, enriching members of the corporate and military industrial complex, but on projects that have no congressional oversight (forget about public). The compartmental aspect of government has branched quite efficiently (from their standpoint) into the corporate realm where I.P. can remain safely outside of Government and checks and balances don't exist. At this point, defense contractors and corporations have more advanced weaponry than official government entities. DARPA for example, is probably 50-100 years behind Lockheed.

       I think everyone is getting the wrong impression, I believe the money is already spent, but it just isn't on the books. It has been spent on big black budget projects. More than likely we have a highly developed space program the likes of which we couldn't even imagine. When Trump said "North Korea will be met with fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen", I don't think he was talking about nukes.

       can't argue with that. I think the issue, most likely, is the extreme lack of accountability when this money gets funneled to private defense contractors. Add to that the significant revolving door problem we have btw the private and public sector, and I can easily see some of this "spent" money actually finding its way directly in to the pockets of our elected officials.

       Donald rumsfeld came out sept 10th 2001 and stated that 2.3 trillion was missing on the news. The next day a plane hit the pentagon. Guess where those records were?

       Im not saying 9/11 was a setup, but its an odd coincidence. Dont beleive me?

       So, according to the transcript of that speech (and you can look up the whole thing if you want):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it's stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.
We maintain 20 to 25 percent more base infrastructure than we need to support our forces, at an annual waste to taxpayers of some $3 billion to $4 billion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Seems to me like he's saying that it's money that dept A doesn't know about because their systems don't talk to the systems of dept B that spent it. Or, in his original analogy, it's "floor 3" not talking to "floor 10". So
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       knows where the money went, just not everyone simultaneously. I would not describe this as "missing" money, but rather "untracked", which is in fact the original language that Rumsfeld used.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video clip you provided does some serious violence to the context of the $2.3 trillion remark, in my opinion. By cutting out the very next sentence, it changes the meaning pretty dramatically.

       Isn't that still pretty bad? I mean, how do they make a budget if they don't know which floor spends how much? Thinking about it, this is a pretty lame excuse as to where the money went. Seems like it would be very important to know how they are spending the money

       Yeah, it is pretty bad (and that's why Rumsfeld is asking for more infrastructure spending in the next few sentences). He is explicitly saying how bad it is and how he wants to fix it. What I'm saying is that people commonly misunderstand what type of, magnitude of, and reason for that badness is, and it leads to a lot of weird speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually when people talk about that Rumsfeld speech they are saying that he was trying to hide it by announcing before 9/11, or that the money is "missing" as in it left the govt. or went to some illicit operation or something. These conclusions are just not fair to be drawn from the speech itself, particularly when you understand what Rumsfeld was saying. If he wanted to "hide" the 2.3 trillion...why even announce it at all? If the govt. was going to destroy the evidence the next day anyways (as the comment I was responding to implies at the very end) there would have been no record of that money if Rumsfeld had just not said anything. So why would he out his whole plan to the world, when he otherwise would have "gotten away with it" perfectly? It makes no sense.

      <p>
       I agree, and so does Rumsfeld. Hopefully in the time since the speech the money tracking has been modernized.

       I think he announced it because he had to. You can't just hide that much money. And them not knowing how it was spent is just as bad as if they didn't know where it is at all.

       I'm not going to get into this argument forever but I'll respond to a few things here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I think he announced it because he had to.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to the logic of the person I was originally responding to, did he really have to? Who was forcing him to announce it, if in fact it was known that it would be covered up the next day? The implication was that the money books were going to be destroyed the next day anyways, so that any discrepancies would be overlooked as losses from the destruction. I would think that if Rumsfeld had foreknowledge of the attacks, he could have stalled for 24 hours on the "2.3 trillion" comment. Who was forcing him so hard that he couldn't have waited just one day for his knowledge of 9/11 to "cover his tracks", according to the theory?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        them not knowing how it was spent is just as bad as if they didn't know where it is at all.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem with this sentence is that it uses "them" in an ambiguous way. According to Rumsfeld's original speech,
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       knows where the money was spent, it's just that dept A doesn't know that dept B spent it. Their systems don't talk to each other, so it takes "extra infrastructure" to transfer that information. The transferring of that information is where the "annual waste to taxpayers of some $3 billion to $4 billion" comes in. It's not that the money disappeared, necessarily, just that there is a lot of bureaucracy that makes tracking it harder and more expensive. That bureaucracy is what Rumsfeld is trying to streamline.

       Defending what shit? I'm not defending anything, just clarifying what Rumsfeld actually meant. If you read the actual speech you can see that Rumsfeld thought the untracked money was bad and he wanted to stop it. It's just that the way that money is commonly thought of as "untracked" is misleading and leads to a lot of unfounded statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        I think untracked money is bad. Rumsfeld thinks untracked money is bad.
       </em>
       I just don't think Rumsfeld would have announced the money missing to the whole world if the records were going to be destroyed anyways, since it would out an otherwise "perfect plan". It just makes more sense to think that the speech was about boilerplate "let's reduce govt. waste" stuff (which is important!) and 9/11 the next day was coincidental.
