    <div class="md"><p>Security got there first. He shot through the door hit him in the leg. Cops were in the floor shortly after but had to wait for rifles and more officers.  Which is standard procedure your not going to bust into a room with 4 police officer with pistols. He had cameras set up to see who was coming. He probably committed suicide once he saw cops at the end of the hall staging. I’m goin by the police scanner and what we know already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been bugging me also. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a conspiracy, but I&#39;m curious. </p>

<p>Only thing I&#39;ve come up with is, if they were out in the hall, continuing to shoot might have prompted the police to storm in sooner. If he had plans to escape he might have been using that time to try to come up with a new escape plan, just going over his options... at least until Swat got there and he knew his time was up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won’t be hearing much from this case unless it’s leaked. But most of security for those casinos are in the business for quite sometime. Casinos are the one place where nothing goes unseen. They have the best technology and the best security. You also probably won’t here much or see much from inside the casinos. Business will sure take a hit after this and if multiple casinos were hit , it would absolutely destroy Vegas.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, the guy had an obvious struggle with addiction. From the looks of his brother in the interviews (might be post shock) he could be struggling with addiction too.</p>

<p>What if the guy really snapped? He may of had elaborate plans to fortify the room and intended to stay there until he was killed. BUT once he started shooting and the realization of action kicked in (IMO the more familiar you are with adrenaline the less time and effort it takes for your brain to work properly while influenced by it.) He could have realized he wasn&#39;t okay with his actions and decided to blow his head off as a result. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a shooter acted on impulse and then couldn&#39;t cope with their actions. </p>

<p>The guy could have made an escape. It seems like the only thing stopping him was 4 cops with pistols waiting on back up. The resources this guy had in his room could have easily made for a effortless escape. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>probably shot in the head by the guys actually shooting and left to be found dead.  maybe the security guard or an officer in cahoots stalled the search long enough for the real shooter to split.  the guard may have been purposely hit so he wasnt suspected of involvement.   they breach the door and find the body.  idk but the fact that there are so many questions and different scenarios that could have happened in what should be a straight forward event makes me wonder</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i was also curious about why it stopped, also seemed to be taking quite a while between reloading.  seems one would try to get off as many rounds as they could because normally tou wont know when the  ops will arrive.  this guys knows he has a time limit and has an added advantage knowing exactly when the cops are nearing his position.  why take so long between reloads and why stop shooting?</p>

<p>WASHINGTON -- Twelve Israelis who were unaccounted for in Las Vegas amidst a massacre there on Sunday night have been identified and are safe, an official with the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;All of the Israelis that we were looking for has been located,&quot; the official told The Jerusalem Post, confirming that their diplomats on the ground in Nevada were on their way back to California.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been wondering the same thing. But I also want to know why he had so many guns in his room? Okay so he needed 2 automatic guns in the windows let’s say, and a pistol for closer range and mobility when escaping(or killing himself), and maybe a shot gun as well. In my opinion that would get the job done well with enough ammo of course. Why do you need 17 guns or what ever number it is now for 1 gunman?</p>

<p>There have been a few interviews now saying that Steven Paddock was an intelligent man who was meticulous with planning. And he lived a very private life. He’s a multimillionaire who played $100 hand poker for fun in his retirement, owned multiple houses, 2 single engine planes, owned 40+ guns, and that’s just what I’ve seen on the news. What I’m trying to say is that you don’t get to where he’s at, with 0 obvious motive with the simple thinking of “I want to kill as much people as possible without strapping a bomb to my chest”. I may be trying to connect dots that don’t exist, but I can’t believe he did this just to kill a lot of people or he had a mental break. I obviously think he is sick person and may have been born this way, but I don’t  think his motive is that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say he had a lot of guns because he was firing guns designed for semi auto action in a full auto manner. He knew the guns would jam. Instead of fixing it he could just move to the next one. </p>
