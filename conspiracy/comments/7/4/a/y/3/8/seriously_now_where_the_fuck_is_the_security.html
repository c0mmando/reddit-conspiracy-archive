    <div class="md"><p>yah they have them by now - no question... if they exist they have them.</p>

<p>why wouldn&#39;t they release them to quell the questions being raised?</p>

<p>they should be releasing the video proving their accounting of the events so people can move on. The families of the victims deserve to know for certain that things happened as they have been told.</p>

<p>the family of the shooter also deserve this.</p>

<p>Just trust us ok? Trust us. We know we have lied to you before but just trust us that a mad man killed your loved one. Also just trust us that your brother, your son, your husband killed all these people. Just trust us ok?</p>

<p>Fuck that. Prove it. They haven&#39;t proved anything at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nonsense. you are speaking nonsense. the families deserve proof. it isn&#39;t asking for too much to see the alleged shooter enter the casino with his arsenal of weapons. a dead body covered in blood proves absolutely nothing and you know it.</p>

<p>they have lied to the people before... many times before... the families deserve to know for sure.</p>

<p>but it doesn&#39;t matter does it. the countless families of 9/11 victims who petitioned for proof didn&#39;t get what they were asking for so... wtf does it matter right?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting no one died moron. The coroner can communicate with the families all he wants... if the families don&#39;t get definitive proof who care what they say about their dead loved ones.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting then that the government and the police have never lied to the people? Yes they have. For this reason alone - they should be proving their narrative.</p>

<p>Strange how a graphic picture of the shooter makes its way online but not a single image of the shooter entering the casino in which he supposedly stayed for 4 days.</p>

<p>You are the one that&#39;s crazy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I said the corner and the police. This is elementary shit, it&#39;s their job to speak with the family members. If someone thinks Stephen Paddock did not kill their family member, that would be the time they can discuss it with the proper authorities.</p>

<p>So far I&#39;m just trying to get information.  I&#39;m not really buying any of the conspiracy talk but if there&#39;s any compelling evidence (not shakey camera footage showing a strobe-light that was on 2 hours before the incident) then I&#39;d like to see it.</p>

<p><strong>Few Vegas casinos have hotel surveillance</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Las Vegas casinos — some of the most closely watched spaces in the world — don’t have video cameras in guest room hallways&quot; (...) &quot;Yet The Associated Press found that 23 of the 27 major Strip casinos have no surveillance in hotel hallways or elevator landings.

They said the only one they knew of that did was Caesars Palace and they thought MGM Grand did but weren&#39;t sure.  Seems to jive with this list.  They said for the most part they only cared about lobby/gaming floor as that is where all their assets were.</p>

Who is motivated to keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of mental illness, and has the power to make something like this happen? And who would benefit from that kind of legislation? That&#39;s what I am stuck on...the shooter&#39;s motivation of &#39;I just want to kill people&#39; seems more plausible than a conspiracy where no group really stands to benefit.</p>

<p>Releasing images identifying criminals is standard procedure.</p>

<p>It is standard procedure when they have someone they need to identify or locate. Even then, releasing such material to the public are sometimes avoided. Witness statements are less reliable if they&#39;ve been provided with additional material about the incident, them making it obvious that they are looking for someone might cause that person to flee, etc, etc. </p>

<p>It would be weird if all 22,000 people had filmed the thing and all 22,000 videos went online and didn’t show any deaths or abrupt endings... but I’ve only seen 10 or so different videos. Hell, 100 videos is only .045% of the crowd. Even if you assume 50 people surrounding every camera, it only brings it up to 22% of the crowd being in the immediate footage.

Why are so many of the listed victims associated with government,law enforcement,medical,teaching and public service?Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, seeing how some of them were modded out makes sense for more than one reason. Gun enthusiasts, correct me if I&#39;m wrong - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wIjPox5.png">but here&#39;s what I see labeled</a>. </p>

<p>Left gun has an optical zoom, bipod, a standard mag, and lacks a bump stock (meaning it could only fire as a semi-automatic). Meaning, the killer probably used it to take accurate zoomed in shots to select his targets. </p>

<p>Right gun has a holosight, bump stock (enabling the pseudo-automatic firing rate), an extended mag (notice the red line I drew - there are two rows of bullets in that clip), and a foregrip. The foregrip would make it easier to fire it in pseudo-automatic. The scope wouldn&#39;t be too useful as it&#39;d be kicking like a mule. Bump stock would have benefited from a bipod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Kq2t5kzMY">BUT it has to be a specific type of bipod.</a>. IE, one that can move back and forth on a guide. You can also see in that video why a scope is tricky with a bump stock. It flaps all over. Otherwise the physics that makes the bumpstock work would cause the bipod to drag back and forth on whatever surface it was &quot;mounted to&quot;. </p>

<p>It kind of makes sense to have copies of the same gun (less reloads). Also kind of makes sense to have different load outs (single fire + fully auto). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i love how they release all that stuff but anything else it too risky for &quot;the investigation&quot; (just another power word they hide behind).  With just about every other incident caught on camera it gets released almost immediately unless they are looking for more suspects and dont want to let on they know who they are.  To me the only reason they havent shown his actually in the hotel and casino is because he was with ither people.  either they have more suspects or the others he was with were perhaps people recognized by the PD.  either way everything about the way any shit goes down is always surrounded in mystery</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also depends on the camera and it&#39;s placement. A wide angle shot wouldn&#39;t be able to pick up on facial definitions as well where as a fixed zoom camera would. I&#39;ve worked with a few camera softwares, it&#39;s not without it&#39;s flaws. </p>

<p>Also any blind spot could set the investigation back in video review because now you have to find what camera he gets pick up on next. Not to mention that one camera could draw a conclusion and the next could make that conclusion void. Trust me when I say it takes a lot of time to peice together multiple cameras on one person. Not to mention if he met up with anyone, they would now have to track that person.</p>

<p>They haven&#39;t released anything yet, what has been released is leaks, so I do hope they come out with stuff soon, but with this big of a crime scene it will take a while. </p>

<p>True enough. I have my own levels of skeptism with all the theories flying back and forth but while I think it&#39;s okay for people to be asking questions like you see in this sub I don&#39;t think we are going to have a more accurate picture until some time passes.</p>

<p>This would not be difficult. His check-in time would be recorded in the computer system and the hotel can know every time his room&#39;s lock was unlocked as well. That gives you a bunch of fixed points in time where his specific time and location are confirmed and tracking his movement within the hotel around those time points wouldn&#39;t be hard. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have loads of respect for anyone willing to join the services, I just don&#39;t think that &quot;our freedom&quot; is in jeopardy, at least, not because of foreign enemies.

<p>Security Guard and Paddock go on shooting rampage. Plan to escape by shooting airport tank. Tank doesn&#39;t explode and Security guard shoots Paddock in chest and stages his suicide. Security guard shoots self in leg and microphones police the exact location of the room. Also after being shot he helps them clear rooms to avoid suspision.</p>

<p>How else could he get the room? Guns to the room? If shooter set up cameras in the hallway, how would he manage to get shot only once by someone with automatic weapons? Why is there no footage? Did security guard disable the cameras?</p>

<p>Also, speaking of dirty business. If you read the 4chan post predicting the attack back on September 11th, he mentions this: </p>

<p>&quot;If their plan is successful state of nevada will pass a law in the future making all casinos have mandatory metal detectors and backscatter machines. Soon after a federal law will be passed to put these machines in universities, high schools, federal buildings, you name it. OSI Systems and Chertoff are the main producers of these machines. Sometime around 2020 Chertoff and OSI will merge into a single company.&quot; &quot;...Mr. Adelson will become a huge sponsor of these machines and he will be the first to put them in his casinos when the law passes.

    <div class="md"><p>Police departments generally don&#39;t release information like videos of crimes to the public if they have no pressing need to identify specific people in the videos/photos. What does get released is usually acquired through public records requests (almost always are denied for active investigations however; the case needs to be closed for that info to get released) or entered into evidence in court and thus becoming public information. </p>

They were recording videos during the shooting, and the guy interviewed on Fox Business said the shooting was coming from 30 floors below them.  The patio of the Foundation Room would have a perfect view of the left-most broken window of Paddock&#39;s Vista suite on the 32nd floor, but none of the people in the 2 videos recorded on the patio happen to notice the broken window or the gunfire coming out of it?</p>

<p><strong>Few Vegas casinos have hotel surveillance</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Las Vegas casinos — some of the most closely watched spaces in the world — don’t have video cameras in guest room hallways&quot; (...) &quot;Yet The Associated Press found that 23 of the 27 major Strip casinos have no surveillance in hotel hallways or elevator landings. All but four of the 27 hotels are owned by MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment Corp., Las Vegas Sands Corp. or Wynn Resorts Ltd.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>HOTELS WITHOUT SURVEILLANCE</strong>

If you look at the layout of the building and how the windows are set up you will notice that the windows are busted out in different rooms. Meaning he had a suite and a regular room. So unless the wall was torn down between them, he would have had to run from room to room through the common hallway. I would like to see if they had any footage on a hallway camera of him running between rooms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The suite and regular room had a door which adjoined them. Many suites in Vegas are configured like this, I stayed in one recently at the Mirage. Unless you&#39;re talking a penthouse level mega-suite, &quot;two bedroom&quot; suites are generally one bedroom suites that have a door connecting to an adjacent regular room, as long as it&#39;s unlocked from both sides. No need to walk through a common hallway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not from me but: </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;The LVMPD knows the motive behind the attack, but the FBI will not allow us to release the motive because it implicates the FBI in illegal arms deals and supplying arms to ISIS terrorists within U.S. borders.</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI agent who participated in multiple illegal arms deals in the Las Vegas area in a gun running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious. Paddock thought he was engaging in another routine arms transfer, but ISIS had learned about the entrapment scheme and Paddock&#39;s true identity. They killed him and carried out the massacre, and then fled the scene.</p>

<p>Everything is being kept under extreme wraps because 1) armed ISIS terrorists are still at large and 2) this is very embarrassing to the FBI and they don&#39;t want their scheme to become public knowledge.</p>

<p>I will be posting further information throughout the day, people within LVMP are disgusted and are pushing for this information to be released to the public.&quot;</p>

<p>This is what is happening, this is why there is soo much oddity, gun trade gone bad, terrorists are still at large and killed this trader for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did say he was shot through the door, which would give credence to the security cameras he installed. Plus the multiple weapons they found makes sense for a single shot and explains the pause.  I&#39;m not saying this whole thing isn&#39;t fishy, but the explanation isn&#39;t implausible. </p>
