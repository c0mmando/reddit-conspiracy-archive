        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I want to start this off by saying Im new here, I have never been one for conspiracy theories until this event. Nothing about it makes sense.</p>

<p>One thing that has confused me, that maybe you guys could enlighten me on, is why we are hearing from people that Paddock spent decades acquiring guns and ammunition, yet at the same time that he purchased 33 of them in the last year. For the record, they are saying they found 47 guns belonging to Paddock, 33 of which were bought within the last year. The two statements of Paddock amassing guns over decades, and majority of them being bought within the last year don&#39;t fit together to me.</p>

<p>It could just be something small, but it just seems to me there are just a lot of little details that really don&#39;t make sense and I don&#39;t know what to make of them. Why would one person even need that many guns to carry this out? Why have all of the materials for explosives in his car? Why leave some ammo in his car unless he thought he would need it there? If what Im hearing is true and he may have had a plan to escape, in my mind at least, he had to have someone helping him. I don&#39;t see a way in which a 65 year old man is going to get from the 32nd floor of a hotel to the bottom and to a car or something to escape all on his own. I don&#39;t know, I really don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait. So you&#39;re saying that these statements are to purposely benefit the NRA?

    <div class="md"><p>33 guns in a year is not suspicious. People love to waste their money on collections. It&#39;s human nature.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it seems like he was thinking about doing this for a long time and got spooked on several other occasions.  He was being careful to stay off the radar of law enforcement or whoever.</p>

<p>To buy a fully automatic weapon you have to pay a ton of cash, wait up to a year to get the permit, have a totally clean record, find a class three dealer, and then abide by a whole host of new regulations including having your name and address reported to local law enforcement and apply for a permit every time you take it over state lines.  </p>

<p>Not ideal for a guy trying to stay off the radar of the government and totally unnecessary.  There are easy ways to illegally and legally convert semi automatic weapons to automatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a lot of assumptions. </p>

<p>Buying a fully automatic weapon still wouldn&#39;t have put him on any &quot;radars&quot; because he fits all the criteria of legally buying one. Not to mention that if his plan was to &quot;stay off the radar&quot; I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t be hard to find someone selling one on the black market or otherwise if you were actually looking. It&#39;s not like money was an issue.</p>

<p>Also if mass killing from a sniper nest was the plan all along, there are much better ways of doing it than a fully automatic rifle. It would be much more practical to single shot people than spray and pray from very far away. If his end game was mowing down lots of people it would&#39;ve been far more effective from ground level.</p>

<p>His weapons of choice don&#39;t match up with what the end result was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that is a lot of assumptions haha.  What I said was well reasoned.  The 9-12 month waiting period alone is enough to explain why he didn&#39;t bother.

<p>I do know that in the same situation an automatic weapon would have little advantage over a semi automatic weapon with a bump stock or other mechanism to increase the rate of fire and would come with a lot more risks, cost, and waiting time than the weapons he acquired.</p>

I&#39;ve always joked about &quot;fake news&quot; and what not, but now I&#39;m really starting to believe that it should be questioned. It&#39;s caused a lot of self reflection on my part as well, Ive found that a lot of times it was just easier to believe there wasn&#39;t something more sinister going on pertaining to some situation that happened. It was more convenient to stay in the dark or to stay ignorant of what was really happening, now things have just gotten to the point where, in the case of this event, you can&#39;t not question the common narrative. I hope that all made sense, Im typing this out at 5am lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We call it &quot;fake news&quot; for a reason. You should watch the full interview his brother did. It&#39;s 30 but worth the watch. You&#39;ll notice they spin a lot of the stuff he talks about like how he traveled a lot and stayed in different hotels. Now they&#39;re saying he made dry runs on other concerts near hotels but conveniently never mention any other hotels he stayed at. Which according to his brother was a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>33 guns in a year is not suspicious. People love to waste their money on collections. It&#39;s human nature. Assuming he&#39;s paying full sticker all the time we can estimate $100k invested. Very much in line with sports memorabilia collectors, yachting enthusiasts, and wealthy men who like to keep a proper wardrobe.  This guy wasn&#39;t poor. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t up to no good, it just means a big collection rapidly acquired isn&#39;t suspicious on it&#39;s own. </p>

<p>I do know that in the same situation an automatic weapon would have little advantage over a semi automatic weapon with a bump stock or other mechanism to increase the rate of fire and would come with a lot more risks, cost, and waiting time than the weapons he acquired.</p>
