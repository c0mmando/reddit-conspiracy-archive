       Sometimes you got to be blunt. There are two distinct guns firing from two distinct locations. If you cannot tell, them I'm not sure what to tell you.

       the consistent timing between close range and long range tells my ears that it’s an echo, probably off of the building with the large facade in the distance, because I guess to be blunt, that’s how sound works.

       Tho, that could have been because of him switching windows.

       Still, not saying only one shooter. I did listen to the scanner, but it is feasible the window farther from her would sound different.

       Honestly I was a solid one shooter advocate until I saw this video. There's no way that the 45s shots are the same weapon and they're too close together for it to be the same person. It sounds exactly like talking gun drills from the service, two automatic weapons laying down fire in alternate patterns. Everyone needs to watch this video

       Yea but if you keep listening you hear the far away "echo" shots without any preceeding loud shots, proving imo 2 shooters. My guess is they were on those fuel tanks next to the airport, quick and unseen exit btw, and were probably out of the state before the breech.

       1-45 seconds and on. You hear gunshots close to the cab, and also gunshots off in the distance. Two different guns and locations. Even the cab driver says: "gunshots now seem further away" and then, bam very close to her. It's not echoes.

       I'm entirely on the fence about this theory. I do think he had an accomplice but no valid evidence suggests there were multiple shooters. I don't necessarily think he was alone and I don't think we're being told the whole truth but I'm skeptical about a second shooter. A lot of these conclusions are coming from low quality videos circulating on social media and what if's. He wasn't alone though even if he was alone in that room, someone else was working with him.

       That's it's the same gun being sweeped around the crowd, and that those "controlled bursts" are firing at the exact same rate as the sound before it. Gunfire sounds different when it's being aimed in different directions.
      </p>

       I'm not an expert on firearms, but I know gunshots sound very different when they are sweeping towards/ away from you.

       There are 2 sounds in most of these videos. These are easily explained if you google them. First is the sound of the bullet passing the sound barrier(seeing the bullet arrives first) and then you here the sound of the gas leaving the weapon.  If you're fat enough or just right position you won't hear the sound of the billet passing. Just google "sound of being shot at"

       The sharp snapping sounds that are intermittent are the bullets passing close to the person taking the video. The pattern to me indicates him just sweeping back and forth as he's firing into the crowd, the bullets hitting the crowd really close so you can hear the bullets passing and then sweeping to the other side of the crowd and far enough away where you won't hear that sonic crack

       The only thing that could debunk that both guns came from a single shooter is a crank trigger with a motor attached. You could make the argument of dual welding the firearms but anyone who's used a slidefire knows its impossible as you need one hand to hold the grip and another to apply pressure to the handguard.

       Have you ever actually heard a ricochet? And, what surface are you implying that these bullets are ricocheting off of? Asphalt? I’ve heard ricochet before, and unless it’s coming off of an armor plate, all you’re going to hear is the bullet whiz past you.

       Theres a different between ricohcet sounds, an echo, and a clear audio of another fiream. This is a ricochet from a .50 although louder you get the idea.

       Alright, I suppose you’re an expert now that you’ve watched a shit quality video on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I heard in this video was the shot, then the bullet (or rock, or whatever else flew back at him) hitting his ear pro, followed by the sound of his ear pro falling off.

       Oh shit haha I was agreeing with you it clearly sounds like 2 shooters. That video was just posted as an obvious comparison to what a ricochet sounds like and how it sounds nothing like what the other guy was calling a ricochet in the video.

       There is nothing in the way of convincing evidence of actual gunfire, damage from bullets, or gunshot wounds. There are a few suggestions and cheap television tricks, but certainly not the hellstorm of destruction and carnage that there would certainly be on the internet this long after such a shooting.

       Go to this one at about 9:40, dude has a rather sizable hole in his arm, then a chest wound after it went through.

       The video of that guy going around checking for pulses doesn't feature any obvious wounds-on-flesh, but plenty of wounds-under-pierced-clothing and pools of blood beneath bodies. And actually I think there's one woman about to pass who has a clear exit wound in the back of the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the assertion that there'd be plenty of carnage video, I don't think too many lookieloos stuck around to document the wounded at the time. As for whether there were real gunfire and bullets, you could probably ask any of the 21.5k who survived, and especially those who took hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting was real, the motive/circumstances of how it went down are uncertain, far as I'm concerned.

       I've seen that video; there is no "Hole" in the guy's arm and even if there were one wound on one guy's arm, that alone would be suspicious that it was the
       <em>
        only visible injury at the deadliest massacre ever.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You said yourself, there are 21.5k witnesses here.... and all the CCTV footage, and no video of any shots hitting anyone, or even photos of things which have been shot with automatic fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your asserting that you can see wounds through clothes is a testament to the power of suggestion, a form of mind control which allows credulous people to believe that a monumentally deadly and gory shooting occurred and a few drops of blood in a bizarre video somehow "prove" this.

       You obviously didn't watch the video he just linked and go to about the 9:00 mark. But regardless of any video evidence, a friend of mines sister was killed there that night. Am I supposed to think her and her family are part of some hoax?

       9 minute mark, got it, guy's got "blood" on his right arm. That's supposed to be sufficient to show that a hailstorm of automatic fire was sprayed on an open area in front of thousands of witnesses in the most gruesome shooting the country has ever seen? I don't think so.

       As someone with access to backend hotel data, what I can tell you is that someone put that there were two people in his room. Either the host that made the booking or the front desk agent when he checked in. Adult count defaults to 1, so someone had to at least believe there would be two people.

       Nope and nope. The name on all his reservations is John Smith (typical for high rollers) but you can get back to his real name through the name profile id. There is another field that sometimes captures extra info, and there was a reservation in June with Marilou's name on it. As for the gambling, at least for this weekend he used his own card.

       Wonder if that was the chick people said were saying everyone would die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious from your perspective, I read somewhere yesterday they were scrubbing the databases of his past stays, etc. That sound legit to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if I may, I get he disabled the cameras on the 32, but this is Vegas, not some regular town hotel. Is it even feasible those cameras would go unnoticed, in terms of being offline?

       They haven't scrubbed anything in the database, and I highly doubt they will. For one, the gaming records are regulated by the gaming control board, we're not legally able to modify them. As for the hotel records, I'm sure law enforcement would want to see them, so unless you mean it's LE who wants them scrubbed I don't see it happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the cameras, this is the first I'm hearing he disabled any. I don't work with surveillance or have any access to their footage, but I know we have people monitoring them 24/7, though mostly focused on the casino floor. I'd assume someone would notice if a camera was out in the hotel hallway, but depending on how soon he disabled them before he started shooting there's no guarantee an engineer would have gotten out to check them before it was too late.

       It's unfortunate you don't have any evidence.  One of these days maybe you will, until then anything you say should be considered as, at best, conjecture.  You don't have to convince me or anyone else if you don't want to, but don't expect to be taken seriously by anyone exercising critical thinking.

       Could these muffled shots be part of the shots against the security guard in the hallway? Looking at the synced video it appears that these shots where the taxi is parked occurred 5 minutes after the shooting began. Not sure when he shot the guard.

       Do people think there were two shooters at different locations? Or that there was another person in the room with Stephen possibly taking turns shooting? I'm curious why the sheriff thinks he had help.

       Doing the math he would need to be shooting nonstop with near perfect accuracy to shoot 500 people in under 10 minutes. In the dark at a long distance with multiple reloads. With the door ajar, drunk. There would be thousands of blazing hot shells on the floor. Doesn't strike me as the most logical explanation.

       500 injured doesn't mean 500 shot. I'm sure a good number of people where injured trying to escape (trampled/fell etc). I don't know how many gun casualties there were specifically.

       Still, not saying only one shooter. I did listen to the scanner, but it is feasible the window farther from her would sound different.

       There are 2 sounds in most of these videos. These are easily explained if you google them. First is the sound of the bullet passing the sound barrier(seeing the bullet arrives first) and then you here the sound of the gas leaving the weapon.  If you're fat enough or just right position you won't hear the sound of the billet passing. Just google "sound of being shot at"

       The sharp snapping sounds that are intermittent are the bullets passing close to the person taking the video. The pattern to me indicates him just sweeping back and forth as he's firing into the crowd, the bullets hitting the crowd really close so you can hear the bullets passing and then sweeping to the other side of the crowd and far enough away where you won't hear that sonic crack

       It's unfortunate you don't have any evidence.  One of these days maybe you will, until then anything you say should be considered as, at best, conjecture.  You don't have to convince me or anyone else if you don't want to, but don't expect to be taken seriously by anyone exercising critical thinking.
