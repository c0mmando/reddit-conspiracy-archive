       There hasn't been this much speculation and outrage over an act of violence for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like even "normal" people are starting to realize that something fucky is going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       People died and information is being withheld. But the truth is out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whatever this shooting was about, it was sloppy, and people are noticing the inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this opens people's eyes to the fact that we can be deceived, and have been deceived in the past. That those in power are encarnations of evil. That this would not be the first time they murdered us, staged events, harvested souls, given weapons to enemies they themselves created, and stirred a hive-mind of negative energy in order for them to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that's what it's all about. It's a God damned fight for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these years we've been programmed to need money. Buying things we don't need. Consume garbage instead of producing something sustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       They thrive at the expense of our suffering. Whether it's billionairs that make their fortunes off the sweat of the misguided, or pedophilic cannibals that feed off the blood of the innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever the fuck they are, they need to maintain thier system at whatever the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       They bury the fragile ones with drugs and debt. The ones strong enough to stand are faced with barriers, and once they make it over them all they see is the same fucked up wasteland, except this time they're above it, and they can only go back, or be a part of the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       TEAR DOWN THIS FUCKING WALL and build something greater. Something that will support us instead of divide us. We need to change the way we think, but a lot of us are afraid of of change. We're scared of what we aren't certain about. we're afraid of the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we are beings of light. And once we realize that there is no darkness, but only absence of light... we'll be okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go forth and be the light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaaand that's enough rhetoric for today.

       it starts with money. Try to spend as little as possible, don't give in to the status quo, you don't need that much to live and be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       use everything you save and invest it in yourself. grow whatever food you can, it doesn't have to be a lot. Invest in solar energy, in a few years it will be far more efficient. if you plan on buying a car, buy electric, don't give the oil companies more money. Take your money and use it against them.

       so they did a study about censorship in china, to see what was being censored, and it seemed that the chinese censors would allow the people to complain about almost anything, but as soon as the people started talking about
       <em>
        actually doing something about it
       </em>
       , thats when they get shut down
      </p>
      <p>
       its probably similar in USA
      </p>
      <p>
       of all of the various forms of activism, the one that scares the establishment the most is "direct action"
      </p>
      <p>
       what is "direct action"?
      </p>
      <p>
       lets say there is a village with one well, and the man who owns the well is a tyrant
      </p>
      <p>
       the villagers could sit around and complain about his tyranny,
      </p>
      <p>
       or they could just go dig a new well.
      </p>
      <p>
       most people would rather sit around complaining about the tyranny than doing something about it
      </p>
      <p>
       as they say,
      </p>
      <p>
       stop focusing on tearing down the old, and start focusing on building the new

       I think human nature is all about community. That's what separated us from everything else. Thousands of years ago we settled down, lived off the land, and cultivated it for our families and neighbors. Working together is human nature, not this dog eat dog world we've been trapped inside of.

       The biggest lie we're fed is that human nature is violent and aggressive, that everyone has some 'dark side' or whatever. It's totaly nonsense. Humans are by nature loving, sociable, empathic beings. The vast majority of people just want to live in peace. The vast majority of human beings that kill do so for a pay check, to survive. Whereas think of how many human beings work to help others with no compensation, just out of love.

       We're very hierarchic, which we get from apes. I don't think we're generally empathetic except where it fits into our hierarchy. For example it's ordinary people who commit genocide, and they abandon what Jesus would call empathy in order to do so - but it's only 'outsiders' we're slaughtering so whatever. And then there's ordinary competition: you fight your way up the ladder so your DNA can attract a more viable mate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's interesting for me is how the internet is changing our perception of the hierarchies. For one thing if everyone born in Syria has a smartphone then privileged nationalities - our being born in Europe and America and therefore having better lives for no reason - become impossible to justify using any conventional morality. So we have to give voice to our hierarchic prejudices, heretofore unmentionable, and of course it's not pretty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe self-awareness is born from it though. If we're crushing people for being born poor and we can no longer call them foreign because they have smartphones and are in the same conversations as us, we'll need new stories. Instinctively I don't think we could transition from more honest stories to less honest ones, e.g. the Nazi stuff that's getting popular is surely unstable. We'll probably latch onto all kinds of bullshit in the meantime.

       If some part of the government and/or other powerful entity did it, I doubt they'd fake it. Far easier and more convincing to just shoot at the crowd, and if they are willing to go to these lengths (setting up a shooting) for whatever end goal they had in mind, I doubt they'd be above doing so.

       Sandy Hook was hardly the last one, these kind of shootings became popular in the mid 80's, albeit to a much lesser extent than what its like today. Sandy Hook was just one of the more publicized and post 9/11 ones, not to mention the existence of the internet and the particularly fucked up nature of it.

       I went on Facebook today and it was interesting to see the variety of people talking about it. I saw a group of middle aged women discussing if there was more than 1 shooter. This has people talking and they will have to provide answers or all trust will be lost.

       as more and more people are waking up, its getting harder and harder find people who aren't "woke", and when those "woke" people are moms and dads, aunts and uncles, brother and sisters, co-workers, church-goers, teachers, etc it gets harder for the normies to avoid it.

       The fact that there's any trust still around and wasn't already lost long ago is I think a big part of the problem.  No more trust worthy of being given to the establishment.  At all.

       Let's not use the more than 1 shooter as 1 reason why this is a conspiracy.  Eventually they maybe able to debunk that notion later and it will be an easy attempt to discredit any other conspiracies. I don't believe there was more than 1 shooter but I do believe there is a bigger story here.

       I agree in asking questionS but let's not allow 1 question to be repeated over and over as "the" conspiracy.  Focus on the big questions directly tied to the orchestration.  Proving 1 shooter would may not be that hard considering we know nothing of the evidence they have so far.

       Well there are plenty of people reporting multiple shooters at multiple hotels. There are lots of questions that need to be asked. ZeroHedge had a great article on the big ones yesterday that was on the top of Drudge and here for quite awhile and I know it got a lot of views.

       If there were shooters at multiple hotels we would have seen video of it.  If you go to r/vegas sub you can see locals who worked at some of the locations where these supposed shooting locations occurred saying that they were all on lock down.

       I think we sometimes give the elites too much credit. They have the money and the power but the brains are not the best. Look at Hillarys entire campaign. It was a fucking mess. I'm starting to think the obvious answers to these conspiracies are usually the right ones because they aren't fucking masterminds. I've never seen this many woke people in my life. They are going to strike back hard but we can beat them. Talk to people in person, you would be surprised how many people are already suspicious. Turn off the msm news, the late night talk shows, snl etc. It's all just brainwashing. People believe them because we haven't given them a reason not to.

       But taxes make sense. They're used to war and the "drug war," which is shameful, but I don't want people to get away with not paying for schools and firefighters and highways when I have to.

       schools are not what they seem. schools are there to take the children away from the family and give them over to a state employee. this allows the government to indoctrinate the children with propaganda without much interference from pesky parents, and allows the female to be available to work outside the home, to flood the market with cheap labor as women compete with men for jobs, thus driving down wages. working men have not received a real raise since 1973.

       furthermore, schools fill your mind with drivel like the Bohr model of the atom, the Big Bang model of the universe, that vaccines are safe and effective and that men have walked on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       whats worse is that they mis-instruct the students so thoroughly with programs like "common core" that the students aren't even capable of using their math and science skills as part of their critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       not to pick on you personally, but if you are the typical America, i would hazard to guess that:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) you still believe men walked on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       2) you can't apply math and science to understand why 1 is impossible

       Well, it's worked for them before, and most people are pretty dumb at this point, and I think some very important evidence on the 23rd floor needed to be destroyed, so they rolled the dice. And they got away with it. We'll see if they get away with it again... as Terence McKenna put it, humanity is in a photo finish as to whether we evolve into Aquarius or descend into hellish fascism that'll likely destroy the planet. We shall see.

       They know we know but they cover it up to make it less obvious.  The problem is the division of the people.  They get us focused on Hillary and Trump but the real issue is the Intelligence Community.  The shadow government is the creation of it all and the way to get money from tax payers after fake shit like this happens.  Instead of socialism or some communist government they create fake wars to milk us for money.

       Except, it's actually true. We have entered into the age of Aquarius. The Age of Enlightenment. The "golden" age that Mayans and other ancient civilizations knew would happen.

      <p>
       It's been talked about for a long time because it's been prophesied for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking out into the world only proves this. Everyone's awakening from a deep deep slumber and starting to ask questions and wake up.

       There's more turmoil, strife, anger, as people bring things to the surface we have held down within us collectively for so long.

       I'd say nowhere near.  That 911 wasn't the last straw seems to indicate that almost
       <em>

       will be the last straw, honestly.  Seems there will continue to be people who buy the establishment narrative, unfortunately.

       Does anyone think that TPTB are
       <strong>
        loving
       </strong>
       all of this overwhelming attention to the matter? Watch now something
       <em>
        horrific
       </em>
       is going to come back because of this extra attention, and this event will go down as the "Vegas Incident" of 2017? No matter what happens, it seems it's inevitable that it could be swayed in whatever direction seems necessary for the agenda (if that's what is going on). I'm not saying this just applies here, but it's similar to throwing the "out there" views of conspiracy like flat earth in the limelight to discredit conspiracies as a whole. The whole term conspiracy is a damnation in itself as it was designed and intended to be. A religious person will claim to be religious, but not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       kind of religious.

       Think of the leverage that could pull. "Oh no, that's just silly talk. That's the kind of talk that led to the Vegas Incident".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if i'm wording this right, but it's kind of a scary concept if you're catching my drift. Very akin to the patriot act in ways. Getting people aware to all the fuckery going on, could quite possibly be used against the truth.

       Most people are over it, sick of hearing about it. Everyone went to work this week. Everyone has bills. People are still watching TV, going to movies, restaurants, drinking, playing on their iphone. It was awful. But how long can you sit in front of the TV and cry about it? Life goes on. How much did Orlando change things? Uh none? That was long gone and forgotten within a month for 99.9% of the country.

       Once Black Friday hits, xmas is coming, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who gives a shit. People around this sub have had rock hard boners since it happened, this is their xmas, birthday, new years rolled into one. Footage, interviews, largest mass murder, this is the glory hole. But for 99.9% of the country, their weekend plans havent changed. So uh, no.

       But is this really a false flag? To control the narrative you need a motive. Motives are easy to cook up. The fact there is no motive, letting people creative their own theories, works against the goal of a false flag. This has to be the least scripted mass murder ever. He was a nut job dating back years. Sometimes a crazy person is just a crazy person.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has given a decent theory as to a goal of any deception? Chaos? Destabilize? That works against the goals of the global powers. They want us being happy little sheep enjoying our Starbucks and iPhones. These events cast a light on the problems going on that the powers would rather you ignore.

       So the idea vegas was a false flag is silly.

       The sad truth. And unfortunately, so many pick the later. Often it's rationalized with feeding and protecting "your family".

       Aren't the concept of family just more divisions as well.  Only when the entire human race can say that humans are a giant family, then would there ever be true peace (until the reptilians come)

       The fact that there's any trust still around and wasn't already lost long ago is I think a big part of the problem.  No more trust worthy of being given to the establishment.  At all.

       It's been talked about for a long time because it's been prophesied for a long time.

       Let's not use the more than 1 shooter as 1 reason why this is a conspiracy.  Eventually they maybe able to debunk that notion later and it will be an easy attempt to discredit any other conspiracies. I don't believe there was more than 1 shooter but I do believe there is a bigger story here.
