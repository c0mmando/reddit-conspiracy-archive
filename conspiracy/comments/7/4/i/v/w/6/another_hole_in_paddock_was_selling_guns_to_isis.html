    <div class="md"><p>Then explain the timeline. At 10:05, the gunshots started. At 10:07,  two officers arrived on the floor below Paddock and heard gunfire above them. Gunfire ending at 10:15 PM, and at 10:17 officers arrived on the 32nd floor and a minute later, that Jesus Campo dude said as many as 200 shots were shot out the door and that he was shot in the leg. How would ISIS get out? Did they rappel out of the windows in a helicopter like in a Hollywood action movie? lmao</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about your timeline for a moment-</p>

<p>Why would an unarmed SECURITY GUARD (not police, not FBI, not SWAT, etc) be trying to get into the room of a live shooter? How likely is it to have 200 shots at you and only be hit in a very non vital area? </p>

<p>Your timeline could easily be inferred that the security guard was in on everything, and was the shooter/2nd shooter. He then killed Paddock shot himself, and waited in the hallway.</p>

<p>It makes 0 sense for him to EVER approach the room or that shortly after approaching, the shooting stopped and paddock killed himself. </p>

<p>IMO the only explanation other than the guard being involved is that Paddock took a break from shooting outside, and realized what he did and killed himself. But I find that unlikely. Also why was the door ajar for the security guard, but had to be blown off by SWAT?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes it not realistic? If you take into the account that it&#39;s possible he was a middle man for the FBI or another agency so that they could follow trafficking of weapons and find out where channels are, it makes perfect sense. Also take in that he may have been considering blowing a whistle and somebody uphill got wind of it and threw him to the wolves. </p>

<p>Not to defend him or anything without any evidence, but to say that it&#39;s impossible when there&#39;s no evidence to the contrary is silly. Everything is speculation on our end, including the likelihood of any given outcome or reasoning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some theorists (even prior to the Las Vegas event) have said that the evil portions of the deep state sell &quot;dark weapons&quot; to ISIS.  Dark weapons includes things like depleted uranium and white phosphorus, which could be considered chemicals.  Maybe he was selling these dark weapons as well as guns? I have no idea if the media has named the types of chemicals found in Paddock&#39;s car so I could be wrong.  Just throwing this out there for discussion...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you all seen the photo of Paddocks head and chest?  He was shot above the right eye and one in the chest....he&#39;s either one tough MF shot himself in the chest then decided to head shot himself....OR....this whole FBI gun dealer thing might make sense.  Let&#39;s just say for the sake of argument he was in the FBI as an arms dealer.....ISIS finds out goes to his room and kills him then does the mass shooting....hammer shmammer....ANYONE could have put that there after the fact...he CLEARLY was shot in the chest and the head.....the blood staind also indicate an old stain....and a new stain.</p>
