<p>&quot;11:27pm - The second breach was set off, allowing police access to the second room...&quot; </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever stayed in a conjoined set of rooms, they lock from each side individually. Why would they need to explosive-breach that door?</p>

<p>Are we to believe that mid-shooting, while changing firing locations, he paused to lock himself out of the side room? Why would anyone even think to do that on a normal day, let alone that high adrenaline moment? It just doesn&#39;t track as something anyone working alone would think about.</p>

<p>This timeline fact supports the idea that a second shooter fled into that room, locked the door behind as a diversion and evacced as a guest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sooo to add to what OP said about a possible second shooter fleeing to the second room and locking it, then escaping as a guest from the second room; what if that&#39;s why there was 200 rounds fired down the hallway? He saw he was being double crossed/set up on the cameras and tried to shoot his accomplish but missed? Has anybody actually seen pics of the damage to the halls from the 200 rounds besides a few holes in the door? </p>

<p>Unless i&#39;m thinking incorrectly, that would mean he would have to enter the side room (2nd room), lock the in-between door from the side room, leave through the front door (of the side room), then from the hallway re-enter his main room. if that&#39;s the case, wouldn&#39;t that be pretty clear on the hallway security cameras? do they even have cameras in the hallways?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how do they work? last time i stayed in one, there were 2 doors in the middle, so each room had it&#39;s own door that could lock. so the person staying in Room A could lock his side of the door regardless of what the person staying in Room B did with theirs. So Room A&#39;s door could only be locked/unlocked from Room A, and Room B&#39;s door could only be locked/unlocked from Room B.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct but there is little reason to lock room A and exit into the Hall to room B. If they breach room A then they simply turn the deadbolt. However room B deadbolt is only one sided. I see your point if you are trying for the perception that no one opened that door but security wise, locking it from side A does nothing </p>
