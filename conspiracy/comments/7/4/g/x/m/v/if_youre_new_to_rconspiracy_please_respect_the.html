       Lots of new users here since the shooting and lots of patronising comments towards users who actually want to discuss conspiracy theories around this event. No matter how ludicrous a theory might might seem to you it's not fair to berate other users for expressing a viewpoint that you might not be used to in other subs.

       I’ve been lurking here for like 10 years.  How can you discuss a conspiracy theory without discussing how it differed from the mainstream narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like you’re advocating for people to just be stupid and believe things without any basis or reliable evidence whatsoever.  That’s the difference between a “theory” and “bullshit”.

       He's talking about people constantly pushing the MSM narrative down everyone's throats and muddy the water when people discuss alternative theories. This doesn't allow discussions. It seems that you either missed his point or you're trying to twist his words.

       Sure anyone here could speak for themselves, but you have already showed your ability to discuss by simply dismissing the highest upvoted reply to your comment with a simple: "I disagree, I think you’re the one twisting his words and projecting your beliefs into what he said.". Without any sort of reasoning or comment on WHY you disagree. Why should anyone take the time to "speak for themselves" when we have seen you just simple disagree, don't provide reasoning for disagreeing and then put fourth some sort of self-righteous effort in your next comment that you would like "real feedback".........

       Considering he said something totally different from OP, what other conclusion could I logically draw?  He said something TOTALLY different, so I accused him of projecting his own beliefs into his interpretation of what OP was saying.  I’m not sure what other way you would expect me to justify that.

       I also disagree that a ludicrous theory WITH NO EVIDENCE shouldn’t be berated, along with the person promoting said theory and watering down the quality of this forum.

       OP said that he either gets patronized or berated for posting his wild theories.  As I interpret it (because who else is going to interpret it for me), that covers the full spectrum of possible responses to something posted that is, for all purposes, insane.  It leaves no room for dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect, he wants this to be a “safe space” for all ideas, regardless of how little justification there is for even having the idea in the first place.  I, on the other her hand, feel the total opposite.

       Are you saying people here don't berate other for expressing alternative views? That's what he's bringing to light.

      <p>
       He never said we can't discuss how a theory differs from the MSM narrative. Everyone knows the MSM narrative already. We are here to come up with alternatives theories as only a fucking moron would still buyanything the MSM feeds them.

       So...is it ok to point out the flaws of a proposed theory if it's done in a nice/civil way? The way I'm reading some of the stuff in this thread, it sounds like some folks would like to be able to discuss theories unopposed - which, I get: it's fun and exciting to think up conspiracy theories. If that's the goal of this sub, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, it's not necessarily a given that everyone knows the MSM message on a topic. Even if there's information available from the MSM, that doesn't mean we've all brought ourselves up to speed on it. I think it's especially important to be able to discuss MSM messages here so as to maintain a level of skepticism of that message - particularly when an event continues to evolve (such as the Vegas shooting).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is going to be a safe space for conspiracy theorists then that's cool - I think that's good for those of us who would like to be able to test the merits of a specific theory to know so as to not offend. If, however, this sub and its contributors are able to stomach criticism/skepticism of ideas, I think it's worth discussing how we can do so with tact and civility.
      </p>
      <p>
       (To clarify, I'm not suggesting you hold any specific views on the matter so I hope I don't come across as suggesting you do by asking questions.)

       mostly its the fact that the majority of comments in some threads are simply insulting everyone who believes in a certain theory or they insult the r/conspiracy community as a whole. Their comments don't add to the discussion whatsoever because they don't offer any insight. If you have been here for ten years then I am sure you are familiar with forum sliding and other tactics used to manipulate online discussion.

       I've been here about half as long and I'm familiar with what you're talking about.  I, of course, have a personal bias, but I'm cognizant of it so take these examples with a grain of salt as they stand out in my mind when discussing this..  We've all seen the anti-Clinton spam anytime Trumple Thinskins makes the news and I'm aware that it happens with other subjects, of course.
      </p>

       I definitely agree with you about those here who add nothing to the discussion.  Such as those who, without responding to the article or a single point made by a poster, call people shills, racist etc.

       It was more like that when I first joined this sub. The posts generally didn't have as many comments and most of what people did is share new info that relates to the topic at hand. But, once this place began to become the last refugee of the pizzagaters and every other sub that had been taken over, we saw a massive influx in nonsense and name-calling. People began labeling one another trumptard, snowflake, libtard, etc. And that's when it became obvious that narrative control was going on

       Definitely!  That's the main reason that I've said that this subreddit is a battleground for ideologues.  The election was when I started to see the subreddit's quality decline, but when Pizzagate was the hot topic, discourse started to degrade exponentially.  Please don't take my last statement as a slam against all who espouse the PG conspiracy as there were several rational folks that I talked with.  It did, however, fuel what I view to be one of the cancers to discourse;  Accusing people of shilling without addressing the content of their post.  Critical thinking and the Socratic Method will do more to battle shills than blind accusations, in my opinion.

       Yes, in my opinion this is exactly how things should be done. But frequently this is not done in this manner. Obviously people can be critical of a conspiracy theory, but they should do in a civil and kind manner, realizing there is a human being on the other side of that computer screen.

       Those people who who theories that ar debunkable will eventually get debunked, and respectfully so. But if they aren't given the space to get debunked and people are berated everytime because they don't align with the MSM then it creates more confusion. This is a classic case of mudying the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I would rather hear a theory someone has come up with and try to analyze it rather than re-hearing the MAN. Isn't there other subs to discuss the official narrative? Like every other sub out there but this one? Stop trying to make this sub into something it's not. It's a conspiracy sub for fucks sake. Why do so many snowflakes get their panties up in a bunch when people discuss conspiracy in a fucking conspiracy sub. It's like people getting upset you can only be pro-Trump at T_D. Well duuuuuuh.

       God damn you.  I almost choked on my wrap when I read that.  Also, I've been in your position before, sans fucking yourself, trying to reason with ideologues.  It's fruitless unless you enjoy the rectal ragnarok that is inevitable when they can't make a coherent argument.  Hell, one of them called my use of the Socratic Method "retarded bullshit".  Seriously.

       Because right now the entire world is on a precipice where almost all the normies are on a ledge ready to wake up to how crazy the world actually is and they are incredibly combative because the worldview they want to believe is slowly unraveling in front of us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how when wikileaks emails are brought up people dont even try to refute them they just say non sequitors and tell you to put on your tin foil hat or try to change the subject, because the emails are all 100 percent real and confirmed.
      </p>

       Unlike this russia conspiracy which is the epitome of stretching and actually has less evidence then many conspiracies that have been discussed for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the msm and normies are all eating up a conspiracy theory served up by msm whilst emails are right there to be seen by the public of all manner of fuckery including practicing the occult/spirit cooking.

       This is a perfect example of paranoid behavior.

       You’re doing everything but outright calling me a shill because I make the
       <strong>
        controversial
       </strong>
       statement that the theories discussed in this forum should at least be grounded in reality.thats it.  Just one shred of reality and I’m cool.  Grand claims require grand evidence.  This used to be a great place full of great minds.  Now all the top threads are just pages of retarded shit that is s total waste of time because it’s people just speculating and posting whatever crazy thought pops into their head with no evidence whatsoever to support even thinking that in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe in reptilians?  Cool, there’s at least cave drawings and shit that look like lizard people?
      </p>
      <p>
       But to say something like (hypothetical example they I saw somewhere) “the Las Vegas shooter was dead days before the shooting took place”.  Well there’s currently no evidence whatsoever to support something like that.  So I would consider something like that should be down voted and ridiculed into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone were working to discredit this place, that’s EXACTLY what it would look like.

       I’m sure there is a sub for thought experiments, but this is a great place for that, but I t does seem like hijacking this sub for your own ends, and that’s basically my issue with it.

       I thought the sub was degrading into complete bullshit and changing dramatically, quickly.  Rather than just complain I decided to do my part and participate and try to make this place more like how I want it to be.  I’m not delusional to think I can do it by myself but I hope that there must be others who feel the way I do.

       That’s not what I meant at all mate. If you’ve been lurking here for 10 years I shouldn’t have to explain it. People are being downright rude to regular posters here just for discussing certain theories which might seem outlandish or out of line with their conventional viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we need to analyse what the media are saying and take clues from every breadcrumb they leave us but that doesn’t mean we should take what they say as gospel and repeat it hear like it’s fact and should be believed above any other theory.

       In my own experience, the negativity is often (not always) proportional to the “unverifiability” of the post in question.

       The fact that you felt like you needed to explain any of what you said to me just  shows how little you even understand what is being discussed here.

       You have the whole rest of Reddit to circlejerk the mainstream narrative. This sub is specifically for discussing alternatives- no matter how far out the ideas seem. I'm not sure why it bothers so many people that others may be entertaining theories that are different than the spoonfed version.

       Of course. The official narrative has already proven itself faulty. The MSM version of events deserves serious scrutiny. You are welcome to believe whatever you want and other's have that same right.

       I don’t necessarily believe the guy was the only shooter. My only point is that people need to understand it’s way easier to just kill people than try to fake it. There may even be crisis actors survivors, im only saying that the bodies, the deaths are typically real.

       There are a couple people here that firmly believe LV is a hoax. I disagree, but I don't think that is anymore harmful than the massive number of people that jump through hoops to protect the official version by insulting, attacking and berating any attempt to question the the parts of the story that don't line up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The honest people here throw spaghetti theories against the wall all the time with the intent of getting honest input and gather more info from others. Rarely do I see anyone here that I'm familiar with be unwilling to accept info that pokes a hole in their theory.

       I think it IS harmful to push the idea of an American government that doesn’t kill its citizens to meet an agenda. Maybe they don’t everytime, but the “Hollywood: operation crisis act 14” theories are mostly garbage, and actively stop new seekers of truth.

       I've said this before, there is no official narrative.  It's only been four days and the investigation isn't over.  It's like nobody understands how investigations work.  It's possible they're looking for a second shooter but they don't want to let that person know.

       Why is it
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       for discussing alternatives?  I'm fairly sure it says conspiracy as the name of the sub, not "AlternativeConspiracies".  If there is a conspiracy in the mainstream news, it should absolutely fit within the confines of this sub.  People should be encouraged to discuss the merits of it, the problems inherent in it, and also whether or not there's a conspiracy behind the conspiracy so to speak.  There's also nothing in the sidebar, last I checked, that is limiting the scope of discussion here at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully understand your reasoning behind the statement, I just disagree because I feel this sub should be as welcoming as possible to all people who have a questioning mind.  The No True Scotsman stuff gets used around here, by some and not all, to try and limit discussion and participation.

       If there's a conspiracy being discussed in the MSM, it's still a conspiracy.  We'll likely talk about it here from multiple angles, which may or may not agree with the MSM conclusions, but it should still be fair game.  As far as articles go, your choice is whether or not you consider this to be a news forum at all.  If current articles involving/discussing current conspiracies are acceptable, then all sources of current articles should be welcome.  If you don't want this to be a news forum, then everything should be off-limits.  Either no censorship or total blackout, not some biased censorship where we pick and choose the narratives so people visiting here only get that version of events.  Let's keep it transparent because people here read the comments on an article, so there's plenty of opportunity to educate them on the lies they might be seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'd love a flair system for posts so I could filter out topics I'm just not interested in.  I get your sentiment and I've echoed similar to it before, but I just disagree with the word "specifically".

       Maybe you need to be a little more discerning. You know what I find compelling?  Shells on top of his blood pool that are immaculately clean.  The fact that he left a note and it “isn’t a suicide note” but they won’t tell us what it said.  That he had 20 guns and didn’t use most of them.  If someone said, what if it was an arms deal that went south, I wouldn’t dismiss that, because hey it’s at least remotely supported by something.  Clearly I don’t reject conspiracy theories.  I just have a brain and can’t turn it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there’s no evidence whatsoever then it it just a bullshit, made up story.  I can’t believe that this is controversial.

       the difference is having absolutely no evidence that backs up the conspiracy.

       Exactly this. If you say ‘I think (thing happened)’ that’s one thing, once you start saying ‘I know (thing happened)’ you are essentially saying you have incontrovertible proof (thing happened) and should be held to that standard, otherwise it feel like the old repeat the lie over and over until it becomes true situation.

       If you're new here, chances are you aren't looking at the big picture.  I know crisis actors are real and have been used at other "deadly" events.  If you don't realize that yet then your perspective will be very different.

       So asking you to think critically about a theory isn't productive?  If you just want to make up stories and LARP, I'm sure r/fiction would love some new material.

       or, maybe by definition, a theory is not necessarily going to be provable.  It is, after all, a theory.  it is not, by definition, a fact...which of course
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       provable.  Those folks who come in and demand proof of this or that tend to do so knowing that proof is not available.

       Actually, a theory must be provable by definition, or it isn't a theory.

       Being unproven and being unprovable are very very different.

      <p>
       Once it is proven, it becomes a fact...no longer a theory.  Let's have a look at the definition of a theory:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a
        <strong>
         proposed
        </strong>
        explanation whose status
        <strong>
         is still conjectural and subject to experimentation
        </strong>
        , in contrast to well-established propositions that are regarded as reporting matters of actual fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being unproven and being unprovable are very very different.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While they may be different, it is irrelevant to the definition of a theory.

       Completely disagree.  All things that are unprovable are unproven.  Not all things that are unproven are unprovable.  So it is very much relevant.  If something. Is objectively unprovable, it isn’t worth discussing

       Right, once it becomes PROVEN it is a fact. It can't become proven without being provable.

       I believe he asked what gave you the right to be the arbitor of truth and what others choose to discuss, you chose to reply with vitriol instead of continuing with the debate with a response that actually required more than a kneejerk reaction to write. Anyone can blatantly question the others intelligence without providing anything else to the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we only spoke about what is proven, we'd be 60 minutes tv show instead of an internet messaging board. It didn't seem like he was arguing the definition of provable, he asked what made you feel the righteous indignation to dictate what is provable in all aspects of conspiracy (especially involving government cover-ups, so he asked what gave you the knowledge and authority over it), which you got flustered and called him an idiot for not curtailing to your words, which I'm assuming you believe are rock solid truth nuggets in a world filled with falsehoods.

       You're putting words in my mouth like he was. I never said we should only talk about what's proven, that would defeat the entire purpose of discussing conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claimed that a theory did not need to be provable. That's just flat out incorrect, and it has nothing to do with mine or yours or his idea of truth. Provable just means that, hypothetically, something would be able to be proven. It doesn't mean we did prove it, or that it's likely to be proven, or that it's not really fucking difficult to prove. It just means that it CAN somehow be proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he didn't mean provable in the literal sense, then that's his poor choice of words, not mine.

       You called him an idiot and reacted, I pointed out that the behavior is what OP is discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't claim that, he asked what made you the authority over what is provable and worth discussing when you cannot prove or disprove a theory involving a government conspiracy, you can speculate, use media, have an eyewitness report but it's very difficult to unequivocally prove or disprove a conspiracy based on the available information since it will be disputed all the way until it is proven (like all major conspiracies). That's just the nature of conspiracy theories
      </p>
      <p>
       Your position is soley on what is provable, but have you ever actually tried to find proof in favor of a conspiracy theory or just to devalue it based on your preconceived notions of what you can personally prove based on your position?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry you have difficulty discussing a subject without using insults to belittle others to prove your point, but it isn't my fault you've managed to encapsulate exactly what OP was discussing in one of the top comment chains.

       Provable has nothing to do with someone being able to PERSONALLY prove it. A government conspiracy is certainly provable, no matter how unlikely it is. It CAN be proven, even if it won't ever be. Disputing it is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: a theory that bigfoot exists is provable. If bigfoot exists, it is possible to capture it or capture overwhelming evidence of its existence and use it to show people that it exists. Nobody has ever done that, so most people assume it doesn't exist. Even if it does exist, it's quite possible that nobody will ever be able to prove its existence. But, if someone were to find strong evidence in favor of the existence of bigfoot, they could formulate a theory about its existence that is provable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opposite example: the existence of god is not provable. You can believe in god or believe that god doesn't exist, and one will be correct and one will be incorrect, but you can never prove or disprove it. If someone were to base their theory around divine intervention, it would be a waste of time to discuss it, because it is inherently not something that could ever be proven or disproven. Therefore, it is not a theory, it is simply a belief.

       You've still avoided skating the original question over why you feel it necessary to continue discussing what is provable when Google had done it for you ages ago, and why you're taking this stance when questioned why you were belittling and calling the user an idiot. The act of taking this stand as the end all be all to the discussion is completely opposite to users attempting to work through conspiracies with the rest of the class.

       Are you trying to make a statement over the difference between faith and what is proven or provable?
      </p>
      <p>
       It reads as if you're making the assumption that his theories would be belief since he had no proof, which doesn't mean that it can't be provable or worth discussing in an attempt to find proof. Which you called him an idiot for suggesting and questioning that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we've wrapped ourselves in this dumbass defensive loop, notice how you completely avoid what the crux of our issue to only discuss the definition of proof over the issues raised by OP.

       The crux of the issue was that he said a theory doesn't have to be provable. When I corrected him and he doubled down and got defensive and snide, I called him an idiot. I don't know what else you want me to tell you.
      </p>

       I wasn't arguing about any specific conspiracies, I was responding to one person being incorrect about the definition of a word.

       Conspiracy will be unprovable until it is proven, and history has shown time and time again that behavior like yours there is a detriment to actually discussing theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       People used to believe microchipping and government mind control experiments were hokey science fiction that is not provable until it slaps us in the face. So in essence I can see each of your points and his, but I don't see how this helps us in the act of actually trying to crack conspiracies.

       No, it is by your metric is it not? How am I misreading what you've said. You've brought up 'belief' in conspiracy as what you viewed the previous user as having compared to your view on holding fast to the proven and sticking solely in that realm and never questioning outside of it.

       So Bigfoot is not proven to exist, so it is unprovable until it is proven, if ever.

       Yes, and a theory is based on the available evidence.  So when a theory can instantly crumble by examining the known evidence, it can be considered false, right?
      </p>

       So when people say "multiple shooters!  There's a light on the 4th floor!" and it's pointed out that the light is flashing before and after, it should he discarded until other evidence can support it.

       Available evidence is the key.  Very often the evidence required to actually prove a theory is not available, especially when we are talking about an unaccountable government which lies as a matter of convenience, and uses a compartmentalized classification system in order to mitigate the damage of information getting exposed to public scrutiny.  I mean heck, the land of the free has secret laws, secret courts and secret interpretations.  The truth may be out there, but it is very difficult to prove given our shared reality.

       People act like disproving one aspect of a conspiracy theory completely devalues a user's entire theory and post. Then the dog pile starts, the wells are poisoned, and then we will never discuss it again and any actually discrepancies within the official narrative will be discredited because conspiracy theorists we're wrong once (kinda like Reddit and the Boston bombing fiasco, a select group fucking up caused the entirety of the investigative movement to eat shit and die).

       The two of you are talking about different things. What you describe is obviously problematic while what
       <a href="/u/PantsMcGillicuddy">

      <p>
       If someone shits on your theory by calling you stupid for believing it, then yeah, they're not good for this place and should be called out for it. If they shit on your theory politely using logically sound arguments, then you have a chance to reevaluate your thinking, adapt it where it was flawed, or provide a counter-argument when you think the critic was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strobe light on the 4th floor of the Mandalay is a good case in point. If it weren't for a bunch of people providing arguments for why that light couldn't have been muzzle flashes, we'd be stuck trying to rationalize how they managed to replace a window in a crime scene so quickly.

       It's actually easy if you approach it without being short or dismissive with others.

       Surprisingly it is all about tone here, most people realize that they are sharing a fringe idea and when they are met with anger or belittlement they'll get defensive and kickstart the backfire effect.

       The same could be said of a lot of people who put down the positive criticism. If you say you don't agree with some bat shit theory you get called a shill. Just because a bunch of turds on 4chan made something up doesn't mean it's worthwhile to repeat it a million times here.

       My recommendation would be to attempt as best as you can to frame your question in a form that cannot be interpreted as an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying "Do you have a source for that?" alone can very easily be interpreted as an attack by many people, even though it's a perfectly valid question. In my experience, this is because it is more often an opener from someone hell bent on debunking what you have to say rather than a show of genuine interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something as simple as "Fascinating. Do you have a source? I'd like verify for myself and maybe dig a little deeper." can make a world of difference in terms of the sort of response you get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, you're right, a lot of people that come here are depressive, irritable people, and it doesn't take much to give them an excuse to get snappy. Source: myself

       These are exactly the kind of comments that are unproductive, yes. You didn't do anything with this comment, except ask a smug question that has an obvious answer. People come to this sub to think and talk critically about these subjects, but the point he was making is that when people just come in here to say no to everything, that isn't really contributing to the discussion. It's just saying no that's unbelievable so you're wrong, in a sub meant to discuss exactly those kinds of topics.

       There have been so many people recently who come here with the view that the maisntream media narrative is the truth, and that because the media said it, that automatically gives it one million credibility points, even if what the media is saying has no evidence. For example, the one shooter or multiple shooters theory. Mainstream says one shooter, despite the footage, the many eye witness and victim accounts of multiple shooters and the scanner audio from when it was happening with police saying there were multiple shooters. For some reason this sub is now full of people who think that because the media said there's one shooter, all that evidence is nothing compared to the zero evidence and simple outright statement of a narrative by the media. Same people then spend ages trying to condescendingly tell people who are thinking about different possibilities that they are mentally ill and require a psychiatrist. It's people like that who are totally annoying, disrespectful and bringing down the quality of the sub. Critical thinking and questions and suggestions and pointing out holes in a theory is good, but that only comes from people who are actually engaging and taking it seriously, not the people who are still completely wrapped up in the mainstream lie.

       I haven't seen people here saying  "there was only one shooter because the media says so" but I
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       seen them point out that the footage (audio or video) doesn't definitively show multiple shooters, and we know from past events that police and witnesses
       <em>
        often
       </em>
       get confused about how many shooters there are, and in hindsight, there's very little physical evidence that supports the theory of multiple shooters, i.e. bullet holes or casings in places where they couldn't physically be, other video, ballistic, or audio evidence that is impossible to explain without multiple shooters, etc. Could there have been multiple shooters? Sure, but a reasonable evaluation of the available information combined with what we know about the relability of eyewitness statements makes the single shooter theory more plausible. Occam's razor and all that. It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       possible for the official narrative to be correct , and to dismiss that possiblity is just as close-minded as to say that the official narrative is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       correct.

       I'm not saying we shouldn't think critically and not ask questions about theories, but just because someone can't answer a question doesn't disprove the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, we're talking massive conspiracies carried out by powerful people with lots of money most of the time. If they didn't cover their tracks well, then it wouldn't be a conspiracy theory. It can take time to find proof.

       Some of the "evidence" of theories are so ridiculous they need to be called out. I had someone on here convinced the shooting was directly targeted at Trump because he shot into a country music concert and "white people that listen to country music support Trump".

       I can appreciate a healthy dose of doubt on topics. But way too often people connect from A to V and think it makes perfect sense.

       that's because you wouldn't believe the truth, regardless. trying to point out how people are wrong about some theories, like the 4th floor shooter is definitely productive because it's clearly wrong.

       it sounds like you would rather the conspiracies run amok and all of them conflict instead of actually trying to make sense of this shit.

       Well the funny thing about conspiracies is depending on what you believe, you're going to seem like a contrarian asshole or a "shill" to the other side. So when anything flat earth gets posted here, you'll see a sea of comments calling OP an idiot. When anything gets posted here about Trump, you'll get a sea of comments defending him and calling the news fake. There's a political battle going on here. We'd like to think the majority of people are here to learn and discuss theories with an open mind. But that is the furthest thing from the truth.

       It is one thing to disagree.  It is something entirely different to mock, denigrate, and hold up any official explanation as gospel, especially considering how often the official explanation is found to be flawed at best.

       I have literally been high enough in the air with the right perspective where I could actually see the curve of the earth, so to me there is no debate.  Guess what, I will never go into a post on flat earth theory because it doesn't interest me, and I have no need or want to ruin someone elses' discussion, in spite of my very strong beliefs on the subject.

        Guess what, I will never go into a post on flat earth theory because it doesn't interest me, and I have no need or want to ruin someone elses' discussion, in spite of my very strong beliefs on the subject.

      <p>
       But what happens when you see flat earth level nonsense on something you are interested in? 80% of the stuff from the Vegas shooter in the first 2 days was derived from personal feeling or shit posted by infowars or 4chan. "Alex Jones said a false flag was happening this week!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be able to call out shit that can only come from a paranoid maniacs fever dream.

       So what is how I respond to that?  Why do you care what others are discussing.  What is it to you?  Some people post opinions and try to engage in discussion.  Others try to sway opinions one way or the other.

       You are free to call things out, but we ask you do so in a constructive manner.  You will always catch more flies with honey than vinegar, so if you goal is to win a convert, then be mindful of that fact.  Suggesting someone is a paranoid maniac because they are entertaining a thought you happen to find absurd is kind of what we are talking about.

       The "far flung theory" was pretty ubiquitous on this sub. Especially then all I advocated was waiting till we know more details. But yes my patience will wear thin when it's a constant barrage of "MSM shill" while I'm just trying to say your false flag theory is unsubstantiated.

       Maybe there needs to be less criticism of the doubters and more criticism of the fanaticism displayed by the theorists.

       So wait.  Feel free.  Others have a right to engage now.  Trying to tell others how to exercise their right to free speech is pretty much an on starter for all but the authoritarians among us.

       I have no problem with doubters.  Doubters are an essential element to testing a particular theory.  However, when those doubters engage in JTRIG tactics then they become something else imho, something we can definitely do without.

       No kidding. I entertain conspiracies casually, mostly in the pursuit of knowing all the facts about things that interest me, or trying to make sense of something that shocks or hurts me. I understand that conspiracies are theories, but a theory and misinformation are two different things. If you are going to take the time to present your theories, at least do some fucking research so you don't look like a total asshole. Even I have found the time to read all new updates, watch videos of the shooting, listen to the police scanner recording before I came in here to discuss. If you want to be taken seriously, do better dammit.

       Also, people here have a really bad habit of presenting their theories as inevitable fact. I'd have a lot more respect for people with the intellectual honesty to phrase their theories as "What if &lt;x&gt;" instead of "The MSM lies, &lt;x&gt; is definitely what's going on", but you never see that.

       You seem to be confused at what
       <strong>
        theory
       </strong>
       means yourself. It doesn't simply mean "whatever you think may have happened based on nothing". It means an idea put forward to explain something that is based on independent verifiable data points. If it is criticized and fails to stand on it's own it's not a good theory, or is a disproven one until new evidence can support it.

       The definition of the word varies depending on the context in which it's being used. It's almost as if words have multiple meanings! But even if that weren't the case, Google defines theory as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It says nothing of basing it on verifiable data points. It says it tends to be based on general principals. A lot of these conspiracy theories are based on general principles that we as members of society are accustomed to and aware of. Such as greed, lying, and the power of money.

       No need to be semantic. It’s pretty implied, especially when

       Colloquially, obviously. I shouldn’t even have to specify. Scientific theories follow completely different processes and guidelines, much like everything else in the science community.

       You don't have to entertain it, you could ignore it or debate it. I think OP is just saying don't be a dick to others who are in the midst of a discussion just so you can 'smell your own farts' as it was put earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can taste righteous indignation when they are arguing for the mainstream narrative of events against a group of conspiracy theorist and not realize how ridiculous that crusade is. It's a whole lot easier to speak out of one's ass through a position of comfort, and comfort in knowing the 'true' facts as they've been presented is what anti-conspiracy theorists waft endlessly as concrete fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your position is rock solid concrete, then what purpose is coming into a conspiracy subreddit to cause drama unless you believe that conspiracy theories are so ignorant that they must be trolled and punished for their childish behavior so that they'll learn to not question the status quo and become happy meme sharing, social media using, time wasting members of society stepping out of the way to allow the elites to run things, because why bother when I have my new iPhone X with facial recognition emojis and tinder.

       Depends what you mean by "right", of course. Do they have the right to do it without being arrested by the government? Of course. Do they have the right to do it without criticism, the right to a safe space to engage in said games without anyone interrupting, complaining, or calling out their lack of justification? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is pretty explicitly advocating for the latter "right", which is not a right at all. Equivocating on the meaning of the word "right" by interpreting it the former way doesn't really address the question in its proper context.

       There's debating and then there is smattering your "hoax" theory all over every thread without evidence outside of "it's fake blood". The latter just seems like forum sliding or gaslighting because they know people will blow it up and that sidelines the actual thread.

       Can you send me the link to people harassing the parents of those victims? I must've missed that. That's pretty fucked up.

       Regardless, what does that have to do with this? I never claimed making death threats = entertaining a theory. I'm talking about making a post on a subreddit sharing an idea, not harassing grieving parents.

       You assume you know the truth, eh? I was on the fence until I watched the performances in full they showed on the news. God the acting is bad. Cheif medical examiner "uhhhhh I don't know" for fifteen minutes. Pre rehearsed grief stories. Shit is suspicious. Am I going to start calling supposed parents? No, not necessary and too risky just in case I am wrong.

       Right!  That was the most ridiculous news conference I've ever seen.  If anybody watched that and believed that guy, I have some beachfront property in Arizona to sell them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That shady-as-hell medical examiner actually claimed at a press conference the next day that he made the decision to not allow any paramedics into the school and instead declare all the kids dead within 9 minutes, leaving all the bodies in pools of their own blood, bleeding out onto the floor and stiffening up with rigor mortis all morning, afternoon, and night so that his team could sneak them out under the cover of darkness into secret vehicles when nobody was looking at midnight. Give me a break. Paramedics would have rushed all those bodies right out onto the empty color-coordinated triage mats (they had one for deceased bodies too, ya know) and into vans and medical helicopters to rush them to the hospital--dead OR alive. That's how we handle mass shootings. Some joker doesn't get to refuse to let in paramedics. They didn't even let any parents in to see the kids and the parents (crisis actors) were perfectly cool with that. Riiiiiiiight.

       You mean those "grieving parents" who were gleefully laughing in national interviews the day after their children were supposedly slaughtered in the most heinous, scary way possible?  Yeah, those are actors.

       Nobody saw any dead or dying children come out of that school and it was surrounded by news crews that were broadcasting live. That shady-as-hell medical examiner actually claimed at a press conference the next day that he made the decision to not allow any paramedics into the school and instead declare all the kids dead within 9 minutes, leaving all the bodies in pools of their own blood, bleeding out onto the floor and stiffening up with rigor mortis all morning, afternoon, and night so that his team could sneak them out under the cover of darkness into secret vehicles when nobody was looking at midnight.

       I watched the videos of the aftermath of Vegas.  They were rushing around with the people who were just shot, loading them into ambulances and the backs of pickup trucks as fast as they could.  There wasn't a single dead or dying person that came out of that building.  The paramedics weren't even ALLOWED inside.  The parents were never allowed to see their children and every one o of them were okay with that.  You couldn't find one parent in a thousand that wouldn't demand to see their child, even if they were dead or shot up, yet every single one of these crisis actors were fine with it.  The "parents" got their houses for free years earlier, too.

       Vegas was an open air situation with thousands of bystanders but once the scene was secured, obviously dead bodies were left in situ. AMR staff technically broke the rules by even attempting to get to patients when there was still an active shooter threat. In Sandy Hook, most of the wounded were walking wounded and evacuated by police, the seriously injured were quickly taken out by police with medical training and delivered to the paramedics. There was zero reason to let non LEO go into the building when they didn't know if it was secure and by the time it was secure, the wounded were already evacuated and as I pointed out, there is no point in moving dead bodies and disrupting a crime scene.

       You are proof that the one of the most awful straits a person can have is confident ignorance. I live in CT. So what you're suggesting is that "actors" moved to CT years before the incident, bought homes, pretended to have children, who were also "actors", then faked a tragic event and stayed in character to continue living and working in town. The school is in on it, the school board, the town, the outlying towns, neighbors,  friends, all in on a conspiracy to do what? Take away our guns that were never taken away? This is the reason that when you people have something to add to a conversation, by default we all assume its bullshit.

       The problem is that in some proven instances it isn't ridiculous to believe that nobody died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard the "babies in incubators" story from the First Gulf War.  The story was that Iraqis took Kuwaiti babies out of incubators and threw them on the ground killing them.  This was used as justification for the war.  The problem is that no babies were killed.  It was an entirely fabricated story.  It even included a female actor testifying before congress and fake crying.

       I suppose it's certainly possible. Though it seems more likely that Sandy Hook was a false flag carried out through MK Ultra rather than a hoax that never occurred. But we can't really know for sure.

       I post that video pretty often it seems like people rarely watch it.

       I don't know man.  I think the "parents" are actors.  Again, this isn't an outrageous claim.  It has been proven to occur before.  Have you watched the parent interviews critically?  If not, do so.

       Also, some of the details on Lanza make zero sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, he wouldn't touch door knobs because they were metal, he was so intolerant of noises that he couldn't even bare the sound of his mom walking on the floor in heels, and he was so uncoordinated that he couldn't tie his own shoes.

       Yet we are too believe this same kid would gun to the gun range, and ultimately get the highest kill-to-injury ration in the history of mass killings?  That

       I agree we can't know for sure.  The question is how reasonable is it to doubt?

       We must remember that conspiracy theorists are people, and some of those people are trolls, and some of those so-called conspiracy theories are counterintelligence to make other conspiracy theories look crazy. It's the reason the term conspiracy theorist was invented.

       We only know that he shot the computer tower. Whether or not he got the hard drive is unanswerable, but no doubt that would have been destroyed later if it wasn't shot.

       How do we go from "sending a bullet into a computer tower" to "ruining the hard drive"? How do we know where the bullet hit? If it did destroy a hard drive, why is this a piece of the puzzle proving that JA and friends molest children?

       I didn't say that. In fact I corrected the guy in another comment saying that we don't know that it hit the hard drive, only the tower itself. And sure it's not the easiest way to destroy evidence, but it's an efficient way to get the public to associate "pizzagate" with "crazy man shoots up family restaurant" if you're in cahoots with media, like JA is. If they've got something to hide then they're probably gonna put in effort to making sure the narrative is in their favour with the resources they have at their disposal.

       Ah, I didn't notice that you're not the same person I originally responded to. The widely believed story is that this guy burst in, fired one shot through a door in order to destroy the hard drive in a desktop PC.

       Shot a hard drive, then was released, not put on trial, and went quietly into the night.  Enough to point the blame at pizzagate and shut discussion &amp; discovery down.   One guy, an actor, one shot, no repercussions.  Come on now.

       The people there didn’t know he wasn’t about to start the next mass killing.  They were probably all terrified.  It’s pretty irresponsible to minimize the seriousness of what he did.

       The actor who shot Comet's computer tower (on the one single day that the traffic camera that faced the restaurant from outside had been removed) was not a genuine pizzagate researcher, but more likely a fall guy to help discredit the movement.

       I realize you're being sarcastic but if I were someone who was personally touched by this event, I'd be desperate for any information on the
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       of it all, and gravitate towards places where people are talking about and right now, this subreddit is probably one of the more active places for discussion about the shooting on Reddit. Hell, I'm on the other side of the country and I'm here because I want to know the why. I would not say it's safe to assume that there are no friends or family members reading these posts.

       It's a ridiculous argument that's supposed to make you feel bad. Been hearing it for years. So many Americans take the questioning of the narrative as a personal attack on themselves, as if even the craziest of us who do stupid shit make a difference towards what we're discussing. Ignorance under the guise of patriotism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world, everybody would be discussing these things regardless of their merit. Everyone. The atrocities of governments long before the 20th century alone should be enough to ingrain that doubt in us. Too much has been proven, admitted to, and apologized for to not question everything. There are idiots on both sides - that's a people thing, not a theorist/skeptic thing.

       Look man, i am sickened by what happened. I hate violence, just thought of one innocent life being lost is terrible, but over 60? That actually causes me pain.

       I also love guns and markmanship, and this tragedy has actually made me start to doubt whether our gun laws are okay. This whole thing has really shaken me.

       I say all of this so that you have some perspective when i say that anybody can talk about any conspiracy they want here. I dont know what it is like to lose a child, but today marks the 10 year anniversary of losing my dad, so i understand how it can be a touchy subject.

       People died. I know it. You know it, but some are convinced there were no deaths. Its a dumb theory and there is very little backing it up, but this is the place to discuss it because above everything else we try to look at things objectively and question everything here without letting our emotions cloud judgement. Im sorry for anyone who is hurt by ignorant people who immediately claim nobody died, but we will more than likely set them straight pretty quickly, and if we cant then that would mean there is more to look at concerning that theory.

       People certainly have the right to pose whatever theories they may have to this community, and the community has a right to weigh the evidence/possibilities, and react in whatever manner seems appropriate to them...whether it's laughing at the ridiculousness of the theory or giving serious criticism and offering other possible theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one should be 100% certain that they know the truth behind any of the shit we see here. And no one should believe their own bullshit or the bullshit of others. Always keep in mind the possibility that you might be wrong about everything, and be open to other perspectives. The main issue I see here is dogmatism/100% certitude towards theories. It's often helpful to entertain a number of possibilities, but don't become one of those people who is CERTAIN that 9/11 was an inside job or Sandy Hook was a hoax, etc.

       Hehe, exactly! I was hoping someone would say something like that. Even when there's those things that seem fundamental to reality, outliers always exist. Reality is a matter of perspective, and absolutes only exist within given times and places. Nothing is really absolute. We can generalise though so there's that.

       The point is that some people claim to "know" things which obviously is not justified true belief (the gold standard of knowledge).
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, you will often hear people claiming to know something because they were told it by media.  That is not knowledge.  They don't "know" that.  They think they do, but they don't.

       Planes were not what destroyed the World Trade Center. Period. It is impossible for a skyscraper to turn itself into powder and scrap metal in a matter of seconds. There is an enormous amount of energy missing from that equation. Believing that planes were what destroyed the World Trade Center is like denying that humans evolved from other life forms: you have no coherent alternative theory and you have to ignore literally all of the evidence.
      </p>

       You can be certain that planes were not what destroyed the World Trade Center. It's a fact.

       It all depends on how much evidence there is.  It is fine to be certain of something if there is evidence to support your conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is when people claim to be certain in the absence of evidence.  In those instances speculating on possibilities is perfectly reasonable - certainty is not.

       I don't know if you've travelled or experienced war.  What we saw in Las Vegas is a single instance of something that becomes a fact of daily life in a war zone.  59 civilians die in a "single airstrike" in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, man, this shook me too.  For about 3 minutes.  Then I remembered traveling to places like Sarajevo where machine gun fire still traces across the fronts of office and apartment buildings.  Where artillery holes adorn skyscrapers.  The little flower-like scoured-out patterns in sidewalks they call "Sarajevo Roses" that mark grenade explosions.  That world is what our arms hold at bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are one of the oldest governments on the planet.  We survived a civil war.  These feats are due to the fact that
       <em>
        we hold our government fucking accountable!
       </em>
       They answer to
       <em>
        We The People
       </em>
       and if they ever refuse, they'll answer to a bullet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our right to self defense is how we stop another Holocaust.  How we stop a Holodomir.  59 people dead is a bloody nightmare.  How about 59 million dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet we live in a society in process of collapse.  Warlords will multiple.  Violence will metastasize.  If guns are not available, it will be bombs or poison or bacteria or any number of other ways to slaughter innocents.  So prepare yourself for what comes next.  And for God's sake, don't give up your guns, else you're just meat for someone else's fire.

       People should be careful, someone yesterday posted that one girl who was interviewed was also on doctor Phil. Shortly after one person came up with her full name, and another her Twitter. Then someone tweeted to her saying Reddit said she's a paid actor, is it true?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that posts accusing individuals without evidence of any kind doesn't NEED to be discussed, and shouldn't be posted, especially since it will likely lead to doxxing, like yesterdays post.

       How do you investigate whether someone is a paid actor? How do you do it
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       doxxing them? To me, it seems like the inevitable result. There's really nothing to talk about, if you don't know who they are and can't prove it.

       I don't think I would consider it doxxing to post someone's Twitter account that's been on a TV show using their real name. It would be different if they had their identity on the show or if someone posted their phone or address.

       The fact that you've misconstrued what I've inferred about the previous poster's argument to be what I actually believe is no excuse to be rude.  Had you asked, I would have explained that I did so in order to point out the ridiculousness of the stance that constructive conversations should be stifled in any way.  No form of meaningful discussion should ever be discouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, do you think your general approach (as represented by your previous response) is conducive to an environment where everyone feels safe expressing their opinions?  You were fine up until your last "point," whereby you do exactly what you profess to be against-- discourage the discussion of a belief that someone else (namely, you
       <strong>
        and I
       </strong>
       ) find wrong or offensive.  In a word, don't be an asshole.

       Not saying you're wrong, but do you have examples of nutters accosting victims families? I kinda assumed it would be a thing, but never really heard any first hand accounts of it and always wondered if any sandyhook families have come forward about it. (I assume you meant sandyhook with the kids comment...) but also, I would assume neighbors and stuff would also get questioned/bothered, and then I would think there would be videos out of people validating the victims existence.... genuinely curious though.

       Yes. I've never understood this argument. People are in control of their own actions, and therefore are responsible for them. The idea that someone else's words can cause you to act a certain way is idiotic. Even the concept of fighting words, if you throw the first punch: it's your fault.

       It is even 1% possible for you to conceive that someone whose young child went to school and never came home because they were murdered might have some emotional reactions that seem bizarre or difficult to understand? Have you ever heard of a laugh full of sick desperation.  Have you even for 1 second entertained the possibility?  Have you studied any psychology to see if that’s the case?

       I have seen more videos of parents giving interviews after losing their child than any human being should ever see--because I grew with sensationalism "news." I'm old enough to have been around a number of parents who have recently lost their children.  I've seen what it does to people.  It takes every bit of joy out of their face and body.  The one thing all those Sandy Hook parents had in common was they all were laughing joyfully during interviews, may of them literally the very next day after their child was supposedly murdered in the scariest, most heinous way.  If that were normal, I wouldn't have said anything about it, but I happen to know it isn't normal because I've seen grieving parents hundreds of times.  Besides that, nobody saw any dead or dying children. In fact there were only a small handful of children (1 classroom's worth at the most) ever to be seen anywhere near that place that day.  I was watching live along with everyone else. Sandy Hook was a Hoax.

       People died?  Oh?  At Sandy Hook?  Did you see any bodies?  Because I was watching all day long as news crews surrounded the building and broadcast live.  Not a single dead or dying child came out of that building.  In fact, there were only a handful of children to be seen anywhere.   I watched a medical examiner tell us the day afterwards that he made the decision to not allow any paramedics into the school and instead declare all the kids dead within 9 minutes, leaving all the bodies in pools of their own blood, bleeding out onto the floor and stiffening up with rigor mortis all morning, afternoon, and night so that his team could sneak them out under the cover of darkness into secret vehicles when nobody was looking at midnight. Give me a break. Paramedics would have rushed all those bodies right out onto the empty color-coordinated triage mats (they had one for deceased bodies too, ya know) and into vans and medical helicopters to rush them to the hospital--dead OR alive.

       You can provide evidence which supports your theory.  You can tell from the context of his reply that he is misusing the term proof when he means evidence.  A common mistake.  You think you’re being superior intellectually but in reality you’re jsut being pedantic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us are arguing that you have a responsibility to assess the value/credibility of the information you use to formulate an opinion about something.  If you disagree with that then I don’t know what to tell you.

       I would agree with you, however it is not uncommon for people/tourists around here to respond to evidence-supported educated hypotheses with condescending requests for "proof".
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence my answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience the probability of this happening is proportional to two dependent variables: 1) the validity of the evidence and 2) the "identity parameter" it entails. This is explained by cognitive dissonance, as
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71qi7q/what_i_learned_from_trolling_rtopmindsofreddit/dndc84b/">

       Right, because people who think they see the "truth" that sheeple can't are never smug. They are clearly more humble than people who disagree with them.

       This. The whole point of conspiracies is not to further develop an ideology, it's to find TRUTH. If you are strictly interested in running a nonstop counternarrative, you're just as much a sheep as the people who take

       I have to ask what exactly you mean by quibbling and mocking.

       Mocking should be clear, but I think a bealthy discussion can't be bad. As long as the guy that doesn't agree doesn't try to take a position of absolute rightness.

       I think this particular shooting is so over the top and clearly so many elements that scream conspiracy that normies half believe the conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They however are experiencing dramatic cognitive dissonance so they smugly talk smack because at this point they are trying to convince themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last couple years have basically confirmed the basics or conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The normies want to believe in their fantasyland where the government hasn't been for years a globalist regime hellbent on world domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       They keep the illusion alive by pretending they always thought it was obvious when a conspiracy theory comes true.

       For the most part I try exactly this. I also, when I post my own theory, say something like “I could be way off but...” and then say it. Still get some backlash for it tho.

       I will also admit, I have been a subscriber here for a few weeks now. Just never really been too much into some of the stuff I see or had anything worth personal concern over (like my beliefs of other theories, etc), so there was really no point for me to be here and comment.

       Except when the theory is retarded and makes the community look bad.  That's a real conspiracy - one to inject fake conspiracy theories to make the ones with some truth to them look bad.

       . Conspiracies based on real circumstantial evidence and plausible motives are all over the place. Conspiracies with no evidence you though of in the bathroom about Obama being a vampire... sure post them I don't care. But people still need to be able to ask whether there's any objective basis to the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussing a theory is not just about fellating the author. Frankly a lot of the people complaining about brigading are whining that not enough people support their Obama Vampire Theory.

       You still don't seem to be understanding how the English language works. Words convey meaning. Sometimes you use them to convey meaning beyond their literal meaning. So you use figurative speech, hyperbole, metaphors, or allegories etc.  Doing so and trying to pass off such a statement as literally true would be lying. Doing so in a manner designed to make clear the figurative meaning, such as if someone said something sarcastically but with a tone that conveys sarcasm, is just called speaking in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you miss that I was speaking figuratively or not? Because if you did miss it then that's a whole different barrel of fish. And if you didn't miss my actual meaning, which seems more likely, asking for a literal Obama Vampire Theory post would be a deliberately combative and misleading way to try to frame a response I think. One in line with your choice to immediately devolve into vitriol and name calling.

       In any event, the topic calls for tolerance of conspiracies and understanding of what this sub is about. I was trying to state my opinion that I agree, but supporting respectful questioning of a theory, or disagreement, must also be encouraged. Disagreement and requests for sources on topics is part of the process of fact finding. It is contributing to the search for knowledge and how bad information is winnowed out. If people don't support that process and instead call downvoting or questioning a theory brigading/disrespect  then this place will devolved into

       (obviously to some extend disrespect/brigading does occur...where could we find someone disrespectful I wonder?... but usually when I see the terms used around here it's because people are upset not everyone agrees with them).

       Great. And I have no problem with that. Respectful but diligent questioning is exactly what should be encouraged.  (Joe Rogan is a great example of someone who questions and disagree with many of his guests, but does so in a way that allows people to continue discussing the issue and learning from each other.) (Also please forgive formatting issues I have no idea what this post will look like.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what would be sliding (I assume this means scamming or something similar?) the sub-reddit given my only real point is that real feedback from real people, as long as it’s respectful, needs to be encouraged. And sometimes that feedback is going to be negative in the sense that it questions the op or asks for sources and that is a good thing. That is how learning happens. Nobody learns anything in a room full of people who agree. This is true regardless of the brigading comment so I kind of regret including that comment though I do stand by it.  (and support it below).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing I want to point out is that the drama surrounding this sub-reddit’s temporary swap to contest mode is 100% part of the issue I am talking about. It is an attempt to equalize the validity of comments regardless of any support they have and allow weak positions to avoid answering obvious questions. I believe it is a perfect example of some members of this community trying to hide from mostly real feedback by pretending it is fake for their own ego’s sake. (They want to assume people criticizing them are not be real for obvious psychological reasons).
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see certain mods admit they have taken actions to stop brigading because they “feel” like it is appropriate. Not because of evidence. What posts do they feel this way about? I bet it’s whichever ones disagree with them. (There’s more discussion to read about on this topic out there but this is a start,

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here are some low hanging fruit examples of people claiming brigading just because they’re told they’re wrong that were easy to find and relatively recent. A lot of this takes place in comments and I’m not sure if there’s an easy way to look through those as opposed to title searches, but here’s a quick title search:

       </a>
       (people should be banned if they say something nice about the CIA. Calling someone a shill is the same as saying they’re brigading you for my purposes. IE. claiming someone’s opinion is not legitimate based on  mere disagreement.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On a final note, I would just say I absolutely do believe there are paid shills on social media. Brigading does happen. But it is important not to jump to that conclusion about someone just because they disagree with you because once it’s said the conversation is over. Many shills are probably paid to do just that, prevent meaningful conversation between disparate groups.

       Well, t_d was designed to be a circle jerk so that's sort of a given. It's not just casual pushback we're talking about, it's dozens of users derailing threads with nothing but insults. The people that comment with inane slights that do nothing to criticize the op other than to call him stupid. That happens too often around here

       Do you think that it's possible that selection bias is colouring your view of the situation?  I ask because, while I have seen people use random ad hominem attacks and pejoratives, I've not really seen that frequently.  If you're referring to personal attacks and shill accusations without addressing a single point in a post, then I could see where you're coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that I differentiate between the two examples is that usually those who take issue with people asking them for evidence of a claim seem to take that as a personal attack.  Ironically, they're often the ones who're quick to ignore information and call a user a shill.

       I enjoy this sub because I'm naturally skeptical which means I'm skeptical of everything posted here as well. I think a lot of people new to the sub see people asking questions and instead of viewing it as a discussion they view it as what the rest of reddit is, a circle jerk, and assume that everyone here has their mind made up. That's not, from what I've seen, what this sub is about.

       I don't post in threads that are politically polarizing because disagreeing with someone and arguing isn't going to change anyone's mind. There are things on here I'm interested in and fighting isn't one of them.

       Fair enough. Using the Russian Collusion as an example, I think pretty much every argument for and against have already been made and people are firmly in their camp. I know that's not the only political debate going on on this sub but I'd say it makes up a large percentage of it.

       My biggest problem with this subreddit is that some people seem to think that everything published in "mainstream media" must be incorrect.

       Look at different sources and make up your own mind and stay sceptical.

       Not everything you read is correct but everything isn't wrong either.

       I feel the same way. It's nice to workout your brain and entertain more than one possibility. My debate class had us debate one thing one way (pro life) and then the other way (pro choice). Helps you get a grasp on the reasoning of the other side.

       I hate to read some subreddit's and I hate some people on youtube but I sometimes listen and read that anyway to try to look at things from a different perspective.

       It is pretty frustrating to read some things I agree so I try to not even engage in whatever it is that's frustrating to me. It's easier to talk in person though with someone you may disagree with because I think most wouldn't resort to calling someone an idiot or whatever to their face and kind of manage their tone.

       I wonder if conspiracy theorists are more in the habit of looking at things from a different perspective in general.  Maybe conspiracy theory is just the result of a willingness to consider different perspectives.

       One thing that's hard in debates is when the opposing argument is rooted into the person's morality and their view of the world. That's not something easy to persuade someone from. And it's an exercise in futility to try. For example, the prolife/prochoice debate : pro life people literally view abortion as murder. End of story. It'd be hard to justify murder to anybody. That was one of my biggest concession/rebuttal issues. I think that's why it's like a debate 101 topic.

       Aside from the fact that in a lot of the shit threads I see, political bias is clearly the reason why illogical conclusion are jumped to, you really need to speak for yourself.

       How should this community discuss my theory that Donald Trump was the real shooter, not Paddock? I believe Trump did it in an effort to end legalized gambling in Las Vegas, which would result in more tourists using Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City. (We can see the MSM and FBI playing along, with story after story on how “Paddock”’s addiction to Video Poker caused him to snap.) He also wanted to punish Nevada senator Dean Heller for not supporting Trump on the healthcare bill. (Trump had access to the guns thanks to the Secret Service; he acquired his proficiency with them during his time at West Point.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s my theory. How should it be discussed on this subreddit?

       It should be discussed exactly as you just discussed it. While I'm not entirely convinced of your theory (No offense - I can't tell if it's a joke or not), you laid out your reasons for believing it clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently there's no way to no for sure whether your theory is true or not, so I'll entertain it in moving forward as more information is unveiled to determine whether there's any substance to it.

       He's obviously presenting a hypothetical that highlights the biases on this sub and the underlying implication of OPs grievances.

       Ah, I figured he wasn't serious. Hard to tell these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, I disagree. There's no harm in entertaining such theories, so long as it's just something you muse on internally. I'll take people thinking this place is a silly over not being able to share "silly" ideas any day. Even if I believe many of the ideas are admittedly ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the scary part is that some of the theories seem so ridiculous at first glance, and that's what makes them so easily covered up.

       I didn't believe for a second that Trump was behind the shooting, but I did consider it once I read his post. And I'm no worse off for it.

       You don't seem like a dumb person, surely you didn't entertain that Trump would get up there and pull the trigger himseif? Being open minded is one thing, but some things don't deserve it, we don't have to pay those any serious thought.

       Of course not. The way I understood it was that he was claiming he orchestrated it. Not that he physically performed the act. Which by the way I still never believed (and I figured he was kidding).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though again, I have to disagree. Even theories as ridiculous as flat-earth deserve some thought. Because it's not until you've seriously considered the argument being made that you can say it's false.

       No it's not, and I don't see how so many people can't seem to understand what he posted. OP wants to see an end to people piling into threads to regurgitate the MSM account of events, or to attempt to shoot down the thread while offering no real criticism of the theory or only offering personal attacks.

       You're really getting into semantics here, while I think it's pretty clear the original angle you were coming from. Why do you think that topics you disagree with don't warrant discussion? Surely opposing viewpoints are valuable?

       I was literally just thinking this! It is sad how far downhill this sub went in the last 2 months. A flood of new users from 4chan and R/politics wanna come in and spout off partisan bullshit all the time. Really making me want to unsub. I love a difference of cultures and opinions but quit trying to shove your politics down my throat.

       Yes that's exactly what I was talking about the Dems have caused trouble too though, I'm independent and don't really give after just keep the politics out of it and discuss the facts guys. It's not hard, but it does feel like we are being brigaded by alt right bullshit.

       We should easily dismiss the noise though, or we'll get overwhelmed with nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I approach CT rationally. I want to investigate and see/hear as much for myself as possible. Always looking for that smoking gun (no pun) that is undeniable. That I can't rationalize away. That I can't use logic and common sense to dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this event... So much noise has emerged. So much easily dismissed nonsense that doesn't need to be explored because it is easily debunked yet...
      </p>
      <p>
       Half the world wants to focus on the noise instead of continuing to look for real evidence. We have a cyclical effect going on where we spend a few hours hashing out a theory in a popular thread only to have a new crowd pile in the next day after seeing a youtube vid and pronouncing the very theory we've already debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you come in trying to paint us as shills and patronizing. We are neither. We are trying to sort through the BS to get real evidence. This is only harder if we have to continually re hash the same BS every few hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       So kindly GTFO with you concern trolling. We're busy figuring out what really happened.

       As far as I'm concerned there isn't a MSM narrative, but only support to completely suppress anything suggesting some sort of cover-up or planned attack, which, at this point, wouldn't be too surprising given the bizarre nature of info being shared.

       I see a lot of times when an alternative theory to the official story is posted, and someone pokes holes in it, people attack them with arguments that seem to automatically assume the hole poker is on board with the official story.  They get called shills and all sorts of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a skeptic.  If something doesn't make sense to me I'll question it or point out the flaw if I know (or think I know) something is wrong.  That does not mean I believe or don't believe the official story.  It just means I'm asking a question about a theory or pointing something out that is wrong with that particular theory.  Simple as that.  Yet sometimes I'll get attacked for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is extremely biased, and close-minded, to ignore official stories that come from the MSM.  I have no problem with people attacking the story from the MSM and making arguments that counter the story, but when I see people like the OP here who immediately dismiss MSM stories just because or try to say this is not the place for MSM I have to shake my head.  Often it seems like to me that people reject MSM stories like this just do it because it doesn't fit whatever narrative they believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: I feel people like the OP just want to censor what people see in this sub to only stuff they want to see.  I think that is stupid.

       This sub is a fucking shit-show. Of course the mainstream narrative is going to be defended by the majority of people. That's why it's "mainstream" I actually have no problem with that. What bothers me more is there are clearly people here, call them shills, or whatever you want to call them. Their goal is to derail certain threads within a topic. If a thread is actually going somewhere all of a sudden a comment will appear that makes no sense at all or is a personal attack or whatever, suddenly a brigade arrives and this comment has 30 upvotes and subcomments. What was being discussed is now basically covered up. I've been seeing this in r/conspiracy for a long time but with this incident especially it's very blatant.

       And yet we needed this thread to tell people the same, so the answer is obvious. Don't know how much you lurk this sub, but people have been asking for a rule where OP has to point out the conspiracy for a long time. Or maybe I'm the only one sick of a front page full of mainstream articles you'd find on /r/politics or /r/The_Donald.

       It is my direct experience that a large minority on this sub do not want to do that.  What they want it to have what they know is Truth to be uncritically reinforced by others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out a source is wrong 97% of the time isn't patronizing nor is providing evidence that something is wrong.  Take, for example, the people who said it was wrong for some of the gates to be closed at the concert in Vegas.  When they received information showing this was wrong they ignored it or lashed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same applies to those who say they are doing science when they have no model, no math, no evidence or no experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting this another way this isn't black and white it is a lot more nuanced than that.

       I agree that there was a significant change during and especially after the election, and I agree that the posters from T_D that have infiltrated can be pretty annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are lying to yourself if you try to say that this place hasn't been infiltrated by both sides, and there is no basis to your claim that it's 100% T_D's fault. Correlation doesn't equal causation.

       But the "other side" wouldn't have had any fucking reason to bother being here if T_D wasn't trying to use this place as a shitposting misinformation sphere.

      <p>
       If they even are "here" -- frankly I haven't seen much blatant "shilling"/Clinton defenders/etc compared to the number of things I see posted by "MAGA09" or "CUCK_FOR_SALE" whatever. That doesn't mean they aren't here, I certainly haven't tried to identify any suspicious accounts or anything. But, I certainly do see those T_D people replying to anyone who questions their shit posting calling them CTR shills on the regular, though. Fuck, I wish I was getting paid for this, it'd be way better than my real job.

       Just because you haven't seen them doesn't mean they aren't there. I get that's your experience but it hasn't been mine. It's not as common as T_D posters seem to think but they are here.

       Anyone who hasn't realized that the political left and the political right are two heads of the same beast placed there to give us an illusion of choice is looking too closely. The Donald is the more obnoxious in your face element (I rarely see people here wringing their hands waiting for Hilary's leadership) but this "The left" vs. "The right" is hilarious when you consider the shining star of proper "rightness" just conceded that Hilary had a point when she said "what if he had a 'silencer'?!", despite the fact that full auto suppressed fire is a finicky and rare thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "right" just agreed to freeze their relaxation on federal gun laws and the left is there doing the same old song and dance: "no one 'needs' a firearm_accessory" fill in as needed. A different situation will warrant different roles for the two but the connection remains, two heads of the same beast.

       Seriously does conspiracy have different way of processing cause and effect. If any evidence was put forward that was solid I think a good deal of the newer people would take notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read everything that's been posted and nothing has legs. It's people who have decide it's a conspiracy and are throwing stuff at the wall and hoping it sticks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government watching and recording all communications is a real conspiracy it's one of the most serious issue people of the world face.

       This tragedy has really shown that some people on this sub aren't processing the world in a Normal way their not applying health psychology. We've had acts of violence how the whole of human history in multiple countries to jump to its a conspiracy without isn't healthy.

       This may get buried, but, I would like to say that I have come here since the shooting, because something does not add up here. It's the same feeling I had after 9/11. Perhaps it is a positive that so many new users are joining this sub -- as more and more people are starting to realize how much the media and those in power are lying to us.

       That's pretty true. It's such an obvious pattern that we can pretty much bait them into predictable responses now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's good that we also have these kinds of threads show up and people think they can post without reading the sidebar: "This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone."
      </p>
      <p>
       And start calling us morons for saying that free thinking means more than thinking only in certain ways.

       I'm sorry but I think that discussing the mainstream narrative is part of discussing conspiracy theories. Of course you have to point out why the mainstream narrative doesn't work to prove that a conspiracy might be true. Although you have a point in that some users are berated just for espousing certain conspiracy theory, without even arguments made against them.

       You think with groups out there like shariablue having warrooms with teams of people posting using bots, that they wouldn't also try to disrupt the conspiracy narratives?
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of the world are very close to actually questioning the globalists and not falling for mainstream media propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very important to the globalists to disrupt the narrative because more and more people are lurking soaking in conspiracy theories and when a critical mass inflection point gets hit things will get crazy quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if a good percentage of currently useful idiots started to question the mainstream media?

       I wonder though, why propaganda is making it to the front page so many times. Being anti-MSM doesnt mean you should accept any other "news outlet". It doesnt mean we should believe in a random persons opinion. To have a proper discussion you will always need evidence or logical reasoning. And this shooting is a perfect example of the inability to do so. Long time members are just falling for everything that might point to something else when so far we have no reason to do so. Believing everything.

       The real conspiracy is the sudden increase in alt right rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       A white guy shoots up a concert and suddenly the narrative is "It was liberals! It was a jew! It was a muslim! It was ISIS! It was a secret liberal jewish ISIS agent working for Soros!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the other stories about "MSM won't talk about this damn black murdering white people!" like it's an actual story. Or stuff about BLM being evil. Or stuff about shills trying to help the blacks or yadda yadda blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a whole bunch of alt right bullshit.

      <p>
       I mean one of the posts on the front page is screeching about how "achktually wounded knee was the largest mass shooting" like that has anything to do with any "conspiracy". It's just blatant negative rhetoric meant to make people doubt the story.

       Anything not in the mainstream narrative, which contain part truths and lies, belongs in the conspiracy realm. Each of these globalist media creeps will be the first to tell you if you don't buy their bullshit narrative your a conspiracy nut. Even a guy with a cell phone filming first hand is a conspiracy theory. Accurate journalism, won't make the evening news. So  I don't know what the problem is.

       Don't be a dick, for sure.  But the amount of anti-discussion I've been seeing lately is disturbing.  Scrutiny is a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing, and a good theory will stand up to it.  People coming here and arguing in favor of a "mainstream" narrative is completely fine.  And the cattle calls for people to not do so need to stop.  This isn't a sub for people to push bullshit and not have to defend it.

       I happen to enjoy reading entries on this sub, but I feel bad that there may have been people who decided to take action on something written or discussed here.    These are conspiracy theories, meant to provoke thought but I don't think that anyone in this sub would advocate direct action based on tenuous postings in this sub.    I've heard that the term "conspiracy theorist" was coined by an intelligence agency who sought to discredit those whose ideas and speech could prove to be dangerous.    From there, individuals would willingly wear that title when discussing those ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       To anybody reading here, I do not believe that anyone who posts here recommends taking direct action based on what gets discussed here.    If you do take action, that's on you, especially if you act in a manner that you yourself would not like to be treated, for instance having someone barge into your home and firing a shotgun  or having someone come up to you in public and accusing you of being a liar.   Application of the golden rule is recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideas are powerful, and I'm worried about those who would take a mental exercise and choose to stress out over it, or choose to directly affect someone else's life with direct action.   Roko's Basilisk is a good example of an idea run amok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideas are powerful, but don't let them control you.

       I understand the frustration of people purely being here to be contrarian.  It should not be frowned up, however, to ask for the evidence used to as the basis for a theory or opinion.  I see variations of OP constantly and it's getting old.  It's essentially saying "I want to be able to speak my mind/opinion and I only want to discuss it with people who agree with me".  It's intellectually weak and it also leads to circle jerks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this subreddit wasn't as politicized as it is, then I'd be more relaxed when it comes to espousing ideas with zero evidence.  Add a "pure speculation" tag if you want. I've seen conspiracies that seemingly exist to smear a political opponent and is just an exercise in confirmation bias.  I'm a skeptic that has earnestly tried to be cognizant of my biases.  When I'm discussing various conspiracies involving the media, I expect to be challenged.  If I weren't, I wouldn't have such a thoroughly developed theory.  I do not like circle jerks and echo chambers and while I don't think that that's what OP is asking for, I still believe it's worth cautioning against when this subject is discussed.

       This sub has become r/conspiracydenial. Just post a article from WaPo "debunking" a conspiracy and watch the upvotes roll in. Half the accounts here have no actual interest in any conspiracies. But the mods want it to be top minds friendly here, so it's open season on conspiracies that aren't reported on by CNN.

       I think it's quite telling that the narrative that people want to build up around the conspiracies are fairly one dimensional and trying to point at the same people that are disliked go to site that's it's more of an agenda looking for evidence rather than genuine interest in conspiracy.

       This topic won't hit the mark. The people op is talking about are purposely coming in here to troll. Many of them are definitely paid to do it too; astroturf is a confirmed fact, especially in communities like this. I guess it's good to have this post up reminding everyone what this community is and what the legitimate people in this community come to this community for, because that calls attention to the trolls who are purposely being assholes. But those assholes are assholes on purpose. They want to be assholes, and asking them nicely to stop being assholes won't do anything to stop them. We can't stop them like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I just avoid engaging with people I don't think are contributing in good faith. Sometimes I'll drop a comment explaining how they're full of shit first, but going back and forth with inane bullshit just clutters the forum and makes threads less interesting to read. If someone is being annoying on purpose, trying to fight them just gives them what they want. We should correct lies when we see them, but we shouldn't feed trolls. I think starving them of that validation is the most effective way to "battle" that type of user.

       For some reason, they just don't get it. It's called CONSPIRACY for a reason. What I've also noticed is people calling others names when it doesn't fit their narrative, which is bizarre, considering it is a CONSPIRACY sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you call them out on the name calling, they keep doing it without talking about facts and ideas. To me, many paid Brock Dickface Media Matters and their goons stirring up BS.

       No one suggested theories should be accepted, but discussion should be allowed to proceed without mockery and derision designed to dissuade that discussion, I think is the point.

       You still don't seem to be understanding how the English language works. Words convey meaning. Sometimes you use them to convey meaning beyond their literal meaning. So you use figurative speech, hyperbole, metaphors, or allegories etc.  Doing so and trying to pass off such a statement as literally true would be lying. Doing so in a manner designed to make clear the figurative meaning, such as if someone said something sarcastically but with a tone that conveys sarcasm, is just called speaking in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you miss that I was speaking figuratively or not? Because if you did miss it then that's a whole different barrel of fish. And if you didn't miss my actual meaning, which seems more likely, asking for a literal Obama Vampire Theory post would be a deliberately combative and misleading way to try to frame a response I think. One in line with your choice to immediately devolve into vitriol and name calling.

       In any event, the topic calls for tolerance of conspiracies and understanding of what this sub is about. I was trying to state my opinion that I agree, but supporting respectful questioning of a theory, or disagreement, must also be encouraged. Disagreement and requests for sources on topics is part of the process of fact finding. It is contributing to the search for knowledge and how bad information is winnowed out. If people don't support that process and instead call downvoting or questioning a theory brigading/disrespect  then this place will devolved into
       <a href="/r/conspiracyshowerthoughts">
        /r/conspiracyshowerthoughts
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (obviously to some extend disrespect/brigading does occur...where could we find someone disrespectful I wonder?... but usually when I see the terms used around here it's because people are upset not everyone agrees with them).

       The "far flung theory" was pretty ubiquitous on this sub. Especially then all I advocated was waiting till we know more details. But yes my patience will wear thin when it's a constant barrage of "MSM shill" while I'm just trying to say your false flag theory is unsubstantiated.

       Maybe there needs to be less criticism of the doubters and more criticism of the fanaticism displayed by the theorists.

       The same could be said of a lot of people who put down the positive criticism. If you say you don't agree with some bat shit theory you get called a shill. Just because a bunch of turds on 4chan made something up doesn't mean it's worthwhile to repeat it a million times here.

       But the "other side" wouldn't have had any fucking reason to bother being here if T_D wasn't trying to use this place as a shitposting misinformation sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they even are "here" -- frankly I haven't seen much blatant "shilling"/Clinton defenders/etc compared to the number of things I see posted by "MAGA09" or "CUCK_FOR_SALE" whatever. That doesn't mean they aren't here, I certainly haven't tried to identify any suspicious accounts or anything. But, I certainly do see those T_D people replying to anyone who questions their shit posting calling them CTR shills on the regular, though. Fuck, I wish I was getting paid for this, it'd be way better than my real job.

       Anyone who hasn't realized that the political left and the political right are two heads of the same beast placed there to give us an illusion of choice is looking too closely. The Donald is the more obnoxious in your face element (I rarely see people here wringing their hands waiting for Hilary's leadership) but this "The left" vs. "The right" is hilarious when you consider the shining star of proper "rightness" just conceded that Hilary had a point when she said "what if he had a 'silencer'?!", despite the fact that full auto suppressed fire is a finicky and rare thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "right" just agreed to freeze their relaxation on federal gun laws and the left is there doing the same old song and dance: "no one 'needs' a firearm_accessory" fill in as needed. A different situation will warrant different roles for the two but the connection remains, two heads of the same beast.

       You are proof that the one of the most awful straits a person can have is confident ignorance. I live in CT. So what you're suggesting is that "actors" moved to CT years before the incident, bought homes, pretended to have children, who were also "actors", then faked a tragic event and stayed in character to continue living and working in town. The school is in on it, the school board, the town, the outlying towns, neighbors,  friends, all in on a conspiracy to do what? Take away our guns that were never taken away? This is the reason that when you people have something to add to a conversation, by default we all assume its bullshit.

       Shot a hard drive, then was released, not put on trial, and went quietly into the night.  Enough to point the blame at pizzagate and shut discussion &amp; discovery down.   One guy, an actor, one shot, no repercussions.  Come on now.

       Sure! It should be berated! In case you don't know what berate measn:

       I haven't seen any where you have provided any sort or reproach or admonishment saying otherwise.

        This thread is and always has been an opinion based discussion, so you’re demand for “facts” makes no sense in this context. What facts are you looking for? Should I sneak into their houses and read their diaries?

      <p>
       Again no sort of submitted proof or axamples? Just talking out your ass?

       TLDR: Your a tool who thinks they can talk their way out of their shitt fucking comment that some how got upvotes. Yet you lack any substance to your comments and I still sit here waiting for you to provide it...... Keep going troll! I'm on vaca let dance all night long!

       The people there didn’t know he wasn’t about to start the next mass killing.  They were probably all terrified.  It’s pretty irresponsible to minimize the seriousness of what he did.

       On the flip side, it’s not fair the blame an idea for what a crazy person does with it.
