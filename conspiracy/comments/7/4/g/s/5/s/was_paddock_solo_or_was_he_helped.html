       Basically three paths of logic I can see:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Paddock acted completely alone with no help and pulled off what he did completely solo.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There were multiple gunmen part from Paddock in different locations in the hotel or the concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Paddock simply received help from someone who helped him get to his position with guns, etc. However, the people who helped him didn't participate in the killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Paddock was trying to sell guns to an unknown buyer, who turned out to be ISIS. The buyer immediately murdered Paddock and used the guns to cause a massacre, then fled the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this sub think? Is there another path I'm missing? I'll add to the list if I am.

       No; there should be no pussy-footing around this question. We are talking about the deadliest mass shooting in US history that took place in front of thousands of witnesses with recording devices in a city with CCTV cameras on every corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       You show me the specific image that proves beyond reasonable doubt that gunshot wounds occurred from real gunfire. It should be as simple as showing one single entrance wound on one purported victim at the scene, or any gunshot damage to any objects, let alone the fact that there's no footage of
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       being shot.

       Obviously I believe the same kind of staged event is happening repeatedly, because it's so easy to fool people just with the form of mind control called the power of suggestion. Show people running around, screaming, some people lying on the ground, play some popping noises, and that's enough to fool 90% of people into thinking the shooting was real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I'm right about just one of the events you mention, and I am, it merits a serious investigation and puts a huge burden of proof on the claim that any new mass shooting is the real deal.

       The idea that there were multiple shooters when no one can even prove that a single real round was fired is exactly disinformation. Worse, it's the kind that spreads itself even by people who really think it's true.

       So instead of simply proving any real shots were fired, which would be laughably easy to do if this were a real shooting as reported, you "cleverly" link to Wikipedia. That seems kind of weird if it's so obvious that people were really shot.

       People will notice the fact that you cannot substantiate any claims of gunshots or real gunfire, when my doubts are well-founded and this proof should be incredibly easy to abundantly present.

       You really think nobody was actually shot? No wonder conspirators get a bad rep at times, this is the same kinda BS Alex Jones pushes. People actually died, were actually shot and killed, it’s not that we don’t believe that, what we don’t believe is the story MSM and the authorities are attempting to push. I’ve seen video of people dying, just go to
       <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">

       I've seen this video and not only does it look like someone kicks the cup, but it's silly that we're talking about the deadliest shooting in the history of the country with thousands of witnesses and no one can prove shots were fired and to do so they point to a cup.

       Already seen these. At the 9 minute mark there is a guy with what we assume to be blood on his arm. And that's definitive evidence of hundreds of people being shot by automatic rifle fire with thousands of witnesses? Give me a break. There's literally not even an entrance wound visible.

       No, if you watched those videos, Seen people on the floor choking on their own blood attempting to survive, and still don’t believe anybody was shot, there is something extremely wrong with your ability to asses a situation for what it is. You’re right, thousands of witnesses were there, however I guarantee you a great majority of people weren’t readily recording to capture any gunfire on video, seeing as they didn’t know it was going to fkn happen. How does one see these videos and still think it’s staged? Smh.

       Pools of blood and dramatic acting is enough to bamboozle you? There should be a mountain of well-documented evidence that shots were fired and people were hit. Are you not aware that these things can be and are faked, and on a relatively low budget?

       I’m super new to reddit, I’ve seen different levels of conspirators: the ones that speculate the truth is being hidden and ignored and the other side where people really truly believe this entire thing was completely fake. If you search this thread enough, you would have already seen the videos of people dying out near the shooting area.

       Anything you hear about 'death to the patriarchy' means kill white men.  Anything about 'white privilege' is whitephobia.  Anything about diversity is promoting of invasion of white nations and genocide of whites.  Complain about mass/illegal immigration?  You must be a nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on, but the point is there is a heavy anti-white effort in white nations.  Why not islamic people for this?  Because islam is their proxy army of death to outbreed and kill whites.  Islam=submit to God and live as mohammad.  Mohammad says lie, steal, rape and kill non-islamists.  They go through -INCREDIBLE- efforts to protect islam.  Recent Tennessee mass shooting of 9 killed 1 in a white church?  Very little coverage in the media, even less mention of him being from sudan, nothing about a place 97% islamic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill m103 in Canada, you flat out CANNOT speak negatively on islam, it's literally illegal now.  A man wrote 'no more muslims' on a bench and was sent to jail for 5 months.

       There are similar efforts all over the white western world, England has a ton of this.  The whole 'NOT ALL MUSLIMS!' bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal is to paint whites in the worst light possible, genocide them and replace them with non-whites.

       It's impossible to know for sure, but if the ISIS/Gun Running theory is false then I would have to say that Paddock had to have done the shooting with one other person.

       If you read that article it states that when security guard Jesus Campos approached room 32135 he did so because he saw that the door was ajar. My guess would be 2nd shooter vacated the room before Campos was shot in the leg by Paddock.

       1) Paddock acted completely alone with no help and pulled off what he did completely solo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, until they said they think he had help. Then they (LVMPD) stumbled over their words for a few, while avoiding terrorist questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There were multiple gunmen part from Paddock in different locations in the hotel or the concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Careful, you're speculating. I think there had to be multiple shooters, but we need evidence. Somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Paddock simply received help from someone who helped him get to his position with guns, etc. However, the people who helped him didn't participate in the killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The layout of the room from the articles and reports I've read made it seem like someone else was there. There's a lot more to this that we don't have, but it is possible he could get it all up there alone.

       It's tough without all of this information in one spot. If i had the time, I would love to make a timeline of events using all the BS that is out there and let the overlapping and disinformation be picked out that way, leaving a clearer timeline, and legitimate questions. If only...

       They shut off the elevators probably with 8-10 minutes, maybe sooner.. You can hear it on the police scanner.

      <p>
       And police would be in the stairwells too going down. If I were the real shooters, I would have had a room on a nearby floor to run to after the shootings. But the timing of the security guard and what happens before SWAT arrived in still pretty confusing on why Paddock would still be shooting if he wasn't part of the plan. And if he was already dead, who was shooting the guard and how did they get away in time?

       I have wet my beak on this theory too. Certainly interesting and certainly possible. I just don't believe a hotel room in a massive casino would be the place to do it. Just my take.

       Paddock thought he was working undercover for government selling arms to criminals. Cia/fbi set him up in the hotel for a standard transaction. They then "suicide" him and then use the guns to carry out the attack. They arrange all the details in the room to frame him and then they leave.

       Wait... this seems way more far fetched. Why would the CIA want to murder 59 people? Do you honestly think ISIS has infiltrated the highest levels of our government, but hasn't bothered to install Sharia Law nationwide? This is some Obama-is-a-Lizard-Person level shit.

       Yes, the security guard and police were on the 32nd floor well before the shooting stopped (obviously, the guard was shot). Neither the guard or police have mentioned anyone else being in the room or running past them after the guard was shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Paddock appears to have legitimately stuck a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. I'm not saying that can't be staged but Paddock isn't going to voluntarily open his mouth and let someone stick the muzzle of a gun in it. There would be some sort of struggle or altercation. This doesn't jive with "The buyer immediately murdered Paddock" idea at all.

       You really think nobody was actually shot? No wonder conspirators get a bad rep at times, this is the same kinda BS Alex Jones pushes. People actually died, were actually shot and killed, it’s not that we don’t believe that, what we don’t believe is the story MSM and the authorities are attempting to push.

       Pools of blood and dramatic acting is enough to bamboozle you? There should be a mountain of well-documented evidence that shots were fired and people were hit. Are you not aware that these things can be and are faked, and on a relatively low budget?
