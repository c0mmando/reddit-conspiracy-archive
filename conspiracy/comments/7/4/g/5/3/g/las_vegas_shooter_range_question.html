       This might end up being one of those posts that's TLDR. But, something has been bothering me about the Vegas shooting: the range at which the shooter was taking shots. What we know is that he's 32 floors up. Using what the MSM reports are AR15s and AR10s. The pics that we've seen of the weapons show optics mounted to those weapons. Not that I claim to be a wise man, nor a mathematician, but, how could someone, without formal training, make those shots?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about high school geometry. Something called: Pythagorean Theorem. a
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       + b
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       = c
       <sup>
        2.
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       32 floors up, would be "a". [Take a look at this article about how to estimate that height.]
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <a href="http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/HeightCalculator/tabid/1007/language/en-GB/Default.aspx">
        http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/HeightCalculator/tabid/1007/language/en-GB/Default.aspx
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Using that information, the shooter would be approximately 350 feet up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using Google Maps, the distance from the furthest point of the hotel to center stage, is approximately, 1150 ft. Make this "b" for the formula.
      </p>
      <p>
       "c" would be about 1200 feet, or 400 yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the effective range of an AR15 is 500 yards, and the AR10 is higher. If the audio from the MSM is to be taken at face-value, the shooter was using a combination of these two weapons, with a bump stock, to shoot 400 yards, without any known military training. Not only that, the pictures we've seen are of weapons with mounted optics, casting the illusion that the shooter was "aiming". Aiming and going "full-auto" don't exactly mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to throw this out there to get some thoughts.

       I'm not a gun guy... but I don't see how you could actually use the optics and the bump stock at the same time... I'd guess he had em there in case they are needed situationally, but was just firing in the general direction of people.

       I am a "gun guy" and am puzzled. A buddy of mine, uses his AR15 for hunting. At best, he's been able to hit, with luck, a target out 150 yards. Granted, he doesn't have a top-of-the-line optic, military training, and says that it's mostly luck.

       I bet he could hit at least 50 bullseyes if he fired for 10 minutes from above down into an area of 20,000 penned in targets.

       Cause ya don't have to pray and spray with an AR15... dude could mellow out his trigger finger and take a few well placed midrange shots if necessary... like at security guards in a hallway or something similar.

       The optic sights don't make any sense, niether does having that many weapons. And think about shooting a full auto for 11 minutes, his arms would be spaghetti after 2 minutes. He also had to set the place up, carrying up the guns up, load all the guns setup the door optics and do some drinking and gambleing on the side. This guy was a fucking machine or somethings not right.

       Maybe he used his weapons differently depending on the situation, and the scopes were just left on there from the last time he went shooting, where the scope was necessary?. Like he brings up all his guns to the room. Did he just not bother to remove the scopes? He knew he didn't need to aim, maybe it just wasn't worth the extra work to remove the optics?

       Does your friend shoot from a blind 32 stories high into a dense crowd of thousands of deer?  If he did, he’d hit a lot of somethings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, on a side note, your friend shouldn’t be taking shots at animals he isn’t 100% confident about, as there is the HIGH potential to wound the animal and cause it massive undue suffering or simply maiming it. (If that’s what you were saying)
      </p>
      <p>
       Those people were fish in a barrel.

       I wonder how he and other terrorist/mass shooters seem to get their weapons to fire flawlessly without a stoppage or jam. And or can clear it in a proficient manner. Wouldn't firing 'automatic' or rapid increase the chances of a jam along with any heat issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also wouldn't bruising or red marks on the shoulder and firing eye ridge/socket show up on an autopsy?

       Shooting at damned near full-auto, and using an optic don't go together. Maybe to sight in the first target, and then cut loose, but the rifle would climb.

       have you ever shot an ar? they dont leave bruises lol. shit, not even a 12 gauge shotgun or large moose hunting rifles left bruises. The largest recoil ive delt with was probably a mosin and even that didnt leave a mark or bruise on my shoulder, im not sure why you think shooting an AR would leave a bruise?

       The shoulder with good technique and can see no bruising but this was an older guy with no military training, rushed, going back and forth between two windows using different guns(What was it 23 guns in room?) My whole thing is his age and does not look well in photos. The older you get the easier it is to bruise  especially if a big drinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on the optic I can't see it not bruising. I think he mostly sprayed in bursts.

       you dont need military training to learn how to shoot a rifle properly lol.

       Also not sure why being in your 60s means youre some senile old guy who cant do much physical activity? ive met skiers on the mountain in their 80s ripping it down slopes better than 20 year old kids. being 60 doesnt mean you cant be physically fit.
      </p>

       I agree he most likely sprayed, but I dont see how there being an optic on the guns leads to this being fishy.

       For me, it was the range to the audience that made it fishy. If you were going to try and kill people at that range, wouldn't you choose a different weapon? Or, wouldn't you position yourself differently?
      </p>
      <p>
       Using round numbers, the bullet travels 80% of the distance that the rifle is rated for, just to get to the target(s). Then, using a bump stock, to increase the rate of fire, just seems off. Seems like it would have been easier to just walk into a crowd with the bump stock'd rifle and start shooting. Or pick a more precise weapon.

       its within the effective range of an AR? not sure why you wouldnt go with something like that, one of the most common rifles, very large amount of aftermarket attachments and such. very easy to shoot as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other weapon would you choose?
      </p>
      <p>
       what seems off? he was shooting in to a condensed crowd of 22,000 people, you literally just spray in their direction with a gun like that and get hit after hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       what isnt precise about an AR? or a bump stock shooting in to a giant crowd? you make it seem like he was trying to pick off people one by one, which we can tell by the videos isnt the case, he was wildly spraying the guns in to the crowd.

       If the endgame is to inflict maximum damage, I'd stick with the AR, but I wouldn't fire blindly from a 32nd window. As you've noted, it was like shooting fish in a barrel, with a crowd of 22,000; imagine if he'd been on the ground, and closer. Cut the range by half and you'd have killed more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the height, I would have thought he'd pick something bolt-action, with the optic, and be more precise. Let the rush of the people, lead to death by trampling. It would take a lot longer to find the source of those shots because it wouldn't be the staccato of gunfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of the question was the range. It seems off to me, given the weapons chosen, and the amount of ammo spent.

       I think that the AR, configured as the shooter had, would make more sense closer up.

       If he worked at fitness I can see it being a possibility but so far no indication of a gym membership, workout routine, vitamin regiment or even shooting drills. The Dallas gunman was seen in his backyard practicing scoot and shoot techniques. Being rich he could've had his own gym set up and/or even land for a homemade range but I don't see fitness in recent photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole thing is in recent photos he doesn't seem healthy. The bar picture shows a drunk guy with a turkey neck and yellowish tint. A drivers license photo shows a tired man.

       It is an assumption based on current information. I would've written off something like the bar photo but then I saw license photo. I could be wrong but as someone who worked out my entire adult life I see what happens when you don'tand/ or mix with alot of drinking. Depending on the job even some physical jobs won't keep one in shape. As meticulous as he was it would be consistent to think he would've prepared physically in technique and fitness-that's the information I want to see.

       Could be wrong but without physical and/or chemical aid I just can't see this guy doing it alone.

       It's the prep, carrying at least 10 suitcases to his room, moving furniture, loading the mags in mass although without arthritis I'll give him that and that's after he loaded his car with the gear along with at least 50 pounds of explosives. The stress of planning and not being outed along with other daily issues like heavy gambling losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard a theory that he was on the anti anxiety meds to keep himself calm because he knew what he was going to do and needed help getting through it. That would be an indication that he can't handle stress which can cause heart issues in far younger individuals. The fact he went so far as to get psych drugs wouldn't put it past to think he had himself put on one of these 'anti-aging' steroid regimes.

       Normal capacity magazines in well made, properly maintained weapons RARELY jam.  I’ve fired thousands of rounds from an AR-15 Bushmaster and never had it jam on me once, including Firing so fast that the barrel literally flowed red in the night.
      </p>
      <p>
       typically your weapon can jam when you do any of the following:
use shitty ammo
use a high capacity magazine (particularly drums)
Don’t clean/maintain/reassemble your weapon properly
Use a normal magazine but overfill it.  It’s best to put 29 rounds in a 30 round magazine, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, an AR 15 has almost no recoil.  It’s like shooting a high powered aero soft gun

       I don’t understand why the range is an issue for some people? I have some “military training” but not much outside of just basic marine boot camp and we were shooting with iron sights at 500 meters which is farther than this and a hell of a lot of guys could absolutely place shots on those. Even at 300 meters kneeling guys were shooting tight (within 6 inch) groups relatively often. Give any of those guys a fire grip, bipod, etc and they could absolutely make those shots all day. Shooting an AR takes literally no stamina whatsoever, the recoil is at best minimal. The only problem at that range would be the rate at which he was firing and staying accurate but he didn’t have to be accurate at all just spraying.

       I'm wondering if there was a camera mounted to those scopes, a live feed POV first person shooter video. For a "select" audience. A second shooter in the room could take the cameras with him. As stated, you don't need a scope to hose downrange.

       Has anyone confirmed the number of cameras? I know that there was one at the peephole on the door; and one in the hallway on a cart. We were told that both were there to alert on movement in the hall.

       More curious if the scopes on those rifles will accommodate a camera. I suspect there are some people who would pay $$$ to see a video of a massacre of American citizens. A second shooter in the room would have had an hour to dismount the cameras and take them along. Investigators wouldn't look in that direction for motivation unless a shooter POV video of this event surfaces.

       I don't know about the number of cameras. The cameras we're aware of were for surveillance of the approaches to the room. This wasn't a limited budget effort. The shooter was supposed to be gun expert, so the long gaps between volleys weren't just for reloading. It wasn't for letting the barrels cool, either, that's what all the spare guns were for, the ones that never got used. Moving a camera from one scope to another could account for the time lapse, if he was limiting himself to camera adapted rifles and a livestream camera. (although it might be easier and faster to dismount the scope and move it to a new rifle with the camera attached, so I'm probably just talking out my ass, here.)

       Think about the weight of the ammo. Maybe he does cross-fit.
