        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This might end up being one of those posts that&#39;s TLDR. But, something has been bothering me about the Vegas shooting: the range at which the shooter was taking shots. What we know is that he&#39;s 32 floors up. Using what the MSM reports are AR15s and AR10s. The pics that we&#39;ve seen of the weapons show optics mounted to those weapons. Not that I claim to be a wise man, nor a mathematician, but, how could someone, without formal training, make those shots?</p>

<p>Think about high school geometry. Something called: Pythagorean Theorem. a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>32 floors up, would be &quot;a&quot;. [Take a look at this article about how to estimate that height.]</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/HeightCalculator/tabid/1007/language/en-GB/Default.aspx">http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/HeightCalculator/tabid/1007/language/en-GB/Default.aspx</a>)</p>

<p>Using that information, the shooter would be approximately 350 feet up.</p>

<p>Using Google Maps, the distance from the furthest point of the hotel to center stage, is approximately, 1150 ft. Make this &quot;b&quot; for the formula.</p>

<p>&quot;c&quot; would be about 1200 feet, or 400 yards.</p>

<p>So, the effective range of an AR15 is 500 yards, and the AR10 is higher. If the audio from the MSM is to be taken at face-value, the shooter was using a combination of these two weapons, with a bump stock, to shoot 400 yards, without any known military training. Not only that, the pictures we&#39;ve seen are of weapons with mounted optics, casting the illusion that the shooter was &quot;aiming&quot;. Aiming and going &quot;full-auto&quot; don&#39;t exactly mix.</p>

<p>Just wanted to throw this out there to get some thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a &quot;gun guy&quot; and am puzzled. A buddy of mine, uses his AR15 for hunting. At best, he&#39;s been able to hit, with luck, a target out 150 yards. Granted, he doesn&#39;t have a top-of-the-line optic, military training, and says that it&#39;s mostly luck.</p>

Like he brings up all his guns to the room. Did he just not bother to remove the scopes? He knew he didn&#39;t need to aim, maybe it just wasn&#39;t worth the extra work to remove the optics?</p>

<p>Also, on a side note, your friend shouldn’t be taking shots at animals he isn’t 100% confident about, as there is the HIGH potential to wound the animal and cause it massive undue suffering or simply maiming it. (If that’s what you were saying)</p>

<p>Those people were fish in a barrel.</p>

<p>Shooting at damned near full-auto, and using an optic don&#39;t go together. Maybe to sight in the first target, and then cut loose, but the rifle would climb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shoulder with good technique and can see no bruising but this was an older guy with no military training, rushed, going back and forth between two windows using different guns(What was it 23 guns in room?) My whole thing is his age and does not look well in photos. The older you get the easier it is to bruise  especially if a big drinker. </p>

<p>Depending on the optic I can&#39;t see it not bruising. I think he mostly sprayed in bursts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you dont need military training to learn how to shoot a rifle properly lol. </p>

<p>Also not sure why being in your 60s means youre some senile old guy who cant do much physical activity? ive met skiers on the mountain in their 80s ripping it down slopes better than 20 year old kids. being 60 doesnt mean you cant be physically fit. </p>

<p>I agree he most likely sprayed, but I dont see how there being an optic on the guns leads to this being fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was the range to the audience that made it fishy. If you were going to try and kill people at that range, wouldn&#39;t you choose a different weapon? Or, wouldn&#39;t you position yourself differently?</p>

<p>Using round numbers, the bullet travels 80% of the distance that the rifle is rated for, just to get to the target(s). Then, using a bump stock, to increase the rate of fire, just seems off. Seems like it would have been easier to just walk into a crowd with the bump stock&#39;d rifle and start shooting. Or pick a more precise weapon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its within the effective range of an AR? not sure why you wouldnt go with something like that, one of the most common rifles, very large amount of aftermarket attachments and such. very easy to shoot as well. </p>

<p>What other weapon would you choose?</p>

<p>what seems off? he was shooting in to a condensed crowd of 22,000 people, you literally just spray in their direction with a gun like that and get hit after hit. </p>

<p>what isnt precise about an AR? or a bump stock shooting in to a giant crowd? you make it seem like he was trying to pick off people one by one, which we can tell by the videos isnt the case, he was wildly spraying the guns in to the crowd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the endgame is to inflict maximum damage, I&#39;d stick with the AR, but I wouldn&#39;t fire blindly from a 32nd window. As you&#39;ve noted, it was like shooting fish in a barrel, with a crowd of 22,000; imagine if he&#39;d been on the ground, and closer. Cut the range by half and you&#39;d have killed more people.</p>

<p>With the height, I would have thought he&#39;d pick something bolt-action, with the optic, and be more precise. Let the rush of the people, lead to death by trampling. It would take a lot longer to find the source of those shots because it wouldn&#39;t be the staccato of gunfire.</p>

<p>The whole point of the question was the range. It seems off to me, given the weapons chosen, and the amount of ammo spent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the prep, carrying at least 10 suitcases to his room, moving furniture, loading the mags in mass although without arthritis I&#39;ll give him that and that&#39;s after he loaded his car with the gear along with at least 50 pounds of explosives. The stress of planning and not being outed along with other daily issues like heavy gambling losses.</p>

<p>I heard a theory that he was on the anti anxiety meds to keep himself calm because he knew what he was going to do and needed help getting through it. That would be an indication that he can&#39;t handle stress which can cause heart issues in far younger individuals. The fact he went so far as to get psych drugs wouldn&#39;t put it past to think he had himself put on one of these &#39;anti-aging&#39; steroid regimes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normal capacity magazines in well made, properly maintained weapons RARELY jam.  I’ve fired thousands of rounds from an AR-15 Bushmaster and never had it jam on me once, including Firing so fast that the barrel literally flowed red in the night.</p>

<p>typically your weapon can jam when you do any of the following:
use shitty ammo
use a high capacity magazine (particularly drums)
Don’t clean/maintain/reassemble your weapon properly
Use a normal magazine but overfill it.  It’s best to put 29 rounds in a 30 round magazine, etc.</p>

<p>Also, an AR 15 has almost no recoil.  It’s like shooting a high powered aero soft gun</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t understand why the range is an issue for some people? I have some “military training” but not much outside of just basic marine boot camp and we were shooting with iron sights at 500 meters which is farther than this and a hell of a lot of guys could absolutely place shots on those. Even at 300 meters kneeling guys were shooting tight (within 6 inch) groups relatively often. Give any of those guys a fire grip, bipod, etc and they could absolutely make those shots all day. Shooting an AR takes literally no stamina whatsoever, the recoil is at best minimal. The only problem at that range would be the rate at which he was firing and staying accurate but he didn’t have to be accurate at all just spraying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More curious if the scopes on those rifles will accommodate a camera. I suspect there are some people who would pay $$$ to see a video of a massacre of American citizens. A second shooter in the room would have had an hour to dismount the cameras and take them along. Investigators wouldn&#39;t look in that direction for motivation unless a shooter POV video of this event surfaces.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about the number of cameras. The cameras we&#39;re aware of were for surveillance of the approaches to the room. This wasn&#39;t a limited budget effort. The shooter was supposed to be gun expert, so the long gaps between volleys weren&#39;t just for reloading. It wasn&#39;t for letting the barrels cool, either, that&#39;s what all the spare guns were for, the ones that never got used. Moving a camera from one scope to another could account for the time lapse, if he was limiting himself to camera adapted rifles and a livestream camera. (although it might be easier and faster to dismount the scope and move it to a new rifle with the camera attached, so I&#39;m probably just talking out my ass, here.)</p>
