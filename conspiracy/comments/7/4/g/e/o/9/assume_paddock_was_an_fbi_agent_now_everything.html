<p>Even had a foreign girlfriend - someone who wouldn&#39;t ask questions.</p>

<p>He owned homes in retirement communities, because they&#39;re quiet and unassuming.</p>

<p>He brought 19 guns up 32 floors because he was going to sell them, either illegally or as part of an FBI sting.</p>

<p>He set up cameras to record the whole thing as evidence. But never got to turn them on - something went wrong. Either he snapped, or he was killed and someone else was the shooter.</p>

<p>Remember, this guy would have had lots of interaction with the FBI as a kid - his dad was FBI most-wanted.</p>

<p>Either a rogue agent, or something went wrong.</p>

<p>No one is talking about this enough. He wasn&#39;t filming to film himself shooting people(what would be the point) but to try and cover his ass and get evidence of what really was going to go down in that room</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s changing because AMNO makes it obvious he either had help or was going to sell it. Swapping it to Tannerite makes you push gun control easier and supports lone wolf.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real, no one is going to mistake AMNO fertilizer for Tannerite. This is a purposeful change in the story.</p>

<p>Makes sense why the sheriff was told &quot;don&#39;t go there,&quot; when asked about the car by the press.</p>

But the FBI are federal cops, they don&#39;t control black markets and organized crime. The Deep State Does, this guy was a Deep State asset unleashed to murder and inflict the most violence on us civilians. ( not the first time either) It is important to remember that the FBI is designed to INVESTIGATE matters such as this. Unfortunately the Deep State is out of control and is waging war on America laughing at the FBI while doing it</p>

<p>The more I think about it though, the gun deal angle at least ties some questions together. But only if you approach it with the idea that the other party&#39;s plan all along was a mass shooting and the gun deal was just thier cover. They didn&#39;t want to do all of the heavy lifting and were possibly already on watch lists. They never needed 20 guns anyway, it was all part of the setup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the gunrunner theory came from a 4chan post, and i&#39;m not really buying it. The massacre was meticulously planned, it was not improvised. </p>

<p>There is so much wrong with the official narrative though. So many witnesses claiming multiple shooters. The distinct sound of an m240 light machine gun. The lack of photos / footage released. the questions raised by the &quot;leaked&quot; photos. It&#39;s possible the suspect was a fall-guy, and a few others actually escaped and got away with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, because most footage is from pretty far away, and at least on the 5.56 weapons the muzzle flash really isn&#39;t that much to talk about, and if you attach a flash hider, it would basically be impossible to see the flashes from afar with all that background lighting going on in LV.</p>

<p>Also take into the fact that he probably didn&#39;t stick his weapon out of the window but rather stood a bit further back (purely speculation), then you would almost certainly not be able to see those miniature explosions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that is driving me the most crazy, is two things.  1, the gun sounds far more like a M240 than any 5.56 weapon and 2. there is not a single video showing muzzle flash at all from either window?  Vegas is filled with cameras.  There has to be a security camera somewhere in vegas that looks towards that corner of the mandalay bay building.  There has to be a single shot showing a muzzle blast coming out of these windows.  There is no mention of any flash hiders on the weapons, and if you look at the pictures from the room there was no attachments on any of the guns.</p>

<li><p>Agreed, it does sound more like the belt fed machine guns i&#39;ve heard,</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah, it&#39;s weird, but if he did indeed keep the pipe inside of the hotel, the flash really wouldn&#39;t be seen with all the additional lighting from so many sources, BUT, if he had the gun outside, surely something should&#39;ve caught at least one flash as you say.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And, looking at the pictures I see a whole lot of attachments that usually do not come with a gun, such as Foregrips, 60rnd mags, holographic sights and scopes, so he did have quite an array of attachments on the weapons he used, so a hider wouldn&#39;t be impossible, but if it&#39;s not mentioned like the other attachments, he probably didn&#39;t have any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right Right he did have attachments, I should have said I didn&#39;t see any muzzle attachments (Flash hider or otherwise).  And while I do agree that all the lights in vegas could block our some muzzle flash, I would still expect to see something.  There are plenty of videos looking directly at mandalay, exactly where he was, and no flashes coming with audible gunfire.  That either leads to a second shooter (M240 IMO), or he was very very far back in the room.  Then if you look at the pictures from the room, all the shell casings and guns are right up against the windows meaning he would have been at least somewhat close to the window.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has looked at ground level for shell casings that may have fallen.</p>

<p>The theory is that he was setting up a &#39;sting&#39; operation against domestic ISIS agents. But, they caught wind of the sting, and turned on him. They kill Paddock and as an act of aggression against the government for tricking them, they do some terrorist shit. He probably picked casino rooms because:</p>

<p>1) When you&#39;re moving several million dollars through a casino every year, they don&#39;t ask questions about what you&#39;ve been doing.</p>

<p>2) He was overlooking a loud-ass music festival. You don&#39;t want to be doing a suspicious deal with foreign nationals on a quiet day; you want to do it on a day when you&#39;re literally directly across the street from the loudest night in Vegas. </p>

But here&#39;s something to consider. 
In the photos released of Paddock from before the shooting he clearly has a tattoo on his neck that looks to stretch from just about his collar bone to his Adams apple. 
In the photo released of the shooter dead in the hotel room there is absolutely no tattoo on his neck to be seen. 
Other facial features are also do not look the same but an argument of different angles and lighting could he made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. It was either a meeting with ISIS or the Mafia, and he was gonna be a whistle blower(that&#39;s what&#39;s on the note?) and leave the country, with is why the FBI ratted him out and got him killed. Then killed 58 people to cover it up.</p>

<p>While this might be confidential information vital to coming to accurate conclusions, something sure stinks....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I think I have it figured out. </p>

<p>Who is trump’s worst enemy, the one that can destroy his presidency and send him to prison? </p>

<p>The FBI </p>

<p>Let’s say the FBI was doing a sting with agent Paddock. Things go terrible someone goes rogue. </p>

<p>The then uncovers the “truth” that the FBI couldn’t control a sting and because of them many people were killed and injured. </p>

<p>This event discredits the FBI and the public loses their trust in the FBI. Trump wins in the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why meet at a super popular hotel/casino and why would the shooting start at all, from either party? It&#39;s so impromptu in this theory. They said he scoped out several other events, didn&#39;t they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that is driving me the most crazy, is two things.  1, the gun sounds far more like a M240 than any 5.56 weapon and 2. there is not a single video showing muzzle flash at all from either window?  Vegas is filled with cameras.  There has to be a security camera somewhere in vegas that looks towards that corner of the mandalay bay building.  There has to be a single shot showing a muzzle blast coming out of these windows.  There is no mention of any flash hiders on the weapons, and if you look at the pictures from the room there was no attachments on any of the guns.</p>
