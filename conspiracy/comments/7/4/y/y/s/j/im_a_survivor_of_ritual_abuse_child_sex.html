       The dark magic things that happened to me are the foggiest memories I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happened in old basements of old buildings (mostly) and involved torture by men in all black with black hats. Sometimes I was buried alive and woke up with all this dirt under my nails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know worse things happened Easter and Halloween.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there was blood. I know it was dark and horrifying, but I don't remember much else.

      </p>
      <p>
       1.)  What part of the world were you in when this happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.)  What sort of background did your parents have?

      <p>
       3.)  Are any of the people involved known figures?

       Most importantly, are you okay?

       I lived in Colorado, US when it started. Most of the bad stuff happened in the Midwestern US.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad's family has horrific abuse and pedophilia going back generations. All farmers. All Christian. All Midwestern.(Nebraska)  My mom's family I believe has less sophisticated abuse but still horrible and sexual. In the deep South.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't remember names but there were fancy rich men. And scary secret military bases where really scary shit went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm as okay as I can be I think. Can't find therapists trained for this shit. I hope speaking out helps me reach other survivors so we can help one another.
      </p>

       Thanks for asking if I'm okay.

       The rise of modern fascism (hitler  Mussolini etc ) seems to correlate with the modern hand held camera perfect for black mail. You mention military bases. Does it seem to you like there's black mail involved? I recently read that mao raped a 14 year old girl. I think there's a lot of evidence that hurler was a pedo himself. To much there to ignore in my opinion. Sometimes I feel like the only way all this madness could ever perpetuate is if there was a vast blackmail network keeping everything shitty.

       My parents got involved in some organized crime group because they're pedophiles. Sometimes I think this was orchestrated by my dad or his family because my mom is a lot younger than him, but yes. Pedophilia is a way to have power over others.

       My dissociative identity disorder system was deliberately created by my abusers. Electro shock and horrific abuse was used to reinforce it. This started when I was only about 3 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad knows how to call out certain alters and did until I was in high school. No I don't know how he did it but it doesn't involve words and touching my forehead somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once, my dad asked me if I remembered all the horrible things he'd done and when I said I had no goddamn idea what he was talking about he said, "It worked?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       A stupid ass thing for him to say, but his sincerity leads me to believe this was intentional.

       From what I can see (and I was never meant to be of use to anyone important, though I was part of something that catered to important people) it's a tool and a form of entertainment. It's also a source of income. People do not fuck around making money off of kids.

       Definitely worse and more organized during Easter and Halloween seasons. Rituals always involved an older man dressed all in black with a black hat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easter especially, I was placed on an altar. There were candles and I didn't understand why my mom let it happen. I was very young.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea I think there was religion at the heart of it all. These people were serious as fuck about what they were doing.

       I don't know but it's the reason I started looking into conspiracies in general. I think pizzagate makes people think ritual abuse and trafficking of children is something that is isolated to one group or one place or one time period.

       I was just reading about the son of Sam killer and his claims of being in a satanic cult. The investigators seem to have just brushed that aspect aside. Something about Satan seems to trigger people into disbelief. As someone who has experienced this do you notice satanic elements in everyday life that others probably don't notice? How prevalent would you say this actually is? How do people get roped into this life?

       My dad's family comes from a long mysterious line of wtf abusive psychopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       My paternal grandparents are rich but keep a low profile. I've seen their stacks of gold bricks and boulders of crystals they keep even though they live in an older house in a regular neighborhood. They buy expensive shit in cash and haven't worked since the 70s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't remember celebrities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about other countries. I remember being at airports frequently but I have no idea why I remember that. I don't like to be near airports.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALLLLL of my shit happened on or near millitary bases. In my opinion, this is where people should be looking. Not random ass pizza places. (I'm sorry y'all. But it's what I think.)  Especially underground millitary bases. (toddler hood spent near NORAD; have many dreams where I'm being driven up to the gates.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The mind control I experienced involved sexual and physical torture, paired with watching Fantasia and snow white over and over again. I was also taken to the Cheyenne mountain zoo at night and made to go through some kind of crazy survival shit in the fake landscape exhibits. Suicide programming done at the shrine of the sun, which can only be accessed through the Cheyenne mountain zoo, from my understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still deprogramming with the help of Allison Miller, the author and psychologist I trust most. I have tried therapy but there is simply no training for trauma based mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope talking like this will help shine a spotlight on the need for that training.

       Agree about the military bases, I've read several books about MKULTRA. It's difficult for most ppl to believe this has been going on for so long, almost right in the open.

       I got away from my parents in my early 20s.

      <p>
       I think whatever organized group had no use for my family before that though. My dad's programming started breaking down and he was seeing shit that wasn't there. Attempted suicide, refused to go when deployed (millitary) etc. But he was never dishonorably discharged. He is retired now and living out his days attempting to forget what he's done.

       I have had a hard time believing the idea that there is a secret Luciferian (or some form of Occultist) network filled with well-connected participants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to be insensitive but I have to ask this, but what is the nature of the ritual abuse?  Are the participants doing the rituals with a genuine belief that they are granted some power or is it just sadist sick form foreplay?  Have witnessed anything supernatural occuring?

       The holiday rituals are the ones where they seemed to believe something would happen as a result of what they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other times, like in the basement of the church, I believe it was mostly conditioning little girls to be scared and little boys to be sadistic.

       I believe you. From the age of 13 to 16 my dad sold me to his many well off "friends" some of whom were in the police force. There was literally no place to go for refuge...finally managed to get away at 16... by getting pregnant...it was the one thing he couldn't abide...

       Do you remember any specific places? Do you remember any specific ways that this all went about - like how it was organized or who it was organized with? You mention military/doctors.. have you browsed any public information of military/doctors to see if you recognize any? If you did, a sting operation could be put in place.

       she is a wonderful person and very kind, gentle hearted. She works very hard to try and expose as much evil as possible. To me, from her videos it shows she offers a huge amount of support to those who reach out to her. I find her to be very trust worthy and if you ever wanted your story to go more public to help expose, she'd do anything to help you I bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so sorry this happened to you. I hope you are as ok as you possibly can be and can find hope and help anywhere you look. I wish I could give you a hug.

       I'm so sorry for what you have been through. 
I had a hard time believing in the satanic rituals until my therapists told me she has nightmares from working with people who went through it. She said the stories she heard still haunt her, and that there is a very large satanic following in my city.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really have a question, but would like to suggest looking for a therapist who specializes in PTSD, and sexual abuse, if you haven't already. They may be able to direct you to someone who specializes in your kind of trauma.

       Hi, this is very brave of you to talk about this stuff, I hope you find some way of healing. Have you heard of Cathy O'Brien, she wrote a book about her experience as a project monarch presidential sex slave. The book is called "tranceformation of America". I would suggest reading it, but it is extremely graphic so you may want to be careful it doesnt trigger you somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my understanding, she with the help of her husband, managed to remember what had happened to her through some sort of writing therapy where she was able to write down the memories trapped in her unconscious mind. She released a book about that, I think it's called "A time to heal" so maybe that might help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best wishes.

       The rise of modern fascism (hitler  Mussolini etc ) seems to correlate with the modern hand held camera perfect for black mail. You mention military bases. Does it seem to you like there's black mail involved? I recently read that mao raped a 14 year old girl. I think there's a lot of evidence that hurler was a pedo himself. To much there to ignore in my opinion. Sometimes I feel like the only way all this madness could ever perpetuate is if there was a vast blackmail network keeping everything shitty.
