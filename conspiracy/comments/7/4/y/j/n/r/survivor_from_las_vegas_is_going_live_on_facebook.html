<p>The penchant that so many have for unthinkingly disregarding eye witness testimony is as ignorant, unthinking, and stupid as the penchant that other ignoramuses have for unthinkingly believing anything that&#39;s posted.  Both extremes are entirely moronic.  You definitely reside in one of the extremes.  Your ignorance is something you should definitely work on.  It does you no favors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shots that cracked loud and sharp were the ones that were very close to you. The crack is a sonic boom from the super sonic bullet traveling through the air. When the shooter was aiming across the arena from where you were at you wouldn&#39;t hear the bullets. </p>

<p>I guess the high frequency sound doesn&#39;t travel as far as a low frequency sound. </p>

<p>A bullet traveling faster than the speed of sound can be confusing. You would hear the sonic boom from the bullet as a totally different sound event. The sound from the rifle firing the bullet would come later since its sound had to travel through the air across the distance in order to reach you. The crack of the bullet comes first and the sound of the rifle that shot it follows a short time later.</p>

<p>There are several posts in various threads in this sub describing this that were made by several other Redditors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The speed of sound in air is constant, the frequency of the waves has no bearing on the speed they travel.  What you said is akin to saying, &quot;light travels faster when it&#39;s a bright light versus when it&#39;s a dark light&quot;.  No!  Speed of sound is a constant and dictated by the medium that it is travelling in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said anything about the speed of sound being different. You completely misinterpreted what they said.  </p>

<p>Gun is fired. Sound waves are generated, but the round making the sound is supersonic and travels faster than the sound waves. Round flies over your head, where the conical waveform of a sonic boom (or crack) is heard. Depending on the speed of the round and the distance from your location to the gun, the sound of the initial gunshot arrives after the round does, because again, it is supersonic.  </p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t all that complicated and is very well understood by people who are capable of understanding it.  </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t you ever heard the saying, &quot;You never hear the shot that kills you?&quot; If that round would have instead gone through your head rather than over it, you&#39;d be dead before the initial sound waves made it to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t understand what I meant...</p>

<p>The only time you can hear the sharp crack is when the bullets are nearby. The ones that are further away can&#39;t be heard. Yet wherever they are they can always hear the loud boom of the rifle every time it&#39;s fired.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do low frequencies carry farther than high frequencies? Yes. The reason has to do with what&#39;s stopping the sound. If it weren&#39;t for attenuation (absorption) sound would follow an inverse square law.</p>

<p>Remember, sound is a pressure wave vibration of molecules. Whenever you give molecules a &quot;push&quot; you&#39;re going to lose some energy to heat. Because of this, sound is lost to heating of the medium it is propagating through. The attenuation of sound waves is frequency dependent in most materials. See Wikipedia for the technical details and formulas of acoustic attenuation.</p>

<p>Course, you can just pretend along with some of the others that what is heard is two shooters. This fact has been pointed out MANY times in various threads by various people.</p>

<p>The laws of science are still in effect regardless of whether or not you or anyone else believes it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On another topic...</p>

<p>A high velocity bullet is traveling faster than the speed of sound. The bullet and its sound are heard downrange first because the bullet itself has crossed the distance ahead of the sound of the gunshot that is heard off in the distance.</p>
