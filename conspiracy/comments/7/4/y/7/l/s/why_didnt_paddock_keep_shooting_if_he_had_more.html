       If you were a shooter, and you were planning on killing as many people as possible before you got caught, why would you stop not even half-way into the arsenal you have? I think the answer is obvious. He wouldn't. He wouldn't stop shooting because he clearly had heaps of time to do more damage to the thousands trapped on the stage. The only way that I can see the shooting stopping is if the shooter dies or if he runs out of bullets, so what's the deal here? I believe that the shooting stopped because whoever was behind it needed time to kill Paddock, break his window, and set him up. If you didn't already know the following PAY ATTENTION:
       <br/>
       &amp;nbsp;
       <br/>
       Footage of the shooting has been proven time and time again on here using some excellent analysis.
       <strong>
        The gun that was shot out of Mandalay Bay was not a bump stock rifle, it was a 100 round belt-fed LMG.
       </strong>
       There is still a discussion debating which LMG it is, whether it's an M240, or something similar. Still,
       <strong>
        the audio has been proven to not be bump-stock fire.
       </strong>
       Remember this, because only bump-stock rifles were found in Stephen's room. No LMG's were found, which leads me to my conclusion. I believe based on my analysis of the windows,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74qrxy/i_dont_think_stephen_paddocks_window_was_broken/">
        here
       </a>
       which shows that Paddock's window wasn't broken during the shooting, along with the guns found in his suite NOT matching the gunfire, that we need to thoroughly investigate who bought the guest room at Mandalay Bay. Because I really believe someone else bought it and shot an M240 out of it. Even makes the two pistol shots heard make sense, if someone else did the killing of Paddock.

       For me- that empty hour is the
Biggest part of this mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the reasons you list.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take- it was the sec guard, Jesus.   He did "knock" on door at say 11 min into shooting- only to be shot at 200 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thinking- paddock thought Jesus was full on swat breach team, and this was the end.   I'm thinking.. he likely
Killing himself around 15 min in- and lay dead until swat showed up.

       All hail Jesus.  ????

       There is no proof any rounds were shot in the hallway. Certainly no gunfire heard that would support it either. I think the bullet wound in Campos is the second pistol shot.

       You see 200 bullet holes in the door? Escaped down that long unprotected hallway with 200 rounds being drilled down there after him? That's a killing field and he only has one very non lethal in the leg.

       There is no burn marks on the door still on the hinges or the door frame that indicate am explosive opening of that door. The glass light missing from the wall lays intact on the floor. The exit sign on the floor also is intact. There are bullet holes in the door laying on the ground but none in the other door. The door on its hinges is the door that opens with the handle the other requires pulling a top and bottom pin secured to the top frame and floor. This section is more secure than the other part of the door. Why is it the section blown off then? There is no way 200 holes in that door either

       Looking at one of the stitched together videos there are two bursts of automatic fire that are very muffled- which may indicate they were fired inside (through the door) but they're about halfway through the shooting

       Why would the CIA do this? Why would someone place a shit ton of weapons in his room to frame him when all it would take is a couple? Who got into his room while the police were watching all the doors? You cant just throw out theories that make no logical sense.

       As I said, it's more likely someone shot up the venue with an M240 and there were no weapons matching that in his suite. I think he already had the guns, and worked for the CIA. According to ISIS, he recently switched religions. If he was working for the CIA selling guns to ISIS, it makes a lot of sense that they offed him when he essentially switched allegiances (converting to Islam, ISIS claims his attack).

       It's not necessarily ISIS, and also have you actually read any of the Podesta emails? Or know anything about arms dealing and CIA involvement in it? We are actually currently arming Syrian rebels. Who knows what Paddock was doing on those Cruises to the middle east.

       Yes, but get out to where?  I am still waiting to learn how the closest stairwell was barricaded.  Was it blocked from the hallway or was it blocked from inside the stairwell?

       The only escape plan that makes sense is for him to go upwards into the Four Seasons.  But even still, he was shooting from his own room so they would know who to look for.

       This puzzles me too. Wouldn't the door open INTO the stairwell? If it was blocked on the outside, someone should have noticed. But then again, I'm shocked that the room service cart was left in the hallway outside a $800 per night room long enough to have a camera hidden on it on top of a plate with an overturned bowl on top of it, with black wires snaking into the room.

       True, if he in fact was shooting from his room. If he thought it was a simple weapons deal he wouldn't have made escape plans. The Four Seasons is reportedly owned by a Saudi Prince, and those upper floors have access to the helipad.

       A photo of his upper body has been leaked. The blood pattern under his head is strange. There is a large pool of faint blood with smooth margins staining the carpet, overlaid with a smaller pool of bright red, very thick blood with very irregular margins on top of it, coming from his mouth. Blood stains on his shirt in the center of his chest, a hand gun off the the side, drops of blood in two separate trails going in different directions.

       Seriously though. If he had a pistol, he's at a severe disadvantage. I don't think anyone would be that stupid to try and enter a shootout with someone laying automatic fire, especially without any knowledge of his set up inside the room, despite how heroic anyone wants to be. There's a reason and military breach the way they do.

       This is something I’ve touched on in other threads but hasn’t got much traction. If you shoot 7.62 or 5.56 indoors without hearing protection you would be disoriented and probably throwing up from the concussion, tinnitus and inevitable smoke and lead dust build up in the air.

       In a different thread someone brought up that the snorkel looking thing in the room could be a cpap machine or some kind of breathing apparatus for filtering the air. I have a hard time believing he had no hearing protection though. Especially if it was a breathing apparatus then it means he had the foresight to filter the lead filled, smoky air but not to have ear pro? It will be interesting to see what comes up in the next couple weeks because this whole thing is crazy inconsistent.

       Not denying it couldn't be a snorkel/other type of breathing apparatus, but highly unlikely it is CPAP.  every CPAP I have seen has only a tiny filter, and about a 6 foot hose, so it's not really doing much air purification.  I said in another thread you'd probably get much better filtration from a dust mask

       Yeah, but if you have surveillance set up to monitor the hallway, could have easily given yourself a small break while monitoring. His set up, down a long narrow hallway to reach him with 100s of rounds still loaded would have forced SWAT into a situation where they would have had to repeal down the building to get him, which would have taken even more time.

       If you have a belt fed firearm, why the fuck would you stop at 100 rounds? LMG's like this are typically loaded up with MUCH larger belts. Why only 100 when you have 20 100 round magazines for AR15 style weapons? Also like someone else said there there are no links on the ground in the photos. At least the lack of brass is explainable if using an AR with bumpstock, they eject with a forward trajectory from hitting the brass deflector. The majority of the brass likely went out the window. disintegrating links, on the other hand, are not ejected but gather near the gun. I think armchair warriors are getting all worked up on this LMG shit. even the sound is consistent with a bumpstock with irregular fire rate and what i feel are jams. Both bumpstocks and those 100 round magazines are notorious for jams. If whatever shooter did this had shot these prior they would know this. This is why I believe there are numerous guns. Not to change between when out of ammo, but when there are jams.

       Someone earlier claimed the brass could've gone out the window, but bystanders likely would be finding that brass left and right. No eyewitnesses mention anything about that. They'd probably be selling that shit on eBay because people are sick fucks.

       There was no M240 and there were no belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were 2 shooters. One was shooting at the rocket fuel tanks and Paddock was shooting at the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy shooting at the tanks ran out the door and barricaded the stairwells then escaped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Security Guard "Jesus Campos" unlocks Paddock's door. The police said he had keys. Jesus bluffed and said the police were there. This panicked Paddock who took off his ear protection and started to shoot at Jesus. He failed to kill Jesus who was still taunting him. Paddock then shot himself in the mouth and did not escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is a crazy theory. Was Jesus the other shooter and had a change of heart and attacked Paddock? Was Jesus executing Paddock as the fall guy? Or was Jesus a real hero who's identity and story is being protected by police to keep him safe from reprisals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are police withholding the real story in order to catch the other people with Paddock?

       An LMG fires bullets at precise intervals. A bump stock fires at irregular intervals which is exactly what you can hear in ALL the videos released so far. This is from info i found on the net, I'm no gun expert

       No, I think you're assuming that the 200 shots even happened. Look at what happened with Paddock's death. First LVPD said he killed himself, then now they say SWAT shot him.

       Paddock's door wasn't ajar. It was another door on that floor.

       It's not necessarily ISIS, and also have you actually read any of the Podesta emails? Or know anything about arms dealing and CIA involvement in it? We are actually currently arming Syrian rebels. Who knows what Paddock was doing on those Cruises to the middle east.
