        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a fun little social experiment....Answer in list form. </p>

<ul>
<li>Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.</li>
</ul>

<p>When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; <strong>&quot;the trump name is still very much a future asset for us&quot;...</strong></p>

<p>How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren&#39;t the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty? </p>

<p>Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position. Why was this a good move?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The point is, he lied to you, turned around, and &quot;got the band back together&quot; so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Explain.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments">https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Why did trump meet in private, and visited the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone are fucking incriminating as shit and, reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can you explain this? Are you OK with this and why? </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the &quot;terrorism boogeyman&quot; in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, &quot;bomb the shit out of them and take the oil&quot;. Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war? </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them? </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8">https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8</a></p>

<ul>
<li>You would agree that the CIA is a globalist and evil intelligence agency, correct? Why Is trump saying that the CIA is &quot;great&quot; and &quot;terrific&quot;? Why did he say that he was behind them &quot;1000%&quot;? </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cM">https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cM</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses? </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, after criticizing Obama&#39;s policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again? </p>

<ul>
<li>Finally (I will be editing more, stay tuned), also after criticizing Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips, is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000 dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these acceptable to you? Why are you willing them slide.</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions should be very easy for you to explain, considering your die hard and obsessive support for him as the current POTUS. How do these moves, which many of us consider to be terrible overreaches of power and authoritarianism, benefit our country and help take down TPTB? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liked his policies and thought he was a funny dude that appeared to go savage in alot of instances which I admired. Although that could have been a cover. I was also really hoping Hilary would action be placed behind bars. But I now know that&#39;s never gonna happen, and the knowing feeling just sank in over time.</p>

<p>I dont necessarily support him nearly as much, I do hope for the best and still hope he could be on the side for the people. But I just don&#39;t believe people are placed in a position of power unless they can be controlled. So its my theory Trump is just a distraction, and he may do some good and some bad in front of the public eye, but behind the scenes there are others doing much darker work in secrecy and Trump having no part of it while remaining a distraction for the masses while TPTB continue with their plans. Sad world, but on the plus side, I do feel the tides turning and that more and more people are waking everyday from this corruption and evil.</p>

<p>&quot;Because you&#39;d be in jail&quot; had me leaping out of my chair and pumping my arm like I had just won the lottery.  </p>

<p>...yet here we are 8+ months in and Clinton is still very much not in jail.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s because the situation is much more complicated and, well, political, than what we as citizens see. There&#39;s probably one legitimate path that sees Clinton is handcuffs, all the other paths are guaranteed failure because of how connected she is to the Deep State. It&#39;s like having one round in your rifle and you&#39;ve got a charging rhino coming at you.

    <div class="md"><p>That may very will be the case. Doesn&#39;t negate the fact that there is still a divide, and most don&#39;t take the time to see past that facade. 
You can say left or right doesn&#39;t matter all you like, but when it comes down to it lobbyists are still split in two. If the Right controls the majority of the House, you&#39;re not going to see the same types of laws being passed. So while it may not matter to the elite, because they literally aren&#39;t divided, us wage slaves still have to live in the society they created. That&#39;s why the media pretty much disregards independent candidates, our society unifying is bad business for them. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s my point. They all work together to further their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can completely sympathize with the view that trump is more of the same, as a trump supporter. He&#39;s done little to dispel the label that he&#39;s a neocon rino like others in the Republican Party. </p>

<p>The fact is even if trump is a saint the establishment is using him to polarize people and sow discord so that people can be shepherded back into as podesta would put it, naÃ¯vetÃ©. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted for him, but wouldnâ€™t say I ever really supported him.  Would have voted for McAfee if he won the libertarian nomination. Here was my reasoning for voting for Trump.  I donâ€™t trust our a government a single bit and believe there truly is a shadowy elite or whatever you want to call it, pulling all the strings. Iâ€™m ready for a drastic and radical change. What that entails, I have no idea. </p>

<p>The way I saw it, Johnson was my best choice based on his policies, but I think he would have made a terrible president based on his personality. He would have been eaten alive.  I saw a vote for Hillary as 8 more years of the same shit weâ€™ve gotten for the last several decades and I just didnâ€™t want that. Lastly we get to Trump.  He was just so different than any other politician from the very beginning and I loved every minute of it. It was so entertaining. Honestly thought he had a good shot from the very beginning because of it, regardless of his message or policies.  I thought then and still think now he is anti-establishment, but I make that claim based solely on the way he was treated by the media and everyone else you consider part of the establishment. It reminded me of what happened to Ron Paul.  All that said, my reasoning was this. I figured if Trump won either 2 things would happen. One being he was gonna back up everything he said, drain the swamp, GOP and Dems alike and actually attempt to fix this country trough yuuuge changes lol. That or he would fuck up on such a massive scale that it would spark an uprising or constitutional convention or something or other and would end up with, again drastic changes. Now to your question. I still donâ€™t believe him to be part of the establishment and truly believe heâ€™s an outsider, but I could easily be wrong.  I donâ€™t think heâ€™s been great or terrible and it has felt like more of the same, but hopefully that changes. </p>

<p>Iâ€™m no die hard trump supporter so I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m the person you weâ€™re wanting a reply from, but here it is. </p>

<p>Back to my reasoning for voting for him though. The right(or folks on the Donald) think heâ€™s fuckin God Emperor? Like wtf and the left is ready for a revolution. Blows my mind</p>
