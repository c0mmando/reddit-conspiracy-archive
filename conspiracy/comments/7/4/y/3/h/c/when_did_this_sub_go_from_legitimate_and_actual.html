<p>The sub has since focused on dismantling Democrat establishment theories about Trump and/or Russia, amplifying revealed quasi-conspiracies about Clinton and DNC, and trying to prove all the others (Seth Rich, Pizzagate, Clinton Kill List, Charlottesville &quot;hoax,&quot; now the Vegas &quot;false flag&quot;). A fair amount of &quot;work&quot; done on these have been fabrications, deliberately misleading, shitpost and meme-like efforts meant to be spread virally, regardless of truth or correspondence to sources or evidence.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories have become an American political team sport, as they have been in multiple contentious political situations throughout the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone is directly targeting the protagonists of every conspiracy theory, MSM, intelligence agencies, deep state, then of course people studying conspiracies and facts will side with them. Trump was targeted so heavily by the MSM, aka the mouth of the establishment. Every classic swamp member of the establishment attacked Trump including Intelligence agencies. Now I&#39;m not sure how new you are but the MSM and intelligence agencies are rooted in every conspiracy theory out there. Anyone they collectively attack is going to be the &quot;hero&quot; of every conspiracy theory and the one we should side with. Nobody has ever discredited the MSM like Trump has and thus, no political figure has fought against the establishment&#39;s interests like Trump has. You need to have a lack of simple critical thinking skills to not put two and two together. </p>

<p>trump has berated the press in general, apart from fox? afaik. now fox are as bent as they come, they are the epitome of fake news. doesnt trumps open approval of fox news seem a little hypocritical? doesnt it seem like a bit of a double standard to laud him for attacking the left leaning media, but ignore his approval of fox?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox has been more fact based and less biased than other news sources. A recent study showed they had about a 50% positive /negative coverage, whereas other networks, not only have had 95/5 splits, but have been caught blatantly lying many times and engaging in the questionable practice of the loud lie and quiet retraction. If Trump was openly supporting news pieces that were demonstrably false than it would be worrisome. As it stands the media climate we have is extremely deceitful. Because it is so demonstrably dishonest it isn&#39;t at all wrong to point out which news shows or anchors give good reporting. </p>

<a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/">https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/</a></p>

<p>Not saying that as a network they can be trusted. I think certain people there can definitely be trusted, especially if you know they are biased, you can hold them to the standard of providing primary evidence, having an honest standard of journalism, providing their analysis, which has a clear bias, and then you can make up your mind from there. Trump points the good ones out, like Hannity and Tucker. There is nothing wrong with pointing out honest journalists with standards. </p>
