<p>There&#39;s good reason for not immediately releasing every single detail of an investigation to the public. In the past there&#39;ve been problems with false leads from the public that have to be run down wasting investigators&#39; time, false confessions of involvement and even copycats.

<p>Is it censorship for a news website to use a Paywall? This is the opposite. Using archive links so CNN doesn&#39;t get click revenue isn&#39;t censorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cameras when you don&#39;t need them. Calculations when you don&#39;t need them. More guns and ammo than you need. Extremely low profile. No social media. He just seems like that type of person. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t buy the &quot;crazy guy&quot; narrative. He didn&#39;t just go crazy one day and decide to kill a bunch of people. He was extremely thorough. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so surprising we have no motive. If he was smart enough to do all of this, he would be smart enough to get his message across. Unless he didn&#39;t want to send a message...</p>

<p>I think he was supposed to get away. He&#39;s extremely smart, but not smart enough to realize when it&#39;s time to leave? He could&#39;ve gotten through that unarmed security guard. Something happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said to another poster, according to the Pythagorean Theorem there&#39;s a little bit of math involved. </p>

<p>If A is the height of the building, and B is the distance from the base of the building to the concert grounds, C is the square root of both A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2.</sup> This makes for a shot a little longer than a hundred yards and needs to be accounted for to be able to hit where your sight is zeroed to. </p>
