       The note itself has not been released to the press. CNN's story cites a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's good reason for not immediately releasing every single detail of an investigation to the public. In the past there've been problems with false leads from the public that have to be run down wasting investigators' time, false confessions of involvement and even copycats. People be crazy, yo.

       Well he had anywhere from 9-40 guns as per the inaccurate and varying reports. So maybe a calculation for each?
      </p>
      <p>
       And taking a shot at a higher elevation is different than taking a flat shot. If you remember Pythagorean Theorem, there's a difference between b (the ground distance) and c (the vector including his height to the target).

       Truth be told, I was pushing to have all MSM links banned and to have them rolled through archive, but those of us with that perspective didn't have enough say.  So we got CNN on the list, and for their crime it is worth it.

       It's not even censorship. You can post archive links of CNN.

       Is it censorship for a news website to use a Paywall? This is the opposite. Using archive links so CNN doesn't get click revenue isn't censorship.

       The first few shots werent heard in the crowd and were semi auto. He does seem like the overly analytical type that has to account for everything. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if it were calculations even though you obviously don't need them when you're only 100 yards out.

       Cameras when you don't need them. Calculations when you don't need them. More guns and ammo than you need. Extremely low profile. No social media. He just seems like that type of person. That's why I don't buy the "crazy guy" narrative. He didn't just go crazy one day and decide to kill a bunch of people. He was extremely thorough. That's why it's so surprising we have no motive. If he was smart enough to do all of this, he would be smart enough to get his message across. Unless he didn't want to send a message...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he was supposed to get away. He's extremely smart, but not smart enough to realize when it's time to leave? He could've gotten through that unarmed security guard. Something happened.

       Like I said to another poster, according to the Pythagorean Theorem there's a little bit of math involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       If A is the height of the building, and B is the distance from the base of the building to the concert grounds, C is the square root of both A
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       + B
       <sup>
        2.
       </sup>
       This makes for a shot a little longer than a hundred yards and needs to be accounted for to be able to hit where your sight is zeroed to.

       I really don't think paddock was sitting by the window drawing triangles to figure out how many millimeters north he should aim his automatic, but ok.

       I don't think he was either lol that paints an interesting picture in my mind. Could he have possibly drawn them in the days he was in his hotel room before?

       Also aiming is measured in degrees not millimeters!

       A long overdue nod to the time-honored practice of pressing ink on paper rather than typing. Young people take note.

       US snipers are trained to have a handwritten card of similar trajectories and distances. So does this add to the theory of a second shooter?

       Wasn't he using tracer rounds too? What's the logic in doing trigonometry when you can see where the bullets are going and readily compensate?

       Tracers are federally illegal (or so I thought), do you have a source for that?
