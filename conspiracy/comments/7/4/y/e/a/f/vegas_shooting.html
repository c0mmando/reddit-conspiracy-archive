So im watching the news about vegas and it doesnt make sense... some backround info on me... I have deployed 2x to iraq and 2x to afghan.  alot of the videos i have seen the rip of the first volley sounds a hell of alot like a SAW (squad atomatic weapon/ m249)  now on that note some other videos do show the abnromal cyclic rate of a bumbpstock but that first volley is a fully auto weapon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know nothing about guns but what I want to know is they say he fired from two rooms so was there any breaks in the firing that could be attributed to him running from room to room also he had many guns how many were found in one room and the other room, also camera looking through peep hole did it empead him from opening the door or was it taaped  or screwed to the door my point is how was it attached to the door</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno about that... im not a tinfoil kinda guy for the most part.  As i watch the videos and the first rip was a sustained rate of fire....  sounded cyclic.... for at least about 150 rounds.  that dude in the first volley never changed guns...  I stand by what i say that first rip is a fully auto weapon (IMHO a fucking SAW)  it does not sound mag fed it sounds belt fed and there is never a issue with feeding rounds.  those of us that know how  a mag weapon loads knows that any weapon going fully auto that isnt belt fed causes alot of issues</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that, assuming he knew that problems were likely, it&#39;s possible that&#39;s the reason he had 23 guns. Don&#39;t worry about reloading, don&#39;t worry about jamming or over heating, just empty one, and pick up a different gun....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ahh ok my bad no even though he had big magazines and bump stocks it still doesnt explain the amount of rounds fired per minute in all that.  if he was changing guns which he did and it does account for the breaks in fire.  what im sayin is the first burst wasnt any kind of modified gun it was a machinegun that i have extensive knowledge on.  I mean i get guys get pissed but im still having a hard time wrapping my head around this shit... maybe he went off the deep end and the only thing that makes sense is somekind of antifa shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you think he had a SAW. what is the relevance of that? again, im not being argumentative, i want your opinion.</p>

<p>antifa arent really a thing, they are a bunch of college kids that throw bottles of urine at police. before believing its antifa i would believe it was made to look like them and i dont think thats the case either. the thing is, despite antifa not being a thing it is making people suggest they are. that coincides with the theory that some party somewhere is trying to divide the country.</p>

<p>his last voter registration was democrat, that was a couple decades ago. his most recent hint of any political affiliation was that he mentioned he liked trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the reload isnt that bad provided the mags are already pre loaded maybe 5 seconds for a scrub private.  the clips in question alot of the gunfire from alot of videow do support the idea he had 30- 100 round magazines.  however the first volley of gunfire was not a magazine fed weapon.  IMHO it was a belt fed machine gun.  now it would take about 10-25 seconds to reload that.  alot of things dont add up on this.... maybe the police are holding alot of things in still but alot of my army buddies agree this wasnt your run of the mil firearm that opened up to start this sht</p>

<p>have you seen the interview done with the guy and girl soon after the shooting? she was talking about shooters on the ground and coming from all directions. particularly the way that people were forced to leave. i think this vid also puts that to rest and is a good example of how confused some peoples accounts can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen the video with the guy and girl. Yeah, eye witness testimonies unreliable as it is let alone when something as intense and chaotic as this happens. Also a lot of &#39;eye witness&#39; accounts of shooters on the ground and other casinos seem to mostly be &quot;we heard someone say there was a gunman&quot; rather than &quot;we saw with our own eyes&quot;. </p>

<p>At the start he seems to fire for 10 seconds at a time with 30-50 seconds between bursts </p>

<p>Have a watch of the video it&#39;s really good to get a chronological perspective </p>

<p>Also the second video is interesting as you can clearly hear two single shots after the automatic (and burst) fire is finished </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok so the first 20 seconds of the video i have an answer as to why it sounds like 2 shooters.... the cracks are the rounds flying buy   the softer thuds are the actual gun shot... remember most bullets fly faster than the speed of sound... however from the above video the first volley is about a 13 esco.  the 40 second mark to still have people standing around and no one telling people to get down is a bit strange.  the 55 second mark the rate of fire is sporadic so it could very well be a bumpstock there.  again the cracks vs the boom is the same shooter just the time it takes sound to travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no to me it does not.  you have to remember that alot of times with a 7.62 you will hear strange sounds as the bullet flys by.  fuck even with 5.56 same rules apply for the most part.  remember most bullets break the sound barrier so you hear the crack as the bullet flys by then you hear the boom from the gunfire.  if that makes sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely considered that. But the video in which I’m referring to you can hear 2 different gun sounds at 2 separate times making different noises. You hear one up close clear as day, and then you hear shots coming from far away (at the same rate of fire) and then from then on you only hear those shots from the distance. </p>

The &quot;far away&quot; gunshots have no echo, and are quieter than the echo of the &quot;near&quot; shots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers for the awesome analysis. One other question I&#39;ve been wanting to ask someone with firearms knowledge and experience - is there any chance the different weapons could have been from different places, but not fired at the same time? </p>

<p>The reason I ask is that there have been no official reports of a full automatic weapon in the hotel room (only ARs with bump stock have been mentioned) and I saw a picture in the linked article here (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74u0ye/you_know_like_every_64yearold_white_guy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74u0ye/you_know_like_every_64yearold_white_guy/</a> )</p>

<p>Also, reports on the police scanner that a van was seen leaving the Delano during the shooting.</p>

<p>So do you think <em>it&#39;s possible</em> the auto weapon could be coming from the Delano, with the burst fire being closer (from Mandalay)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you understand sociopaths, you understand how this has happened.</p>

<p>Sociopaths have risen in our society because they are ruthless, they will lie and do anything to advance themselves without any conscience. Then they will ensure that they have control as much as possible over those in the hierarchy below them, by employing people who are like them, people they can blackmail (e.g. for being a pedophile). They have the advantage of not having a conscience but being able to fake being a normal human - normal humans just cannot conceive of the level of evil and the lack of conscience, empathy and humanity these people have, so they don&#39;t get suspicious, they dismiss any intuitive feelings or whistleblowers etc as ridiculous. So these people end up being protected by the web of other sociopaths and moral degenerates they&#39;ve surrounded themselves with, and protected by the good nature of the general population, who just find it hard to believe that people they see on TV who act normal and like they have families and kids etc, could actually be the suited up, PR-buffed real life equivalent to Hannibal
Lecter. It sounds ridiculous to people, but that is the reality, and when you think about it you can really see how it&#39;s happened and how it&#39;s gone this far, especially with nepotism and how generational abuse produces more sociopaths, so these big wealthy and powerful families are hideously abusive, everyone in them has grown up in an environment full of narcissists, sociopaths and psychological, physical and oftentimes sexual abuse, and then they become sociopaths themselves and carry it on, like an intergenerational disease, that has at this point in history, infected much of the global power structures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean this is why guys will never believe a mass shooting? Because you might have to confront some ugly truths about gun violence. It&#39;s so much easier to just dismiss the act as a false flag rather than confront reality. There&#39;s no rabbit hole here just pro gun nuts pushing propaganda </p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;amp;v=5vdeHMqCscs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;amp;v=5vdeHMqCscs</a> between 6min 9 secs &amp; 6min 18 secs</p>

<p>You hear one continuous lower pitched gunfire with smaller overlapping intermittent bursts at a different cadence.</p>

<p>Echo unfortunately does not work like that. People will try to mislead you saying it&#39;s sonic crack as the bullets are closer...</p>

<p>BUT.... it wouldn&#39;t happen only part of the time it would happen all of the time which it clearly doesn&#39;t in aforementioned video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the evidence against the multiple shooter theory? Because all I have seen and heard that there weren&#39;t multiple shooters is that the authorities and the media said so, whereas there is the police scanner audio and seemingly hundreds of eye witness accounts that say otherwise. As for the footage appearing to show sounds of multiple guns being fired, I&#39;m not expert enough to know, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be definitive either way, I&#39;ve seen people give convincing arguments for it to be echos etc, and others give convincing arguments that its multiple gunfire.</p>

<p>So when you say the evidence is tacked against it, please at least provide the evidence so that we can see, because there&#39;s a lot of counter evidence that it has to obliterate.</p>

However the higher amount of corroboration from unrelated sources the more likely it is that the events witnessed are truth, and the less likely they can be written off by human error.

I had a friend that worked for a high end gun store, and I mean high end. It had it&#39;s own landing strip for rich mothefuckers to fly in, land an airplane, pick up their guns and leave.</p>

<p>He sold M2 .50 cals, which are belt fed full auto, grenade launchers (I want to say 30mm, because 40mm was illegal for civilians to own) rifles galore, pretty much anything you could imagine, they sold it. </p>

<p>This shop also had a range where you fire all the weapons. If you were never military or LE, you can watch videos on YouTube to learn how they function, then go out and practice. They aren&#39;t very hard to use. </p>

<p>Nothing about what you brought up is strange or out of the ordinary, just if you&#39;ve never paid attention to it before now, it seems farfetched and surreal. I was prior military and am a gun but, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised in the least to learn he was using a 249 or some other full auto weapon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually surprised he didn&#39;t use a suppressor. All that money on guns, but he didn&#39;t buy or build suppressors for them. That would have made him even more deadly because he would have been harder to find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t. People seem stuck on the &quot;arms dealer&quot; thing. His brother was saying &quot;one man army&quot;. I think Paddock or the body was framed and it could be a false flag. The group could&#39;ve taken him hostage, brought their own guns, shot, left their stuff and killed him.</p>

<p>The interviews with the brother are really weird. Real I aren&#39;t shot like that or happen so quickly without lawyers involved...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, there is a post floating around conspiracy somewhere that says something about some dudes theorizing in a video that some of the sound signature from the shooting matches up with the sound signature of an m240 or something like that. Maybe get with them and use you mil experience and their tech and see what you can make of it. Sorry to be vague and sorry if it turns out to be s shit post, I just skimmed it and didn&#39;t know what to make of it. I&#39;ll try and find the post and drop the link, I saw it a couple days ago, but I have to go do some other stuff so forgive me if it doesn&#39;t show up or I can&#39;t find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m far from knowing what I&#39;m talking about, but what would be the noise difference in shooting out the window toward the streets, compared to shooting the hallways and shit inside the room? Wouldn&#39;t that make the shots a lot more muffled while he was supposedly firing 200 rounds at the security guard? And you can hear on some videos where the shots sounds are clearly different. I&#39;m all for it being a bunch of different reasons, but no one has really talked about how muffled the shots could be shooting inside the room instead of out the window. 
Also the angle he would have to be leaning out the window, wouldn&#39;t that make for most of the shell casings to eject right out the window or hit the frame/curtains? So the shells inside would for sure be from him shooting inside the room obviously but you&#39;d think there would be a ton of casings beneath the window. Right where all the glass should be. </p>
