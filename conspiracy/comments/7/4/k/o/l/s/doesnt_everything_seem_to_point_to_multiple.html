       From everything we've read thus far, my theory of some kind of "cell" is growing, though I don't completely rule out that a guy with the means to make a big event, went crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about how many guns were brought in, and also not brought in, how about the explosives, and their specific use?
      </p>
      <p>
       He brought up way too many guns to use alone, two perches, but he....also planned to escape, which means he couldn't just sit there for an hour firing off thousands of rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       He shot at jet fuel tanks, but he had explosives which are basically perfect for helping blow up a fuel tank in the car, which makes me question if someone else's job was to get those explosives over to the tank to be shot and ignited.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems this entire operation was built for at least two or more people to carry out, but Paddok was left alone, so he did his part, realized it was compromised and shot himself knowing he wouldn't be able to escape. Perhaps the reason he thought he could escape, was there was supposed to be so much carnage happening all around, that the police wouldn't be able to mobilize on him as quickly or at least not with their full focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Las Vegas is a very corrupt place that covers up crimes and murders on a daily basis to keep the tourism dollars coming. I'd estimate that dozens of violent and/or unsettling crimes are swept under the rug each day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be in A LOT of people's interest, to keep the idea of multiple conspirators still at large completely out of the public unless they had no choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lone wolf won't destroy business, the bad guy is dead, but if we knew there were more potential attacks by an organized cell of some kind, people would be cancelling their trips left and right.

       Bingo. Paddock was an idiot and didn't disable the smoke detector in his room, while the FBI/CIA spooks were one step ahead, planned on using Paddock's inexperience/trust against him. I've seen enough personal accounts saying multiple shooters that it'd be surprising if it were false.

       Super villain orchestrates terror plot, forgets to tape up fire alarm.

       Fire alarm goes off, alerting police according to early reports. Yet now itâs reported first on scene is a security guard reportedly patrolling randomly who is by all reports a dead set hero and after getting shot is the one to alert police as to the shooters location.

       No there was another person in there with him. There was absolutely no reason to break two windows and run between them to fire when he could have just stayed in one and conserved his energy and time. Another person was in the room using all the extra ammo and firearms with him. They bailed early, most likely to go initiate another âphaseâ of the plan. Instead, they bailed completely became one of the many bystanders running for their lives.

       well since we now know there are no cameras in the hallways, and they certainly knew that, it would be super easy to just walk right out of there, IN FACT, since they had cameras on the hallway, another person would have known it was clear to make an exit and maybe even walked out with other patrons who left their rooms, or perhaps he/she had a room on the same floor and simply slipped right into another room posing as an innocent bystander.

       I don't believe that there were no cameras. The Four Seasons Hotel within the Mandalay from the 35th floor to the roof is where all of the Saudi royals and some extremely well-heeled people routinely stay when they're in Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The security and cameras within both parts of the building would be tighter than a drum due to that and all the staff would be on the watch for anything even slightly suspicious or out of the ordinary due to that.

       Not when the safety and security of royalty, and most especially Saudi royalty, and extraordinarily wealthy people from around the world are concerned. If anything happened to any of them it might well cause an international incident, so yes there are extraordinary security measures that they're also not going to admit or reveal anything about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The super rich that stay there of course pay for that kind of protection and they also pay for that security to be discrete and keep their mouths shut about anything that might publicly embarrass any of those clients who spend a pile of money every time they visit and stay in that very hotel precisely because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Four Seasons at the Mandalay was a huge money maker for the chain and it's pretty plain that it's going to be making a whole lot less off it now because this incident was
       <em>
        allowed to happen
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Four Seasons will probably be compensated in some way for that "inconvenience" or has some back up plan to keep and look after those major clients somewhere else in Vegas after this.

       The words "confirmed" and "most likely" don't fit very well together in the same sentence, in which case it's better to say it's been "implied" or "inferred", instead.

       It may well be confirmed that there are no

       I completely would believe this theory. If Stephen truly has a wound in his stomach then he could've been shot by his accomplice. Stephen was found in the main room. Second window in the adjoined room is on his right hand side behind him. It's quite possible that this is a two person job and Stephen was set up as the patsy while the other person left to do more or hide nearby. There was enough time for them to do so given that swat took near an hour to breach. I skimmed the police scanner and recalled hearing the security guard that got shot went down a few levels way before the swat team got to the 32nd floor to breach. Definitely enough time to getaway.

       If the security guard got popped with a small caliber pistol round and not during a rifle spray down the hallway then it would account for the first pistol shot of the last two rounds fired in the whole ordeal. I seriously wonder how much of him the cops actually saw and when....and also how much the cameras that were set up  actually saved what they were filming.

       More likely the first pistol shot was him shooting Paddock in the head and the second was him shooting himself in the leg. Escaped in plain sight.

       Could be if he had accomplices, they rented other rooms on the same floor and escaped there since there were supposedly no hallway cameras.  I'd imagine police are looking into anyone that stayed in the hotel in this timeframe.

       Oh absolutely. I feel like youâre probably going to be right in the end. Hell, Iâve done maintenance in condo buildings my whole life. He could have busted the second window out to allow the wind to blow through and clear the smoke after the room started filling up,  too. For some reason, those buildings always have a huge pressure difference if you open more than one entry point for the air to flow through.

       It's definitely a possibility, the things that make me lean towards a single shooter is the audio (no point where two people are shooting at the same time, at least from the audio I've heard) and no reasonable explanation why the second shooter would have bailed only a few minutes in (don't think he could have left after the security guy gets there). If one or more security people were in on it, that could explain it, but that seems like it would be an easy (or least easier) connection to make.

       I think those are some of the logistic reasons that keep this from being a real debate and keep it in the âconspiracy theoryâ territory. Youâre correct about all of those. Any other ideas are basically pure speculation at this point. For me, itâs almost 50/50. I feel like itâs a coin flip. Either things are exactly how theyâre saying or something
       <em>
        big
       </em>
       is off. Honestly, I hope itâs just a crazy dude who had the means,  time, and physical ability. As scary as that would be as far as our ability to mitigate future attacks, it wouldnât be as scary to me as an entire group of operatives working behind the scenes to murder large groups of American citizens to accomplish different agendas like taking our rights and making their buddies lots of money...

       I agree with you 100%, there are things that just feel off about it, but the more I look at it, the more I feel like it's a guy who had some sort of weird fantasy of the perfect mass murder event but once he got to the point of execution, everything started to fall apart. People talk about the planning, but I just don't see anything particularly complex about what he did. He bought a lot of guns (not hard for an older rich white guy), rented a hotel room (again, not hard or unusual for him) and carried a bunch of bags to his room, which is weird but again because of his demographics probably wouldn't get a second glance. It looks like maybe he thought about explosives and possibly thought he could escape n but both of those things would have taken real complex planning. I don't want to end up on a list, but I can think of at least 5 things I can think of, off the top of my head that wouldn't have been particularly hard but would have made his chances of escaping higher. But even then, he didn't even try to hide his identity, so what good would escaping have done? If it's a cover up for something, why make it look so half assed?

       Yeah. Iâve been telling people for years that it wouldnât be particularly hard for a person to pull something like this off. There are too many ways weâre open to it. Not even firearms related. Society has to operate on a high degree of âtrust that guy wonât do something fucked upâ...and that something could be anything humanly valuable in day to day life. Iâm not going to going to get into it, but as a new father, itâs becoming much much easier to see the ways Iâm vulnerable, and society as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think thatâs whatâs scary about these things. Thereâs no way to keep them from happening AND remain fully free ourselves. At least if it were a shadowy group of conspirators we could do
       <em>
        something

       to stop them.

       No way was it a single shooter. Several videos floating around of multiple, simultaneous automatic gunfire from differing locations. Multiple witnesses from the concert coming forward saying the same.  In rereading your comments, it actually sounds like you're trying to go back and rework the narrative, rather than even mildly examine that which is already public.

       Based on the last two shots in all the different footage, two small caliber handgun round were fired ten seconds apart. That could mean exactly what youâre hinting at or it could me absolute jack shit lol

      <p>
       Thatâs what is so interesting about speculating about this thing. For every different possible scenario, there are a lot of random clues to suggest each one is at least possible and the harder you look the more you find to support what youâre looking for.

       So you think they were the shooters that some employees and patrons are reporting in other casinos? Seems odd to me that someone wasn't up there with him raining down bullets since if escape was the plan, it would have had to be a fast shoot and run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also seems odd that explosives were ready, but not used. Maybe one of them got hung up or couldn't make it in time, but I'm really thinking someone was supposed to get those explosives over to the tanks and either shoot them from a distance or leave them for Paddok to hit with one of the scope rifles up top.

       and why is he there for days and days for such a simple operation? was he just having one last vacation before carnage? if so he didn't make much of it. Seems more that he was planning everything out as perfectly as possible, so all this sloppiness of explosives left in the car, him only shooting a few of the guns, taking a long time between bursts, doesn't add up.

       You can shoot fuel tank all you want, but a gun isn't going to ignite JP-8. It needs to be atomized to ignite. You can literally put out a match with JP-8, the flash point is really high.

       The only way the fuel tanks would've done much is if they'd suffered a massive breech, letting all the JP-8 spill out and spread over a wide area while on fire/before ignition.

       To be fair, "planning everything perfectly" pretty much just involved buying some guns, booking a hotel room and spending a few days smuggling them into the room. Nothing we've seen is overly complex, and it was made even easier by the fact that he's a rich white guy. The stuff that would have actually taken real planning, like explosives or a viable escape route, didn't happen.

       Was there footage of that lady screaming that stuff?  Because all I saw was the interview with the teenager who made the claims. Assuming that the screaming lady story is true, it would show that she had her hand in this in some way, shape, or form.  But the thing that sticks out to me is why she didn't inform the police?  Or what if she did, and they ignored her?  We need to find out who it was that was screaming that shit, and get an interview out of her.  That would be the key to blowing this wide open.

       I don't remember where I saw it, but I read that the blue tube is part of a breathing apparatus, not a go pro mount. Also, he used a video baby monitor as his camera, which they don't record but you can stream as long as you have the address.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question is, who would he be streaming to if that is the case.

       The live stream would be to himself, streaming footage of what is in the hallway to himself.  At least that is what I gathered from the evidence, anyways.  Many others here have also arrived at that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you remember if anyone stated why he would be using a breathing apparatus?  Because I can agree with your conclusion on what the blue tube is, but I don't get the purpose.

       That is completely plausible.  Its not like he wouldn't know a few nasty people, especially considering what his own father was involved in.  He could have easily been manipulated and made a fall guy while the real assholes got away.

       The amount of force needed to break those windows even with a hammer is surprisingly high.  The tape would help protect him from slicing up his arm after he nails the window with a hammer and it punches through.

       Honestly I wouldn't even say he planned it out well. I mean yeah. He set up a couple cameras to check a hall way and apparently the lobby. Still 'shot himself' with plenty of time to carry on shooting or escape like they suggest he wanted too. If his goal was specifically loss of life he could of done it much better, especially if he doesn't mind dying at the end. It's not like they had ANY idea who he was at first. He could of just put another bullet in the security guard and ran out of the room screamin about a gunman when he sees police. Got his pistol, got in his car and gone boom.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is he got wet feet after shooting security because of how close he was lmao, shooting at people from a 32nd floor across a street would be like playing CoD if your down for murder.

       I didn't think about it until you mentioned about shooting the guard and ran down the hall steaming about a shooter. He could have easily done this and gotten away with as much hysteria that was going on and the fact that he was well known at these casinos. He could have easily gotten away in his car and detonated the explosives or just drove off and claimed a new identity. The dude had a butt load of money so it wouldn't have been an issue for him to take that route.

       Exactly. The question is why didn't he. Evidence he wanted to escape. Okay. So why didn't he?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) somebody set him up as a fall guy and they got away.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) he really had no plan to escape and decided he didn't want to risk being captured. If this is the case then why have a car filled with apparent explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Apparent arms deal setup for CIA gone bad with ISIS.   This isn't ISIS style. Youd know if it was ISIS by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Suicide because the security came in and it broke him out of his trance. You don't do this kind of shit without atleast sort of zoning out. He saw security. Panicked, assuming they knew where he was( If I was commiting mass murder and someone walked in id assume they knew too) and realising what he'd actually done, shot himself
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd stop trying to think of reasons why he did it and start trying to work it backwards. Why didn't he leave in the hour or so he had before swat arrived

       This is apparently a clever man, after all.

       No they wasn't. He'd had a good 10 minutes after shooting security until the two police officers arrived. And even then they didn't sit outside the room they sat in a stairwell so he couldn't escape and they wanted reinforcements. Then did room to room clears because he'd stopped shooting. At any point he could of ran away shouting about somebody with a gun. Nobody would of even tried to stop him.

       Ooooorrrrrr... it was all a set-up from start to finish complete with a convincing enough look-alike that could pass for Paddock who was already a marked man and deliberately lead into a trap to get rid of him and some dirty guns that will never be seen or heard about again after this as part and parcel of another and even more spectacular mass shooting incident to push the same agenda forward that's already right back on the table and will move the police state yet another step closer to an even more complete control over the public than it can already exert.

       You're correct but wrong in this case, this was explosive material that can ignite by being fired at, which leads me to believe it was meant to either take out those jet fuel tanks which would have been a massive explosion, or it was meant to set off a fertilizer bomb where the crowd would be retreating. All this leads me to believe that thankfully, someone didn't do their set up job as planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an out there theory, what if the crazy woman that told everyone they were going to die and was escorted out, was the woman seen with Paddok, and also was supposed to be planting the explosives but got tossed by police?

       Remote detonation isn't hooking an egg timer to a wire plugged into a brick of C4, it's a little more complicated, not to mention shooting a nice big target of that type of explosive is easy to do and safe for the shooter at a good distance.

       Whut? You're seriously arguing that a timer or remote detonator would be a worse option than shooting indiscriminately at it and hoping for a spark?

       The rest of your theory is kinda intelligent, then this random piece of videogame logic. Was the car filled with barrels that were painted red? Everyone knows they explode when you shoot them.

       The tanks may or may not have been the target, maybe he planned to drop a bag of the explosive by the exits, or like I said, maybe an accomplices job was the explosives, all I was saying is it's one of the easiest ways someone with no training would use that stuff to make a massive bomb, especially used with something like a jet fuel tank.

       Not true, I shoot rifles all the time here, I guarantee you I could hand you a dialed in rifle that you could hit a bullseye from a thousand feet away, you don't need training to hit a backpack that far away, you could certainly hit it within a few shots.

       Fair point, I've only ever shot a .22 and .303 Lee Enfield with iron sights, I imagine it'd be quite different with a dialed in scope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, a remote detonator seems like it'd be the better route IMO.

       I agree with you, I'm just looking at what he had and what it's used for, it's also simple and legal to get and frankly why complicate things?
      </p>
      <p>
       A detonator can malfunction, the range might have been overestimated, this is an old guy who probably never did much fucking around with electronics and even basic wiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind his plan was way easier, you can fill a couple bags with that, drop them off anywhere or by a bigger target like fuel tanks, and one shot makes it go up.

       What thread was that? I've seen a couple that he's patsy, but I have a a hard time believing it, he was even dressed like Dexter, he was pretty tactical for an arms dealer, or patsy, I think he did the shooting.

       I posted above that I think the crazy lady telling everyone there were going to die might have been the one who was supposed to plant the explosives by the tanks and where the crowd would be running to exit, but she got thrown out because she couldn't contain her insanity and complete the plan.

       No accomplices just the people that were actually there to carry out the mission. I think the extra weapons were there in case they had to shoot their way out to avoid capture. The operation went as planned and they killed Paddock and escaped without needing to use them. Who cares about them being left behind. It just causes
 more confusion and speculation for us to ponder anyways.

       YES especially after watching the brother's interviews!  I think the brother may have known and was supposed to be there.  Also check out this video of a body language analysis of the second interview:

       Motherfucker.... this made me think of how one of our beloved alphabet agencies went and encouraged a mentally ill person to try and carry out a bombing.  I am going to have a bitch of a time pulling that info up because I saw this story months ago, but the basic story was that an undercover agent or two started chatting up the ill person, trying to encourage him to carry out some sort of bombing attack with them.  When he started to follow through, he was busted and put in jail.  Part of me thinks this could be a senario, but instead of intervening, the agent(s) let him do his thing, perhaps to push an adgenda.

       There are dozens of documented cases of this and hundreds, maybe thousands of cases where it was never proven or even saw a court or committee but the evidence is overwhelming, including the first world trade center bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have spooks all over the internet in dark places where fragile people go to vent, including 4chan, darknet forums etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt it's "ISIS" converting these people on forums, I fully believe these are operatives from right here helping push these people over the edge, helping them acquire whatever they need and plan the operation. Then the agencies are the ones who get to seize all the computers and potential links and tell the story however they want.

       I think a lot of us know by now that ISIS was created by the U.S. to serve as a convenient boogeyman to pass more surveillance laws and invade other places.  Funny how "ISIS" claimed responsibility even before the shooter was known.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyways, i agree with you on pretty much everything there.  Our shitty fucking alphabet agencies have been getting away with this for so long, and i do anticipate that they had at least prior knowledge that this was going to occur.  False flag events have been very frequent recently, and I am sure it is because they are testing the waters to see what works and what doesn't.  Perhaps it is all one big PsyOp to get us all to surrender our rights for the illusion of safety?

       Las Vegas isnât as corrupt as youâd think. Yes, yes. I know; where there is power there is corruption. But to say something like âLas Vegas is a very corrupt place where they cover up murders and crimeâ no, what?

       I live here too, and perhaps have a little more access to the higher ups than you might because of business dealings.

       A LOT of crime is swept under the rug here, and depending on where you live and how often you are at the strip, you'd never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live in the suburbs like most, and rarely come to the strip, you have no idea how much is hidden.

       Did you know that a serial killer was offing tourists here quite often a few years ago? Oh you never heard that? probably because it would have been bad for business. He was never caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 1000 people die here each year, some of natural causes, some of suicides, some of accidents, but a good number of deaths are "reclassified" into less scary labels to make an unfortunate thing like murder, vanish.

       It was never in the media like that, law enforcement suppressed it but someone was killing random tourists in a pattern but those deaths were labeled as suicides to not set off a panic that someone who had access to hotel rooms was sneaking in and killing people.

       it was some sort of arms sale/sting, with the expectation the attack was planned for that night. the initial plan included the bomb that was found in the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       the woman warning people at the front of the stage was involved and the shooting of the crowd, that seems to be entirely conentrated on that area in front of the stage, was actualy an attempt to kill her.

       I would bet money the hotel security personnel are known to at least some of the local PD. Seems unlikely as an escape route.
      </p>
      <p>
       An accomplice, or someone else, could have been in another room on the same floor and escaped as a scared guest. Also unlikely, but more likely than the security guard fake out scenario in my opinion.

       Maybe he killed himself so early because he realized no one else was participating? Like by 15 mins in he shouldn't have been the only one shooting/blowing things up so he knew he'd be on the hook for all of it with no chance of escaping.

       This is my theory, I don't think he had a change of heart, I think he knew the plan was fucked, that people were caught or they freaked out last second and bailed on him so he knew he was the only target and couldn't get out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other potential to me because those handgun shots are 10 seconds apart and completely out of place is that someone was in the room with him, they might not have done any shooting, but they killed him to make sure he wasn't taken alive or surrendered so that he couldn't give up their identity, and then they walked out of the other suite, into another one.

       Eric and Stephen did the shooting together, Eric bailed and Stephen took the bullet as he has got a brain tumor and had not long to live. Watch the interview with Eric. totally nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why there's two windows blown, 'two shooters' etc. It was both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The adjoining doors betwee the two rooms was locked and had to be blown. If there was just one shooter using both rooms, he wouldnt lock the internal door. The security guard mentioned that the external door was adjar. This is because Eric left. They deliberately chose a suite next to the stairwell so he could escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen and Eric look and dress similar, they ID'ed as each other which is why Stephen was in the hotel earlier than it appears. That was Eric.

       It's has to be the gun industry. They had been losing money since the republicans took control of the house, Senate, and white house. Sales have been falling this year and they were losing money. Why not carry this out knowing the democrats would get back on the "gun control" horse? They are making money again with the stock market and panic buyers.

       The gun industry doesn't lose money, sales are always lower when more gun friendly politicians are in office and people don't have a sense of urgency to stock up, however events like these are not good for the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short terms sales skyrocket of course, but each horrific event pushes more and more people into the anti-gun crowd even gun owners themselves start supporting the idea of banning most high powered high capacity rifles, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gun industry, if anything, wants people saved by guns so they can say "look how this crisis was stopped by a good guy with a gun" People being terrified of mass shootings isn't a good long term play.

       He did not shoot himself. The pistol's placement defies physics. If he shot himself that pistol would be by either hand. Not way above his head. Also he has two gun shot wounds one in the head and one in the torso

       Been reading all the comments about how he planned to get away, maybe thinking they wouldn't know it was him but the cops showed up too soon. Problem with that is the hotel staff knew he was there.  Room service, comped room, paper trail on all the guns. If he actually did this shooting he didn't plan on getting away. Even if he managed to make it somewhere with no extradition treaty he would have to assume we'd still get to him somehow. But...I don't think he was alone. I'm really leaning to the idea he was a patsy that had no clue he was about to become involved in someting like this. He was used. Setup. Put down. Hell, at this point I wouldn't be surprised to find out he didn't even bring any of those weapons in. Clueless fall-guy for whatever weird shit was going down, with the real perps planting enough firepower to focus everyone on him and burning off kust enough of it to make it plausible before making their escape. Or not.

       Maybe he planned to disappear to the Philippines, maybe he planned to escape only to create more attacks and die no matter what at some point soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       People vastly overestimate their abilities. How many criminals thought they would get away with it? besides like I said, no one says he planned to live 30 years on a beach, it said escape, not how long he planned to survive after.
