       Upvotes have been at an all time high. You know those joke comments that make everyone laugh on the rest of Reddit that never make it on r conspiracy because we take each other seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea just about every thread has a joke comment too upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "regular people" are here in large. The normal circle jerk is broken. Which is okay because it's making us work harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if we're being fostered and encouraged. There may be more to say but I'll leave it at that.

       Maybe it is just that more people than normal are seeing the cracks in the official story. They're coming here to see if we "crackpots" are putting any significant pieces together, and of course many of them, being classic redditers, will disparage us vehemently as soon as they believe they see the slightest flaw.

       You wish. The real world is the one we live and walk around. 99.9% of the people we interact with everyday are dead asleep. They are so easily manipulated. The information has been won. Reddit is hard proof of that. This sub "new" fans are bots and Spez's admin control group cleaning up the corners of information people could find by accident on Reddit...lol

       I'll be honest I came here looking for people who instantly thought it was a false flag or whatever because that always happens after this sort of event. And then the pics got leaked and I saw it here first and the "official story" doesn't add up so here I am listening to "crackpots" who have been far more informative than any other website or subreddit I've been on.

       Well if I can speak for the community (I am in no way able to speak on behalf of this or any other community) I say welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is true that for every event,
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       here will claim it is a false flag. It is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, after looking at the fine details of so many of these events, I really don't feel confident at all in telling you which ones are real and which ones aren't
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be a double-think going on in the public when it comes to these conspiracies. Everybody knows the government lies to us. Everybody knows the media isn't very trustworthy. Everybody knows our leaders have skeletons in their closets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody has seen real, factual, honest-to-gob-conspiracies happen, whether it was Fast and Furious under Obama, Iran-Contra under Reagan, the Tuskegee experiments, operation Gladio, operation Paperclip, MK-Ultra, operation Mockingbird, the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as soon as you point to a specific conspiracy that might be happening now, suddenly you're crazy for thinking that the government/media would lie to us.

       I don't call the assumption of every public terror event to be a false flag to be a knee jerk reaction. It's the
       <em>
        rational
       </em>
       reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       State run terror (real or hoax)
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the absolute norm. Private(aka amateur) terror is extremely rare because it requires resources most private people simply don't have access to without "help".
      </p>
      <p>
       At the most you could claim that open crime cartel related terror is "private" in some fashion but personally I consider it a dangerous mix between private/corporate/state terror agendas.

       A few minutes perusal through the comment histories of these
       <em>
        jokers
       </em>
       should be enough for anyone to see their true intentions. Anyone who unwaveringly parrots the MSM narrative whilst attacking other users contributes nothing to the conspiracy sub, yet these type of comments garner the most upvotes lately. The number of critical thinkers active in this sub has also mysteriously been elevated beyond normal in the past few weeks. How odd..

       I know my comments aren't as informative as average here as I tend to ask a lot of questions and haven't been paying as much attention to shadowy stuff lately.. but now I just check the new tab here religiously. I don't buy the arms dealer story. I'm just waiting for some way for this to make sense. And in the meanwhile maybe it's time to hear what people have to say in questioning the central narrative at sandy hook.

       Any one who compares comments to others is automatically suspect. No one here gives a fuck about quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just give your best guess. We research your comment. Look at it on google. Then try bing. The try livelink. Then try specialities.
      </p>
      <p>
       We give thought to a no nothing post. You make it clear that you are trying to "fit in" by asking what to do.

       You are not a Truther. You are a joke. And you made it clear.

       I am not a main theorist and primary researcher. I'm here for semifinished and fully finished products. As such I don't give a flying pig fuck whether you think I'm a duck or a MKULTRA victim.

       But there absolutely are sinister neoliberal elements at work here. I see them in most threads. Trying to divert discussion from constructive paths.

       I've been a lurker on this sub, first comment was yesterday... Vegas  just doesn't add up for me. I guess I'm looking everywhere for ANY sort of motive because I just don't want to believe what I "feel" really happened. Even on Facebook, grandma's are not even buying the narrative! I think that is the why on the uptick in traffic of this sub.

       I am not a regular to this sub...well I wasn't until now. I've always said that conspiracy is a necessary way to test what you are told is true. What happened in Vegas gave me an excuse to delve deeper. (Puts tinfoil hat on) I am now one of you.

       I'm just going to say, I've been lurking here a long time, and didn't believe any of this "the sub is being infiltrated" stuff. However, my mind changed when I saw someone question why anyone should be investigating the LV shooter at all. That's when I realized there are actually people in this sub trying to dissuade independent thought and just accept the narrative.
