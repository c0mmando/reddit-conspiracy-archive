<p>Yea just about every thread has a joke comment too upvoted.</p>

<p>And the &quot;regular people&quot; are here in large. The normal circle jerk is broken. Which is okay because it&#39;s making us work harder.</p>

<p>I wonder if we&#39;re being fostered and encouraged. There may be more to say but I&#39;ll leave it at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if I can speak for the community (I am in no way able to speak on behalf of this or any other community) I say welcome!</p>

<p>Yes, it is true that for every event, <em>someone</em> here will claim it is a false flag. It is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction at times.</p>

<p>But honestly, after looking at the fine details of so many of these events, I really don&#39;t feel confident at all in telling you which ones are real and which ones aren&#39;t</p>

<p>There seems to be a double-think going on in the public when it comes to these conspiracies. Everybody knows the government lies to us. Everybody knows the media isn&#39;t very trustworthy. Everybody knows our leaders have skeletons in their closets. </p>

<p>Everybody has seen real, factual, honest-to-gob-conspiracies happen, whether it was Fast and Furious under Obama, Iran-Contra under Reagan, the Tuskegee experiments, operation Gladio, operation Paperclip, MK-Ultra, operation Mockingbird, the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>But as soon as you point to a specific conspiracy that might be happening now, suddenly you&#39;re crazy for thinking that the government/media would lie to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t call the assumption of every public terror event to be a false flag to be a knee jerk reaction. It&#39;s the <em>rational</em> reaction.</p>

<p>State run terror (real or hoax) <em>is</em> the absolute norm. Private(aka amateur) terror is extremely rare because it requires resources most private people simply don&#39;t have access to without &quot;help&quot;. </p>

<p>At the most you could claim that open crime cartel related terror is &quot;private&quot; in some fashion but personally I consider it a dangerous mix between private/corporate/state terror agendas.</p>
