People are coming forward with ridiculous amounts of detail.  Back when 9/11 happened, the internet was still somewhat new to many of us, and yet, we have many theories as to what happened.  Does anyone care to speculate on this?  I kind of feel like this case is potentially totally transparent, and that there are old fashioned minds running this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never seen or heard so many people challenging what the gov / media is saying about this. Majority of witnesses are claiming there was more than one shooter. I am also hearing the exit wounds are far bigger than what the claimed .223 could do which is why I am thinking a M240 was used as the sound is very similar. There is so many things wrong with what we are being told I don&#39;t know where to start or leave off, but I feel it was out of &quot;our&quot; control once the shots started taking place; being an act of terrorism on someone else part - not Paddock. I think he was just the face of an arms trade gone bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is body cam footage of a cop on the north end of the festival. Shots rang, people run and we meet a bald man who was shot in forearm. Very sad actually because he was shot in chest and didnt realize it, we see his reaction when notified he has been shot in chest, very sad. Anyways the exit wound on his forearm is massive, like hollow point style. You can find it online im sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, bullets are known for not making clean exits wounds after hitting a human target.  Human tissue causes projectiles to slow down rapidly causing them to rotate and twist while passing through flesh.  They&#39;re going to already be slowing at 300-400 yards down range.  The effective range of most assault rifles is 500-600meters.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if any sort of MG or LMG was used, including an M240, we need to ask where are the metal links for the ammo belt(s) that would&#39;ve been used?  In the released pictures I don&#39;t see any evidence that a belt fed weapon had been used.</p>

<p>Plus, if he actually had an M240 at his disposal the death toll would be significantly higher.  That weapon has a listed effective range of 800m, over twice the distance that most victims were from the shooter.  Not to mention that it would&#39;ve been a far more stable platform with a simple bipod making his selecting of targets far easier.  Another weapon I&#39;ve seen proposed is an M249, which has a range of 700m.  Either way, the theory of a belt fed weapon is a bet shakey.  The multiple long pauses in bursts of fire don&#39;t really fit with the idea.  Perhaps if he could have been fumbling with belts in the dark and if someone had provided him that weapon he is not used to then maybe.  However, I&#39;m more inclined to believe that his long pauses were from moving to the two different shooting locations and switching weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Internet has been around awhile. I don&#39;t think that changed things. Personally, I think what has changed this go around is faux influence on social media. We have been seeing this creep up lately even regarding Russia. They pay to play. It&#39;s not out of the question for shills to behind the onslaught of conspiracy theories being thrown around where before you would have had just little ole me posting. These theories (some of which make valid points others that are garbage) are making it quickly to my Twitter and FB feeds. Maybe they want us to question the official story blaming this administration further dividing us? Who knows why. I do know that in the past I would have to seek out conspiracy information and this time it&#39;s being brought to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there are several theories that could account for that. Could be that it&#39;s jsut SO many people are questioning and seeking out such information that their algorithms can&#39;t hide it. Could be that there are warring factions within TPTB, some good and some bad, and that the good guys are doing their best to push the truth out. Could be that they want people to realise the truth about this global evil pedo terror elite conspiracy so that there&#39;s a reason for trashing the whole global establishment and starting again with a &#39;new world order.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there actually an &quot;official media story&quot; though? From what I&#39;ve heard/seen/consumed, from both the press and LEOs (LVMPD, FBI, etc.), there&#39;s lots more to investigate, almost certainly other players involved (according to Sheriff Lombardo and the FBI guy), and no motive they&#39;re confident in sharing yet.

    <div class="md"><p>DJT was the force that broke it open. Love him or hate him, you can&#39;t deny him the credit for all of this. He made Chief Conspiracy Theorist a Cabinet level position with Bannon after all. Or you can just accept him as the force that makes you question all reality or your will to live, but regardless he&#39;s the one that has dragged everything into the open. </p>

<p>People hate his tweets, but the affect is not dissimilar to the classic cross vs. a vampire. The people that are incapable of living their lives without their narrative being puppeteered by The Powers that Be are literally shaking in the sunlight of candor and truth. These are not reliable nor principled people. </p>

<p>Once you reach the age that you&#39;re able to reliably assess that no one around you has any better clue than you, then your perspective changes. You realize that every person and every thing is a tired cliche. You realize that you can basically get fucked, get drunk or get high and they all have their price...and then what? After you&#39;ve &quot;done it all&quot; in every far reach of the world then what&#39;s left?</p>

<p>Frankly, not a lot. You find a thing that makes you happy and you do it..or you don&#39;t and your life ends in very different circumstances...</p>

It&#39;s been surreal to watch how the Media has reacted to losing complete control of &#39;the narrative&#39;.  It&#39;s so odd to me that Trump is a buffoon and such an easy target...yet the media keeps making shit up to beat him.   They are so used to lying about reality that when reality presents such an easy target they can&#39;t hit it.... </p>

<p>I was hoping a smart person with integrity would be the only way to fight their bullshit...nope, they know how to tear down good people....turns out it took Rodney Dangerfield goes to Washington to make THEM look equally foolish.  I feel like I&#39;ve learned so much about mob mentality over the past year yet understand even less about other humans than before.  I feel vindicated that the Press is as horrible as I&#39;ve always claimed (even shittier than I thought) yet can&#39;t understand how THIS buffoon IS their kryptonite?  Yet here we are.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty libertarian, which means I tend to resist any particular party viewpoints.  Also I generally assume people are less capable than they seem, not more.  Trump seems to me to be all persuader and bullshitter with very little drive or capacity for technical scheming.  I&#39;ve met so many &#39;successful&#39; people along my life who fit that mold.  They don&#39;t have any real skills or deep intellect, just an air of confidence born of having a good instinct for persuasion.  I think he just got lucky that his weird personality was a good fit for reality TV and he&#39;s milked the hell out of being in the public eye ever since.  He&#39;s a real life Zaphod Beeblebrox who believes he&#39;s way more shrewd than he is....yet the results are the same because of his bombastic confidence paying off enough to make it seem like 4d chess.  I&#39;d bet any actual russian laundering was something one of his toadies came up with along the way.  Not saying Trump isn&#39;t a crook.  I honestly don&#39;t care.  Just that he&#39;s not some great mastermind.  It&#39;s strange to me how so many people either think he&#39;s an evil mastermind or strategic genius.  </p>

<p>Part of that belief is the deep state stuff is pretty bad and I get more enjoyment believing a simpleton is doing so much damage to the insiders.  It&#39;s like the movie &#39;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot;.  He has no idea what he&#39;s doing but the outcome is &#39;as if&#39; he does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem like a well meaning person, but I still downvoted you. Donald Trump is smarter than you comprehend. He is a New Yorker. He talks too much and says things people from New York say. He&#39;s also a guy who grew up rich when playboy magazine defined what a rich intelligent man should look like. Donald Trump is 70 years old. He is an incredibly healthy old man who gets called every name in the book but never gets called what he actually is, as far as observable reality proves... a political genius, and thus far nothing more. </p>

<p>He is no Beeblebrox, no Vonnegut creation. He is a real man, not from the greatest gen, nor a Boomer. He is more than you give him credit for (the man who knew too little, give me a break).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I hope you are right.  It&#39;s just my guess and I&#39;m as misinformed as the rest of us.  I do like that he just says what he&#39;s thinking and doesn&#39;t have that annoying political-talk filter.  I also think he means well and has the best intentions for this country versus many opponents who are in it more for Machiavellian bullshit.  </p>

<p>Though a political genius who&#39;s incredibly healthy?  Come on now.  He&#39;s a great persuader and knows how to work a crowd, no question.  But he&#39;s also lucky to have gone up against the most unlikable candidate ever.  </p>

<p>Again, maybe I&#39;m wrong and he really is playing 4D chess but my money is on him just being so bumbling and unpredictable that the media&#39;s well-oiled spin machine has to keep re-calibrating.</p>

<p>Kind of like being a really skilled fighting game player and you get beat by a newbie button-masher.  I think Trump is a button masher, you think he&#39;s a skilled competitor.... the result is mostly the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think Trump is just a part of the conspiracy of Divide and conquer, however..<br/>
Let&#39;s say (theoretically) he is for the good of humanity (secretly), would you rather him drag all of the stuff he knows out into the public and get JFK&#39;d, and shunned by the media for telling &#39;lies&#39; (which they would no doubt claim, ramblings from a mad crazy man, they have been building that narrative regardless), or try to blame another nation off as doing it, or another U.S. citizen (and try to use that person to wedge us against each other, further dividing us). Who knows what would happen, if the U.S. would erupt into civil war and try to overthrow the oligarchy of control that currently exists, the people that are truly behind everything are wealthy enough to just leave the country and avoid it all together.<br/>
If he is working for us, he could just be doing so covertly behind the scenes, in which case his ideals would live on, and intentions would become clear (maybe) throughout whatever happens throughout his term.<br/>
Ultimately, I think he is a part of the conspiracy, the only reason he is wealthy after all, is his family &#39;played the game&#39; so to speak of working the system that was put into place, and have been successful at it, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason he would personally want to change that (unless they care about equality and actual freedom for everyone).<br/>
But who am I to know the motives behind what anyone does, we are all humans with our own wants and needs, and maybe there are ultra-rich people out there, that do want the world to be living in peace and prosperity rather than war and strife and profiting so much off war and death.</p>

<p>And referring to Albert Pike&#39;s letter (referenced in your linked discussion): I don&#39;t see how Pike&#39;s plan for WW3 to unleash atheists and nihilists is working right now. Instead there is a genuine &quot;good&quot; spiritual component at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have overheard quite a few people talking about this one. Not on Facebook or anywhere on the internet but in real life. The Las Vegas shooting is so screwy not many people are buying the official story at all. They definitely raised some eye brows by telling so many lies over the last few days. </p>

<p>As someone who has been woke for a very long time I am not sure why &quot;they&quot; even did this shooting. They are not going to be able to grab the guns. Maybe the vampires needed feeding. The Obelisk / Luxor / 91 harvest symbolism is all there for this being an occult ritual. Ultimately I feel this was an energetic occult ritual NOT a gun grabbing event. This is something the masses aren&#39;t quite ready to understand yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet started as a novelty. Eventually it became a supplement to other mainstream sources. But now that the young people that grew up and developed alongside the internet are gaining prominence, more and more people are choosing the internet’s vastness of information over the limited and diminishing scope of the standard media that used to be so universally accepted. Now it’s not uncommon to hear about people without cable or even televisions. </p>

<p>Before the internet, there was the news, and it was considered a trust worthy and reliable source of information. But now that the internet is exposing all the many sides of the truth, lines are being drawn and fragmentation is multiplying. Today, choosing a primary news source is almost like choosing a favorite sports team, based more on loyalty than logic and rationality. This fragmentation will only continue further as the infants of today being raised on iPads develop into tax paying adults. </p>

<p>Things will never be the same. But I don’t think it’s safe to assume the powerful establishment will ever surrender their influence over the thoughts of the world so easily. They may have been slow at first but it’s more than apparent that their tactics have long since incorporated the internet’s particular form of disseminating information. Every time the people at large evolve beyond their grasp, they develop new and more cunning forms of control. The truth will always stand, but it will become more and more difficult to know who to trust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thread and the comments have solidified it. I do belong here. I’ve been discussing conspiracy theories with my dad and boss for the last few weeks. It started by a discussion on the Vietnam War series on PBS leading to distrust in govt. and then we started discussing JFK, 9/11 and everything since. 
We’ve discussed the fact that people are opening their eyes to what’s happening, and our technology is making it so much easier to ask questions and dissect everything. THEY weren’t counting on us using their distraction methods (internet, social media etc) to help us open our eyes. 
But I do question whether or not being active on this sub will put us in a position to be scrutinized.

I know we’re constantly being watched and have been for years... but maybe we’re being bated so that the puppet masters have a list of people who distrust the govt ..

    <div class="md"><p>In the days before the printing press, actually manufacturing print media was difficult and costly. This ensured that only those with existing money and power would be able to do it. Then the printing press revolutionized everything. It used to be rare to know how to read, but with books plentiful, literacy among common folk started going up. This social change brought on revolution around the world. Even so, however, power was still consolidated. Not just anyone could write a book, and even if they did, printing was still cost prohibitive even with the Advent of the printing press, so established power still had the power to gatekeep what gets published. Same idea for other forms of media that came later, like TV, radio, and film. It costs a lot to produce, equipment is expensive, so wealthy get to play gatekeepers. </p>

<p>The Internet is this kind of revolutionary change and the world is still not used to it yet. Literally every person can be carrying a portable TV studio in their pocket that can instantly broadcast to the entire globe. Any person who sits down to write a book can publish it themselves and even give away an infinite amount of copies to anyone they want. Because of the low cost to entry, anyone can do it. They can&#39;t gatekeep like they have for centuries. They still try, like with YouTube cutting ad support for politicial channels they want to censor, but they can&#39;t stop the people from freely distributing among ourselves. As time marches on, technology is going to make us more and more de-centralized, and that de-centralized will ensure our media is democratized. We still have to deal with the corporate media spewing propaganda, but they&#39;re obsolete and losing power every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty libertarian, which means I tend to resist any particular party viewpoints.  Also I generally assume people are less capable than they seem, not more.  Trump seems to me to be all persuader and bullshitter with very little drive or capacity for technical scheming.  I&#39;ve met so many &#39;successful&#39; people along my life who fit that mold.  They don&#39;t have any real skills or deep intellect, just an air of confidence born of having a good instinct for persuasion.  I think he just got lucky that his weird personality was a good fit for reality TV and he&#39;s milked the hell out of being in the public eye ever since.  He&#39;s a real life Zaphod Beeblebrox who believes he&#39;s way more shrewd than he is....yet the results are the same because of his bombastic confidence paying off enough to make it seem like 4d chess.  I&#39;d bet any actual russian laundering was something one of his toadies came up with along the way.  Not saying Trump isn&#39;t a crook.  I honestly don&#39;t care.  Just that he&#39;s not some great mastermind.  It&#39;s strange to me how so many people either think he&#39;s an evil mastermind or strategic genius.  </p>

<p>Part of that belief is the deep state stuff is pretty bad and I get more enjoyment believing a simpleton is doing so much damage to the insiders.  It&#39;s like the movie &#39;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot;.  He has no idea what he&#39;s doing but the outcome is &#39;as if&#39; he does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, bullets are known for not making clean exits wounds after hitting a human target.  Human tissue causes projectiles to slow down rapidly causing them to rotate and twist while passing through flesh.  They&#39;re going to already be slowing at 300-400 yards down range.  The effective range of most assault rifles is 500-600meters.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if any sort of MG or LMG was used, including an M240, we need to ask where are the metal links for the ammo belt(s) that would&#39;ve been used?  In the released pictures I don&#39;t see any evidence that a belt fed weapon had been used.</p>

<p>Plus, if he actually had an M240 at his disposal the death toll would be significantly higher.  That weapon has a listed effective range of 800m, over twice the distance that most victims were from the shooter.  Not to mention that it would&#39;ve been a far more stable platform with a simple bipod making his selecting of targets far easier.  Another weapon I&#39;ve seen proposed is an M249, which has a range of 700m.  Either way, the theory of a belt fed weapon is a bet shakey.  The multiple long pauses in bursts of fire don&#39;t really fit with the idea.  Perhaps if he could have been fumbling with belts in the dark and if someone had provided him that weapon he is not used to then maybe.  However, I&#39;m more inclined to believe that his long pauses were from moving to the two different shooting locations and switching weapons.</p>
