        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Over the last two days I have seen more posts on facebook about the shooting in Las Vegas than any other mass shooting or terrorist attack to date, especially when it concerns the multiple shooter theory. I understand that there will be more activity because of this happening in the states and the scale of it, but it still seems like an abnormally high amount. </p>

<p>One thing I haven&#39;t seen once shared on FB, and have only seen a few sparse posts in here about this, is this man&#39;s potential CIA connections and the possibility of this being some sort of arms deal gone bad or ISIS attack with a pasty. IMO this is the real story here. (i am not sold on the multiple shooter theory, crucify me) Not only is the multiple shooter theory being focused on, but people in here are defending it more overtly and aggressively than I have ever seen before. (I received some of this backlash, so I am slightly biased) </p>

<p>Earlier as I was getting ready to respond to another person who was in dismay that I didn&#39;t think there was multiple shooters, I had one of those thoughts that you have to do a mental double-take on. What if the real story is the CIA/ISIS connections and all this spam we&#39;re seeing is an active participation to push the skeptics view from the real issue to something trivial? It would explain all the aggressive participation in here and the unusual traffic on FB.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that is necessarily the case. The increased activity and semi-hostility could stem from this attack hitting so close to home, and I admit this stems slightly from my personal biases on the matter. However, I think this is something we should consider in all news and conspiracies, especially this one. In the technological age that we find ourself in, any real cover up will have an online presence, here especially. Just food for thought. Remain critical of all theories and explanations until proven true. Then question some more.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I believe too, at this point. Contradictions between Daesh &amp; FBI (even if linked at all possibly on some others levels) also did make sense into this.</p>
