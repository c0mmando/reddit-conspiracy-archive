      <p>
       You're the one who has to explain away genocide and the most vile form of racism on the planet.  Good luck with that.  I say good luck because in order to rationalize it, you have to invent reasons that aren't found in the bible, or search in other parts of the Bible, and retroactively apply them to Canaanites and Egyptians.
      </p>

       Please, explain why the slaughter of the Canaanites, and the infanticide of all Egyptian firstborns was "required".

       Ultimately the context begins in Genesis 3:15 and Genesis 6:4. The Canaanites were involved in genetic manipulation of humans and animals and that's why even the animals were to be slaughtered on some occasions and laws in place killing the animals in case humans had sex with them, and the Passover has a few meanings, #1 that faith and obedience in God will preserve your life, #2 that disobedience from God will mean death and #3 maybe the most important one that this is a foreshadowing of what God himself was going to allow happen to his own firstborn of the creation, his only son the Lamb. Who would have his blood spilled out symbolically as the lamb blood on their doorposts.

       Hahaha.  Genetic manipulation.  By Canaanites.  Hahaha.  That's the most hilarious stretch I've heard in a long time.  Thanks.  Every man, woman, child, animal, and stone in Jericho had to die, because they had secret, (unmentioned) genetic engineering labs hidden in them.  Good stuff.

       And your excusal of the infanticide of Egypt is vapid, has no meaning.

       The genetic manipulation and unauthorized hybrids are mentioned many times, first mention is in Genesis 6. Deuteronomy 3:11 describes the king of one of these old tribes as having a bed 9 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. That's over 13' tall and 6' wide. Not to mention Goliath and other giants. If you don't we want to accept the Bible or these things written in it that's one thing but the Bible 100% describes the genetic tampering that happened.

       You should imbed the verses themselves, so people can see for themselves the hilarious leaps you're making.  I'd do it myself, but I'm not ready to end it, yet...
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's clean it up...  If you're over 7 feet tall (Goliath), or have an unnecessarily large bed, every man, woman, child, and animal in your state must die?  Well praise the lord!

       It's the DNA tampering that gets you in trouble, the flood was sent to wipe out the ancient world because of what was going on, the stories of ancient Greece and the Titans and the hybrid creatures is real and supported by all religions. The same technology is being ushered in as we speak. Once you cross species  something happens and it is an abomination. Genesis 3:15 was the division and plan to save mankind and talks of a seed (genetic) war that was coming, Satan knew his plan would fail if the perfect man Jesus was born and he almost succeeded in defiling the whole earth pre flood by manipulating the DNA of man to prevent this.

        21 Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.

       I'm sorry what do you mean? What I'm saying is that if God hadn't wiped out everything with the flood everything would be ruined. Noah was found "blameless, or spotless" meaning he had no manipulation done which is what preserved the line.

       He wiped out all the giants.  Every living thing, supposedly, except Noah's family.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, unless they went through all that effort, but smuggled some super giant on board without god, or the writer, or anyone else noticing, then there wouldn't be any more giants.

       There it is, your disdain for the Bible. You're not seeking truth or understanding or anything else because you don't want to believe in God. Might as well live up and own up to it, I was once like you funny enough but hey everyone's on their own path.

       I'm just reading your own Bible back to you, there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that if this bible god is real, then he's exactly how he's described in his own Bible.  Bloodthirsty, petty, vindictive, genocidal, infanticidal, cruel, plotting against his own and all others, and manipulative to evil ends.  It's all in there.  You just have to read it, after you've removed your lifetime of brainwashing.

       I read that God killed the giants, and everything else.  That's a big problem, if they mysteriously popped up much much later in the Bible timeline, with no mentioned source.  And the Bible itself doesn't even really get into the nephelim/giant connection.  That's an Enoch thing, so still not "biblical".  Goodnight.  I'm out :)

       Call me crazy, but I don't think shouting down people who say things you don't like is the best way to go about it. You can speak up yourself if you want, or you can just ignore it and go on with your life. Telling somebody to stop talking is hardly ever a good idea.

       No, man. Even that calls for tolerance. Being intolerant of what you see as intolerant is just more intolerance. If somebody says stuff people don't agree with, they'll go out of business in the marketplace of ideas.

       While Christ stated if you plan to uphold the laws you’ll need to do it perfectly or else it’s in vain; Jesus being the only one to do so. As far as less pesky rules; they asked Jesus about Adultery and Murder and he said whoever commits those in their hearts has already commit the sin. -In my eyes that seems infinitely more difficult and not “Lite” on the contrary it seems to me to be even more “stout”

       Please show me the verse for your first statement, keeping in mind that (supposedly) he then let ~2000 years worth of Jews live and suffer under the punishments of the first covenant, with literally no hope for salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Jesus regularly flouted many rules of the Torah, so if he was supposed to be the only one to fully uphold them, he failed miserably, by his own admission.  Looks like you'll have to wait for a different human sacrifice to come around.
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw, if you've ever trimmed your sideburns, sucks to be you, but you broke the law.  And if you rape somebody, make sure that nobody hears it, so it can be her fault.  You'll get to either marry her, or kill her, then, so it's kinda like a win/win/win for Jews and Christian's.

       If a person doesn't believe in God, it's important that they understand what the Bible says, so they'll have the correct interpretation, rather than holding on to any misunderstandings of the Bible.  Because some may believe that the Catholics who went on a crusades and killing protestants, will label those Catholics as examples Christianity, when in fact Jesus would have condemned what the Catholics have done to people in history.

       If you want to properly refute the bible, then you shouldn't be ignorant about what the bible says.  Live how you want, but if you have to say anything about Christians and Christianity, then you should properly educate yourself about what the bible says, just as I have and I've read the Quran so I can properly refute it without being ignorant.

       My belief that a God doesn't exist seems pretty relevant to the topic, since he is here to explain what the Bible really says. You know the book which claims a God exists.

       Luckily I was introduced to rational thought and the scientific method, and realized that a collection of writings by primitive savages from thousands of years ago isn't really a good touchstone to build my life on.

       Plenty of people have misconceptions about the bible, therefore it will be beneficial to correct how they view the bible, and by doing so we'll be able to discuss bible prophecies and how they relate to current conspiracies properly.  At any rate, I believe this topic has been long overdue and the people tend to be very interested in this subject.  Cheers

       I'm here to talk and understand people.  There are atheists who believe they know the bible, but in actuality they assume they know and have been fed disinformation from atheist websites, rather than reading the bible &amp; understanding the context.  There's seriously a large disinformation campaign against the bible being perpetuated by people on this forum.  cheers

       A person can come to understand the Bible.  The bible says that Jesus is The Son of God, therefore the only understandable interpretation is that He is who He says He is and to understand that Jesus died for our sins.  Some things need to be interpreted, while some things can be understood easily.  If a person doesn't want to believe in God, then they'll find anyway to twist scripture to fit their narrative.

       No you are acting higher than other people because you interpret the Bible a specific way. There are wildly different factions all reading the same book, because they interpret it in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them believe they truly understand the Bible, because they think they are smarter than everyone else.

       I don't think I'm smarter than anybody else, there's a ton of people who misinterpret the bible on this forum.  There's people here who believe that they know about Christianity just because they went to church for 25 years or because their parents forced them to go to Catholic school.  Some people here believe that the crusades led by the Catholic's was an example of Christianity.  So there's definitely a lot of ignorance floating around that needs to be cleaned up.

       There are wrong ways of interpretating the Bible, to say there isn't would be ignorant.  Any person that person open up a random page of the Bible and start criticizing it, while not bothering to understand the context.  When it comes to the bible, the one's who don't want to believe, will much rather not understand context and would rather be ignorant.  Cheers

       You must be really smart to be able to decide which interpretations are correct. There must a bunch of churches you think are ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be smarter more spiritual than every person in all of those factions for this to be true. Are you?

       There is no “right understanding“ since the bibel doesn't deal with precise science or storytelling...
..there are even several versions of the jesus-storyline!
