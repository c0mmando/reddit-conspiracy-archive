        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This happens all the time, especially in this extremely gullible subreddit:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some event happens.</li>
<li>Someone posts a screenshot from 4chan that is dated from before the event, predicting it and claiming that someone in particular is responsible or has an agenda.</li>
<li>This proves the event was a conspiracy and some anon on 4chan had prior knowledge to it, and indicates that his point about who is responsible is correct.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem with this logic is that <strong>anyone can make a fake 4chan screenshot.</strong></p>

<p>Anyone who has Google Chrome installed can post something on 4chan right now, and use the &quot;inspect element&quot; function to change the date of the post, then take a screenshot of it and post it to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and claim it was taken months ago.</p>

<p>Only believe screenshots of dates <em>if the person sharing it can prove the screenshot was taken before the actual event occurred</em>. And no, meta data in the image doesn&#39;t count, because that can be easily edited too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the real problem is this.... some anonymous guy posts some stuff in an on-line forum and we are supposed to believe it? I&#39;ve read several of these screenshots and many of them seem plausible.  Some of these posts and other random tweets seem to corroborate each other and the dots can be easily connected.  But there are also several conflicting narratives....  He was a member ISIS.  It was an FBI plot to sell guns to ISIS that went wrong. It was a false flag that will be used to take our guns. It was a false flag that will be used to roll out mandatory x-ray machines/body scanners.  </p>

<p>While I do believe there is enough evidence, however circumstantial,  to think something is being hidden, the simple of fact of the matter is that no one will ever know.   </p>

<p>I honestly think the deep state killed Kennedy but it will never be accepted as the truth. I honest think 9/11 was an inside job but it will never be accepted as the truth.  I honestly think the war in Syria is over a gas pipeline but that will never be accepted as the truth. </p>

<p>It is entirely possible this was just the work of some mad man.  Who knows? Regardless, this will be the accepted *truth.&quot;</p>
