       Stephen Paddock was a multi-millionaire accountant that had a gambling addition. He spent hours infront of video poker machines gambling away thousands in each sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       On October 2nd, Stephen was doing what he he normally did every other night, gambling at video poker. It was 9:00pm and he was sitting with a younger hispanic lady whom he met days before at the bar who hit on him after noticing he was a high roller. Unbeknownst to him, She was an undercover agent on a mission to assist in carrying out the largest mass shooting attack in history to provide political justification to repeal the second amendment or shall I say severely diminish its function as the second amendment stands in the way between a free country and a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Stephen was playing his poke game and flirting with Agent 1 shall I call her, two other agents were out scoping the concert. These agents as reported by eye witnesses were hispanic and randomly telling people they're all going to die. Their roll was to scope out the parking lot to determine the best method of attack, planning shot patterns to herd people together like sheep as they ran from one side of the venue to the other to avoid the barrage of bullets. They also had another roll which was to plant multiple firearms in the vehicle owned by Paddock. Once they completed their tasks they informed Agent 4 via secure communication to start the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile Agent 2 and 3 are scoping out the concert, Agent 4 was working hard getting ready for the attack. He was carrying up firearms in concealed luggage roller boards and using the hotel roller cart to stack them and take them up to the suite. He also sets up the cameras near the door and duct taped the smoke detectors. He broke out two glass windows overlooking the venue using a special tool in the panoramic suite 32-135 and placed a hammer on the floor to make it look like a hammer was used when in fact these windows cannot be broken with a hammer. Breaking out two was to increase airflow to prevent smoke buildup in the room and killing the shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       By this time Agents 2 and 3 were finished gathering info and scoping out the venue to cops, barriers, etc... and relaying this information to Agent 4 to execute the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point Agent 4 fired into the crowd with specific targets in mind to herd the people and to kill/injury as many as possible using firearms that can easily be obtained without a background check and using modifications that effectively turn these guns into full autos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plan was going perfect thus far until Stephen decided he had enough of gambling and he was concerned with what was going on outside and decided to go up to his room earlier than planned. Agent 1 tried to stop him but was unsuccessful and thus relayed back to Agent 4 that he was coming. At this point Agent 4 was ready for him and as he entered his room he was held at gunpoint while Agent 4 gave him an untraceable sedative. While Stephen was passed out in a chair Agent 4 continued his assault until he realized he had been made over the scanner that police were on the 30th floor and moving up. He then pulls the tape off the smoke alarm and sets it on fire tossing it out the window knowing that it would trace back to him while shortly after setting off the smoke alarm from all the smoke in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       He takes one of the guns and fires dozens of shots into the front door of the suite to help with his get away. He then strips down and changes clothes, putting his clothes on Stephen while he is still passed out. Leaving his gloves on he shoots Stephen in the chest once with a 357 mag revolver as shown in the leaked picture where he does not die instantly but however chokes on his own blood. You'll notice in the leaked picture there is two puddles of blood, once fresh and one old and soaked into the carpet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agent 4 then changes into his new outfit and shoots himself in the leg with a fmj 357 mag round while facing out towards the window. This way it goes through his leg and out the window leaving no trace that it was not an 5.56 round.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point Agent 4 walks out of the room and down the hall where he meets the police getting off the elevator as he's about to go into the elevator to make his escape. Trying not to blow his cover he stays with the police waiting for SWAT. Eventually police told him to go get medical attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was agent 4? The Security Guard who was hired just less than a week ago. While the Security Guard (agent 4) is playing it cool with the police officers waiting for swat to breach agents 2 and 3 are planting guns in Stephens home while Agent 1 is no where to be found. Once SWAT breach the door they immediately shoot him in the head which explains the second blood puddle only to realize he was already dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Agent 4 is being hailed as a hero who's real name we will never know has successfully completed his mission for the elite that pull the strings from the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are still some big questions such as why wire 100k? This could have easily been done by the agents to make it appear Stephen actually did it. They could have also faked communication with the girlfriend to further strengthen their plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the number 13 on his neck this was written on his neck using lipstick and easily washed off. The way I see it Stephen was the perfect pick for a setup. This guy had no online presence, no Facebook, owned a handgun. Multi-Millionaire with no social life and addicted to gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind this is just a theory ;) But is this possible? Who did the agents work for? Is there any evidence to dispute this theory?
      </p>

       Apparently Mandalay Bay has a hotel within a hotel known as the four seasons. This hotel occupies the 35th through the 39th floors and have their own elevators and own security systems. Owned by a Saudi prince. Would be much easier to carry firearms down 3 flights of stairs instead of up 32. Wouldn't be the first time the Saudi's were involved in an attack on US soil, look at 9/11 for example. What is even further bazar is that this occurred route 91 on 10/1, put that together and you get 9/11/01 in a hotel owned by Saudi's who have been linked to funding the Sept 11th attacks.

       potentially strengthen my theory as two handgun shots can be heard within 10 seconds of each other at 3:25 and 3:35, One going into Steve's chest and one going into the Security Guards leg.

       Aaaand this gets instantly downvoted, even though it looks like it's up to something interesting.

       A minor flaw on this is it doesn't explain the way ammunition was haphazardly placed, or why it was necessary to break two windows.

       Breaking two windows was to minimize smoke build up in the room and prevent killing the shooter.

       Ammo being ejected from AR's and AK's bound around like crazy on a flat surface and would easily explain that.

       Phycological warfare is something that is common among agents. As for the security guard, I don't know that was just a theory. I doubt the info would be released and nothing I can find publicly on this guy.

       Gaming areas are always monitored with cameras, and Paddock would be using his points card. So at least this theory is very testable.

       The million dollar question is if he was gaming and the evidence shows that he was gambling at the time the first shots rang out, would they really let something like that get out? After all we have absolutely no video evidence of this guy except from 2011.

       The monitoring is legally mandated, so there may well be barriers to modification. Also, the technical barriers to faking video are still hard.

       The casino would probably prefer that their long-time customer be exonerated, but yeah, I can see it not getting out.

       Paddock was in on a crime in someway, whether murder or providing weapons to muderers, I don't see any chance he did not buy the guns and did not bring them up to the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, everything else IS being made to make him the patsy, when there is a much bigger machine at work.

       The guy planned to escape, he just bough his girlfriend a truck, that he researched, and haggled on the price a month prior. The salesperson remembers the girlfriend saying what a great guy he was, how he saved her from an abusive relationship, and how nothing was abnormal about Paddock. Suddenly after days of questioning, she is saying she was "worried for his mental health"
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy was up to too much normal shit to go on a massive killing spree alone, someone fucked the plan or fucked him or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who could go sit and gamble for hours cool as a cucumber knowing they were going to execute what they hope will be hundreds or perhaps thousands of people?
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think he was part of some sort of cell or group of confidants that were in on this together, but it's possible he really wasn't intending to kill anyone, that he bought the guns to flip for profit on the black market. You can sell a $900 rifle for $9000 if you are connected to the type of buyers that can't get their hands on these guns even in private sale where perhaps their nationality or demeanor would scare off the gun seller.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's being setup as the killer when he may have been a seller, or he's being setup as the only killer when there were multiple who are still out there.
