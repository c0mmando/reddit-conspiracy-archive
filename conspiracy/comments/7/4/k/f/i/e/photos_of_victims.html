    <div class="md"><p>The bodies in that video? It shows a bunch of people lying down on the ground, sure. And this is from a distance in the dark. I think if the shooting were real we would have a fuckton of photos and videos by now of anything being shot, let alone images of gunshot wounds and bullet damage to anything.</p>

<p>Food for thought:  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, to clarify: I don&#39;t think fake corpses were used in those scenes, but the point of that was to show that there are ways of faking or simulating dead bodies with brutal injuries that I&#39;m sure we all can agree would work on 90% of the country. </p>

<p>They probably filmed some of these scenes beforehand, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t say they are fake or poisoned. But like many others on the Internet, I’ve seen people get shot,  and killed. Gunshot victims and the works, is not to much to assume that there would be much more graphic to evidence shown.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah like many people are saying though, it literally shows nothing, no blood, no real wounds, just people laying in the ground. If hundreds of bullets rain into a crowd of 600+ people you’d see horrible wounds, blood, heads blown out ect. I KNOW PEOPLE WONT FILM THIS, but there is no evidence of this yet.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s such a thing as a right to privacy. It would be journalistically unethical, and maybe even <em>literally illegal,</em> for the press to run photographs of victims without some kind of consent from their families.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s easy to think that everything&#39;s on the Internet or whatever, but it&#39;s just not. Things like photographs of the dead <em>usually</em> remain private. Generally those kinds of photos don&#39;t appear in the news. So their absence from the front pages is not indicative of anything in particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, except the ones that have been all over the news, yeah.</p>

<p>This is sounding like one of those things where somebody goes &quot;Why isn&#39;t there X?&quot; and people go &quot;X is right here&quot; and the first guy goes &quot;Not that X!&quot;</p>

<p>There have been pictures of the aftermath published in the press. You can find them online easily. Clearly these do not satisfy you, so I guess a reasonable question is what <em>would</em> satisfy you?</p>
