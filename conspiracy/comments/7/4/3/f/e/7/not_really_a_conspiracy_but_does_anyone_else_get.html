        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I swear a popular rapper could make a song glorifying snorting elmer&#39;s glue and millions of stupid kids would start doing it.</p>

<p>Or a popular model or pop star could shave her head scalp bald and millions of women would follow her and do that same thing.</p>

<p>Or CNN/Fox News releases an &quot;official story&quot;, along with tons of celebs and popular talk-show hosts also promoting the &quot;official story&quot;, and almost everyone blindly accepts it as the truth. Even questioning it gets you labeled insane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they all constantly say they&#39;re strong and independent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty creepy to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is all linked to changing generations and aging.  That is why they always target the younger minds, as they&#39;re less exposed and therefore less experienced in its corruption.</p>

<p>By the time you&#39;re old enough to see it it is already too late as you&#39;re by now embedded in it through dependency.</p>

<p>The internet changed that, it was a truely free platform with no rules, but since the late naughties they&#39;ve completely took back control of it.  So now the newer generations have no experience of what a free internet truely is or could have been.</p>

<p>It began with &#39;I&#39;m feeling Lucky&#39;.  Does anyone remember when the thing you did on the internet was to look for random and obscure websites by typing in random shit.  You would find some really random and strange stuff but more often than not something really obscure, relevant and informal. The real internet.</p>

<p>Google took control of that way of browsing with that one button &#39;i&#39;m feeling lucky&#39;.</p>

<p>When you control who becomes part of celebrity culture and celebrity society you control the minds of the young and gullible.  </p>

<p>That is why they clawed the internet back, so they can expose the youth to celebrity culture how they see fit rather than for what it actually is.  The platform changed and they had to catch up.</p>
