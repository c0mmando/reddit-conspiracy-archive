<p>*Note: I posted this yesterday, and it was linked to TMOR immediately and I was discouraged, so I deleted it. I changed my mind and am reposting it! : )</p>

<p><strong>“Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” ― Arthur C. Clarke</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I listened to the sound of gentle guitar as I stared up at the unobstructed night sky. It was a cloudless, captivating night, and we had no service or technology to distract us. As my ex-boyfriend played a tune, I noticed three red dots in the sky. When he noticed me staring, he abruptly stopped playing. The three red lights were formed cohesively into a triangular shape, and they all seemed to be connected in some way. I was not sure if they were really one big object, or if they were synchronized somehow. I did not have a camera with me, and my phone’s camera could not capture anything convincing (this was about 10 years ago). I stood awe-struck as the lights slowly raised vertically, finally vanishing into the night. </p>

<p>I have many stories like this, but that’s all they are – stories. Whether anyone will ever believe me is something that has concerned me less as I’ve gotten older. </p>

<p>I loved the idea of aliens growing up, and when I moved to where I am now (redacted), the love grew even more immense. I live in a dazzling, spacious area where there is little light pollution and nature is generally untouched. Not only can I photograph the night skies amazingly, but I have seen weird objects in the sky on many, many occasions (not just the one I mentioned above). The most common UFO experience I have had usually involves some type of metallic object that seems to zip across the sky into what seems to be some type of wormhole. There are many more if you want me to expand in comments.</p>

<p>I am not here to prove whether or not UFOs or aliens even exist, and this is not what this post is about. However, in the span of ten years or so, I can say that I have seen about seventy-ish UFOs, and at least a large portion of those I cannot explain to this day. I even personally met Travis Walton, who has a famous story about being abducted by aliens. They even made a move about it (<em>Fire in the Sky</em>):</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Walton_UFO_incident">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Walton_UFO_incident</a></p>

<p>While I have seen many UFOs, I have never encountered any alien being. Over the years, though, I have started to grow more and more suspicious of the “alien narrative.” I am absolutely convinced that if nothing else, UFOs are just super advanced government technology. It is said that the government has technology that is much more advanced than we even realize, and I’m sure people in the comments will have more to add to this. The evidence I have for this is anecdotal. A military man I used to live near told me that, yes, the government has technology at least 50 years ahead of what we are using.</p>

<p>So, whether aliens are real or not, I feel there might be some sort of alien agenda. Again, I am not necessarily trying to prove whether or not aliens or real, but I definitely believe the conspiracy behind aliens might be a real thing. In other words, I think that the idea of aliens is pushed, and it is pushed for a reason. If nothing else, this post can take you away from all of the Las Vegas posts right now. I hope you enjoy. </p>

<p><strong>Aliens and Religion</strong></p>

<p>The Pope said he would baptize aliens:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-says-he-would-baptise-aliens-9360632.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-says-he-would-baptise-aliens-9360632.html</a></p>

<p>Hey, I would, too, but when that story came out, I grew a little suspicious. As those at the Vatican peer into their “Lucifer” telescope (that’s the name – seriously), I wonder if they know some things we do not know.</p>

<p>While the Catholic church (or religions in general) has not taken any stance on extraterrestrial life, I have noticed that more and more seem to believe in the existence of aliens. In fact, more seem to believe in space aliens than God, according to a U.K. survey:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/alien-believers-outnumber-god_n_1968259.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/alien-believers-outnumber-god_n_1968259.html</a></p>

<p>This article, “Don’t Believe in God? Maybe You’ll Try U.F.O.s” shows further how many might substitute the idea of God for something like extraterrestrials. From the article,</p>

<p>“When people are searching for meaning, their minds seem to gravitate toward thoughts of things like aliens that do not fall within our current scientific inventory of the world. Why? I suspect part of the answer is that such ideas imply that humans are not alone in the universe, that we might be part of a larger cosmic drama. As with traditional religious beliefs, many of these paranormal beliefs involve powerful beings watching over humans and the hope that they will rescue us from death and extinction.”</p>

<p>Just to add, I’m not arguing that people need to be religious to find God. In fact, I understand how religions have been corrupted over time. However, I find it interesting that some have replaced the entire concept of God with something like aliens. While not quite the same thing, many also seem to gravitate toward ideas like the simulation theory before they gravitate toward God. Even Bank of America says there is a 50% chance we are living in a simulation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-thinks-theres-a-50-chance-we-live-in-a-matrix-2016-9">http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-thinks-theres-a-50-chance-we-live-in-a-matrix-2016-9</a></p>

<p>It seems as though people would rather believe in <em>anything</em> before they believed in God. Why?</p>

<p>There currently is this promotion that aliens have created God, and not the other way around:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/785536/Aliens-CREATED-GOD-conspiracy-theory-religion">http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/785536/Aliens-CREATED-GOD-conspiracy-theory-religion</a></p>

<p><strong>Are We Alone?</strong></p>

<p>As noted earlier, aliens make many feel as if they are less alone in this gigantic universe. Still, here’s a scary thought: what if we really <em>are</em> alone?</p>

<p>If there is really nothing out there, what does that mean for us? As of right now, there is no proof of the existence of aliens:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/anonymous-nasa-alien-life">https://www.popsci.com/anonymous-nasa-alien-life</a></p>

<p>If aliens do not exist, doesn’t that make life seem even more random and/or special than before? Let me explain. Already many people believe that the universe came from nothing (the Big Bang theory) Then, many already believe that life also appeared without purpose of direction – through randomness. 
I’d claim that if there were not aliens, it makes our existence seem less random and more special. If we really are the only ones out there, that has some severe implications.</p>

<p>(Just a side point here, does randomness even truly exist? I think I read somewhere that even in things that seem like true randomness, there is still a pattern of some sort….
<a href="http://andreweifler.com/there-is-no-such-thing-as-random/">http://andreweifler.com/there-is-no-such-thing-as-random/</a>)
Anyway, next if we are really alone, this means that we have even more of a responsibility to take care of this world, our home. </p>

<p>Decades ago, people were told there would be flying cars by now, and they might even be able to vacation on the moon! Well, I guess you can vacation to the moon for $150 million dollars:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/vacation-moon-150-million/">http://www.iflscience.com/space/vacation-moon-150-million/</a></p>

<p>The point is that is 2017. I do not see the flying cars or the hover boards (the Back to the Future ones anyway), and it seems like we cannot just trash this Earth and find a way out. If there really aren’t extraterrestrial beings, it may indicate that there may not really be any place realistically near us that is habitable for humans. Perhaps they push this sort of “futurama” so that we cannot feel as bad for destroying our world in countless ways. Do I even have to link to the countless upon countless ways we are destroying our world daily?</p>

<p>It’s just a thought, and I’m not saying I’m right. </p>

<p>What I do know that there is just about the same type of evidence for aliens as there is God: anecdotes, unproven theories, and belief systems. </p>

<p>Perhaps the idea of aliens is appealing because it is another way for many to feel disconnected from God – to feel that we are in charge of our own future and destiny after all. In other words, people want to feel in control of their lives, and maybe the thought of alien beings, a possible future version of themselves, gives them that sense of control. </p>

<p>Finally, perhaps the larger conspiracy is that they do have the technology to space travel and meet aliens and such, but would they really tell us that? If the Earth really is being destroyed, are they going to fit 7.442 billion people on their spaceships before the apocalypse? I don’t think so.</p>

<p><strong>Aliens and Demons</strong></p>

<p>I ran into something a little creepy a few weeks ago. Apparently my favorite Satanist Aleister Crowley had contact with a demon that looks a lot like our modern view of aliens. You can see the image here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm">http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm</a></p>

<p>You can read more about “Lam” on the site above, but it explains,
“It is interesting to note that since Crowley&#39;s time, in occult terms at least, Lam is considered a class of entity rather than an individual being.  When one invokes Lam, they are invoking an entity of that type, rather than a specific being.  For occultists operating along O.T.O. lines, the idea is to invoke these Lam entities through Magickal Portals (intentionally created rents in time and space) into physical manifestation on planet earth.  Why this is desirable is not always so clearly stated.  (It often appears that within Crowleyian circles the working rule is often: &quot;If Crowley did it, I want to do it, too.&quot;)”</p>

<p>What if communication with ‘aliens’ is nothing more than communication with demonic beings through some type of magick (notice I’m not writing magic) and portals?</p>

<p>It kind of makes me wonder more deeply about the pretty famous law of one “Ra” material:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">http://www.lawofone.info/</a></p>

<p>Anyway, even if beings do not exist outside our world, it is quite possible that beings may exist inter-dimensionally, through portals or wormholes. Perhaps not all those beings are ‘bad’ or ‘demonic’, but it makes me wonder what people are really communicating with.</p>

<p>To me, and this is entirely my theory so do not freak out if you disagree, we are all energy (vibration). Our consciousness exists at a certain vibration, and there may be beings that exist at lower or higher vibrations than us. To me, any being that takes dark, sinister, or strange rituals to communicate with may not be at such a high vibration, and I’m not sure I would want to communicate with that being. Again, that’s just my idea; you can always disagree! 😊(I still need to write a post about my experiences with ghosts…)</p>

<p><strong>Pop Culture and Aliens</strong></p>

<p>Look no further than pop culture to see that aliens are pretty damn popular. “People of Earth” is a pretty popular show on TBS about aliens living on Earth (I love the catchy, folky theme song btw). Surprise, surprise, it’s about people who have been abducted by aliens and meet in a Catholic church “for some reason”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBY-9pCmC3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBY-9pCmC3s</a></p>

<p>That video is pretty interesting in and of itself. It even talks about reptilians! 😊</p>

<p>Then, let’s not forget the popularity of “Ancient Aliens” which seems to spread the idea that aliens were there all along – maybe even our ultimate creators:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/ancient_aliens.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/ancient_aliens.html</a></p>

<p>While there have been reports of UFOs for hundreds of years (or more), the first alien abduction claims did not exist until the 1900s:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction</a></p>

<p>If aliens have always existed, why did they mysteriously start abducting people in the 1900s and not before?</p>

<p>Again, this goes back to what I was saying earlier. UFOs are probably real, but the evidence for aliens is not the best.</p>

<p>There is no possible way I could list every alien reference in pop culture, but there are some things I want to note:</p>

<p>• “American Dad” has an alien as its main character. The entire premise of the show revolves around government conspiracies.</p>

<p>• “Paul” is about an adventure with an alien on an “insane road trip.”</p>

<p>• Rick and Morty is more popular than ever, and the entire premise of the show is that aliens exists on many levels.</p>

<p>• Futurama showcases aliens on nearly every episode. Though I love this show, it promotes nihilism, Godlessness, and emptiness on many levels (and I could expand further if needed).</p>

<p>I can keep going. It is important to note that while there are thousands upon thousands of movies depicting aliens, and the more modern shows seem to depict aliens as kinder, smarter, and just generally better than human beings. Perhaps they are being push as the next step in evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Genderless Beings</strong></p>

<p>Now this is where it gets crazy. Could the push for androgyny in society be an ultimate push toward the acceptance of alien or alien-like beings? I admit this is a big leap, but this is a conspiracy forum, so please do not have a heart attack (unless you get shot with a heart attack gun or something).</p>

<p>I have written so much on gender issues, so I am not going to get into everything here. Let’s just say though, androgyny and genderlessness seem to be the next big push in our society. First, they had to get people believe that men could be women and women could be men and people could identify as anything. Now, they are saying that gender is not even real, and the best way to be is without any gender at all.</p>

<p>This article talks about the rise of the “Femiman” or androgynous models:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/04/the-rise-of-the-feniman-a_n_818641.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/04/the-rise-of-the-feniman-a_n_818641.html</a></p>

<p>There is a rise of gender neutral baby names:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/fashion/gender-neutral-baby-names.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/fashion/gender-neutral-baby-names.html</a></p>

<p>There is a rise of gender neutral clothing:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/04/joy-unisex-gender-neutral-clothing-john-lewis">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/04/joy-unisex-gender-neutral-clothing-john-lewis</a></p>

<p>There is a rise of gender neutral parenting:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gender-neutral-children-meet-the-new-generation-of-parents-with-a-gender-neutral-approach-to-a6986791.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gender-neutral-children-meet-the-new-generation-of-parents-with-a-gender-neutral-approach-to-a6986791.html</a></p>

<p>And so on!</p>

<p>Could it be that this push for gender neutrality is really a push for acceptance of living as more robotic or alien-like existence? I mean, more and more people say they want to upload their consciousness into some sort of cyborgs:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/3/27/15079226/elon-musk-computers-technology-brain-ai-artificial-intelligence-neural-lace">https://www.recode.net/2017/3/27/15079226/elon-musk-computers-technology-brain-ai-artificial-intelligence-neural-lace</a></p>

<p>Whether this is a push for robots or aliens, I’m not really sure. What I am sure of is that <em>they</em> want us to be anything but human beings. </p>

<p><em>They</em> seem to paint human as worthless and evil, and it’s only natural that we should evolve, right…?</p>

<p>By the way, have you ever noticed that they are really promoting the exaggerated alien look, even in toys like “Bratz” dolls?</p>

<p>And let’s not forget about the man who paid over $50,000 to look like a genderless alien:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4274396/Man-spends-50-000-transform-genderless-ALIEN.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4274396/Man-spends-50-000-transform-genderless-ALIEN.html</a></p>

<p>Even if this part of my post is far-fetched, one can deny the current push for a genderless society. </p>

<p><strong>The Deception</strong></p>

<p>So, let’s just say this is all true. Let’s say that they are pushing the alien agenda.  Why would they? Why would it even matter? I have a few theories:</p>

<p>First and foremost, I believe it is a push away from God. As I mentioned earlier, everything sounds more appealing to people than God: aliens, simulations, and even nothingness seem better to people than God.</p>

<p>Why? Well, God has standards, and people don’t really like standards. As our society pushes moral relativism more and more, wrong is right and right is wrong. Down is the new up, so to speak. I have written A LOT about my views of this “Oprah Morality” as I call it, so I don’t want to go any further here, unless you want to read my article:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xjqec/oprah_morality_selfishness_the_ego_and_more_an/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xjqec/oprah_morality_selfishness_the_ego_and_more_an/</a></p>

<p>Next, I’m sure you have heard of Project Blue Beam:
<a href="http://www.carlg.org/engbluebeam.html">http://www.carlg.org/engbluebeam.html</a></p>

<p>From this article, “A false return of Jesus Christ, a false revelation from God to unite the world The new global payment system, the digital microchip implant. They want to make the world ready to accept it, the mark of the beast. </p>

<p>They will create a feeling of unity over the whole planet. Perhaps with religious symbols in the sky over the whole world that melts into one. Perhaps they also create earth quakes at the same time. </p>

<p>This event, the project blue beam can occur at any time. They have a plan for a &quot;one world open market&quot;, the whole world as global free trade zone with &quot;free migration&quot; world wide. The bad thing about it all is that you will need an RFID microchip inside your body to get access to this &quot;freedom&quot;. A microchip in the hand, arm or forehead or a tattoo that they can scan to verify your identity.”</p>

<p>Finally, if that all seems too far-fetched to you, it could simply just be a way for us to accept a new world order in general. In fact, Reagan has a vision about this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/flashback-reagans-vision-unifying">http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/flashback-reagans-vision-unifying</a></p>

<p>He said, <strong>““Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.”</strong></p>

<p>That is a little chilling, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Maybe it will not be something like Project Blue Beam, but it is quite possible that the world could unite into a new system if there was some type of alien threat.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This post can go in thousands of directions, and I am not here to convince anyone of anything, really. First, as I finish writing this, I’m not really sure whether I think aliens exist or not. I think it’s still possible, despite what I wrote. However, I am leaning toward that the idea of aliens is being pushed for more sinister reasons.</p>

<p>Next, there are probably thousands of things I did not mention, so that is why I made a post about it, so we can have a discussion. I’d love to hear all of your theories and thoughts on aliens.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to end with the fact that many world leaders believe in aliens and UFOs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/8337299/Alien-life-and-UFOs-10-top-believers.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/8337299/Alien-life-and-UFOs-10-top-believers.html</a></p>

<p>So, if that’s the case, throwing the “you’re crazy” argument is just not going to work here. The question is not whether UFOs even exist anymore. The question is now what’s the deeper agenda? </p>

<p>I didn’t get a chance to mention Scientology or reptilians, but I can leave those for a later post. </p>

<p>So, are we alone in the universe or not? What are the implications. To go back to the original quote:</p>

<p><strong>“Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” ― Arthur C. Clarke</strong></p>

<p>Which is more terrifying to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When going back through my comments from last nights drunken adventures, I wondered why you deleted it :) I&#39;m just gonna copypasta my comment from last night because the /new que is a bit dry tonight and to help facilitate discussion!</p>

<p>Space and the Cosmos have always captivated mankind. From the origins of civilization in Mesopotamia to the conversation I had last weekend with colleagues/friends sparked by staring into the unadulterated night sky (as suburbanites/city dwellers we where quite spoiled with the view), mankind has always been fascinated with what lies &quot;above&quot;. You wrote a great post (as always), so I&#39;ll just pick a couple of points to respond to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is really nothing out there, what does that mean for us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That we must come together as a species, and see ourselves as a collective of conscious beings all granted the random and cosmic privilege of being alive and able to interpret the universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently my favorite Satanist Aleister Crowley had contact with a demon that looks a lot like our modern view of aliens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which to me begs the question- are Aliens misperceived as Demons, or Demons as Aliens? I can not answer personally one way or the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>could the push for androgyny in society be an ultimate push toward the acceptance of alien or alien-like beings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not much to say here other than that you should check out Star Trek TNG S5E17 where they explore the concept of an androgynous alien race back in &#39;92.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some type of magick (notice it&#39;s not magic)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A key distinction, to be sure!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i too love thinking about the possibilities, the sim one is just my favorite really. </p>

<p>Humanity has already gone down the path of simulations of all kinds we can think of, virtual, augmented, 2d/3d/on and on it goes. Eventually we will by natural course of developing simulations, develop an identical one of our very own universe. </p>

<p>Some do not understand how we could possibly recreate our own universe, but eventually we will have automated drones that will scan and map every detail on everywhere, all of it, multiple filters, infrared, x ray, microscopic, etc, we will be able to send out probes faster, cheaper and far far easier into space and beyond than ships that would require to sustain human life for near indefinite periods. </p>

<p>The copied simulation will allow humanity to not only back up themselves digitally, but the entire solar system, and safely travel into deep space, sending robotic autonomous workers after probes that find things of interest, all being able to be real time remotely operated by a human in our solar system. </p>

<p>there is a great story that describes it, if you&#39;re interested I&#39;ll see if I can find it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called first contact and it really left a great impression.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a archive link of what the film is about and where you can rent/stream it from.</p>

<p>Really? Even the episode &quot;Godfellas&quot;? Maybe the later Comedy Central episodes do, but in my opinion the original FOX run <em>satirizes</em> nihilism, Godlessness, and emptiness, rather than <em>promoting</em> it per se. </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s a minor point. </p>

<p>To your overall point, my view of this stuff has been generally informed by Whitley Strieber&#39;s <em>Communion</em>—that these entities are inherently elusive and impossible to pin down, but that they&#39;re most likely manifestations of our own unconscious/subconscious. (It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read it, so my paraphrasal is probably shaky.) </p>

<p>Just read between the opposite camps. I would assume it benefits the Cabal to keep us confused on the subject. </p>

<p>Practically every single culture around the fucking planet talks about these &quot;star brothers&quot; who came here and shared their inventions with us. Some of these beings are depicted as humanoid, often giants. Some of them are reptilian, avian, and insectoid. If you throw in all the legends of fairies and demons you would have a host of other visitors throughout history. </p>

<p>The <em>point</em> is the commonality; the consistency between the overarching story. </p>

<p>These &quot;Greys and Draco&#39;s&quot; could very well be complete fabrications by our government, intended to lead the narrative down a certain path (fear). In reality, these people have been doing this (faking ufos) for a few decades at most, which literally is a fart compared to breadth of human history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A story I&#39;ve heard that makes an odd sort of sense is that they(or at least some of them) &#39;can&#39; come here, but they really really don&#39;t like actually making contact with the surface and especially dislike being in physical proximity to humans that aren&#39;t able to stop themselves from broadcasting unpleasant emotional states. </p>

<p>Allegedly, dying on or too close to earth carries certain undesirable risks and a significant number of entities are telepathic or at least much more sensitive to the psychic states of minds in their vicinity so being near a &#39;normal&#39; person is literally painful. Imagine the psychic equivalent of being next to someone screaming in pain, fear and anger with a high probability of the emotional unpleasantness being directed at any non-human entity that is visible as such.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all just stories coming from people claiming to channel stuff or people who claim to have had meetings where this is explained but have absolutely no way to authenticate their claims, but I think it makes a certain sort of sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I am going to go out on a limb, just like you did.</p>

<p>I basically agree, or at least understand, everything your long post laid down. It was good, classic, rooted conspiracy thinking (which is getting rarer every day as conspiracy gets mainstreamed here).</p>

<p>I want to suggest an entirely different approach to everything you noted: what if aliens are just us humans, time travelling?</p>

<p>This thesis would satisfy both sides of your dilemma - that aliens seem very real sometimes, but they can also seem like a phony mass propaganda trick at the same time.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get into this story, is just to imagine what would happen to a stable planetary society where time travel through a multiverse becomes as common as airline travel is today. Who wouldn&#39;t want to go sightseeing? And, at that level, you wouldn&#39;t just have to go visit your own species&#39; distant past or future - you could visit entirely separate strands of biological development.</p>

<p>Like the world where humans went underground, evolve big black oval eyes, tiny ears and noses, a gray complexion, telepathy, and androgyny (perhaps conceiving children by different means than sexual reproduction).</p>

<p>So you have to appreciate that the multiverse is deep, mainstream physics, not conspiracy and not science fiction. When sentient beings master actual travel between different times in different universes, what will happen?</p>

<p>I suggest that there are an infinite number of these separate but related universes, and that certain beings travel back and forth between them. I suggest we are being visited essentially by our own  relatives, distant or near. And its because our backwater world in the last couple hundred of years has rapidly developed the technology to achieve that level of knowledge enabling such travel.</p>

<p>Now, in all this theorizing, why would one be interested in the great game of religion? Well, even in this vast inifinitude of universes, beings are choosing the light of truth and love, while other beings are choosing the darkness of deceit and destruction. By holding to beliefs and practices that conform to what we do know about good and evil, based on the past experience of our species, we take a stand in this great contest. We know who we are. We know we will ultimately be found and &quot;retrieved&quot;. </p>

<p>This is my understanding of faith in a God of Goodness. Those who believe in a God of Evil, or any such equivalent, do so by trading this position of mercy and innocence for a position of power.</p>
