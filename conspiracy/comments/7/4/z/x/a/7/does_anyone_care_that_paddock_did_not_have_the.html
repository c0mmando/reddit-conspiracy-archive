Now play through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vdeHMqCscs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">this</a> video, which outlines all of the video and audio of the Vegas shooting. 100 round bursts can be heard that IDENTICALLY match that of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7w_gh7uY">M240</a>. The rate of fire of the weapon is NOT consistent with that of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B7tzaYgp5g">AR-15 w/Bump Stock</a>, but rather the 600rpm (10/sec) that the M240 shows. <strong><em>No M240 or similar 100 round weapon was found in Paddock&#39;s suite.</em></strong> This alone proves the shots did not come from Stephen&#39;s weapons. No one could maintain 100 round AR-15 bump-stock fire, especially when the AR-15 breaks due to heat at around 6 minutes, or halfway into the shooting. Add that to the fact that several distinct gun sounds can be heard in the video above, and I think we have ourselves some solid evidence Paddock didn&#39;t do this.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mXe9dk77bk">Here is all the proof you need</a><br/>
Edit: The weapon used may have been an Ultimax 100. Uses the same ammunition as an AR-15 but with the fire rate that is consistent in the videos (10/sec).</p>

That does not necessarily mean that something&#39;s fucky.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol thanks for the suggestions even if they are quite dramatic. If there are reasonable situations where people need semi auto firearms then that shit should be locked down tight. I know people with hunting rifles in Australia and you have to jump through a lot of hoops to ensure it&#39;s safe for you to own that weapon.</p>

<p>Surely there should be limits to the amount of guns and ammunition you can buy too. Legally being able to buy multiple rifles and masses of ammunition seems like overkill if it&#39;s just for a hog hunt or to protect your animals. </p>

<p>And if it&#39;s to protect you against your government then you&#39;re fucked anyway. No amount of guns will protect you if the US government decides it wants to be a dictatorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they do. In Europe we have a lot of radical Muslims, but the fact that it&#39;s so hard to obtain guns surely works in our favour. Just the other day there was a failed bomb attempt on the tube. If the perp gets an ar15 then it&#39;s a different story. There will always be crazies but at least make it hard for them.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not against guns. In America you have bears and shit, police response times may be too long in some areas, firearms are intrinsically linked with a lot of peoples lives and hobbies. I completely get it. I just think certain weapons are completely unnecessary for civilians to own. And I believe that regulations and ease of access should be tightened massively, as I can see how that has worked in both the UK and Australia. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.&quot;</em>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it holds no value because if your government did want to fuck you over then they easily could. Your military is stronger than the next 26 combined or something crazy like that? No amount of semi autos and shotguns are gonna stop them if they really want to fuck with you.</p>

<p>I also appreciate your right to bear arms, just think the line needs to be moved. You&#39;ve collectively agreed that civilians don&#39;t have the right to bear RPG&#39;s and LMG&#39;s right? So in my opinion assault rifles should also be behind that line. </p>

<p>So, because they have strength in conventional warfare we should...tuck our tails between our legs and give up our agency?  No, that is unAmerican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>on a state level, CA for instance, has specifically defined what an assault rifle is. Owning one is not against the law, or even buying one. The required modifications that make it legal make the rifle completely inconvenient and not &quot;fun&quot; to shoot. If they did not care about this specific rifle platform then they would not always target it with more control legislation.</p>

<p>It is not to the advantage of the government to have citizens as equally armed as the states law enforcement and military. So limiting what the civilians can get a hold of still leaves weapon superiority with the government entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between us is that I actually know how the NRA gets its money and from whom.</p>

<p>Go look up the funding sources for the NRA.  The biggest is MidwayUSA.  They&#39;ve run a &quot;round up&quot; donation program where customers round-up purchases and the balance gets sent to the NRA.  MidwayUSA&#39;s giant contribution to the NRA is thus <em>actually from their customers.</em></p>

<p>Many other gun industry leaders run similar programs, including gun manufacturers.  Those big donations you see are mostly just pass-throughs from their customers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NRA is controlled by the gun manufacturers, has been since they were taken over in the 80&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the NRA has a very moderate stance compared to their member base.  Go look at the comments on their statement regarding bumpfire stocks.  Their members are raging.  If you say the NRA is controlled, I agree, but it is to moderate the voice of their members.  SAF and GOA answer more directly to their members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they don&#39;t influence power by coordinating their members, they legally bribe politicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do indeed.  We live in an oligarchy.  If you want something done, you have to pay for it.  We want something done, so we are paying for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you weren&#39;t such a pathetic baby-person you&#39;re ignorance would be cute.</p>

<p>And if you had real facts on your side, you wouldn&#39;t lose so much.</p>

<p>The gun manufacturers want the NRA to be more radical.  The members want the NRA to be more radical.  So why aren&#39;t they?  Because they are weak and they compromise and cede human rights when the going gets tough.</p>

<p>No, I actually pay <em>them</em> money.  Not only that, at every election I print out the NRA&#39;s endorsement list and bring it with me to the voting booth.  Even primaries and local elections.  </p>

<p>They&#39;ve already been <em>very</em> vocal regarding assault weapon bans.
What do you think comes after an &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban, when rhetoric pivots to target the actual weapon of choice for like 90% of gun violence in America? They ban the handgun, which is also the main weapon of choice for self defense. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve wanted this for a long time - they&#39;re just too big of disingenuous pussies to say it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, legally they did it in Chicago, NYC...</p>

<p>Basically, they want to disarm White People. They don’t seem to care much about black &amp; Hispanic people packing illegal firearms. That they are not concerned with.</p>

<p>Now, legal gun carrying white people - They are determined to put the kibosh on that. </p>

<p>Now, these events where a white male kills a bunch of people could be real &amp; they “don’t let a crises go to waste” (Rahm Emanuel) to push their no guns for White People agenda.</p>

<p>Or quite possibly with these shady ass mutherfuckers they stage these events themselves to say “Look! White people shouldnt have guns!” </p>

<p>It’s one of the two. Either way - Organized cohesive White People with guns they see as DEFINITELY a threat to whatever fucked out plan they have to increase their wealth &amp; power.</p>

<p>I don’t really focus on this. I don’t even have a gun &amp; I don’t plan on having a gun.</p>

<p>I’m just commenting on this because of this situation &amp; I notice a pattern going on. I didn’t win anything btw - I don’t really care if guns are banned or not btw since I don’t have one.</p>

<p>Personally, I wish all guns didn’t exist. They seem dangerous. I just can’t help but notice these hypocritical assholes in power would like to be the only ones with guns for some reason &amp; people should be aware of that &amp; the REAL reason they want to take can guns away from legal carrying white people.</p>

<p>It’s not to save lives or whatever bullshit they are claiming. It’s to unempower people &amp; make them defenseless against whatever bullshit they want to do &amp; people should know this.</p>

<p>Plus, a lot of people who know a lot more about the elements involved in the Sandy Hook event like medical personnel, school administrators, etc..say Sandy Hook was fake as fuck and probably no one died.</p>

<p>I saw a video on Liveleak of people supposedly shot &amp; dead in Las Vegas that leads me to believe Las Vegas was more real than Sandy Hook in terms of actual victims killed...BUT the numbers could be exaggerated &amp; it could still be a false flag. </p>

<p>&quot;Resulting laws include a prohibition on kits that allow ammunition magazines to be altered to hold more than ten rounds and a five-year ban on firearm possession by anyone who makes serious threats of violence to psychotherapists.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh man, magazine alteration equipment ban, and increasing the length of time people have to wait until after threatening someone.  </p>

<p>Let’s say that these new expensive state of the art smoke detectors came out and your partner insists you purchase them. You think they’re BS and what you have is fine. So your partner secretly lights your house on fire in a specific way rendering your current detectors useless, well now maybe you AND maybe your kids who didn’t even have an opinion originally will think about those new state of the art ones. </p>

<p>Yeah, it can come off as obvious, but if the fire department comes in and sides with your partner because they’re already on the same team and they’re never going to tell you the truth. You’re left with what you know, not what actually happened. </p>

<p>All you have shown is that he held ~600 rounds per min with long breaks between either to reload or switch rifles. None of this PROVES he had an M240 or smiliar weapon. Additionally if it had been a M240 many more would be dead as it doesnt bounce as much as the bump stock and he could walk the fire where ever he wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude your either extremely guillible or retarded. An m4, military grade ar15, fires 700-750 rounds a minute. A bump fire stock will come close to that fire rate. And yes, if home boy propped up against the window, he had help in managing the recoil then. Your points are not very good. In the video, if it was a 240 or any military machine gun, the rounds would of snapped louder and the gas regulation wouldnt of been all over the place. You can clearly hear the gun almost fucking up because the bolt was gonna outrun the trigger. Stop spreading misinfo dude, literally nothing your spouting off is true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha do you know how hard it is to lay down, and shoot a bi-pod bump-stock AR-15 with an extended banana magazine that could hold 75+ rounds? Actually, he&#39;d have to stand up to shoot the gun. Even if he didn&#39;t stand up, the magazine would be too long and wouldn&#39;t be able to be used in a bi-pod config. And bump-stock fire does not stay consistent, it matches the force provided by the shooter. In the videos, you can clearly hear the first shooter using a gun that is NOT a bump-stock. There are however other shooting audios that show a bump-stock fire, but it&#39;s another shooter, because the distance and loudness of the fire is completely different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does the ultimax have to do with anything? There is also the M249, G36, MK. 46, and hell even a fully auto version of an M4. They all use 5.56 and they all have similiar fire rates and sound similiar(G36 not so much) that doesnt mean they were used! All those weapons have consistency. The only shot that had any consistency was the first burst and thats because the bump stock was warming up. Which is why in later videos or others, you here the shift in the rate of fire. As for two shooters, the guns would of been &quot;talking&quot; in a sense, not one complete automatic burst followed by an echo that is less acoustic than the actual shots. Two shooters=two echoes but there is only one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not a second shooter. Your the only one talking out your ass dude, ive watched every video thats been pushed so far and they all show one shooter using a bump stock. Yes warming up is a thing when shooting. When you first shoot you have alot of the gun grease or lubricant on your gun. As the heat builds up, the lubricant evaporates. Considering this platform isnt made to shoot like the vegas shooter did, you hear the inconsistency with a bump fire stock.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Your idea that it has to be an M240 is plain nonsense and makes me question if you have ANY firearm experience.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny... because I made a post like this, and a.. hold on, let me check... an vet who did 23 active duty as a combat veteran messaged me saying &quot;I’ve been saying the exact same thing since I heard the audio of the shooting. It sounds like a 240B. I have plenty of experience shooting AR’s and the 240B. I qualified expert on both. I served on active duty as a Combat Medic for 21 years including 2 years in Afghanistan. I know that sound.&quot;</p>

<p>So, how much firearm experience do you have?</p>

<p>Not saying you’re wrong, but shooting an AR-15 a couple times is not even close to coming to someone who has an advanced knowledge of the sound an AR makes. For the record, I own multiple ARs and AKs and the sound is definitely not what I would expect a 5.56 to sound like, but who knows what amount acoustic manipulation is accounting for what we hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The magazines showed are 100 round mags for the ar. You&#39;re completely right you couldnt go prone, but you could possibly take a nice kneeling or seated method to shoot from. But the theres the fact of shooting the bump fire stock. Ive never shot one myself but I&#39;d assume its not as easy as it looks to fire off a full magazine without any stopage. But with the belt fed idea i just dont see it, as ive actually fired hudreds of rounds through a M240 and a M249 nobody brought up the fact they have metal links holding the rounds in place. Hundreds of metal links being thrown everywhere. Now yes you could attatch a bag to catch them so maybe who knows.<br/>
My biggest question is where is this dudes hearing protection. Because even if im going to kill myself at the end of a mass shooting I wouldnt want my ears throbbing from the sound. A few hundred rounds fired indoors would be painful as hell.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good point, but over-the-ear hearing pro could easily roll under a chair or bed or something and not be in the few photos that were leaked.</p>

<p>He could have also used in-ear hearing pro and discard them before he shot himself. I imagine in-ear hearing pro would be under-effective under these conditions, but I&#39;m having trouble remembering what kind of hearing pro I had to use the times I&#39;ve shot at an indoor range (i&#39;m assuming double protection, but i just don&#39;t remember), so I&#39;m not really qualified to pass judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that video, and yes, <strong>I&#39;m sure</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the video you linked is showing a PKM gun and not an M240.</p>

<p>Now that that&#39;s cleared up...while there are pitch and timbre differences between the takes of that PKM gun, the general &quot;character&quot; of the sounds is still very similar. And none of those takes sounds anything like an AR-15. This is why they don&#39;t just tweak AR-15 sounds to produce heavy machine gun effects in video games. THEY SOUND DIFFERENT.</p>

<p>The human ear is <em>extremely good</em> at picking out subtle differences in the intonation and character of sounds. This is why you can recognize someone&#39;s voice even under widely varying recording and playback conditions. It&#39;s also why it&#39;s been so hard to create human-realistic computer speech. And if you think this only applies to &quot;organic sounds&quot;, mechanics can sometimes tell what&#39;s wrong with a car by simply listening to the engine.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking on my sureness!</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the very next paragraph addresses the other things that do matter. Did you read that next part?</p>

<p>I pointed out the difference in guns just as a clarification in case anyone thought that the PKM was supposed to represent a M240 firing.</p>

<p>Here are three different videos of a M240 firing. They sound awfully similar to me:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/MI_3unXQthw">https://youtu.be/MI_3unXQthw</a><br/>

<a href="https://youtu.be/KxllVBTI84I">https://youtu.be/KxllVBTI84I</a>  </p>

<p>And for good measure, this is a PKM:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/g48OP8COwqI">https://youtu.be/g48OP8COwqI</a></p>

<p>All this is to demonstrate that different guns do have characteristic sounds - and those differences can be detected despite different recording parameters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did notice something odd by the way some of the rifles were placed though, especially the one on a bipod that is placed over his leg. How did it end up overtop of his like that? I guess it really depends on how he was positioned when he shot himself. There is also the ar under his body near his left hand, sure he could have fallen ontop of it but then it makes you wonder about the ar positioned over his leg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The use of a bump stock is pretty recognizable in the rate of fire, any fully auto manufactured weapon would not have the dips in the rate of fire that we hear. With a bump stock (or a trigger gattling) the rate is ultimately dependent on your muscles and not a gas blow back system so it has no real fixed firing rate: hence the sound in all the videos, a rapid firing gun that has an unstable firing rate.</p>

<p>To elaborate since this gained some steam. The U100 is one of the lightest machine guns. It is very low recoil when compared to other 5.56 weapons and easy to control extended fire since the bolt does hit the back of the weapon, but is gradually slowed. The weakness is that it&#39;s kind of a bitch to change out the drum and takes longer than changing a magazine on almost any other type of gun(which fits the timing). Edit: There is a variant for a quick change barrel, since you can burn it out with extended fire. That could be the delay between volleys as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From ZeroHedge.com:</p>

<p>*Also, think about the geometrics of this:</p>

<p>1.) WINDOWS: The windows in his room were floor to ceiling. To fire down one would practically need to be standing at the edge of the window. Have you ever been to the edge of 32 stories? I have and it&#39;s fucking scary even with climbing equipment - let alone standing on the edge of 32 stories while shooting a rifle with a bump stock while the wind AND CURTAINS are blowing around you.</p>

<p>2.) RANGE OF MOTION: To use the bump stock fire you need range of motion to capture the kinetic energy of the recoil. Using a tripod or even a bipod would not allow that to happen. I suppose he could have taken a prone position and put the bipod on the edge but how the fuck do you burn through 1,000 rounds like that?
3.) BIPOD: Using a bipod would not have allowed him to get the same angle he needed to shoot down. Using a tripod? What, did he bolt it to the floor and run it like a door gunner from a helicopter gun ship? That&#39;s the closest comparable platform to consider.</p>

<p>4.) TIME: Even on full auto, one shooter couldn&#39;t do it. Once in the army my squad was tasked to burn off some surplus ammo (about 10K rounds) as it was the end of the Fiscal Year.</p>

<p>For about 12 hours we (8 guys) fired pretty much non stop on full auto with M-16s. We had to make sure not to burn out the barrels and let the rifles rest from time to time. No fucking way ONE SHOOTER is going to burn through 2,000 rounds in 10 minutes even on full auto. We would be lucky to get through 20 (30 round) mags an hour. It took us so long to burn off those 10,000 rounds we had to use parachute flares to light the range.</p>

<p>Fucking insanity to believe the MSM spin on this. There had to be more than one shooter to hit kill 50+ people from 500+ meters. And where did this asshole go for target practice? What ranges did he frequent? No one is going to pick up an AR platform and become &#39;super killer&#39; without a little practice and know how. *</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny... because I made a post like this, and a.. hold on, let me check... an vet who did 23 active duty as a combat veteran messaged me saying &quot;I’ve been saying the exact same thing since I heard the audio of the shooting. It sounds like a 240B. I have plenty of experience shooting AR’s and the 240B. I qualified expert on both. I served on active duty as a Combat Medic for 21 years including 2 years in Afghanistan.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If he did have ear protection they would surely have either been on his head or in the vacinity of the window and therefore in the photos?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a good point, but over-the-ear hearing pro could easily roll under a chair or bed or something and not be in the few photos that were leaked.</p>

<p>He could have also used in-ear hearing pro and discard them before he shot himself. I imagine in-ear hearing pro would be under-effective under these conditions, but I&#39;m having trouble remembering what kind of hearing pro I had to use the times I&#39;ve shot at an indoor range (i&#39;m assuming double protection, but i just don&#39;t remember), so I&#39;m not really qualified to pass judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it holds no value because if your government did want to fuck you over then they easily could. Your military is stronger than the next 26 combined or something crazy like that? No amount of semi autos and shotguns are gonna stop them if they really want to fuck with you.</p>

<p>I also appreciate your right to bear arms, just think the line needs to be moved. You&#39;ve collectively agreed that civilians don&#39;t have the right to bear RPG&#39;s and LMG&#39;s right? So in my opinion assault rifles should also be behind that line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, legally they did it in Chicago, NYC...</p>

<p>Basically, they want to disarm White People. They don’t seem to care much about black &amp; Hispanic people packing illegal firearms. That they are not concerned with.</p>

<p>Now, legal gun carrying white people - They are determined to put the kibosh on that. </p>

<p>Now, these events where a white male kills a bunch of people could be real &amp; they “don’t let a crises go to waste” (Rahm Emanuel) to push their no guns for White People agenda.</p>

<p>Or quite possibly with these shady ass mutherfuckers they stage these events themselves to say “Look! White people shouldnt have guns!” </p>

<p>It’s one of the two. Either way - Organized cohesive White People with guns they see as DEFINITELY a threat to whatever fucked out plan they have to increase their wealth &amp; power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“I do not own an AR-15, but I have shot one...”. All credibility out the window at this point.</p>

<p>Not saying you’re wrong, but shooting an AR-15 a couple times is not even close to coming to someone who has an advanced knowledge of the sound an AR makes. For the record, I own multiple ARs and AKs and the sound is definitely not what I would expect a 5.56 to sound like, but who knows what amount acoustic manipulation is accounting for what we hear.</p>
