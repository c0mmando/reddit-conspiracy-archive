        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys, I made a comment earlier with as much information as I could find regarding how Stephen Paddock was able to injure/kill so many people in so little time. I figured it was interesting enough to make a post out of.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The information available regarding the shooting is <em>incredibly</em> varied. Almost no 2 sources say the same thing and many articles are just plain wrong about certain claims. I did my best to be as accurate as possible, but it was an uphill battle. For this reason, I ask everybody to <strong>please</strong> comment with corrections as well as any additional information that I may have left out.</p>

<h2>How was the Las Vegas shooter able to injure/kill so many people?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We are being told that there was a single gunman named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Paddock">Stephen Paddock, age 64</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>We are being told the shooter had between <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/10/03/the-tricked-out-guns-las-vegas-shooter-used-in-massacre/">16-23 firearms</a> (I found different numbers on almost every site I visited)</p></li>
<li><p>1x <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FnhUYifgs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=44s">AR-15</a>, 
1x <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6REoRsEZGkU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=16s">.308 AR-10</a>, 
1x &quot;AK-47 type rifle&quot;, 
4x <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfbxyiiIs28&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=17s">Daniel Defense DDM4</a>, 
3x <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkBq7KXPbgM">FN-15</a> (The links are videos of the guns shooting bump fire)</p></li>
<li><p>The shooter had at least 1 bump stock. One was attached to an AR-15, but I couldn&#39;t find what guns the others were attached to. <strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/0ec1df8e71894d59935263eb66cbc66e/Vegas-gunman-transferred-$100K,-set-up-cameras-at-hotel-room">AP claims 12 &quot;bump stock devices&quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p>In the <a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/inside-hotel-room-vegas-killer-gun.jpg?quality=90&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=326">picture of Stephen Paddock&#39;s room</a>, you can see an AR on the floor with a bump stock, vertical grip, 50-75 round magazine, and what looks like a holographic sight</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://www.eotechinc.com/hws-service-and-support/faq#92">holographic sight</a> is accurate up to 300 meters</p></li>
<li><p>Paddock was a little over 350 meters away from the concert (<strong>a</strong><sup>2</sup> +<strong>b</strong><sup>2</sup> =<strong>c</strong><sup>2</sup> where <strong>a</strong> is the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/EcDi4">distance from the NW corner of the Mandalay Bay</a>, <strong>b</strong> is an estimation of 320 ft since the hotel is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Las_Vegas">480 ft tall</a> and the 32nd floor is about 2/3 up, <strong>c</strong> ends up ~1155 ft or ~352 m)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ9Y1V-ltUw">Here&#39;s a video</a> of a dude shooting semi auto at 300 yard with a holographic sight. 350 meters is about 384 yards so Paddock was shooting full auto, 384 yards, and at night.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wnEYhiW.jpg">A photo of the view</a> from the shooter&#39;s window</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSizVpfqFtw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2m11s">Here&#39;s a video</a> of what happens when you shoot an AR-15 full auto continuously. It lasts for 830 rounds of ammunition before it failed completely. It took 6 minutes from the 1st shot to the gas tube melting. Keep in mind that the gun would have become significantly less accurate as the barrel heated and began to warp, even less accurate from 384 yards.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that the entire shooting only lasted <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-shows-exactly-how-the-las-vegas-massacre-unfolded-2017-10/#1013-pm-police-outside-realise-where-the-shots-are-coming-from-6">about 10 minutes</a>. Nonstop full auto from a bump stock AR-15 would be around <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bump-fire-stock-ar-15-stephen-paddock-guns-deadlier/">400-600 rounds per minute</a> which gives us 4000-6000 possible bullets. Now factor in 75 rounds magazines, taking the time to swap out magazines, and switching between only 2 full auto rifles (only 2 bump stocks) and that number goes down by a lot. Paddock also moved across his room at least once since we know 2 windows were blown out. My guess for a &quot;best&quot; case scenario? I think an experienced gunman could get off 2000 rounds if he was going as fast as possible and wasn&#39;t aiming.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is a really critical piece of evidence. Some guy put together a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2uEKUc0_Vc">synchronized video</a> of all the shooting videos that got posted online. Obviously I didn&#39;t count all the shots and in some places the sound is pretty funky anyway. But if I had to give an estimate, I don&#39;t think that more than 1000 rounds were fired. Obviously 1000 rounds is still a lot, but is it enough to get 59 kills and hundreds of injuries?</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s be generous and say 80% of the injuries were actually caused by people getting trampled as they tried to escape. That means that 159 people were wounded or killed from a gunshot wound. That means that Paddock had an accuracy of 15.9% or 1 hit for every 6 bullets (if the 1000 round estimate is correct). The crowd was around 22k people so he certainly had a large target.</p></li>
<li><p>Stephen Paddock was 64 years old and allegedly had <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/las-vegas-concert-gunman-identified-stephen-paddock-64-article-1.3535944">little experience with firearms</a>. He would probably be shaking like a newborn deer from the adrenaline rush of this event.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot one thing! I went through the trouble of finding videos of all those different rifles being fired with bump stocks because of something really strange I noticed while putting together all this information. <em>None</em> of those bump stock videos sound like the gunfire heard in the videos of the shooting. They are all very rapid and uneven whereas the gun Paddock was using sounds much slower and consistent. This isn&#39;t conclusive since we still don&#39;t know exactly which weapons, ammunition, and attachments he was using. Just a side note.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>So your opinion is yours to decide. I can understand why some might not question these events and I can also understand why some might be very skeptical. I would love to hear what you guys think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From 384 yards away, even the slightest movement to the barrel of a gun will result in a huge difference in the placement of a shot.</p>

<p>This is compounded by the facts that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it was night time</p></li>
<li><p>recoil during full auto decreases accuracy</p></li>
<li><p>bump stocks are significantly less accurate than a factory full auto gun</p></li>
<li><p>semi auto ARs do not have barrels made to fire full auto, they overheat quickly and begin to &quot;droop&quot; which causes inaccuracy</p></li>
<li><p>moving targets</p></li>
<li><p>64 year old shooter with little experience</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons there can be no other conclusion that the shooter was simply not aiming at individual targets. He was essentially pointing in the general direction of the crowd and firing.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever shot any type of firearm, you would know that hitting a target is damn hard. </p>

<p>What I would really like to see is a map of the area people were shot. The photos that we&#39;ve seen show them all within a space of maybe 50 sq yards</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not certain. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that there were multiple shooters since I have not seen any evidence of that, but I do think that investigators/police have not released some crucial information. The information that we have been given simply doesn&#39;t explain how the shooter was able to kill so many.</p>

<p>What kind of info would make me less skeptical?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a full auto gun (such as a M240 mentioned in other comments) was found in his room.</p></li>
<li><p>If the investigators announced the full list of firearms used and ammunition used was especially deadly (hollow points, larger caliber than what the known guns are typically chambered in)</p></li>
<li><p>If we found out the approximate number of bullets fired and it made sense for the shooter to be able to fire that many in 10 mins.</p></li>
<li><p>If we were given a map of where people were injured/killed. It would be nice to see the spread/area of where the bullets landed.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I was on one thread in which a guy said the gunfire sounded a lot like he was using a crank, more consistent sound than a bump stock apparently, but that doesn&#39;t solve the problem of the barrel overheating unless he was swapping guns like a madman. But at this point I agree that there needs to be more info released before we come to a concrete conclusion </p>

<p>However, I also admit that I found a few videos that made me doubt the m240 theory. The .309 AR-10 with a bump fire stock sounds similar to the slower, more consistent m240.</p>

<p>The more bump fire videos I looked at, the more I realized that the rate of fire and sound was dependent on the techniques the shooter was using.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that youtuber does that for a living too. In my mind, he&#39;s one the most experienced people at shooting a high number of rounds in a short amount of time. He is able to fire 830 rounds in 6 minutes.</p>

<p>My &quot;non-generous&quot; estimate for the number of rounds fired by the shooter would be around 500-600. This number would mean he was hitting a <em>unique</em> person with 1 bullet out of every 4 or so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shooting lasted 10 minutes and took place in 100 round bursts though. An AR-15 both wouldn&#39;t sound like that (inconsistent bump-firing) and wouldn&#39;t be able to shoot for that long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the youtuber uses 30 round magazines and a few 50 round drum mags.</p>

<p>We know from pictures and audio that the Las Vegas shooter was using magazines capable of at least 75 rounds. This would increase the heat of the barrel and reduce the amount of time before an AR-15 completely fails.</p>

<p>The explanation here is that the shooter was simply swapping out guns without bothering to reload any of them. This would make sense if he was inexperienced and might also explain why he killed himself after only 10 minutes. Once he cycled through all his guns, he gave up.</p>

<p>However, this also leads to more questions. If he really was just switching from gun to gun then why are there such long pauses in between each volley of shots? If he really did have shooting platforms set up in 2 different windows, he certainly would have set up each gun to be ready immediately. He should have been able to fire one gun and move to the next in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The consistent rate of fire and sound are still not explained here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that in this photo, we see that the gun with a bump stock doesn&#39;t have a bipod. The gun with a bipod doesn&#39;t have a bump stock.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider, it&#39;s very hard to use sound to make any claims since the videos we have are all in different locations, using different devices, and there is a lot of background noise.</p>

<p>What needs to happen is that the investigators should announce a detailed list of <em>exactly</em> what weapons were found. Then people could recreate sounds and test everything themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!</p>

<p>Extended magazines and bipods/shooting platforms are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>AND there&#39;s absolutely no way he was able to group his shots if he was just standing up firing from the shoulder. Every consecutive bullet would have been 100+ feet away from the last.</p>

<p>Try this, point your finger in front of you and move your arm slightly in random directions. Now imagine you&#39;re pointing at a 2 story house 4 football fields away. You aren&#39;t hitting that house 9 times out of 10.</p>

<p>The <strong>only</strong> way to maintain the minimum level of accuracy needed to do what the shooter did would be to have a high capacity magazine (75 or more) <em>AND</em> a stable shooting platform.</p>

<p>Since an extended magazine like the one shown in the linked picture can&#39;t be used with a bipod or platform, then the shooter <strong>must</strong> have used a belt-fed machine gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean &quot;shot in relative groups&quot;?</p>

<p>Like he was identifying groups of people and targeting them or he was grouping his shots together?</p>

<p>The &quot;synchronized video&quot; link I provided shows the entire event very well. I recommend watching it if you haven&#39;t already. In the video, it seems like the shooter fires a ~75 round magazine, takes around 30 seconds to reload, then repeats over the 10 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is he didn&#39;t need to he accurate. He  was firing from an elevated position into a densely packed crowd of 20,000 people. He didn&#39;t aim at particular people he just sprayed bullets down on them and hit people at random. Anyone who has any grasp on tactics and strategy will tell you that being in that sort of position is all a person needs to do some massive damage. He had dozens of weapons, so the amount of casualties is not a mystery here. If he was aiming towards a crowd of that size in the most populated  and densely packed areas of the event it&#39;s a miracle more didn&#39;t die or were not injured.There are about 500 plus casualties in addition to the 59 dead.  Whether it was 1000 rounds or 5000, it was like shooting fish in a barrel for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This makes a lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in seeing a virtual recreation of the shooting. When each victim was hit. The spread/area of where the bullets landed. How the crowd dispersed over the 10 minutes. Did he reload any of his guns or did he just pick up a new gun when he emptied a magazine. I think it would get rid of a lot of the skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading something akin to this for the Australia rampage in &#39;96. Nothing extremely technical about it but a timeline accounting of shots fired and hits, who was hit and when, that kind of thing. That guy killed over 30 but did so over much longer and in multiple locations, it was a real manic rampage. I don&#39;t see anything akin to this being likely in this case, that&#39;s a helluva lot of shells to match and forget about timing, defacto machine guns here. Would be illuminating if possible, though. </p>

<p>Lol, the Sheriff you are referencing also said there was no note. Now there is a note. He also said Paddock checked in on the 28th, that is a lie.</p>

<p>But keep telling folks about the truth coming from the Sheriff. It&#39;s fucking adorable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the door that the security guard was shot through only looks like it was shot from the prone position as well.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!</p>

<p>Extended magazines and bipods/shooting platforms are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>AND there&#39;s absolutely no way he was able to group his shots if he was just standing up firing from the shoulder. Every consecutive bullet would have been 100+ feet away from the last.</p>

<p>Try this, point your finger in front of you and move your arm slightly in random directions. Now imagine you&#39;re pointing at a 2 story house 4 football fields away. You aren&#39;t hitting that house 9 times out of 10.</p>

<p>The <strong>only</strong> way to maintain the minimum level of accuracy needed to do what the shooter did would be to have a high capacity magazine (75 or more) <em>AND</em> a stable shooting platform.</p>

<p>Since an extended magazine like the one shown in the linked picture can&#39;t be used with a bipod or platform, then the shooter <strong>must</strong> have used a belt-fed machine gun.</p>
