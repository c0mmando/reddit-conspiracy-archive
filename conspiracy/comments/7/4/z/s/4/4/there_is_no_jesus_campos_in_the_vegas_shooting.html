        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been a full week now this evening and not a single photo has emerged or been released from the man of the year. Alleged Jesus Campos. The security guard at the Mandalay Bay.</p>

<p>The reason why we haven&#39;t seen his face is because there is no such person. Period! The whole story about that supposed person is false. It&#39;s fake. &quot;He&quot; is a fictional character in a scripted false flag event and &quot;Stephen Paddock&quot; may as well be a similar invention.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t remain credible saying he is the hero while not even showing a blurred photo of him in the UK&#39;s top gossip rag the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>Any photos now released supposedly picturing Jesus Campos of the Mandalay Bay are frauds. Just like the entire story line is. Read my main report to know what I&#39;m talking about if you haven&#39;t already.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really as simple as that. There are ZERO reasons why his face should remain a state secret. It&#39;s all bullshit and I&#39;m not buying it. I have given the press and the cops plenty of time to even try to forge a photo of ANY Jesus Campos and even that they haven&#39;t been able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling their bluff because my cards are already on the table and I have clearly beaten them hands down. - KJ intelsector.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. Jesus Campos (JC, seriously, there is so much symbolism that it&#39;s bordering on hysterical,) said the door was ajar. Now we are hearing from agent &quot;Newton&quot; that the door was blown up with explosives?</p>

<p>Maybe JC was the guy that was supposed to get the car full of explosives and head toward the fuel tanks and he didn&#39;t follow through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The open door wasn&#39;t Paddock&#39;s, according to the latest version of the story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>An open door a few rooms away from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers</strong> at a music festival <strong>set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard</strong>, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.</p>

<p>Authorities believe that the guard drew the attention of mass murderer Stephen Paddock away from the chaos below and toward the hallway outside his room.</p>

<p>The guard, Jesus Campos, was shot in the leg while checking on the alarm and according to a police-reported timeline, Paddock never fired on the crowd below again.</p>

<p><strong>The alarm from a room &quot;a number of doors down&quot; from Paddock&#39;s likely was a coincidence</strong>, McMahill told CNN&#39;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.&quot; <strong>The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn&#39;t have the keys to that room</strong>. McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn&#39;t shut completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he wants to stay hidden, for numerous other reasons. Maybe he&#39;s ashamed he didn&#39;t actually stop him. Maybe he just wants to be left alone.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if he wasn&#39;t a real person, I think the government would have been smart enough to get a CIA officer or something to pose as him. Parade around a government asset posing as JC, just for looks.</p>

<p>So, you being the genius you are, why didn&#39;t the government hire a stand in actor or someone to pose as the security guard? Did they just forget? Or say fuck it, we don&#39;t care? The government isn&#39;t stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s YOUR narrative that you&#39;re trying to push right now, and it sounds extremely stupid. Because you sound stupid.</p>

<p>I can buy there was a cover up. I can buy there might have been two shooters and they are covering it up. </p>

<p>I could even buy that JC isn&#39;t a real person, and that they were covering it up. But that part just simply isn&#39;t true. They aren&#39;t fucking idiots. </p>

<p>What MIGHT have happened is that a random security guard was in the area and responded, because during whatever this incident was, there&#39;s no way to insure everything goes correct. Random security guard walks into a deadly government related conspiracy, sure, wrong place at wrong time. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a possibility that he even walked into some massive government conspiracy and they aren&#39;t letting him talk to the media because they are afraid he might spill the beans. </p>

<p>But in no way am I going to believe the government fabricated an entire story about a fake person, but is too lazy to get someone to pretend to be that person. That&#39;s the easy part of your story.</p>
