        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is actually easy to follow and understand.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 2 SIU alumni Steven Byrczyski (this may very well be a pen name considering the damage the photo would do to the official story) took the picture where only ONE window at the Mandalay was smashed. He took that photo not even knowing that there was another window that would be smashed later on that morning, because if he knew about the second window he would have surely seen that that same moment when this photo was taken. But he didn&#39;t because there was no second window to photograph at that very instant (zoomed in).</p>

<p>This is really easy to follow and understand, like I told you.</p>

<p>So the only reason why folks would try to bury this FACT is because they want to push the FALSE story that the mainstream narrative is. Or because, like I sad, they can&#39;t connect two dots.</p>

<p>Think about it. Why would Byrczyski only take a picture of one window when supposedly there were two. He didn&#39;t even know about a second because the second wasn&#39;t smashed yet. From his vantage point he would have clearly seen the second window and then the caption for his photo would not have been: &quot;The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is pictured Monday, Oct. 2, 2017, the morning after Stephen Paddock, of 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, injured over 500 and killed over 50 at a Jason Aldean concert, causing the deadliest massacre in the United States in Las Vegas, Nevada. The shooterâ€™s room is circled in red.&quot;</p>

<p>Beyond any doubt, there was only ONE window to be photographed that very instant. Period.</p>

<p>They can try to spin it as they want but all that does is make my case stronger and stronger. Folks willingly being ignorant can&#39;t be blamed on me or my reporting. -- KJ intelsector.com</p>

I just can&#39;t seem to get a definitive answer for it. I need better photo software. Would love a pic of the hotel just at dawn. So I&#39;m with you on this and have been since the second day</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it is one of the rare silver bullets. Exposing the fact that the windows were smashed at daytime torpedoes the entire narrative and will leave billions of people with a very bitter taste in their mouths, that includes thousands of &quot;truthers&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hotel room receipt... pff. As if that has any value. All it does is distracting from the real questions that must be asked. I don&#39;t even understand how &quot;truthers&quot; even bought into to that for even a second. Like I said before, we need to carve out a completely new, real alternative, timeline and narrative because we have nothing on &quot;stephen Paddock&quot;. Nobody saw anything. No one saw him shooting, no one saw him smashing in the windows, no one even saw a single bullet being fired from his room. No one can even honestly say that he was in the room when the shots were fired. He may as well have been put there during the shooting itself. 75 minutes is more than enough time to put a jacket and gloves on a dead corps.</p>

<p>No pictures. The lady who says it is shown in the video in this article. She is at the 6:10 mark and she is standing up, wearing a tank top, and pointing at the building. I can&#39;t find the original video but she the one that says something about &quot;half way up&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m glad to know I wasn&#39;t nuts for trying to zoom the windows to see if they were broke while it was still night time.
 One other thing I managed to come across was a possible sniper on top of the pyramid. I saw the flash two times, but I heard three shots. I made a quick video and looped it for others too see. Got laughed at about it too, but I found it while watching the cab video</p>

<p>This is my loop video of it. Two shots with the sound:

    <div class="md"><p>Yes thanks, I know it isn&#39;t 100% but like you I find it curious. I also think if this was something that had to of been planned for a long time, I don&#39;t see why it would be such a reach to put a strobe light in that room a few days early for cover. People would automatically blow it off since they had seen it for a few days.</p>

<p>Then people say, but those windows weren&#39;t broken. True, but we have seen pictures where windows have been missing. I also read somewhere along the line that window washers were saying it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal to get them in and out. It&#39;s what they do or it is also a part of their jobs and the windows in hotels are made accessible for just those reason. Maybe you need to be a window washer to know how to go about it and not your average Vegas drunk, but it is another thing to consider.</p>

<p>For a little laugh for you, I forget where I saw it, I read it last night before work so I may be able to find it again. They were saying he had and was using &quot;tracers.&quot; I&#39;m sure you like myself have watched videos from this night from every possible angle that have been presented. Tracers??? Seriously??? And of course someone did see the muzzle flash or tracer from his window. Geezzz Louise...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I read about that but if I remember correctly the &quot;news article&quot; claimed that &quot;the killer&quot; tried to buy tracers. I haven&#39;t followed up on that because it sounded like pure BS to me. Even if tracers were allegedly used no one has seen that and nothing of that sort has been captured on video. It&#39;s all very comical at this point. Only a retard would still be clinging to the TV screen by now.</p>
