        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What was Paddocks motive? There&#39;s almost no chance this was the result of some sort of mental illness, the guy was only in his mid 60s. He had no military service, no experience in the medical field that could have messed him up. According to his family, he made most of his money post-retirement off of gambling, and had made 20,000 dollars off of it in a short time. He retired as a multi-million dollar realtor. There is nothing suggesting large debts that could cause him to do this. His family says that &quot;he wasnt an avid gun guy,&quot; so where the hell did he get 20 weapons, and how did he get 20 weapons into a luxury hotel on the Las Vegas strip in one night? His marriage wasnt failing, he hadn&#39;t lost a sibling or child. ISIS was quick to claim him a convert to their cause, but nothing has been discovered linking him to ISIS or Islam in any way at all. His brother Eric Paddock even said he had no &quot;affiliations, religion, or politics.&quot; Heavy and ABC have claimed that he was perscribed anti-anxiety medication Valium months before the shooting, but there is no supporting evidence for this claim. There is something interesting in the idea that he did this to get back at medical debts from a slip and fall accident in one the Vegas casinos, in which he tried to sue to cover the bill, but the case was dismissed later on. But he wasn&#39;t targeting the Cosmopolitan, nor did he fire from inside of it. Some claim this was in response to domestic politics surrounding weapon laws in the US, but his brother, Eric, said that he wasnt a gun guy, nor was he into politics.</p>

<p>What possible reason was there for this? Im really beginning to believe this is all a cover up and Paddock is the fallman, but I dont know what motive would be aided by killing 55 people on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen to Eric&#39;s 30 min interview and it will have you scratching your head. There was definitely something deeper going on. A guy doesn&#39;t need 20+ weapons to create a massacre. There may have been some AR rifles but some of the sound clips have me convinced on the M240 theory.</p>

<p>A lot about this entire thing stinks, it is a false flag under the guise of it being about some guy who hates trump or mentally ill, blah blah. No, this has a lot to do with who Stephen was working for. Millions of dollars from poker, maybe, but it could very well be a cover up for something else.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t even get me started with the possibility of there being multiple shooters yet a lot of that has been shoved under the rug. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had a history of being weird as fuck, private, isolated, gambling and buying guns. Someone said he was funded. Uhhh, the amount of guns/ammo was nothing compared to what he made/owned/wired. He didn&#39;t need to be funded. </p>

<p>As you said, there&#39;s no purpose, nothing to gain, it hasn&#39;t really changed anything, maybe bump stocks are banned? That&#39;s it? The fact we don&#39;t understand, probably means he was a nutjob. Yes it&#39;s rare, but so are mass murders. He snapped, went off the deep end, had some level of hate building, maybe was terminal, maybe wanted to be famous, maybe he felt the FBI wronged his Dad and he wanted blood before he died, or maybe he;s just fucking crazy.</p>

<p>Does it make sense for postal workers to come to work with a gun and blow peoples head off? Because they couldn&#39;t go the bathroom 3 times in a shift? We&#39;ve seen people snap and kill people. He just happened to enjoy guns, lived near vegas, somehow had the idea man if I was in a hotel room shooting down at 20k people, it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. Sadly he acted on that idea.</p>

<p>Nothing is black and white, not much makes sense,  but mass murders aren&#39;t good at moving any agenda forward unless its gun control. They serve very little purpose, very little impact. The arabs have been suicide bombing Israel for 20 years, very little has changed. People spend 15 seconds going omfg thats horrible, then go back to their lives. Secret orgs, govts, corps, they have much better and more proven ways to get what they want. Orlando changed nothing. Vegas has changed nothing. If a secret org is behind this, they&#39;re stupid. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen/read, most likely he was a nutjob. That&#39;s it. There&#39;s lots of how/why/etc... This is a rare event. He was a rare nutjob, it happens. People go into schools and mow people down. Why? They&#39;re crazy. Can&#39;t understand it. Makes no sense. That&#39;s why they&#39;re crazy. Who was that guy who went into a elementary or middle school? I think he killed a few 7-8 year olds. How fucked up is that? Served no purpose. Made no sense. But it happens, 300+mil people, you&#39;ll get a few completely and utterly fucked up people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because &quot;they&quot;(CIA/FBI/NSA/TSA/DHS/DOD) need to create events that we(the citizens) react to. This in turn gives reason to remove rights from citizens and consolidate power in the central government, thus strengthening intelligence agencies further.</p>

<p>So why are most shootings engineered false flags?</p>

<p>Because most Americans don&#39;t just go crazy for no reason and shoot people. So intelligence agencies create these shootings to pretend like we do... it&#39;s called gaslighting, social engineering, many names. Look up Tavistock Institute if you want to learn more about how a group of people will study human behavior and use that to literally engineer a response from the public.</p>

<p>What response? Distrust. Division. Every white male with a gun is a potential &quot;lone wolf&quot;... that&#39;s the psychology being drilled into people&#39;s heads. On purpose. Because it&#39;s engineered... because they want us divided and less trusting of eachother. </p>

<p>Ultimately you need to decide for yourself and do your own research. But you asked so here we are.</p>

<p>Caveat: are 100% of mass shootings engineered? No way in hell. But many of the mass shootings from the past 5-10 years absolutely have been coordinated by 3-letter agencies, or at least encouraged/allowed to occur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the theory&#39;s had made any sense for me until i read your post, one thing you said really struck home.</p>

<p>I can completely imagine standing in vegas hotels all your life, looking down on concerts etc thinking &quot; pffft all these mass shootings, if i was ever gonna do one id just smash these windows and it&#39;d be like fish in a barrel&quot;   - then for whatever reason decided to act on it, getting old etc, declining health won&#39;t be able to do it in 10 years etc..</p>

<p>It might really be as simple as that. Everyone is looking for a complex theory when it&#39;s actually simple.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as simple as just trusting the media and that&#39;s it. Great idea! </p>

<p>Thanks Internet stranger, so funny how 3 of you all appeared to back up the top commenter&#39;s opinion that basically &quot;there&#39;s no conspiracy&quot;... on a conspiracy sub... so glad you guys all came with your voice of reason. I was almost about to consume very dangerous conspiracy ideas but all 3 of you &amp; your suspiciously-timed comments really helped me avoid going down a dark path of crazy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;only in his mid 60s&quot; is your reason why he couldn&#39;t have had any mental illness? </p>

<p>A family member of mine suffered from depression from 43 and up. Someone I know was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s in their early 60s, probably had it for years prior. Another I know started going to therapy in their late 60s, no illness but dealing with their mental health. </p>

<p>What makes a 60 year old immune to mental illness? They&#39;re perfectly succeptible to the same mental illness as anyone else, even without a history of mental illness or some trauma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but Valium? I understand that ssri drugs have been shown to cause some people issues while trying to treat their depression/anxiety and we always hear about the majority of these mass shooters being on some sort of ssri or similar drugs. Valium (diazepam) is in the benzodiazepine class of drugs. It causes sedation, relaxation, slows you down and gives you the wobbles but as far as pharms go it isn&#39;t a new or unstudied drug. Where is the correlation between Valium and psychosis? Even if the official story was/is real, there is no chance Valium had anything to do with it. </p>
