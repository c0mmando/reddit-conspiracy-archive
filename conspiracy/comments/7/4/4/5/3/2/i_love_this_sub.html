        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I come in here after different events, or when I can&#39;t sleep late at night. Each time I come in here, I am reminded of why I love it -- it messes with my brain and gives me all sorts of other scenarios to think about. I love my thinking being challenged. </p>

<p>Today I came in because a friend told me there&#39;s a bunch of conspiracy theories about the Vegas massacre. I hadn&#39;t even considered this because I was too caught up in reading all the MSM details (yes, yes, I know). Something doesn&#39;t add up and sits uncomfortably with me about this event. </p>

<p>I started watching videos on YouTube of bullet sounds coming from different locations (from a taxi driver) and ones of people analyzing bullet fire appearing to come from about the fourth floor (but no broken window?).</p>

<p>I always notice how when the events are happening, people talk about multiple shooters, then afterwards it&#39;s always a lone person. Is this simply confusion during an event, or wrapping up the story nicely and quickly for the mass public to feel somewhat &quot;safe&quot; again?</p>

<p>My question is: is there ever a tragedy like this where you are confident that you <em>are</em> told the full story, that details aren&#39;t being covered up, that there isn&#39;t a conspiracy. If so, I&#39;d love to hear it.</p>

<p>I also see so much <em>outrage</em> online by well-meaning people and it all seems a waste of energy because it&#39;s not turned into actions which prevents these things. Seems to me that psychopaths will always find a way to kill others -- gun, truck, car, plane, bomb, gas, etc. </p>

<p>Anyways, all this to say, thank you - love this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re never given the whole story or all the details that investigators/authorities know <em>and you shouldn&#39;t always know</em>. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a conspiracy though. Investigations are not taking place openly in the public in the media <em>and they shouldn&#39;t be</em>. Even if there was a second shooter, there are scenarios where the public shoouldn&#39;t know about it right now- like if they don&#39;t have them. More important than not telling you what they do knoow is telling you what tthey don&#39;t know. If they told you that, tthen it&#39;s paint by numbers for someone planning a future event. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that anything is nefarious right now. I love this place too, but again, I realize the reality of investigations. This place exposes a lot of weaknesses and confusion and that&#39;s helpful. It also provides a lot of first hand accounts- usually confusing. That&#39;s helpful too. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not keeping score of who is right or who is wrong. I want to understand what happened. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure. If you pay super close attention, you can learn from other peoples&#39; mistakes though. Like if you&#39;re at an open-air festival, come up with an exit plan as soon as you get there. Make sure you have a path out. Not just for stuff like tthis, but for stuff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRkdwrmzYXg">like this</a> too. </p>

<p>I disagree with an awful lott of people in here about most things, but there is useful stuff in here too. Just keep your head straight and think critically. Never have a conclusion first and then try to get new evidence to support it. Let the evidence add up first. Then adjust your conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is fun. My older brother is consumed by this stuff to the point he can&#39;t really function in the world around him. This has been true for at least 40 years. There are lots of conspiracies that are based in good research, others not so much. I&#39;m sure you never get the whole story on MSM.  You don&#39;t get it here either. You have to mix them up pick your truth. I enjoy my local news mainly to see local idiots and local events...and the weather of course. There is this cultural thing in my town where people run their cars into houses on the wrong side of stop signs. I think it&#39;s sort of funny. Also I like to watch MSM to see how well they lie and those few moments when they can&#39;t hold it together. Good luck in arranging your world view.</p>
