Two options are...he managed to fit 10 suitcases into the mystery car/truck...or he acquired these weapons in Las Vegas. Now we obviously don&#39;t know how large these suitcases were...but 10 (!!) seems like an awfully large number to fit into a compact, midsize, or even a crossover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I&#39;m not a conspiracy nut...but this shit is quite puzzling. They&#39;ve known what car he arrived in by Monday morning when the fertilizer claims were said. Yet no questions from the press about the make and model of his car/truck. Unless they are combing through footage to figure out where he&#39;s been and who he talked to in LV. So confusing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. There was a valet that parked his car at one point though. I guess valet records might validate the theory of multiple trips. If he did make multiple trips then why didn&#39;t cleaning services report the ever growing amount of luggage in the suite? Maybe he had the &#39;do not disturb&#39; tag on the door for three days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay that interesting. You have the source on that? I&#39;d like to read up more on his normal interactions. </p>

<p>That&#39;s okay. They would&#39;ve asked it he had bags to take up. He could&#39;ve been smug and let them take a small arsenal up for him. </p>

<p>Most likely he just went down to his car after it was parked and got his suitcases on his own. And its very possible he used valet once to check in and scope things out. I&#39;m sure he wanted an adequate room before he brought his stuff with him. Then self parked his car the rest of the stay.</p>
