       Long story but it's flat. Lots of people know now. We do need to have a discussion about it where people aren't so divided and absolute. The mention of it triggers a pluthera of hateful remarks on this sub so here is not the best place to do that.

       Technically they do, but I suppose technically you're right, my point was you can see the southern Cross at the same time in both places. It will be daytime in South Africa when it's night in Australia, but at night they'll see the same constellations on the same date throughout the year.

       It's a network. They even tell you that. What do you think all those towers are for, that you get your phone signal from? It's a map on a phone that follows your movement on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked for a dude who built his own cell tower because he wasn't getting a good signal. He is in a large city and as soon as you enter his area the signal goes. Explain that on a satellite network? Where there are spots that the signal is gone or weak. Get to major cities and the stronger signal.

       They have better GPS systems.  I'm not military all the branches have sophisticated equipment not in our phones. Our phones just communicate a short signal to a tower, vice versa. It's all frequencies and waves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The satellite cable I think is them bouncing signals off the firmament. If you want a flat earth THeory, what are all those giant satellite dishes for ?  Flat earthers deny the existence of satellites and don't believe anyone has penetrated the firmament, especially Werner Von Braun, head of NASA, who said as much on his tombstone when he quoted a bible passage about God's firmament.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in flat earth THeory space is not quite what NASA shows us, it instead a studio for Masonic actors to portray a space program through cgi and props.

       Out of curiosity, do you then believe the orbiting satellites that we can see via naked eye and/or telescopes are CGI? Also, why would other planets and moons in our solar system be round but earth be flat? Are they CGI as well? I appreciate that you already answer questions and provide your thoughts. Many of those proposing flat Earth just post and disappear...

       A lot  effort involved to explain a flat earth perspective to a crowd of heliocentrism. For example op has deleted the post, and I have another dude telling me I make no sense after I took the time to answer his question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really see the thousands of satellites and other junk supposedly orbiting the earth? There is tons of it, and it's orbiting at 17,000 miles per hour. Do you see all that?

       I've definitely seen satellites. Wife and I watch them when camping, and it's interesting to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have no issue with people's beliefs and like discussing the topic. I can see the frustration from both sides. It's at least admirable when someone backs up their beliefs with some data and answers questions. It definitely isn't a topic that will be debated and all parties walk away agreeing to

       Very few times I've had good conversations on the topic here. As you see the op was just playing games and trolling, and when you talk about it you mostly get automatic judgement of the person , not just the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it is, I think, is people who oppose it don't research it for fearing they will believe it.  That's kind of what I did.  It's an interesting time to live where some people perceive and experience a flat earth like myself, and some perceive a sphere.  We all know what it's going to take to end the debate but unfortunately that information is being withheld. Actual photos of the Earth and space. Countless videos have busted NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of heliocentrists deny the visual info because it comes from YouTube, therefore it isn't official. Many people who ask for proof don't research to know the proof is withheld. So you have to do science and research your environment using logic and historical record.  It's not as easy as just saying it's false. Without giving any argument, which happens constantly here.

       Op thought it would be entertaining to hear someone disagree with their worldview. Not knowing their worldview is false to begin with.  Doesn't want to hear the truth though.

       The sun is actually a cube, but appears round because of the shape of the hole in the firmament through which it shines.

       Source: Looked at a shit ton of flat earth and round earth proofs and am left in doubt of either. There is tons of suspicious stuff going on with NASA and space imagery which does not help.

       I think flat earth may be a distraction of something even more "out there." It is a sad state of affairs when one can not be certain of the ground beneath his feet.
