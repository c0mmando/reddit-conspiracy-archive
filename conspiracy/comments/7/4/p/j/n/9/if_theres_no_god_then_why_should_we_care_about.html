       These debates are absolutely silly. I said nothing about the existence or non-existence of god, only a reference that mocks our own inability to really determine our own morality and I get downvotes? Get the heck out of here.

       You don't know if God does or doesn't exist, so the possibility of God existing will always exist, therefore punishment of sins after death is always a possibility.

       In the same logic, the opposite could be argued as the possibility of there not being a god is

       I don't think you are being preachy. I can talk about this subject with you, but it's true that I won't discuss most subjects with people who use faith as a source of knowledge. This is because faith based reasoning in unassailable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Socratic method involves questioning why you believe something to be true until you get to the bottom of your beliefs. Its a recursive process. Theists often say they believe something because it is part of their faith.  This means there is no underlying beliefs to explore deeper than that faith and since I don't share the faith we can't find common ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I don't mind you being a Christian, but I'm not and so I don't count you as a person I can take seriously anymore than I expect you count me as one.

       Well, the death penalty is often a punishment that has been decided upon by a jury, and is usually not something conferred on someone by another person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like sometimes the ardently religious people see the non-religious the same way people and cops see sovereign citizens. The non-religious people often have a strong sense of self, and I feel like being religious requires you to give at least a part of your self to God. You have to be willing to give certain sacrifices and live a certain way under the premise that this is following the plan and rules of God, and that it will be rewarded, but it's not like God himself came down from heaven and had you sign a contract on ink and paper that said that. It's called "faith" because you have to be willing to do that, you have to be willing to put yourself and everything you do in the hands of something that you can't physically
       <em>
        show
       </em>
       someone who doesn't believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to what you were asking, it's not that there is something wrong with God punishing sinners
       <em>
        assuming he exists
       </em>
       . The problem is that I don't think
       <em>
        man
       </em>
       should be able to levy punishment against
       <em>
        man
       </em>

       We do whatever makes living in a society and propogating our species easier. Generally things like rape and murder make it hard to live in harmony with other humans.

       In a society of subjective morals, anything can be considered moral if the majority says it is.  If the consensus says that rape is morally good, then rape will be allowed.

       right? but fortunately most people don't like to be hurt either emotionally or physically. so if I don't like being raped I would say rape sucks and I think rape should be wrong. most would agree. morality is not exclusive to Christianity. I am a Christian but the idea that you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you is basic human nature. we all learn at a fairly young age about sharing and things like that and we learn what makes us happy like when someone does good things for you. you want those things done for you and you learn that you need to do nice things for others in order to maintain that cycle. simple

       It's not a matter of what's "a bad idea" or not. It either
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       or it
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       . Either God is real and there is an absolute morality, or he's not, and morality is subjective. Whether or not it's "a good idea" according to you have zero bearing on the fact of the matter.

       then that society would become chaos. law and order would go out the window and you would lose basic functions of civilization like utilities. look at how many civilizations there have been throughout history. there have been countless types of religions and many types of law. the simple truth is you don't need god to have a civilized society. subjective morality has been working for ages. if you get any random group of people together living in a functioning community law and order will be born or chaos will consume them and they will be annihilated.

       All morality is subjective, but to you your bible is the dictator on your moral code. You can't see how it can be morally subjective. The ideas of morals a lone is a subjective subject. People can agree on some basic moral prinicples. But the best way for morals to catch on is if they are often practiced. I believe hypocrisy is what has diminished most peoples faith. So many grand churches that put on a show and speak the word but dont' practice it faithfully. It's what put me off to even approaching the subject. I believe in a higher power and don't believe I need to read a book to understand or feel that power.

       That would be like teaching them that sticking a hot poker in their eye is good. Couple the implications of the difficulty of teaching that with the empathy that healthy humans and most social animal species feel and there's your morality. Nothing subjective about it.

       You have no proof of that whatsoever.  You just

       that.

       If you will provide proof that your morals come from God and God's morals are objective, Ill believe you.  But you cannot provide proof because it doesnt exist. People have been asking for proof of your god for centuries and people are still waiting.  All you offer is faith.  It seems if god wanted people to believe he or she wouldnt make it so damn impossible for people to believe.

       Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them. ~ Steve Eley

       I personally don't think anyone can say there is a god (or call it a "creator") or not. And if there was, there might not be a "purpose"  and the entity might be completely ambivalent to us and our pursuits. So the whole thing is a bit of a moot point, imo.

       It's important to have a civil and polite society because that's how everyone would like to be treated. The world would suck for you if everyone was an asshole, right? That's why we should strive to be good people. Also - I think this universe is pretty interesting and if we work together maybe someday we can start figuring it all out. Maybe we can eventually solve those questions we think are unanswerable eventually.

       Technically yes nothing is as we are nothing. but this is one side of balanced universe, there is a source rooted in energy. And actions echo through "time" into eternity.

       As conscious beings we are the creators of meaning, we either create a meaningful life or we create a meaningless life, either way WE create the meaning. Think about movies, no one ever goes into making a movie with the intention to have it be meaningless (what would be the point, right?), directors, actors, everyone involved is striving to create a meaningful movie. Why? Why is creating meaning so important? Is it so we can feel like our time isn't wasted? And if we  feel like our time could be wasted than it would seem to me that we are saying that life's a gift and in order to show that we are worthy of such a gift, we make that gift meaningful, so that the gift won't be wasted on us.

       Who said there is no purpose to life and why would you care if they said that?  The purpose of life may be to figure out the purpose of life.  My theory is that the "big bang" was that essentially God (the singular, lonely entity in the universe) went on a mission of self-discovery.  We are all fragments of the singular entity in an illusion of separateness.  Like a shattered mirror with shards reflecting upon each other.

       Yeah, that's why it's very important to have moral and ethical philosophers trying to develop understandings and arguments for good moral codes.

       Just because the subjectivity of morality leaves the door open to bad outcomes doesn't mean it must be false.

       Are you stating that belief in a god is the only reason people care for others? I think that countries with high atheist rates do well caring for others (Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand). I'd also point out that during the most fervent religious periods of history saw the most extreme lack of caring for each other (middle ages, serfdom, Spanish Inquisition, witch trials, Western institutionalized  slavery, etc...). Lastly, it appears that the most religious countries murder the most people today (Islamic religious fundamental states, Israell, America, Baltic states, etc...). How do you reconcile that?

       Does the obvious presence of evil not imply there is an opposing force or good? Call it God. Call it what you like but choices are right or wrong, good or evil. Whether you need to personify this is irrelevant. The longer i live the longer i realise evil is winning. I dont care how you want to categorise is but more people need to start choosing the good side irrespective of a religious context

       You don't have to care about other people. That's up to you. I personally only care about other people who also care about other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think most people do care about others. Humans are pretty selfish. They don't like to feel bad, and so they will do things - like charity - to avoid feeling bad, but if you can convince someone to not feel bad about suffering they will often be satisfied with that. That's not caring about others that's caring about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the existence of God makes you care about other people? Caring can't be faked, so simply being ordered to by a commandment doesn't cut it. Caring is a feeling you either have or do not have.

       If there's no god and no afterlife, by process of elimination that would make this life everything, regardless of any absence of purpose.  Care about your life because it's the framework and foundation anything you begin to value is built from.  Make the conscious choice to care about your life because the alternative is valuing nothing.  And that is like taking an equation, multiplying both sides of it by zero, and proclaiming life and death both amounting to nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for caring about others, that usually comes naturally once you've decided that your own life has value.

       You just need to listen to your heart son and stop shilling around this place. You keep posting this God stuff, take it to r/christianity or r/atheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your point though, would you feel good raping someone? Do you want to kill? Do you feel like you could laugh as you torture someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you like gifts? Does it feel good when your mom hugs you? Does it feel good to give a homeless person some food? Do you like laughing with your friends?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats your answer, now cut this shit out

       You forget that you can obey God so you can go to heaven.  If you murder somebody, then you go to jail.  If you murder somebody and you don't ask for forgiveness from God then you go to spiritual jail, which is the lake of fire.

       I agree with you, but if society one day decides to change their morality, then we'll be in for a big change.  I'm sure their be some people who would support legalized murder or some type of "Purge".

       So, we have identified at least two groups of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Group 1- Do not believe in god and do not commit horrible acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Group 2- Believe in god and commit horrible acts.

       I assume you have read the bible so you know that the Kingdom of God is inside of YOU, right?  You say "The pride of a person...", but what about YOU?  That is what you are responsible for.

       So you think this is morally OK ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Deuteronomy 22:28-29 â€œIf a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days.
