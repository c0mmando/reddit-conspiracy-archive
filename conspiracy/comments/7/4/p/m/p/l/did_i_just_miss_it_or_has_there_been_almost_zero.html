       It seems investigators publicly voiced theories on ISIS, Lone gunman, and multiple shooters. I haven't heard any mention of any cartel. Is this just a total dead end? They have been known to be pretty brutal in the past. Any thoughts?

       I don't have any evidence other than what i've seen in the news, on here and other articles. I was just curious why, when exploring ISIS, they didn't think to look a couple hundred miles south, to the people who run drugs. I'm not saying thats what it is, I'm saying why not clear the air on that as well?

       I know, but why go straight to ISIS? Why not use the cartels? Especially considering the current Administration's stance on immigration (though i'm almost 100% the POTUS isn't tied in).

       I heard the Saudis own the upper portion of the Mandalay called the four seasons. It's a hotel within a hotel. From the 35th floor up to the penthouses.

       I agree we haven't heard about cartel especially since its in a casino. Where are any vids of Paddock.?

       It will be disappointing, I'm sure. Like a one or two second glimpse of the side and back of him or some look-alike walking into the casino carrying a black bag.

      <p>
       It will probably be a little blurry, black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they will loop it on all the networks and use that for his proof of guilt.  That's what I expect if we even get that.

       I agree, but with the cost and effetiveness of technology today, We should be holding them to a higher standard. I mean the monitors that Paddock had in his room were most likely 1080p. the webcam was most likely 720p. They are cheap and easily accessable online or from Target/Wal*Mart/etc. There should be a clear, color photo of him that prooves guilt beyond a shaddow of a doubt. Isn't that what we all agreed on?

       Or a terrible thing. MSM reporters crawling about looking for anything they can turn in to a 3 paragraph "unconfirmed report." Then we see it on another site, and take it as proof we craked the case. We played ourselves. I don't have any proof, but I can see it going that way as more time passes without answers.

       That would be totally frustrating. But it may drive people to even more opposition of the media.  I just get this feeling this event is waking people up and whatever the officials try to say is going to scrutinized and found to be fake.  They're gambling right now and I think they will lose.

       Conspiracy sub spiked after this event , difference between this and say 9/11 is after 9/11 hardly anyone believed it was an inside job. In this short time many people now question these events ad nauseam.

       Pretty good one too.  Basically Paddock is an old time drug/gun runner from back in the day.  Used to hop around in Texas (one of his planes was in Mesquite Texas.

       Right, I think I saw that a day or two ago, maybe? But there's still been no official statement that I know of. no questions asked, that I heard. I'm just curious.

       A friend linked a photo of Steve paddock with a number 13 tattooed to his neck. Like the gang ms 13. I don't think the media has expired that angle. As far as I know.

       That was just old man neck wrinkles. It does look like a 13, but I don't see an "internal auditor" for a major defense contractor having a neck tattoo. I could be wrong, but it doesn't fit.

       I'm not saying there is. I don't want to put information out that isn't true. I would like to see it investigated.

       For all I know, they are investigating it. I just haven't heard a public statement. Which makes me wonder, why?

       Very, very true. Especially when they have made comments about investigating other possible leads. Silence during times like this says a lot.

       I agree, but with the cost and effetiveness of technology today, We should be holding them to a higher standard. I mean the monitors that Paddock had in his room were most likely 1080p. the webcam was most likely 720p. They are cheap and easily accessable online or from Target/Wal*Mart/etc. There should be a clear, color photo of him that prooves guilt beyond a shaddow of a doubt. Isn't that what we all agreed on?

       Do they have anything scheduled for today? The pressers say a lot. Body language, talking over the reporters questions, things like that make people suspicious.
