    <div class="md"><p>That would be totally frustrating. But it may drive people to even more opposition of the media.  I just get this feeling this event is waking people up and whatever the officials try to say is going to scrutinized and found to be fake.  They&#39;re gambling right now and I think they will lose.</p>

<p>Conspiracy sub spiked after this event , difference between this and say 9/11 is after 9/11 hardly anyone believed it was an inside job. In this short time many people now question these events ad nauseam.</p>

<p>All eyes on Vegas. Is there going to be anything released today.. press conference?</p>
