    <div class="md"><p>like i said if you&#39;re shooting automatic weapons all over a city you&#39;re going to get all sorts of crazy sounds: echoes, ricochets, hitting concrete, metal, wood, soil, etc etc. that is a fact. if you weren&#39;t hearing those different sounds it would be suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you watch too many movies, tbh. Listen to the audio I linked. Really listen to it. They&#39;re all distinct and varying distances. I&#39;ve spent years hunting and listening to echoes (know where other hunters are to stay away from them), and I&#39;m an avid target shooter. I know the sound of guns, bullets, and echoes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t take into account how much louder (aka closer) the first gun was, compared to the others. The softer shots are clearly further away from the taxi, than the louder shots, and the softer shots do not match up to the louder shots to justify the &quot;echo&quot; theory. If you actually watch the video you can hear the softer (further) away shots without the loud shots preceding it. This the best evidence I have seen so far that shows there were more than one shooter at more than one angle/distance from the taxi driver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, it is real.  Though there may be an explanation for it that we don&#39;t quite understand.  Some have talked about it possibly being the sounds of the bullets breaking the sound barrier.  Here is an example of that <a href="https://youtu.be/JMq4wiIOKGE?t=201">https://youtu.be/JMq4wiIOKGE?t=201</a> . What I am having trouble wrapping my brain around is the irregular intervals of the higher pitched snap shots (pictured below with blue marks).  Take a look at the last 2 snap shots.  I&#39;m not sure what to think of it. but i dont take it as 100% evidence yet.  I will be going through all 50+ videos of the shooting i have found so far and will be posting irregular or interesting waveforms over the next week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is so hard to tell because of all the buildings and obstacles.  Plus, I think he was shooting inside and outside.  That is why some shots are muffled, but I could be wrong.  </p>

<p>It would be nice if someone could document damage at another casino, like Bellagio. There should be bullet holes somewhere, or signs of repairs, if there were gunmen there.  </p>

<p>The lack of video evidence from law enforcement is very suspicious.  It is like they need more time to get their story straight.  I want to see video of the shooter hauling up all of that equipment.  I also want to see video of him in the casino a few hours before the attack.  </p>

<p>I think they are hiding stuff.  I really do.  They know what happened, but they do not want to tell us, so it must be pretty bad.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that audio is from a video of a person who is moving her car, moving her direction, moving the recording device and driving under certain structures along the hotel. Also you gotta take into account the shooter moving position and moving where he&#39;s aiming at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree to some some extent.  If more than 1 shooter, why isn&#39;t there ALWAYS overlapping shots?  Seems they would both be balls to the wall firing non stop, yet we have single volley after single volley with a couple of somewhat questionable overlaps that could be several different things including multiple shooters.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m more intrigued by multiple shooters at DIFFERENT locations .. was it the Mirage where there was apparently another active shooter, somewhere else someone says the cops dropped someone, etc.</p>

<p>The multiple shooter narrative has collapsed around multiple people within that suite at the Mandalay Bay - quite possibly a deliberate refocusing to distract from those other reports and scenarios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason, people think it is beyond believe that others are killed by gunfire.  </p>

<p>If someone is going to stage a hoax, it is very risky to use fake blood, blanks, and actors.  They are more likely to get caught.  They may as well actually do it as a false flag, and have a patsy take the blame.  </p>

<p>I know.  Maybe they whole JFK assassination thing was a hoax.  It was fake blood, and JFK actually survived it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay, you&#39;re operating on circular logic, so I guess demonstrate that people were killed by gunfire...? There were 20,000 witnesses, hundreds of them with active recording devices when the shooting would have begun, so it should be pretty easy to go find a clip of anyone or anything getting shot, anything which has been damaged by bullets, or anyone with apparent gunshot wounds.</p>

<ol>
<li>People were killed by gunfire</li>
<li>Therefore shots were fired.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not circular logic.</p>

<p>You know, it is easy to find out if these were real people that died.  The list of names is public.  Many of them have facebook pages with lots of public info (<strong>don&#39;t doxx, of course</strong>).  Go stalk them.  Send messages to the people that are their friends.  Go check out their universities and jobs.</p>

<p>And every single time, the response will be &quot;<em>Fuck off, you ignorant, vicious little ghoul</em>&quot; and this is because <em>people died</em>.</p>
