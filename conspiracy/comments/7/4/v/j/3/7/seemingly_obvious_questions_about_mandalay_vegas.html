         Wouldn't guests above/below/next to the shooter hear the windows breaking and rounds being shot? I know there was a report of someone below him but what about the people on his floor? And wouldn't that happen almost immediately, giving him next to no time to shoot?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If that was the case, he should have expected limited time to fire. So why bring ALL of those guns/ammo? Seems like a waste if he knew he only had 10-20 minutes of shooting.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On the other hand, the fact that he DID bring so much equipment with him suggests that he was initially prepared to shoot for a much longer time and hurt a lot more people, so why would he execute his plan so poorly?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How does a 64 year old male even have the stamina/strength to break two full sized windows and then continue to shoot up a crowd...could his lack of energy explain the gaps in the shootings?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       A usual goal with a mass shooting/attack is to hurt the largest amount of people in the most efficient way and it seems like there were a lot of other methods he could have employed in order to harm a larger amount of people...as fucked up as it is, I'm just surprised that the body count is so low.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been so intrigued by this all week, can't stop reading or watching.

       Exactly what I'm wondering. I was involved in a school shooting when I was a sophomore, and the gunshot was LOUD. There is no way they just 'conveniently' heard nothing.

       can you elaborate more? i believe what youre saying just want to hear more of your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       also i saw a video of people on the 42nd ish floor during an event, the shots were almost lost in the music, still very loud but maybe not as loud as lower down, with the buildings echo.

       I mean, I was LOUD. Like, there was no doubt about what had happened. We heard a loud bang, and a girl dropped. Everyone started running and screaming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it makes sense that the music drowned it out on the top few floors, but the people on the same floor and probably the floors at least immediately above and below should have been able to hear it. If the gun fire was able to be heard streets away why couldn’t the people in the hotel hear it?

       the guy one floor lower also has been interviewed, but he said he got worried after the "3rd volly of gunfire".   kind of dosent make sense. seen as we know he fired multiple shots before the masses/aldean noticed.

       You forget a concert was going on the street oin front of them.  The walls are likely concrete,  abusing alcohol in Vegas is a thing and likely arm 10pm people were loaded.

       This would be true, I go to the gun range and have been hunting, even with ear protection it is loud, firing so many rounds in unison would definitely draw attention quickly to where you are located

       A school shooting (for which I give my condolences you experienced) is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       different than a Las Vegas hotel/concert/event shooting. The venue being Las Vegas to begin with brings a lot of things guests expect-- drunken guests (possible crashing bottles/glasses), loud parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties with screaming and laughing. Secondly, as someone mentioned the guests at that time would likely be out of their rooms. Most ppl don't visit Vegas to stay in their rooms. A concert was going on outside. Only natural to assume there'd be fireworks. To the untrained hear (like many of the victims below) gunshots are confused with fireworks. This was, afterall, the end of the festival.

       Ive been saying from the beginning that the security guard stood out to me right away. People are hailing him a hero. Usually media would be all over that kinda story for ratings. The man who saw the shooter and survived! Look at the Boston Bombing "hero". He was interviewed almost immediately and, iirc, even sat with the President one on one. I really think Compos was part of the plot and used his uniform as a way out without being noticed or questioned. Especially if he was shot in the leg. No one would think to question him leaving the scene injured. He could have easilly have double crossed Paddock to be used as a patsy and it would explain the 2 broken windows if he was involved. I dont even know what he looks like, which to me, is crazy considering we have pictures of the victims and other stories of men shielding their gf/wives from bullets. What do we know about Jesus Campos?

       Did you watch the video I linked? There are 2 shots from a hand gun at 3:25 and 3:35 then no more gun fire. What if the first shot is Jesus Campos shooting Paddock, then the second hand gun shot is Campos shooting himself in the leg to make it look like he was shot and not involved in this.

       This comment hit me like a ton of bricks. I watched that video two nights ago but couldn't make sense of it. This coupled with the keycard being used while Paddock's vehicle was out of the garage strongly supports the accomplice angle imo.

       They are making Jesus look like a hero because he was the special "security guard" that the Mandalay Bay was providing for the gun deal in the room.

       Jesus has to tow the line and say he "definitely" did not see the 2 ISIS agents leave the room, and it was just Paddock that was suicided in the room

       Can someone correct me if I'm wrong, but he supposedly set up a sniper nest inside the hotel room. No rifle extended beyond the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever shot a lot of rifle or pistol, in an indoor range, there is a significant amount of smoke and gas. How the fuck could he see in an unventilated hotel room after fire hundreds, or thousands of rounds?
      </p>
      <p>
       The hotel photos also show few casings around the room. If he was shooting, brass usually elects in one direction, fast and hard. It usually takes chunks out of wood on shooting bays. I didn't see any brass, damage or the like anywhere in those photos. If it was a true investigation, wouldn't they not be allowed to touch anything in the room before that investigation is complete?

       if you're shooting at indoor ranges where a lot of smoke and gas gathers, you should probably stop going there.  also, it doesn't seem you've actually shot rifles or pistols if you seriously think rounds ejecting take chunks out of plywood - this is absurd.  i've been hit by plenty of rounds standing next to my buddies shooting and the worst that happens is they're hot as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd explain why a few other things you've said are also wrong but it's clear you're not going to listen anyway so i dont much see the point.

       Shooting bays are heavily ventilated, that is correct, but for a reason. Have you ever been hit in the face with ejected brass from an AK? Because not only is it hot as fuck, but it hurts like a bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to the range this afternoon, I'll include some photos of the nicks surrounding each shooting bay to show you what I mean. Chunks was likely a poor choice of wording on my part.

       didnt the smoke alarm supposedly go off? maybe that's why he quit shooting 10 minutes in.  idk i have no dog in this fight because i really dont give a shit, i just like reading all these theories from people who have never shot a gun.  you would think that if he was shooting that many rounds most of them would be towards one side of the room, but switching between windows could account for that.

       I had heard he disabled the smoke alarms since they would likely be triggered pretty quickly, but other rooms in the hall might have gone off, no doubt.

       Most ARs are ambidextrous, allowing you to change the configuration based on whether you are right or left handed. I guess I would just figure there would be a shit ton of brass in that hotel room.

       absolutely incorrect. ARs are not ambidextrous.  the ejection port and forward assist, if there is one, are on the side opposite the mag release, bolt catch - they are forged this way. you CAN get ambidextrous parts like your CH, bolt/mag release, etc, but the brass is still only ejecting in one direction based on how the upper receiver was designed.  left handed ARs have the ejection port on the left side, and right handed on the right. you cant change this on the fly.  there's no argument there. seems like a simple mistake for someone with any experience with the AR platform...

       I like that. I found this video which can further vaidate the brass moving forward / out the window. But I feel like observers on the ground floors would be randomly finding spent casings, likely ending up on Facebook or eBay for some sick asshole to buy and collect.

       I'm just playing devils advocate so keep ya pitch forks down for now:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: I don't think it would be as 'obvious' as you think. Yes, other guests would hear it - definitely. But would they actually be able to figure out which direction it is coming from? There is a lot of sound proofing in these hotels and the majority of the sound would be going strait outward away from the hotel. So while other people could hear it, they probably wouldn't know anything more than 'its coming from above/below/left/right'.. but not how far in that direction(if that, at all).
      </p>
      <p>
       2: He may have thought he would get through more shooting - a lot of people, whether its going hiking or having some drinks with friends will bring
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       than they think they would need because they are going to be in a situation where they can't
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       more if they did need it. Being over-prepared isn't exactly uncommon for.. anything really.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: Maybe the panic/adrenaline was making it difficult to complete his agenda. We don't know the full details of his 'counter measures', but potentially he thought that whatever he did(that we don't yet know about) was going to slow down police response more than it ended up doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       4: Meth. Cocaine. Drugs of whatever stimulant variation - this is Vegas after all. A heavy hit of stimulants allows people to do all sorts of great physical accomplishments they normally couldn't do and 64 isn't
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       old. Yes it is tiring firing off guns but it isn't
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       tiring either. I don't think it's that much of a stretch to think someone of 64 and average stamina/fitness could pull this off without drugs, but they certainly would make it easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gaps are far more likely to be reload/setting up time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The body count isn't that low either. People have an unrealistic view of how lethal getting shot really is. A single bullet from a significant distance has to hit a very vital organ/area of the body to actually kill anyone if they don't receive medical treatment quickly. Most people would have only been shot once I would imagine, due to the inaccuracy of the methods employed(distance/rate of fire etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       He did manage to hit 500+ people which is still a 'pretty good effort'(feels fucked up saying that) for the distance and time he was shooting - it works out to be over 50 people per minute - close to
       <strong>
        hitting someone every second he fired, on average
       </strong>
       . That isn't 'poor efficiency' by any means, in my opinion.

       I think the 500+ injuries includes those who were hurt by getting trampled etc, but otherwise really good thoughts. There’s so many different possibilities, I wish we had more concrete information.

       Ah yes, I didn't factor in the trampling/panic casualties. But even still, being 'generous'(err?) lets say
       <em>
        half
       </em>
       were from his bullets. One casualty every 2 seconds? Still pretty efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still unsure of everything except that lots of stuff doesn't add up in this shooting and it is getting stranger by the day. For sure this was not what we are being told, but what exactly that is.. we need more information, you are right.

       1) Depending on the construction methods of the hotel, there could be a lot of poured concrete between his room and other rooms which would significantly dampen the sound.  I'm also guessing he was firing very close to the window to be able to shoot down and across the street.  This would tend to make most of the firing noise go out the window, not reverberate in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 &amp; 3) The catharsis of actually executing some of his plan proved more emotionally overwhelming than expected, and he lost interest in continuing to fire.  It's the post-Christmas-presents letdown.  You have all this build up over what gifts you'll get and how bad you want them, and then when you finally have them, it's like meh and you've totally forgotten why you were so excited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is he was overly optimistic as to what he could accomplish.  And how bad would it suck if you thought ahead of time "I can only get off 1 magazine before they capture me" and then it turns out you aren't discovered for 8 hours, but you didn't bring enough guns and ammo.  It's a once in a lifetime chance, so pack appropriately.  It sounds silly, but I'd imagine he figured he would have more time, would WANT to shoot more, and had a more heroic vision of a protracted shoot-out with the cops, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual reality is shooting into the crowd a couple of times and seeing the reaction gave him an emotional response he wasn't expecting and probably a too-quick discovery.  IIRC, he blasted at the door and wounded a security guard.  I'm assuming his emotional state plus "the jig is up" realization and then he just punched his own ticket to avoid capture.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I don't think breaking the windows was that hard.   I think had some kind of window breaking gizmo that made it easier.  The gunfire wouldn't really have been stressful physically.

       But then if the windows were shot and knocked out with a hammer, how did no one hear this? And then he had to go and do exactly the same in the room adjoining? Because both of the windows were blown.

       in one of the concert videos you can possibly hear 2 shots just before the volley of fire, was this caused by him trying to get the rhythm  of the bump fire, or him breaking the windows I dont know and we likely wont know anytime soon.

       Well I can tell you before the first shot there was noises against the windows below. As I sat there watching tv it sounded like something just scraped down my window which I just thought that's weird.. then a few moments later the first of the firing. Come morning and day light I then noticed the glass from his window on the roof below, which very likely could have been what the initial sound was. It's not like people are expecting certain things from a sound or know instantly what it was to be able to alert anyone about anything credible. Some of these theories are just a huge reach, everyone over analyzing everything. The guy thought this threw, probably had a high iQ, what he did really shouldn't be considered impossible by any means.

       My guess is whatever you want to call the emotional reaction phenomenon is probably similar to what "green" soldiers go through in their first battle and why combat experienced soldiers are a superior fighting force once they've seen some action and can suppress or ignore it.

       It's not been shown on mainstream media yet but there are logs showing the he was actually in the hotel from the 25th of September, but was put in to another room until the suite on the 32nd floor became available. So if he had the guns from the 25th of September he would of had to move the guns and ammo in to a different room too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also seen an article saying that most of these hotels (and I imagine especially Manderlay Bay as it's part of MGM) have bullet proof windows or at the very least the windows are alarmed when they are tampered with. I imagine this is so that people who have lost big amounts of money can't jump from the window. Surely by now we would have more witness reports, people seeing him around the hotel/strip/casinos.

       Not even that so much. He had 4 days to get them all up there. Don’t know if you have ever been to Vegas, but I’ve done some convention work at the MB. It’s a busy place. Tons of people all the time. No one would take notice of the same guy carrying luggage at separate times over that time period. He would just blend in.

         same as above. they say there is evidence he planned to escape. so why have so many guns, he didnt plan to be there long. if it was in case he had to make a last stand and fight swat, why did he kill himself.

       The way it sounded to me during the press conference is that they found evidence that the shooter was planning to live beyond the shooting.  Like supplies or equipment he'd use after.  Maybe there was a go bag by the door.  maybe maps of local areas, maybe staged equipment at another location for him to hide out at.  I don't think they found sheets tied together to repel down the building.

       Stfu no it doesn’t. 10 o clock youre getting ready and staying out all night partying wake up late probably drunk the next day and do it again. What’s contradictory? Either you’re getting ready to go out, hanging at the hotel/casino/pool, or simply asleep. Explain yourself.

       I think he was an arms dealer preparing to sell a boatload of weapons to ISIS, who he connected to through his girlfriend in the Phillipines. He wires 100,000 to her for the deal, meets with the members, but is unaware that they want to a commit a mass shooting, so they come in, blow his brains out, then start shooting away and slip out after shooting the security guard and go back to their hotel rooms.

       Maybe the buyers asked him to then backed out when they knew secret service snipers were going to be everywhere at lolla, or they were testing to see if paddock was trying to set them up, or maybe to set up paddock more. I'm absolutely not into conspiracy theories but this is way too fishy for me, I really don't think this guy did it.

       There intention was not to buy the guns, that's what they lied about this to set up the mass murder - their intention was to get a bunch of guns in a hotel room above a huge concert then open fire, what perfect way than to get a guy to buy them for you.

       So they still dont take free guns? Usually ISIS like to be in the middle of a crowd so they can spout their alloha akbar shit before blowing themselves up, even if it was a fake deal no one leaves tens of thousands of dollars of ammo and guns laying around

       Dude went crazy for some reason, wired money to his gf before he did what he did so it couldnt get siezed/frozen afterwards, realized he had a ton of guns he doesnt ever get to use and figured no better way to go out then to go down in infamy....sometimes people are just fucking crazy

       What proof do we have be booked a room over Lolla? They could just be making this up so it sounds plausible.

       They couldn't even get his fucking Vegas check in dates right... Yet you're going to believe he booked a hotel in Chicago, and never went without any proof what so ever??

       The only evidence would be that hotel employees leaked valet tickets, room service bills, and parking pics already. I tend to think regular people have provided lots of the good info so far-- gun shop workers and bell hops just checking their terminals and releasing info. As for the other part, they already have him booking a room above a different Vegas music fest. Rahm Emmanuel is going to be pretty pissed if the feds taint chicago's premier summer tourist event as secondary cover for no reason.

       All of that evidence proves he was in Vegas. No one is questioning that he was there.

       Lolla aka Chicago, there is no proof he ever booked a room there other than what 'they' say. And 'they' didn't even know the dates he was in Vegas.

       Yeah. I guess anyone can say anything anonymously on here but I did know someone who died there. False flag conspiracies kind of get to me because it’s hard on the people who lost people during them. I don’t think they work either. I live in a small town in the south and they’re never gonna take our guns. Not easily anyways. It was probably a bad idea to even click on this thread. As for my favorite conspiracies, I like more out there stuff like hollow earth, Antarctica stuff, and alien stuff.

       If you do a simple search you can find videos capturing the shots, there’s also a video of the deceased in the aftermath. There’s plenty of evidence so you’re completely wrong on this. Thoughts like this have no merit and it’s disrespectful to the people who got hurt.

       1) idk. I also saw someone say that no one was in their room at 10 pm cause Vegas; however, that contradicts a news report I saw saying that one of the performers infant sons and his nanny were in the room next to the shooter. I don’t have the source readily available, so if anyone does, much appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Boy Scout motto, “always be prepared”. Idk if that’s correct, but there are sources saying he wanted to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I honestly think this is the easiest one. We know he was a regular at these casinos. I don’t know if he was a regular at this particular one, but he often had long hotel stays. I’m sure he put all of his kit in bags and put those on the luggage rack. I don’t think it would rly raise any eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure you can get all of your pistols in one suitcase, probably the ammo too. Idk about the rifles though, I don’t own any. I suppose you’d have to have a big suitcase for those.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don’t think it would be incredibly strange for this guy to come in with 10 bags when he is known to move around so frequently, and stay in these hotels. Do we have any details about his stay there? I guess I can look and update this.

       It seems the police were at his door 16 minutes after the first call came in. The Security guard was at his door 10-12 minutes from the first shots fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the adrenaline, he had tunnel vision. Once he was distracted from shooting out the window by the security guard, he diverted his tunnel vision to the hallway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, if he really was a lone gunman, I think he fired towards the hallway, knew he was caught and ended his life right then and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took the cops 60+ minutes before they breached, but that doesn't mean they weren't breathing down his neck much sooner. I think the timeline from the police communication was that they were clearing the 31st and 32nd floor within 16 minutes of the first call, give or take. That sounds about right for when he stopped firing out the window.

       Did you look at the guy? He looked pretty elderly and decrepit.  Granted I know plenty of people in their 70s and 80s who are amazingly healthy and young looking but this guy didn't look like the picture of health.

       I don't think you can class him as elderly or decrepid. He just seemed your average man in his mid 60's. He was obviously somewhat fit, he was a regular in Vegas, and lived 80 miles from Vegas and was still driving that distance regularly.

       Didn't the smoke alarm go off?  Anyone that has been to an indoor range knows there's a lot of smoke. I think he/they panicked as this wasn't planned for.  No way he shot himself in chest at point blank range and then was able to shoot himself in the head.  Not sure if police pumped one in his chest but that's possible too.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you plan something for as long as he/they did and overlook the smoke alarm going off probably a minute into it, then continue for another 10, you know the heat is coming as the smoke alarms pinpoint the source to hotel command and control.  A smoke alarm siren is a sound that will induce additional stress to an already stressful situation.

       Not even that so much. He had 4 days to get them all up there. Don’t know if you have ever been to Vegas, but I’ve done some convention work at the MB. It’s a busy place. Tons of people all the time. No one would take notice of the same guy carrying luggage at separate times over that time period. He would just blend in.

       To answer your first question, it is Vegas and I don’t know about you but I spend limited time in my room when I’m there. And I know most people are out and about so it’s not that weird to not have that many reports from the people next to him or above him.

       The window is plexi glass, tempered glass would shatter I to small pieces. Look at the picture. Large chunks of window is still intact. We should get a plexi glass expert on what method is used to break window like that. 
Someone said the building went through a 40M renovation to replace all Windows with plexiglass at one point.

       1: Yes, The New York Times literally interviewed the man who had the room beneath him. But since that’s a left leaning source I expect that to not count for this Sub and T_D.

       The rest are valid aside from the stamina..I go to the gym and lift with older guys, 50-60s. Some retired. They can fuckin swing a hammer still. This guy doesn’t look in fantastic shape but he does look to have capable arm muscles to move a hammer.

       can you elaborate more? i believe what youre saying just want to hear more of your experience.
      </p>

       also i saw a video of people on the 42nd ish floor during an event, the shots were almost lost in the music, still very loud but maybe not as loud as lower down, with the buildings echo.

       This would be true, I go to the gun range and have been hunting, even with ear protection it is loud, firing so many rounds in unison would definitely draw attention quickly to where you are located

       A school shooting (for which I give my condolences you experienced) is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       different than a Las Vegas hotel/concert/event shooting. The venue being Las Vegas to begin with brings a lot of things guests expect-- drunken guests (possible crashing bottles/glasses), loud parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties with screaming and laughing. Secondly, as someone mentioned the guests at that time would likely be out of their rooms. Most ppl don't visit Vegas to stay in their rooms. A concert was going on outside. Only natural to assume there'd be fireworks. To the untrained hear (like many of the victims below) gunshots are confused with fireworks. This was, afterall, the end of the festival.
