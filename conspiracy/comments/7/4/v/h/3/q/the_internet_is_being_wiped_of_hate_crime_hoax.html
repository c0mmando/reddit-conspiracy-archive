    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly it.  Its the same strategy used by prison guards to keep control of the prisons.  As long as the prisoners are pitted against each other based on race, they are too busy fighting each other to fight the guards.  That&#39;s the whole purpose behind race-baiting/identity politics on both sides of the corporate aisle.  As long as poor people are busy fighting each other over inconsequential (in the big scheme of things) racial/gender issues, they aren&#39;t fighting against (or paying any attention to) the oligarchs running our debt-slave society.  For example, the very real issue of police violence against blacks isn&#39;t an issue of racism.  It isn&#39;t a race problem at all - its a problem of power.  If police all of a sudden started abusing whites on the same scale that they are abusing blacks, that wouldn&#39;t solve the problem at all, even though race was a non factor.  The issue is that agents of the government have the power to abuse people - of any color - without being held accountable.  That&#39;s the issue that we should really be addressing that ALL people could support.  The oligarchs know this, and fear it.  Its why you saw a large contingent of paid-for &quot;black pundits&quot; start arguing during the 2016 primary that focusing on class issues were &quot;racist&quot;.  The truth is that when class, power, and wealth disparity issues are solved the issue of racism goes away because power isn&#39;t concentrated and wielding by the powerful few.</p>

<p>There is a huge list somewhere out there of tons of these, but here is a list of the ones I found interesting and which had a decent news article to go with it. Oftentimes these are reported in the national media and the article is then later corrected, which means there are more people who see the initial allegation than the correction, which makes it seem like there are a lot more hate crimes than there really are. </p>

<p>&quot;Five tombstones damaged in historic Jewish cemetery in New York&quot; (Archived initial allegation)</p>

<p>CNN updated the article to say &quot;Authorities have determined that tombstones disturbed at a historic Jewish cemetery in New York this weekend were damaged by environmental causes and not by vandalism.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/05/us/brooklyn-jewish-cemetery-tombstones-overturned/">http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/05/us/brooklyn-jewish-cemetery-tombstones-overturned/</a></p>

<p>A 19-year-old Israeli Jewish man (not Trump supporters and nazis as initially thought) has been arrested in Israel on suspicion of making multiple bomb threats to Jewish organisations and an airline in the US and elsewhere. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/israeli-police-arrest-man-over-bomb-threats-to-us-jewish-targets">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/israeli-police-arrest-man-over-bomb-threats-to-us-jewish-targets</a></p>

<p>The other person arrested over making threats to Jewish community centers was Juan Thompson, a Black anti-Trump leftist who worked for The Intercept until he was fired for fabricating sources in his anti-Trump articles. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/03/statement-on-the-arrest-of-former-intercept-reporter-juan-thompson/">https://theintercept.com/2017/03/03/statement-on-the-arrest-of-former-intercept-reporter-juan-thompson/</a></p>

<p>An openly bisexual Chicago student who claimed she received anti-gay, pro-Donald Trump notes and emails after the election is found to have fabricated the entire story, North Park University said. Taylor Volk told a local NBC News affiliate that she found one of the notes taped to her door at her off-campus residence, which read “Back to hell” and “#Trump” along with homophobic slurs. “This is a countrywide epidemic all of a sudden,” she said on Nov. 14. “I just want them to stop.” <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/25/taylor-volk-north-park-university-student-fabricat/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/25/taylor-volk-north-park-university-student-fabricat/</a>  </p>

<p>Strong accusations were made by a Bowling Green State University student the day after election day. Eleesha Long said she was assaulted and called a racial slur, but BG police said she made the story up. Long wrote a police complaint on November 9th that reads in part, &quot;while walking down Crim St to ask for yard signs, three boys began to throw rocks at me.&quot; Long continued to write the white males shouted profanity at her while wearing Trump shirts. She described how all three young men looked and what they were wearing. <a href="http://www.13abc.com/content/news/BG-police-say-student-lied-about-politically-driven-attack-401814426.html">http://www.13abc.com/content/news/BG-police-say-student-lied-about-politically-driven-attack-401814426.html</a></p>

<p>In the latest case of a faked hate crime, a 20-year-old man has admitted he made it up when he told Malden cops he was harassed by two men proclaiming it’s “Trump country now.” The man, whose name police have not released, had filed a complaint saying when he got off an MBTA bus near Broadway Square in Malden at 10 p.m. Tuesday, at least two white men approached him.  <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2016/11/man_admits_to_faking_hate_crime_in_malden">http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2016/11/man_admits_to_faking_hate_crime_in_malden</a></p>

<p>A Colorado Springs man was arrested after police believe he left racist messages outside a church. Vincent Broughton, 44, who is black, is facing charges for committed a bias-motivated crime and disorderly conduct. The signs were posted outside the New Covenant church that is predominately attended by African Americans. One sign references the KKK.

<p>Woman admits tweeting fake threats to fellow black students. According to prosecutors, the 25-year-old McKelvey tweeted threats from a campus library because she wanted more people to attend the November 17, 2015, rally on racial issues. She then returned to the rally to tell people about the threats. One tweet addressed to campus police read: &quot;@kupolice I will kill all the blacks tonight, tomorrow and any other day if they go to Kean University.&quot; <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-admits-tweeting-fake-threats-fellow-black-students-204320195.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-admits-tweeting-fake-threats-fellow-black-students-204320195.html</a></p>

<p>Over the summer, 19-year-old Jesus Cabrera told police he was verbally harassed by three white men, authorities said.

<p>Openly-gay Pastor admits he lied about a Whole Foods incident that caused a public outcry, claiming that a cake he bought at Whole Foods was decorated with a homophobic slur.  The company also released a statement saying that it reviewed security footage and determined that Brown had tampered with the cake.  He later said &quot;The company did nothing wrong. I was wrong to pursue this matter and use the media to perpetuate this story.  I want to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning the company&#39;s commitment to its values, and especially the bakery associate who I understand was put in a terrible position because of my actions.&quot; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pastor-drops-lawsuit-against-whole-foods-2016-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/pastor-drops-lawsuit-against-whole-foods-2016-5</a></p>

<p>Halley Bass was sitting in a woman&#39;s lit class at the University of Michigan when she cut her face with a safety-pin.</p>

<p>“I had been in a discussion in my women’s lit weirdly, and there were a few people in my class that sort of said some things that scared me,” Bass said. “It was more like I wanted a concrete reason to be scared then [sic] to just talk I guess.”</p>
