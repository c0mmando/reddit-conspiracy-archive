       If the media won't tell us the truth then we have to dig through some information ourselves, as we have been doing. I think personal accounts of the event from people who were actually there really helps build a more clear picture of what happened that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I do admit maybe some of these people were scared and were maybe confused from the concert shooting but there definitely seems more to it as the inconsistencies continue to add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below is my compilation of a multiple shooter theory reports from across social media. Please contribute yours if you have any. I've decided to censor the people's names for privacy reasons.

       I'm not even sure what is the best one.  Just that one should be made that is credible and genuine for legitimate investigation and documentation.  The reddit platform could provide that if no where else.  Similar to the Boston Bombing subreddit and Pizzagate subredit, but we know what happened to those, so its a difficult task, but worthwhile.

       I agree it should be discussed on reddit, but something about false flag in the name turns me off. This is coming from someone who believes Boston, San Bernardino, and Aurora were ff. People should use the sub you linked instead of lvff

       The multiple shooter theory is being promulgated by the event's own

        crisis actors

       and is increasingly obviously a facet of this psy-op to confuse and distract from the fact that there's no reason anyone should be convinced that real shots were even fired at anything, let alone anyone.

       I can take that as a theory. But first let's get all of the reports and then we will be able to make a better educated conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if we have only a few reports of such then your theory could actually hold some serious weight. However if we discover that more than half of the people that were there are reporting the same thing then we might be on to something. Nothing is stopping us from looking into this with an open mind yet skeptical mind.

       Exactly, so before speculating about how many shooters and who they were, it must first be established that shots were really fired, and should be incredibly easy to do were this a real shooting.

       So you can't prove shots were fired, or that there are dead people, but you know that there were shots fired because there were dead people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah there's something missing: realism. What we have are early reports of the shooting, ads for crisis actors, people in the crowd saying there are fake gunshots, confirmed crisis acting, and the complete and total absence of
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to demonstrate that anything was shot, at all.

       Exactly, you don't want to provide any proof, you just want me to shut up. What a joke. We're talking about one of the bloodiest and probably most well-photographed massacre of modern American history and you can't even show anything being shot.

       Because I don't have to prove that something didn't happen when there's no reason to think it did. That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. The burden of proof is on the original claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for the record, there are crisis actors and videos of people in the crowd saying the gunshots are fake. As well as Craigslist ads for crisis actors in Vegas leading up to the event.

       no one knows man. That's what this guy is trying to figure out. There's 2 people in this thread so far that say they lost friends and loved ones. Why don't you put it on the record so this question doesn't keep popping up? Like it or not, there are a lot of very skeptical people, so any evidence you have is really helpful.

       Allegedly at 1:33 top left video you can see a blonde girl with her head resting on a mans back have her head snap in a direction, but I can't see if it pierces the whole head. And of course camera jerks away at critical time.

       Yea I am leery of the claim too, but it was a blonde girl laying her head on a guys back who is wearing a cowboy hat. I don't think she had braids. It was near the bottom left of the video.

If you want to deny every fucking piece of evidence then fly out here yourself and ask every person you see if they know somebody that was affected. Because they will. I promise you that.

       come one man, this is the internet, not everyone is going to dance around everyone's feelings. But it's worthwhile leaving all possibilities on the table and looking for evidence. At the moment, hoax still fits the evidence pretty well.

       And yes, faking something is infinitely safer and easier than actually entangling oneself in wanton mass murder, with so many unpredictable factors and hidden dangers, and which would launch an actual murder investigation.

      <p>
       Oh by the way, if people were actually being shot at this event there would be about 39 things you could show to someone who doubted it that would strongly demonstrate real gunshot wounds and bullet damage.

       Please tell me this is a troll. So you are going to tell the family and friends of the dead and injured that they aren't real? Or they were just actors? WTF man, is everything a false flag? Is every bad thing that happens all crisis actors? Do you really think that there isn't some fucked up people out there that just do bad things? Everything has to be the evil government?

       Define proof. Set a strict bar. Clearly hundreds of witnesses, police and emergency personnel testimony and audio / video footage supporting the idea of a second shooter is too much for you to process, so what would make it easy and believable?

       Audio does sound like sounds of "gunfire" coming from different directions. But we still don't know that they were not blanks or mere sounds from a sound system. No evidence that bullets struck anything or anyone.

       I'm open to believing shots were fired, at any time or place, and I do agree that in one of the videos the "gunfire" seems to be coming from at least two different locations, but in my opinion there is not nearly the visual evidence that any shots were fired and hit anything that there would be in abundance if any real shooting actually occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason, and because there is obviously crisis acting and fakery going on, I'm inclined to believe it was all a drill or hoax type scenario but would be open to considering any evidence anyone wants to offer of real shooting taking place. Again, if it were a real shooting on this scale, by now there would be a truckload of things to show someone who doubted this that would prove it beyond reasonable doubt.

       So all the area hospitals are in on this? Multiples hospitals being maxed out by an influx of hundreds of wounded. All the doctors , nurses, aides etc (thousands) are treating fake wounds, fake surgery, fake medical records, admitting perfectly fine patients. Can you imagine daily rounding and assessments within the hospital on these fake injured? All the charting? All the lab draws? Wound dressings? All the cat scans, x-ray, MRIs. All fake? Imagine calling local funeral homes to pick up up all the deceased at the hospital only to find what?

       I don't know what type of evidence you are looking for. Hospitals value patient privacy. Heard of HIPAA? Can you imagine a hospital calling in extra staff to handle the anticipated influx of patients only to find an empty ER ? All the first responders, EMTs, paramedics, sitting idle with empty ambulances. You don't think any of the thousands of people involved would be like wtf? Where are all the injured? Thousands of people donating blood. Are they just tossing it in the trash?

       your two "gotcha" videos are a video of people dancing and a quiet ER. I'm not following. The quiet ER video has no context. Traumas are not brought through the ER waiting room anyway. Staff are not going to video or take pictures as that = being fired and loss of license and likely lawsuits. I've seen a few pics of bloody ERs though and lots of chatter on nursing message boards of first hand accounts by mature accounts. Here's a video I found real quick

       I feel like those posts all seemed weird, similar in some way or another. I'm no expert and I'm not going to speculate why, but it's either people wanting attention or other specific reason. I do not think there were any shots fired at Caesars.

       I'm with you. Obviously something happened. And most of the crowd probably believed they were being shot at. But as near as I can tell there's no evidence of an injury or bullet being sustained during the alleged shooting.

       what really happens when somebody fires a big nasty machine gun at you and people near you, lots of smoke and noise and creaming and screams and moaning, blood and guts and sheer panic.

       That's the one, poor guy didn't realise he had a chest wound too. I'm looking but I can't find it (imagine that) but that video laid to rest a lot of things for me. Pretty much made me 180 on the lmg and multiple shooter theory.

       Some of the videos I had seen earlier sounded like "buddy fire" between two lmg weapons. I think that was the infamous one the taxi driver took. The only thing that gave me doubt was the fact I know nothing about how acoustics and echoes work on th LV strip... basically a giant concert hallway. That video was taken from the taxi line at Mandalay so it was a little sketch on audio... The body cam was 10 minutes uninterrupted video outside of the event and thus In a more open air setting... In that video it definitely sounds like a bump stock ar15 with intervals for reloading.

       With that said there is still a lot of questions surrounding this one. Mainly motive and logistics.

       I don't think he's converted in the sense of being a true believer or anything, probably just an anti-govt sympathizer.  If he's dealing with gun running, he's likely seen the U.S. Govt at its worst.  We've been a leader in arms dealing forever.  From Oliver North to Fast and Furious.

       People have psychotic breaks, it happens to people of all ages for all sorts of reasons. I know a guy who lost his mind after his cat died at 60, he was super accomplished, had just been promoted, was nationally recognized, a fucking genius academic who was recognized as leader in his field internationally, but he destroyed his life, career, and marraige in a matter of months, started acting sociopathic and threatening people, got arrested multiple times and  has pushed every person who ever cared for him away forever, all becuase his fucking cat died. It's absurd for you to rule out serious mental illness in this situation like it's impossible. Like with most of these shooter conspiracies people are trying to find  some kind of logical plan, some kind of rational motive, some kind of reason why this happened,  instead of facing just how scary and chaotic the world actually is and that  these things can just happen out of nowhere when someone starts getting the wrong thoughts stirring around in their head.

       Him meeting with some ISIS buy team is such a ridiculous claim though. I study the SCW and MENA as a hobby and they certainly don't need to buy American weapons from arms dealers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what position you take on the subject of the war, the American supported players in ME get their weapons and training hand delivered and simply looking over a SCW/MENA small arms Twitter account shows how thriving the weapons market is over there. They have all the weapons they need, they don't need to clandestinely buy them from some white dude in a hotel (probably the worst place to a covert Arms deal)

       Okay, that makes sense! The problem is ISIS isn't capitalizing on that - they're claiming he was their operative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how their PR works and it would be a lot better if they claimed that their fighters had killed (and subsequently exposed) an FBI agent attempting to work with a Terrorist org and had then carried out their mission from that point forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of a single terrorist organization that wouldn't expose the FBI/abc in that instance and refuse to take credit for the 'bigger picture'. The biggest determining factor of a terrorist organization is their publicity and this is relatively marginalized.

       I see what people are thinking when they hear that, so I understand why people feel so strongly that's what they hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive heard this happen a few times though personally. What I think your hearing is rounds breaking the sound barrier. At first you hear the gun itself. Gunpowder in the chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like a completely different gun because I believe he was strafing. Shooting at a different group, and then started firing in proximity of the camera. When the rounds are actually close the bang you hear usually isnt the actual gun, but the snap of  the rounds breaking the sound barrier. Sometimes you hear both. Usually the deeper sound of the gun, followed by the snap.

       How about a timeline that dates back to the first known mention of paddock and/or his movements in LV and Mandalay Bay Hotel? If we agree on a timeline, and we can discuss how each event fits together. Days with more activity (e.g. the day of the shooting will obviously have a lot of activity).
      </p>
      <p>
       We can discuss what we can agree on / disagree on as will fill in the blanks. For instance, there's gonna be a lot of disagreement about no. of shooters (or whether there was a shooting at all). We are therefore going to need to have mutliple possible scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what is the current, first mention of Paddock that anyone knows of?

       I just can't logically follow a multiple shooters theory. For the beginning, just look at the casualties and how they all occurred in the  concert venue. The numbers would be massively inflated if there was more than one guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, if it was some Org, it's easier to fear that than a single, lone wolf, crazed (although I don't think he was mentally ill) shooter. If this was some organized movement, attempting to actively disrupt the peace, it's easier to tell people that and have them fear the next attack. Additionally, it's easier to legislate that as well (ban guns from Muslim immigrants, monitor communications country wide for extremism) etc. One lone wold guy is exactly that, nothing to fear, no agenda to push with.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this day and age, there would be so much footage of the other shoots, and there's none. Just people reacting to what's going on outside and hoaxes/accidental misinfo. No one has footage of anyone injured in another hotel, or images of a shooter in the other hotels, but they sure have video of people running around and screaming, which makes sense.

       nah man, our super competent government set a scene with 5 or more shooters and managed to clean up all their blood without having to set up a crime scene where those 5 shooters were and get their bodies out of there with no one around them witnessing it and taking pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, I know our government is fucked up and does fucked up shit - but its 2017 and there's cameras and video on everyone's phone yet not a single picture or video of any of these extra shooters? c'mon guys get real. and every video that is evidence is just people running, BECAUSE THEY HEARD THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER ON THE STRIP

       This is my biggest gripe with NWO organizations. If you've ever been a part of, or seen first hand, how hard it is to run any organization with a board. Humans are retarded. I don't think I've ever seen a town hall meeting or a local project go smoothly, mostly because of the incompetency of the local representatives.

       To think that a select group of people are doing this on some massive, global scale and the only reason people are on to them is because there was an eyeball with a pyramid in an episode of Spongebob is comical.

       What if this was a robbery? The Mandalay was the diversion, while other hotels got hit.

       first hand accounts are super bad.  tons of ppl hearing echos thinking its a 2nd shooter.  tons of people who know nothing about guns all of a sudden are world class experts.  initial media reports, esp based on witness testimony, will be incorrect.

       This entire fucking thing is fucked. How is it that there's little info released, yet a ton of eyewitnesses talking about what they saw that are being censored in a coordinated effort to suppress info?

       Can I pls see a picture of a bullet embedded into 'something'? or a bullet hole? surely all the tents, speakers, railings and equipment bore the brunt of those cracking shots? CNN would normally have that 'glory shot' of a hole inside a speaker or something... but alas - I am unable to locate any such evidence of any bullet holes? #nocasingsnotruth

       I agree it should be discussed on reddit, but something about false flag in the name turns me off. This is coming from someone who believes Boston, San Bernardino, and Aurora were ff. People should use the sub you linked instead of lvff

       I don't know what type of evidence you are looking for. Hospitals value patient privacy. Heard of HIPAA? Can you imagine a hospital calling in extra staff to handle the anticipated influx of patients only to find an empty ER ? All the first responders, EMTs, paramedics, sitting idle with empty ambulances. You don't think any of the thousands of people involved would be like wtf? Where are all the injured? Thousands of people donating blood. Are they just tossing it in the trash?

       Well eye witnesses were also saying that there were more wounded and dead than being reported, people saying they knew people who'd died whose names weren't even on the list of the people who died.

       nah man, our super competent government set a scene with 5 or more shooters and managed to clean up all their blood without having to set up a crime scene where those 5 shooters were and get their bodies out of there with no one around them witnessing it and taking pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, I know our government is fucked up and does fucked up shit - but its 2017 and there's cameras and video on everyone's phone yet not a single picture or video of any of these extra shooters? c'mon guys get real. and every video that is evidence is just people running, BECAUSE THEY HEARD THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER ON THE STRIP
