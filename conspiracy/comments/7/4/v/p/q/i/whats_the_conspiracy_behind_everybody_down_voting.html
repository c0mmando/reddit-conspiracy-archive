    <div class="md"><p>Because there&#39;s a difference between faggotry and homosexuality. The reason people think gays are so depraved is because the media gives them the attention. There&#39;s plenty of normal gay people who are just as boring as the rest of you. If you have a problem with normal boring gay guys such as myself that&#39;s really too bad, because I didn&#39;t choose to be homosexual. Sure the act of having sex with another man is a choice but I can&#39;t help the fact that women turn me off and men turn me on. My brain is hardwired that way. The same way where someone&#39;s DNA is hardwired to determine their skin color. </p>

<p>Now if you have a problem with depravity then that&#39;s not really a bad opinion to hold. In this generation, modesty is a diamond in the rough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, because a person who believes in God wouldn&#39;t refer to themselves as being religious, because being religious is totally different from having a relationship with God.</p>

<p>But anywho, you&#39;re entitled to live the lifestyle that you want, so I can&#39;t force you to do anything.</p>

<p>As far as fixing homosexuality, just don&#39;t do it, try to establish a relationship with a woman, try to enjoy the beauty of women and appreciating how women are different.</p>

<p>But the only true way to fix homosexuality is through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please ask.  Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried having relationships with women, very good looking women I might add. But I simply don&#39;t enjoy a woman&#39;s company, physically or psychologically on the same level as I do with men. I just don&#39;t relate to women in anyway. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand your comment about being religious being different than having a relationship with God. But I assume, given your username, that you are a Christian. I&#39;m an Odinist so we have different Gods and beliefs on many different levels but they do share alot as well. The 9 Noble Virtues are quite similar to the 10 Commandments for example.</p>

<p>I have a deep connection with the Gods I believe in. I think saying that I have a relationship with my gods is no different than saying I&#39;m religious, but maybe that&#39;s different for Christians. </p>

<p>Anyways thanks for your respectful response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have dumb, backwards views on homosexuality. You&#39;re the worst kind of religious nut: the type that uses their faith to preach and spread hatred of others because you&#39;re absolutely positive that your version of the magical man who created everything HATES these people he created.</p>

<p>A lot of people on reddit are going to disagree with your dumb, backwards views. Maybe it&#39;s time to seek out a gay-bashing internet forum where your dumb, backwards views will be reinforced instead of solidly rejected. That&#39;s really all there is to it. </p>

<p>The establishment is ecstatic with your behavior, they want the conservatives hating gays and spreading word that it&#39;s a &quot;mental disorder&quot; the same way they want liberals hating white men and calling everyone Nazis. Take a bow you useful idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple, it is not hateful to just be against homosexuality.  You don&#39;t have to fundamentally agree with anyone. However understanding is synonymous with love. the opposite of understanding and love is hate. Hate is literally just the negative emotion a human feels when they lack understanding. So disagreeing with people is not hate. Telling people they can&#39;t be gay because someone&#39;s &quot;god&quot; says so, is naive and shows a lack of understanding. So it is on the playing field with all other hateful thoughts. Just on the lower side of the spectrum. Also someone should not be censored in any way unless they are doing more than voicing their opinion. It&#39;s a free country.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not moving the goalposts, it&#39;s simply reexamining the source of your argument. It comes across as incredibly hypocritical to ignore certain things the Old Testament prohibits (sausage with peppers sure is fucking tasty, isn&#39;t it?) while demanding other things the Old Testament prohibits be enforced. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t amend the Old Testament like the Constitution to say God approves of pork chops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Taboo topic is that abuse has played a major role in a lot of LGBT&#39;s sexual preference choices...  All of them? No. Every single one I have met who was questioning or identified as LGBT? Yes. (Again though, it is not all of them... there are different types) </p>

<p>Unfortunately their issues get swept under the rug a lot because it does not help in advocacy...   Personally have seen a lot of abandonment/abuse issues with parents being manifested in this way even those in my own extended family. (And fwiw, those whom I have talked to agree with these causational factors for their personal situations... )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really downvote, but here is my thoughts on homosexuality.</p>

<p>I think it is normal for a certain percentage of our population to be attracted to the same sex. I have lived in a flat with gay dudes and spent plenty of time hanging out with them and their friends. I don&#39;t think any of them had any &#39;mental&#39; issue, they simply liked men. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why people have this obsession with homosexuality, that it is unnatural etc when quite clearly from our history of humanity since <em>forever</em>, homosexuality has been apart of that. It is only from religion that hatred or &#39;disgust&#39; or whatever you want to call it came to be placed against homosexuals. Most cultures accepted it as completely normal before Western/Christian culture came and rose to power.</p>

My agenda to expose the satanic organizations promoting the homosexual agenda, because according to my beliefs, God wouldn&#39;t promote homosexuality, because God is against it, therefore it&#39;s satan who&#39;s behind the homosexual acceptance conspiracy.</p>

<p>Your agenda for allowing homosexuality is probably that you want everybody to be happy, but according to my worldview, there&#39;s something more sinister behind the homosexual agenda, while you believe homosexuality is innocent.  </p>
