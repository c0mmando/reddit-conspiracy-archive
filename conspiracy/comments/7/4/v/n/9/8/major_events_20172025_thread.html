       I made a few predictions a week ago on r/predictions based on current media trends and theories floating around to create a timeline for the next 7 years. This post is to build on those predictions and hopefully get some insight and amendments from the good people of this sub to generate a more accurate picture of the immediate future.

       Elon stays out of the governmental spotlight but is one of very few billionaires today that is widely adored enough to be backed across the board. In order for Musk to be a candidate reforms would have needed to have been made to the presidency to allow non-native Americans to run. Not a stretch with the current contempt for the system.

          A new religion unites all, but is satanic. It will assert that we are descended from God's and rationalise terrible things. Potentially Luciferianism. People will buy into it because it will seemingly come from an ancient civilisation found under the ice in Antarctica. The civilisation was of the Annunaki and will bring a new perspective on the Bible, Quran and Torah as well as explaining human history much clearer (explains pyramids, Baalbek etc). The Nazi symbol originates from this civilisation. Sacrifices will become normal and death penalty will be seen as the preferred option. 2019&gt;.

       The aim of this thread isn't to breed fear, it's to nurture critical thought. At this point it's almost certain something is up with the world. If you think I'm wrong on any of these points I challenge you to search for yourself and bring new theories and evidence to the table. After all why else would you be on a conspiracy sub?

       I just don't like that you hardly put any positive predictions in there. IMHO this kind of thinking plays into the hands of the so-called elites by keeping us in a fearful state.

      <p>
       For example, what about "Tesla's (or someone else's) free energy tech gets disclosed"? It wouldn't be that far off.

       I tried to keep emotion out of it but I must admit the forecast for the next 7 years, as I see it, is going to be largely traumatic. We don't emphasize Hitler on what he did to improve the German economy for example. That said I leave the predictions at 2025 for a reason. That is around the time I think the next real revolution of culture will take place with the eventual toppling of the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't put any links against the point about quality of life vastly improving because that's a little harder to evidence until it happens but my thoughts there are that as part of this we will see huge technological leaps in medicine/life extension, travel, energy production etc that will outlast the NWO.

       Add to this that it's typical for the military (especially the American military) to be decades ahead in terms of technology, if there is a war I believe the following years we will see a domination of automation and AI in manufacturing to the point where most people would not have to work in the classical sense, giving people more time to indulge in hobbies and interests.

       Keep in mind though that this is not all sunshine and rainbows. We will effectively enter a technocracy thanks to a greater distribution of AI and brain augmentations (neuralink). The NWO will rule with an iron fist and anyone that does not obey the rules or narrative will be severely punished or executed. Speaking about conspiracies for instance would be a huge no-no.

       This documentary is ridiculously creepy. Massive eugenics vibe. I'm thinking that perhaps the reason why 2025 is an important date is because it's the start of a new world religion not the end of one.

       We're just going to sit here and let this happen?
When people are being forced into the buses to be driven to fema camps, they'll just allow that to happen?
Will people rationalize this in their minds by saying that ultimately it's "god's" will?
The best thing we could do this century is to kill off the "elite" and oligarchs then abolish religion.

       There are peaceful ways of bringing about change, it's just harder. The best thing you can do today is to share information to as many as possible. The more people that are searching for corruption in the system, the less places corruption can hide.
