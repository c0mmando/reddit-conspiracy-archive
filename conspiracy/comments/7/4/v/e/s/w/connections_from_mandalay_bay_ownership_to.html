        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The CEO of MGM Resorts (James Murren) once bailed the company out of financial ruin, in part with a $3.8billion dollar investment at the height of the 2009 recession.</p>

<p>In 2008-09, Murren led an extensive reorganization of the company, resulting in over $500 million of annual savings; this, together with a $3.8 billion financing effort, kept the company from failure during the early days of the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009.</p>

<p>During Murren&#39;s tenure, MGM joined with Dubai World in the development of the Las Vegas Strip&#39;s CityCenter. When CityCenter opened in December 2009</p>

<p>Dubai World is an investment firm in Dubai that owns a subsidiary called Dubai Ports World</p>

<p>The Dubai Ports World controversy began in February 2006 and rose to prominence as a .... &quot;Intelligence and security officials opposed to the deal with Dubai Ports World said ports are vulnerable to the entry of terrorists or illicit weapons ...</p>

<p>The controversy pertained to management contracts of six major United States ports. The purchaser was DP World (DPW), a state-owned company in the UAE. The contracts had already been foreign-owned, by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O), a British firm taken over by DPW (completed in March 2006). Although the sale was approved by the executive branch of the United States Government, various United States political figures argued that the takeover would compromise U.S. port security.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Was Paddock laundering some gun runner&#39;s money through the casinos in the safe confines of the Mandalay Bay and other MGM resorts? Did he skim and get caught and forced into doing something? Did someone get to him and coerce him? Where is he on all these cruises and trips to the Middle East and SE Asia?</p>

<p>Who is the woman in the drunken facebook picture? She&#39;s mostly blurred out, but when you see her, she could easily pass as a young Marilou. Was she using Marilou&#39;s cards for access?</p>

<p>Also, was this woman, or some other person with Paddock in his room leading up to the shooting (see the Room Service receipt for 2). Did this person need to charge their phone so that his cameras inside the room could be monitored from down the hall on the other phone and recorded or broadcasted back as proof?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he was setting up a deal to sell these guns and thousands of rounds to a contact ultimately tied to ISIS.  I think the hotel is providing a safe place to do business, and the FBI is tacitly monitoring the deals.  Which is why they are so terrified of the leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also could be affiliated with a govt agency to trace the weapons ala fast n furious, ISIS knew it and wanted to fuck over them back so used he weapons to commit mass murder which actually makes sense for them and not paddock. Whatever agency realizes they completely fucked up and thus the cover up.</p>
