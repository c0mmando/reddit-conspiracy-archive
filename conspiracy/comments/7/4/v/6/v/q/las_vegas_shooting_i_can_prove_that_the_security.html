       Since hardly anyone is paying attention and is just rambling away I'm simply going to continue on the same path as I have gone on all along. And I will definitively prove that also the security guard story, our alleged hero Jesus Campos, is FALSE. This too is super easy to do and I know that many of you out there are going to hate me for it because it will shatter your bubbles.

       Campos was added afterwards to help justify the death of the patsy.

       The muzzle "flashes" weren't visible from outside because he wasn't sticking the rifle through the broken window. He wasn't even close to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was firing from his improvised, elevated platform that he made from the two chairs he pushed together. This was at least 5 feet away from the window, so the flashes would've been completely contained within the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chair platform is seen in the photos. It looks a little like a bathtub, in the middle of the room.

       Would you want to lean out a jagged broken window on the 30+ floor while firing? It was either planned or just second nature, but either way it helped to further conceal the location of the shooter.

       Also most of his rifles likely included a default flash hider, which is designed to send most of the flash and gas upward. From that elevated position, it would conceal the shots even more. The flash hider's primary intent is to not kick up dirt while the operator is laying prone on the ground.

       Compensators or breaks really are designed to reduce muzzle rise. A hider/suppressor is normally the milspec default:

       All it does is reduce the flash. You will still see it in a dark window at night. Some of us have been shot at plenty and know this.

       Read the context if what I was replying to. I'm not saying it is dangerous or should be banned, I'm just saying it would reduce the damn flash 10%. That, combined with the shooter standing back within the window frame, and other brighter strobes on the building and reflections, would all further conceal the shooter.

       I have serious doubts that he would have been able to breathe if he fired over 1000 rounds well inside of the room. The smoke would have been unbearable after a couple mags.

       I'd think it'd be even more obvious, since he appeared to have been shooting from a dark room. Wouldn't the entire room light up with each round if the muzzle were entirely within a dark room?

       It's strange that this post is about disproving the security gaurd story yet every post here(so far) is about muzzle flashes from the previous article on that blog?
      </p>

       I mean.. misdirection much? No one wants to talk about what is quite obviously a HUGE hole in this story, of which is outlined really clearly in this blog?

       Personally I find this to be a pretty solid lump of evidence to go along with a whole lot of other stuff.

       They are both looking for the highest paid "exclusive" interview. Campos is represented by his Union, and they surely see the PR value in his story. I'm sure negotiations have been happening for days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look for a highly publicized "exclusive" from one of the big name shows...60 Minutes, Dateline, etc.

       No problem. It's just interesting how you don't see any of these photos in any of the news though. Yet he was interviewed by NBC News.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's even more ridiculous is after he was shot in the leg, he was able to still help clear out rooms.

        Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardi said: "His bravery was amazing. He gave our officers the key guard for the room and then continued clearing rooms until he was ordered to go seek attention."

       Yeah. 200 rounds. In a 6 foot wide hall. That he had video coverage of and could see exactly where he was. And only hit him once in the leg.

       Is there mention of the security guard on the scanner? I saw somewhere that he stayed until police demanded he get help. If there was an injured security guard they would say on the scanner that they had a gunshot wound and request medical assistance.

       I just keep wondering why people are buying this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The morning after the shooting CNN had LVPD interviewing. The reporter asked them to clarify how they stopped Paddock and said there were 2 stories floating around. The LVPD confirmed that police were at the room, but they weren't sure if he shot himself before they got in or if it was after. HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW!?!?!?

       Also--- No unarmed security guard was mentioned whatsoever.

       You're missing the latest version of the story, which the undersheriff shared last night:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         An open door a few rooms away from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard
        </strong>
        , Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorities believe that the guard drew the attention of mass murderer Stephen Paddock away from the chaos below and toward the hallway outside his room.
       </p>
       <p>
        The guard, Jesus Campos, was shot in the leg while checking on the alarm and according to a police-reported timeline, Paddock never fired on the crowd below again.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The alarm from a room "a number of doors down" from Paddock's likely was a coincidence
        </strong>
        , McMahill told CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."
        <strong>
         The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn't have the keys to that room
        </strong>
        . McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn't shut completely.
       </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, in one of Monday's press conferences, when asked about the smoke alarm, Sheriff Lombardo said he didn't know anything about that and it's not how they located the room.
