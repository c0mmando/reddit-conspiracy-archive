And I will definitively prove that also the security guard story, our alleged hero Jesus Campos, is FALSE. This too is super easy to do and I know that many of you out there are going to hate me for it because it will shatter your bubbles.</p>

<p>Campos was added afterwards to help justify the death of the patsy.</p>

<p>He was firing from his improvised, elevated platform that he made from the two chairs he pushed together. This was at least 5 feet away from the window, so the flashes would&#39;ve been completely contained within the room.</p>

<p>The chair platform is seen in the photos. It looks a little like a bathtub, in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>I mean.. misdirection much? No one wants to talk about what is quite obviously a HUGE hole in this story, of which is outlined really clearly in this blog?</p>

<p>Personally I find this to be a pretty solid lump of evidence to go along with a whole lot of other stuff. </p>

<p>They are both looking for the highest paid &quot;exclusive&quot; interview. Campos is represented by his Union, and they surely see the PR value in his story. I&#39;m sure negotiations have been happening for days.</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus Campos, a security guard at the property, was sent to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay to investigate a door alarm, or open door on the floor. When he arrived he was shot in the leg by the suspect. Campos turned around and notified dispatch.&quot; <a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/36541991/undersheriff-calls-mandalay-bay-security-guard-a-true-hero">link</a>  </p>

<p>&quot;The alarm from a room “a number of doors down” from Paddock’s likely was a coincidence, McMahill told CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.” &quot; <a href="http://fox13now.com/2017/10/06/las-vegas-police-security-responded-to-door-alarm-drew-fire-from-killer/">link</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there mention of the security guard on the scanner? I saw somewhere that he stayed until police demanded he get help. If there was an injured security guard they would say on the scanner that they had a gunshot wound and request medical assistance. </p>

<p>Holy shit. The thought of you jacking off in a mirror after hitting submit is hilarious though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just keep wondering why people are buying this story.</p>

<p>The morning after the shooting CNN had LVPD interviewing. The reporter asked them to clarify how they stopped Paddock and said there were 2 stories floating around. The LVPD confirmed that police were at the room, but they weren&#39;t sure if he shot himself before they got in or if it was after. HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW!?!?!?</p>

<p>Also--- No unarmed security guard was mentioned whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the latest version of the story, which the undersheriff shared last night:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>An open door a few rooms away from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard</strong>, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.</p>

<p>Authorities believe that the guard drew the attention of mass murderer Stephen Paddock away from the chaos below and toward the hallway outside his room.</p>

<p>The guard, Jesus Campos, was shot in the leg while checking on the alarm and according to a police-reported timeline, Paddock never fired on the crowd below again.</p>

<p><strong>The alarm from a room &quot;a number of doors down&quot; from Paddock&#39;s likely was a coincidence</strong>, McMahill told CNN&#39;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.&quot; <strong>The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn&#39;t have the keys to that room</strong>. McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn&#39;t shut completely.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Also, in one of Monday&#39;s press conferences, when asked about the smoke alarm, Sheriff Lombardo said he didn&#39;t know anything about that and it&#39;s not how they located the room. </p>

<p>There is literally a completely new story every day. </p>
