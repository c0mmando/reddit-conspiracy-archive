        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>is it possible that this was carried out by two or more individuals who used him as their Fall Guy? and when they saw the police coming on camera, they shot him in the head, and then hid in another room?</p>

<p>Reports are saying that police heard him commit suicide before they entered the room. I have no idea how close they were or if the hotel has their own cameras and they were able to verify he was the only one there, but it seems fishy that he supposedly pulled all this off by himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to have to shooting platforms that far apart (switching back and forth) and from that distance, it doesn&#39;t really give you that much more of an angle on the crowd.  It also seem weird it took the cops an hour to find him, but he off&#39;ed himself well before that.  I&#39;m waiting for more details to come out.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the correct, I heard it took an hour, didn&#39;t realize they knew with in 10 minutes.  Regardless, he was never confronted and took himself out relatively shortly after shooting.  Seems like he would have wanted to keep going if he was so armed.  But who knows, if he was as fucked up to do this, than god only knows what was going on in that head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the smoke alarms signaled them right to his room. And I agree you&#39;d think with all those guns and everything why stop so soon. But you&#39;re right if he was that crazy maybe some kind of regret came over him and ended it early. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all speculation at this point, hence why I&#39;m waiting for more details.  In fact, I just heard about the security guard that was shot through the door.  I&#39;m not curious as to when that happened in relation to the start of the shooting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just discussing this very idea with somebody. Leaves nobody to talk and a highly convenient patsy. Only problem is that he doesn’t remotely fit the bill. Between this and the fact the windows were already busted out and the new videos showing muzzle flashes from the 4th or so floor I believe this was a rushed job. Either as a smokescreen or to usher in new gun control measures and police state entrapments as quickly as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory:</p>

<p>&quot;Mr.  Paddock, you&#39;re our prize winner!  Here is a suite at our resort and $5,000 in gaming credits!&quot;</p>

<p>Goes to check out the room, gets met with a silenced pistol.  Deep state goons then go about creating crime scene and carrying out actual attack.  </p>

<p>Police scanner collaborates multiple shooters and a blacked out vehicle making a hasty escape right before attacks commence.  45 minutes prior to attack, young hispanic couple is removed from venue by security, shouting at everyone they were going to be attacked.  Me thinks the young hispanic couple could have been hotel staff whom overheard or saw something fucked up going on prior to attack.</p>

<p>Why?  Motive doesn&#39;t matter when the whole thing is manufactured to begin with.  </p>
