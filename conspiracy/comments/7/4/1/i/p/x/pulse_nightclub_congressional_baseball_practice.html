       'Alt-right' membership. I'm considered alt-right now just because I like facts and evidence and dislike criminals, when I'd always considered myself left leaning. It's ridiculous! All the lefties who thought that believing in fairness and justice and equality and truth meant they were leftists are now thoroughly confused at suddenly being in the same category as people like Antifa and Clinton. It's the old switcheroo, they hope that by getting people to align themselves with an ideology by baiting them with positive ideals and messages, that people will still cling to that 'tribe' even when the tribe suddenly goes mental and becomes all about shutting down free speech and laundering money for pedophile rings.

       Why would a mass shooting indicate a need for more gun control? Are we going to make all guns illegal? Make bump stocks illegal (people will still get them/make them/ figure out another solution)? Ban high capacity magazines (easily obtainable from other countries/black market)? What is the solution? There isn't one unless you ban all guns, and can you imagine what's going to happen if they did that? Massive rebellion and unrest. It would not end well at all

       One mass shooting doesn't indicate a need. But there have been far more than one mass shooting.

       That's a logical. But there are great options for hearing protection, including those hella tight muffs that can enhance your hearing and then silence sounds at the press of a button. It's pretty tough to use earmuffs criminally, unless you're under the jurisdiction of the fashion police.

       We do have an epidemic. 50 or 60 people are killed by gun crime in Chicago every single month. Look at what their gun laws prevented! So many law abiding citizens can't be armed but criminals still are!

       I feel gun laws are easier to scoot around when you can  buy guns in one area and use them in another. This needs to be a 100% thing but that's very doubtful.

       So you're saying that criminals go around the law to break the law? Cause thats what happens when guns are restricted. Gun control will never work.

       I didn't know Australia was America. This country was founded by fighting back against a tyrannical government. The founding fathers wrote the second amendment to make sure we could do it again if the need arises. We will never surrender our guns and I'm glad that we won't. I'll enjoy being a responsible gun owner because that is a right that I was born with. And I plan for my children and their children to be born with that right to.

       Nobody wants to take away your right to own a gun... I said r e s t r i c t e d.  A mentally sound person has the right to feel safe and protect themself. A mentally unstable person should NOT have the right to own a gun. Period. Point blank. No idea why this is so hard to understand. Anyway, you don't have to worry about your guns being taken away. This government thrives on this shit.

       liberals have much more restrictive opinions on gun control than leftists. the further you stray either direction from liberalism, the more you want to protect yourself instead of sit back and let the government "protect" you.

       I have a guy 3 "doors" (read about a half mile) down and he shoots off a cannon now and then. Sometimes that's in the morning. Doesn't make him a bad neighbor, we live in the country and we expect things like that. Stay in your city please, we don't want you here.

       What you're saying is:
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't upset his neighbors, therefore he /does not/ need a suppressor on his cannon. Gunshots coming from a neighbors home are not all that upsetting or annoying and therefore suppressors are not needed in this context.
      </p>

       I don't know if y'all remember the subject of the thread but it's about why we need suppressors.

       No, what I'm saying is that shooting in the morning doesn't make you a bad neighbor like you claimed. Regardless of the topic you replied to, I replied to your reply. You claim it's a bad neighbor who shoots his gun in the morning, I claim that you're a city dweller with no concept of country life if you dare to make such a claim.

       I dunno man, I haven't worn ear protection while shooting since I was in middle school. Granted I never shoot indoors or around things that reflect sounds, but I imagine most experienced shooters would be comfortable firing a suppressed firearm as long as they aren't surrounded by concrete walls.

       You can fire certain calibers without ear pro, especially with subsonic ammo. .45 is subsonic already, but I have fired weapons with suppressors and subsonic ammo and wore no ear pro.

       Even without any knowlege of a suppresor's mechanism of action, it's common knowledge that it makes the sound of the shot less loud. That's an irrefutable and easily measurable result of using a properly made suppressor. Does it make a barely audible "pew" sound like in a video game? Hell naw. But this is real life and I feel like you know that I know that.

       1: A primary purpose of a suppressor is to lower the volume of the report. I don't think that my use of the word "quiet" in this context can easily be construed to mean like a whisper. We're talking about firearms here, I literally used the term "boomstick" and I'm very aware that they aren't quiet.
2: If suppressors are so unsuccessful in quieting the report from a gun, as everyone seems to want to convince me, why tf do we even produce them?

       A silencer makes it a lot harder to pinpoint exactly where said shot came from, which could save his life.

       I once read that because of how a suppresor actually dampens the report it actually makes it less likely to echo. But I'm not a physicist and I also don't know where I read that.

       Isn't the easiest way to solve this problem to just, i'unno, not shoot boomsticks for no reason too close to homes? I mean there's a whole host of reasons why that's a good idea.

       Also I have lived in the country, but not like boondock country. Just boring midwest farmland. The kind of country where you wouldn't hear your neighbor shooting his gun in his backyard unless the wind was right anyway.

       It seems like the article you posted has an issue with the October 2nd date. I'm sure some outlets have incorrectly listed that as the date. That said, there is a bill that went through a House committee just a few weeks ago - September 12th. They're setting up the House vote. It's just a matter of time. To say that it could happen as early as this week isn't the massive stretch you're making it out to be. It's certainly not fake news.

       They work just fine. She's just too stupid to know that "silencers" don't make a gun silent. Not even close. Quieter yes, but far from silent. She probably got most of her gun knowledge from movies.

       23 guns, wtf. Even shtf preppers wouldn't bring 23 guns. 4 rifles and 2 pistols max.  Primary battle rifle and backup, Primary scope weapon/backup, and primary sidearm/backup = 6.

       23 guns make zero sense unless there was more than 1 shooter, or it was initially an arms deal turned false flag.

       Plus, with as much preparation that was put into this, (cameras in hallways, etc) why wouldn't the guy have brought a few 2x4's and bolted the door in a zombie apocalypse fashion, making it difficult for an entry team.

       Automatic guns overheat pretty quickly, especially light rifles like an AR. And shooting with a bump stock is almost guaranteed to cause a lot of malfunctions like gnarly double feeds and bolt overrides due to the inconsistent rate of fire.

       I'm aware of heat build-up in ar-15, though quite a bit depends on your barrel profile. I've never shot a bumpfire or seen/heard of misfires with them, so I'll look into that.  I would think that practicing how to clear malfunctions would be a priority and once easily learned quicker than changing rifles unless you have a catastrophic failure , such as  the extractor ripping off the casing.

       I'm only speaking about Ar-15's and If you have a quality bcg and barrel(socom or heavy) and you clean and lube them with                slip2000- ewl or another machine gun lube. I don't doubt you though. Heat kills everything, engines, computes, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, aren't a lot of the military weapons already heavily used? How many new, well maintained weapons have you had go sideways? I have no military experience, so I'm genuinely curious

       Its not that the gun is broken or can't be used anymore. They just overheat and shit starts going wrong. A lot of it is caused by the metal expanding as it heats up, and also the changes to the metal's physical properties due to heat.

       You have to realize these guys are playing the long game.  They can afford to wait and slowly whittle away at gun rights until the complete destruction of the 2nd amendment.  What they CANNOT allow is a repeal of any of their laws; if things start going in the opposite direction they will lose their inevitable creep towards tyranny.

       Oh, I understand. I believe they are trying to guilt us and shame us into voluntarily giving up our 2nd. They can't afford the war that would come with just taking them. They need us running the machine.

       They aren't trying to take away guns. They know that's never been possible. Without sending the military into combat against the citizens to take weapons away, there will always be guns on the market in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, this has always been about giving a handout to the gun manufacturers. Guess what happens
       <em>
        every single time
       </em>
       they start talking about gun legislation. People go buy guns. Every mass shooting - people go buy guns. These are the same manufacturers that are making the military's weapons. Why the hell does everyone seem to be in the mind set that they want to hurt these companies that are giving them kickbacks?

       I’m not allowed to point out a hole in your logic without being told to get out?
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a simple question - if they are targeting specific groups, why hit both sides (liberals and NRA members)? It doesn’t make sense. If everyone is a target then your theory doesn’t hold up because there’s no reason to target specifics groups, like you suggested.

       Great find OP. Most will see this as fuel for rhetoric centered around the need for mental health screenings, stricter gun laws, etc. but the aware will see these as truly artificial events propagated by the very powers the rest of society blindly believe &amp; idolize.

       Depends on what your assumptions are, if you're talking about literally being accurate....I mean yes? All you're doing is stating things that happened before a certain date, you can do that with ANYTHING. But if your assumptions are hinting at some foul play, I'm going to need a little more evidence than coincidences.

       I think it's more likely that when you live in the US (a complete outlier for gun deaths for developed nations) it is pretty common for there to be some form of mass shooting within a week of relevant legislation.

       It's correlation, sure.

       Maybe, if gun control legislation is only talked about rarely.  You'd have to actually take into account every firearm related legislation they talk about and see if the pattern fits to them all.  If they've discussed gun laws two hundred times in a year, three shootings occurring near those times wouldn't be strange but expected.

       This is happenstance. Both of the things you're correllating -- shootings, and votes or hearings about gun control at the state and national level -- happen regularly in the United States.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2017_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States">
        Wikipedia
       </a>
       lists 14 mass shootings in the United States in 2017 so far, which is a rate of about one mass shooting every three weeks.

       Well, the Congressional Baseball shooting had 0 fatalities, and the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooting had 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Setting that aside, though, the other problem is that there are plenty of hearings and votes about gun control. It's a really broad category; OP includes bills both for enacting and easing restrictions, bills in the Senate and the House...
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at OP's link to the Florida bill about loosening restrictions on concealed carry in airports. It might seem like an amazing coincidence that a shooting would happen in an airport within a week before that bill was put before subcommittees, until you realize that the bill is associated with three other significant dates (its initial filing, its first reading in the House, and its eventual death in subcommittee). So that's four out of 52 weeks, or a 1:13 shot that an aiport shooting in Florida would happen within one week of a significant date of this specific bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, there's more! That bill links to four "related bills"
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of which attempt to loosen restrictions on concealed carry in airports. Those add about seven unique dates, covering a total of about 11 out of 52 weeks, or more than 1/5th of the year. The Fort Lauderdale airport shooter could have committed his crime on any date in January or February of 2017 and been within a week of one of those dates. And if he wouldn't have had to shoot up an aiport, either; at least one of those bills also attempts to loosen restrictions on concealed carry in countrooms, schools, and a whole bunch of other public spaces.

       Eh, I'm not sure that I'm admitting they're correlated. The dates the OP gave are accurate, but I'm arguing that what looks like correlation of the dates can be manipulating by selecting specific mass shootings and government actions out of a large available pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly all of those shootings happened on specific celebrities' birthdays, for example. But there's a celebrity birthday for every day of the year, so that really means nothigng at all.

       Lolz what. Most of these bills you quote and trying to relax regulations. So the obvious answer is to stage a mass shooting in order to gain support to relax regulations? Uh, sure pal.

       I don't think that motivation scans.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the vote you link to after the Pulse shooting was an attempt to enact gun control measures, and it failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were a conspirator who organized a mass shooting that resulted in the deaths of 49 people -- thus, at the very least, putting you at extreme risk if you were uncovered -- and it didn't even achieve your desired outcome, would you then do the whole thing again, staging a mass shooting that results in the deaths of even more people, in the hopes of restricting access to silencers, which weren't even using in the shooting you planned? Wouldn't it be much, much safer and more efficient to just buy off politicians?

       I'm surprised nobody has asked already, but how frequently does the senate conduct votes on gun-control legislation? We need a prior distribution to make sense of this data.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these were the only votes (on gun-control) they have done all year then your observation is statistically significant, but if they have votes every other week then it is just noise.

       It's all connected through the language of gematria. So is Tom Petty's death and this recent false flag attack (yes it actually happened and people died 😥) in Las Vegas. You will even see connections to Chester Benningtons death in this language. We live in a world where our media, sports leagues, politicians, president, etc etc. are all own by these rich and powerful religious psychopaths.

       These events were planed in a digital manner in advance, and very likely instructions were disseminated prior with encrypted messaging apps. This planning/inspiration/instruction took place on a server where creative writers and cabals operated. This has not come out due to the highly sensitive information discussed on these servers and likely confluence of intelligence/criminal syndicates/terrorists/law enforcement/media etc... that operate(d) on places like this.

       only impacts people who are involved in gun crime themselves.
