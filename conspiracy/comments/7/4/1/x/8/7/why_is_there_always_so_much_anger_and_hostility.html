<p>Well you didn&#39;t say it explicitly but you certainly implied it.  </p>

<p>When you make a claim that people questioning are dumb, it&#39;s implied that you are saying that you are not dumb.  Further, that you are smart enough to understand who is dumb and who isn&#39;t dumb.</p>

<p>So yes, you&#39;re saying it without saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still don&#39;t see the contradiction. Go on. Explain it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok - your second sentence contains the phrase &quot;making claims as facts&quot; which is what you did by saying: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of things people are &quot;questioning&quot; are fucking dumb.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are making this claim as a fact which it isn&#39;t.  You previously characterized those who made a claim of fact that isn&#39;t as being dumb....yet you implied you&#39;re smart.....hence the contradiction.</p>

<p>The question is, are you smart enough to understand what I&#39;m saying or will you simply react with emotion, dismiss me as being dumb and down vote me?  </p>

<p>I never said you were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are you defending? Just everything?  </p>

<p>What an interesting response.  You think I&#39;m defending something....I&#39;m not, I&#39;m pointing out contradictions in your claims but I&#39;m not defending anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t claim anyone was dumb. I said a lot of the &quot;questioning&quot; is dumb and that a lot of people aren&#39;t actually thinking. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahh good point and you&#39;re right. I transposed you taking issue with the topics they were questioning as being dumb and applying it to the people being dumb.  My mistake.</p>

<p>But then your entire argument simply boils down to personal preference.  You simply don&#39;t value the topics being discussed while the other person does.  This happens all the time in life and often it&#39;s people questioning &quot;accepted storylines&quot; that discover new things, new info, new knowledge.  Questioning is healthy, even if you don&#39;t agree with the focus of the questioning.....afterall, you don&#39;t have some objective lock on what is true and what isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all this analysis you&#39;re trying to lay on what I&#39;ve said, you&#39;re just remarkably wrong on the absolutely simplest stuff that can just be read in the comments you&#39;re responding to.  </p>

<p>Eh it happens. I&#39;m human, we&#39;re all human and we all make mistakes regularly....even you.  But don&#39;t escalate it.  I&#39;m not remarkably wrong, I&#39;m just wrong, on this one point.  So what?  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be right on every other point I discuss today.</p>

<p>One of the real issues I see in the world today is this propensity for applying labels to people and then only responding to a label.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no. This is not emotional. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re dumb or not, but you&#39;re certainly fucking wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God it must feel great to you to say it that way.  However, it sure looks emotional when you type it otherwise there is no need for the modifier FUCKING.  Slow your roll Einstein. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many reasons.  For some it&#39;s just an emotional reaction that people think it&#39;s cold blooded to question the deaths, especially if they know someone involved.  </p>

<p>Others, it&#39;s frustration with people who will act like they&#39;ve reviewed all available info to come up with the &quot;things that don&#39;t add up&quot;, but are conveniently leaving out the info that clears it up.  For example, the flashing light on the lower floor.  People keep acting like that&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t add up and is evidence of another shooter, while conveniently leaving out that the light continues to flash after the firing stops.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States has at various times in recent history provided 
support to terrorist and paramilitary organizations around 
the world. It has also provided assistance to numerous 
authoritarian regimes that have used state terrorism 
as a tool of repression.</p>

<p>The Piazza Fontana Bombing was a terrorist attack that 
occurred on December 12, 1969 at 16:37, when a bomb 
exploded at the headquarters of Banca Nazionale dell&#39;Agricoltura 
(National Agrarian Bank) in Piazza Fontana in Milan 
killing 17 people and wounding 88. </p>

<p>In 1998, Milan judge Guido Salvini indicted U.S. Navy officer 
David Carrett on charges of political and military 
espionage for his participation in the Piazza Fontana 
bombing et al. Salvini also opened up a case against 
Sergio Minetto, an Italian official of the U.S.-NATO intelligence 
network, and &quot;collaboratore di giustizia&quot; Carlo Digilio 
(Uncle Otto), who served as CIA coordinator in Northeastern 
Italy in the sixties and seventies. </p>

<p>It would certainly be a place to meet gun enthusiasts and maybe sell them something that they&#39;re not likely to find at the show back at your hotel suite. </p>

<p>Those preparing and setting up for a such a show would of course be getting there early and perhaps meeting with others both socially and on a business level.</p>

<p>So there is an outside possibility for someone to have a collection of maybe 20 odd pieces of that nature for a few discriminating buyers that could add up to a fair bit of money when sold.</p>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday it emerged that Paddock may have previously planned to attack another open-air music festival, which was held from September 22-24.</p>

<p>So if they&#39;re right on this it was at least a week, premeditated, plus all that time spent collecting and modding guns... Seems too long to be &quot;snapping&quot; and more in the territory of MKUltra type stuff if he is actually &quot;acting alone&quot;.</p>

The guy is dead, there isn&#39;t going to be a trial or an inquest of any kind and they&#39;re not obliged to show any evidence to anyone and it&#39;s not very likely that they ever will. It&#39;s in the hands of the FBI who have a pretty checkered past when it comes to these kind of cases in particular.</p>

<p>As for someone being driven to indiscriminately kill a whole lot of ordinary people for what seems to be no reason at all and then off themselves, the most common denominator for them seems to be just how suspicious and very out of the ordinary each of those incidents all are and that the explanations provided never seem to quite add up or make much sense beyond the government taking advantage of them to push some new restrictions and measures that apply to everyone, cost a ton of money to implement and are way out of proportion to those events and just how rare and unlikely they actually are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass hypnosis is part of it, but what you&#39;re describing is simpler than that.</p>

<p>Everybody has their handles, which, if exploited WILL move you in a certain way. Freud knew this, Jung knew this, and crucially, Edward Bernays knew this. Everyone has certain triggers, not always the same, but quite reliably predictable. </p>

<p>Confirmation bias, or rather our powerful desire to avoid cognitive dissonance is a very potent handle. Tell a lie so big that everyone just automatically assumes that everyone one else believes it, and you won&#39;t want to not believe it. Your own brain protects you from believing it. Some will even go so far to protect the lie itself with their life. This, I believe, is what makes meditation and psychedelics such valuable tools. They (can) remove the emotional reaction to confronting ideas, opening your perception to new viewpoints.</p>

<p>At any rate, cognitive dissonance is a pendulum blade that swings both ways, folks. Let&#39;s not forget that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m willing to answer this...please don&#39;t be too hard on me, I&#39;m just telling you what I believe to be true in good faith.</p>

<p>First and foremost I have to address the &quot;lying mainstream media&quot; thing. Obviously it&#39;s a very popular concept at r/conspiracy that the mainstream media can&#39;t be trusted, but in a more representative sample of Americans it&#39;s pretty fringe, and it&#39;s partisan. </p>

<p>I know! I know! You disagree that it&#39;s partisan. Like I said, in here it may not be, but out there it kind of is. Some background: the concept of &quot;fake news&quot; used to refer very specifically to sites that mimicked the format of actual news sites in order to spread falsehoods. These sites weren&#39;t publishing anything resembling real news; they writers weren&#39;t tricked by sources, but rather invented the stories from whole cloth and used fake bylines. Sometimes these stories would go viral and maybe even have an impact on the world at large.</p>

<p>Then-candidate Trump took advantage of the popularity of the term &quot;fake news&quot; and started to use it to describe pervayors of <strong>real</strong> news, like the New York Times or CNN, aka the &#39;mainstream media&#39;. These outlets might get things wrong sometimes, but -- again, this is the general belief, and I recognize people here won&#39;t agree -- they do use actual sources, and print things that they actually believe to be true, under their own actual names. So, for people who don&#39;t like President Trump (and who aren&#39;t prone to being into conspiracies), attacks on the &quot;mainstream media&quot; might appear to be politically motivated.</p>

<p>Add onto that any specific event that might tend to heighten emotions -- say, for example, the wholesale slaughter of dozens of innocent concert-goers this week -- and you might understand why some people might be very angry, in that context, if you use it as an occasion to talk about the &quot;mainstream media&quot; and its &quot;lies.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve made personal sacrifices or morally questionable decisions  based on some kind of hope in the continued existence of our current paradigm or the latest mob-belief, challenges to that system of belief aren&#39;t just challenges to a belief; they are subtle reminders that those sacrifices didn&#39;t need to be made, and those decisions <em>were</em> morally wrong. They are reminders that sometimes past actions can no longer be justifiable in the face of new information or a point of view. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve sent a son off to war that didn&#39;t come back, how do you deal with the awareness that the war itself was <em>wrong</em>, or based on false pretenses, or the cause of unrelated suffering you see everyday? What if you were proud of this son as he marched away?</p>

<p>This is also known colloquially as &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot;. </p>

<p>The thing that interests me most is the level of anger... I&#39;d speculate that most people never make it past disbelief/anger in the 5 stages of grief. That&#39;s exactly what I think this behavior signals. These people are grieving the loss of a system that&#39;s beginning to come apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are forced to see how utterly morally corrupt the leadership of the world you live in is then it becomes very psychologically difficult to be a cog in the machine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because we are brought up in this country believing that we are good moral people and our country, flaws and all, is basically run by good people doing their best to protect freedom in a dangerous world.</p>

<p>If it becomes clear that our &#39;freedom&#39; is largely a myth and the only thing we defend around the world is the profit margins of our TRUE leadership then the whole concept of the self as a &#39;good person&#39; participating in a &#39;morally correct&#39; system collapses.</p>

<p>Most people would suffer a severe psychological breakdown.  I know from experiencing it myself.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be shocked that some part of the personality knows this and fights hard to protect the psyche as a whole from the truth.</p>

<p>White dude does the largest mass shooting in the US and y&#39;all are gobsmacked by it. It&#39;s impossible. Can&#39;t be true. Surely there has to be something else.</p>

<p>Oh! Like, ISIS did it and that means it wasn&#39;t a white conservative! Or maybe it was a liberal jew! Or maybe George Soros did it himself! Anything but a white guy.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s valid to question the official lone-shooter view. And your third paragraph is just fantastical projection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all aware that the educational system, at least in North America, has been dumbed down in order to accommodate the least skilled and those with the least potential. So even those people who are or have been capable of more broad schooling have been short-changed. The level of scientific literacy has dropped as has the ability of graduates to think critically.</p>

<p>All this has gone on while the broadly based media has been concentrated into only a few major players who decide what is aired or printed. Very few people would like to think that their own minds could be the victims of the combination of poor skills and propaganda.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again and again and again we have the lone shooter bullshit trotted out by the [shadow] government of the day. The really annoying part is that there appears to be no real intention in updating the story since Lee Harvey Oswald was named as the so called &quot;lone shooter&quot; in Dallas.
Almost every terrorist now wants to drive into a crowd of people. Why? are they all getting the same training from the same teachers? Show a serious lack of creativity as well as causes one to wonder how many hijackings and other mayhem down the years has been orchestrated false flags designed to create chaos cause fear and confusion and require more draconian laws to &quot;protect&quot; the people.</p>
