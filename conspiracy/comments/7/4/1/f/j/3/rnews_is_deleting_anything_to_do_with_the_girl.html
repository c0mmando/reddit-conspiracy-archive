They arent going to take names, or file a report with the cops for simply kicking someone out for screaming shit at people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only technically &quot;human&quot;. The brains of psychopaths and sociopaths are known to be wired differently. The are not like the rest of us... they have no sense of guilt or remorse, no conscience about what they do to please themselves or how much harm it brings to others. In general their intelligence is above average and they see all our normal feelings as a weakness they don&#39;t share and something that can be easily exploited for their own ends and they take a delight in being able to manipulate others that way.</p>

<p>They already believe that they are better and more powerful than others and generally work their way into positions of authority in order to do that. They are expert liars and deceivers who can pass any lie detector because the truth or a lie has no more meaning and makes no difference to them beyond how well it simply happens to serve their own purely selfish purposes. By any proper definition they aren&#39;t human at all but soulless predatory creatures who look just like human beings but actually aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>actually this is kind of true, we have been deep into hyper-social communication for a few years now and the obsess over views,likes etc causes this exponential 1upsmanship in most communities. mental illness has become glorified and its a contest to see how depressed or psychotic and random!!! you are</p>

More people had a connection to her based on her popularity for music.  The victims of Anders were unfortunate, but for many people there was absolutely no connection to be made to that atrocity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no. The scientific method involves observing a pattern, for example like here we have two instances epople remember of an attack happening and a famous person dying shortly after. So you then migh tformulate a theory, that after big attacks, celebrities die the day after. And then you would take all the big attacks over a certain time period and look at how many of them had a celebrity die in the couple of days after. Then you would do a statistical analysis to see whether the number of times that happened was likely just due to chance, or if it was statistically likely that it was no accident. If you get a result that it is 95% of more likely to not be due to chance, then you have something to go on. That is how these things work. Yes you can find patterns when you look for them, but there are established ways of determining whether those patterns are just naturally occurring &#39;coincidences&#39; or whether there is likely something else to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, I&#39;m all for looking into something and doing the research. It&#39;s just not evidence of anything bigger until you can prove a statistical correlation outside the likelihood of pure chance.

Imo when intuition intersects with reality it is worth investigating.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok then let me reword my comment from above. Do the research and come back when you have meaningful statistical evidence.</p>

<p>There is a whole scientific process in place for statisticians to avoid cherry picking facts, biased thinking, overlooking factors etc. </p>

<p>And btw even if you do find out that statistically more celebrities die after terrorist attacks &quot;correlation does not mean causation&quot;. See:

    <div class="md"><p>Well if your intuition is that celebrities are getting killed to distract from conspiracies during terror attacks then there is an easy way to find out if your feeling leads anywhere. Look at the data that is available. There are lists of celebrity deaths and of terror attacks. Just google those and use a calendar and a spreadsheet to see if there is a correllation.</p>

<p>But if you just wanna smugly discuss you &quot;intuitions&quot; and &quot;feelings&quot; about the media and the elites and sheeple being fooled then you are dishonest if you think you don&#39;t do that for some kind of feeling of wokeness or superiority. You know better than those dumb people blindly following the narrative created by the elites and you can be sure you are onto something because of your intuition and your feelings. That is the most important part anyway because facts and evidence are controlled by &quot;them&quot; anyways so it&#39;s pointless to even try to rely on anything other than your own vague emotions and ideas. </p>

<p>If you treat it like that it&#39;s not a discussion but a circlejerk and you should at least admit why you like getting your intuitive dick stroked here.</p>

<p>I said a pattern ALONE is not evidence of anything, because if you come to a pre determined conclusion and go looking for evidence to support it you&#39;re going to find things whether they&#39;re relevant or not. </p>

<p>So, like you&#39;re saying, it&#39;s a starting point. Investigate it, do the research, and discuss your ideas. I never said anything against that. Just don&#39;t be so close minded that you only see things you WANT to see. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem</a></p>

<p>Literally, with 23 random people in a room, the odds are 50% two of em share the same birthday. 
Remember in elementary school when two people in your class had the same birthday? </p>

<p>Now, it only takes 70 random people and it is a 99.9% probability that two people will share a birthday.</p>

<p>100% is reached at 367 people. (366 days) </p>

<p>How amazing is that? </p>

<p>Now that you read this, I&#39;m sure you remember two elementary grades (2 grades out of 5 grades) where two kids share a birthday.</p>

The default position is not, everyone is lying to me and making shit up for the benefit of some nefarious concept or persons yet to be named.</p>

<p>Q1 Why would a person attempt to warn other people of an impending attack and be unconcerned about their own safety?</p>

<p>Q2What evidence has been presented to definitively link the shooter with any organisation? I have so far seen nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think the couple had foreknowledge of a mass murder.  To me it sounds like the Latino couple were making empty threats after a drunken confrontation.  This sort of stuff happens very frequently at concerts and any large gathering of people where alcohol is involved.  I seem to recall the girl who was interviewed about it saying the couple who were making making threats were escorted out by security.</p>

<p>The threats were unrelated to the shooting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to understand the end conclusion?  That this was all planned?  Dude holed and armed up for 4 days getting ready to commit this act, so it was definitely planned, well in advance.  </p>

<p>So therefore it&#39;s plausible someone else could know, like this lady.  But if she is down in the crowd warning people, she&#39;s not assisting the shooter or helping make it easier for him.  I mean, she might be some hate filled person who knew and just wanted to be down there seeing the victims up close, but why tip people off on the threat in advance if you want the shooting to happen?</p>

<p>Or the flip side, if she knew and wanted to stop it, yelling at randoms at the concert that they are going to die, instead of calling the authorities doesn&#39;t make sense either.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m saying that if this lady actually knew the shooting was going to happen in advance, her actions don&#39;t make much sense regardless of which side of the situation she may be on.  If she wants the shooting to happen, you don&#39;t warn the victims.  If you don&#39;t, screaming death is coming isn&#39;t rational or effective. </p>

<p>So either she&#39;s a nut who knew and figured screaming at the concert goers was the best course of action...or it might just be a drunk chick hurling insults for some unrelated incident that happened at the concert.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t think of a logical result for what value her actions if she really did know added.  Therefore I err to the side of: drunk chick at a country concert.  It actually makes the most sense to me.  But It&#39;s late for me too and I&#39;m rambling so any thoughts are appreciated.</p>
