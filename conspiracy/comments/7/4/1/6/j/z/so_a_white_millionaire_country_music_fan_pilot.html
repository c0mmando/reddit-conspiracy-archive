       It's weird the scope in the second picture down the page still has the cap on it.  Usually if you're firing a weapon with a scope you have to take the cap off to see through it.

       I don't see a scope cap?

       The thing on the rear-most part of the scope is a knob, typically called a variable scope. So you can adjust the 'zoom' on your scope.

       Interesting that neither of those seem to show a bump stock. Sure, he had many more guns, but it seems to suggest that these are either full auto/assault rifles (not easy to get) or these guns were never used.

       You may be right. It looked like a Magpul stock at first, but I now see it's likely a Slide Fire stock. Good catch.

       Why would you use a bump stock? Your goal is to kill as many people as possible before you are killed by the police. You buy a surplus auto sear, drill a hole and drill a hole in the lower, put it all together like Lego's and you have a illegal full auto weapon. Like the guy would give a shit about gun laws?

       Ever tried to accurately aim a bump stock? I have one and it's garbage. From the audio I've heard I say it was a rotary firing mechanism. Btw, you don't need a bump stock to bump fire a rifle.

       At that vantage point why would one need such a device anyway? If mass carnage is the goal why even use guns in the first place. The whole thing kinda smells funny to me but the sounds are what caught my attention.

       Ok kid. You've got this consipracy thing covered. All I said was that this wasn't a slidefire and a slidefire is basically junk because you can do the same thing without it from the hip and with a little practice and technique, from the shoulder, and do just as much damage.  My interests aren't in creating carnage at all but yes there are other methods that could and would have a higher rate of carnage. It's not that difficult of a concept. For about $20 bucks in plastic and a ball bearing you can overrun pretty much any semi auto rifle and aim the thing without a bipod. I've only spent about the last four years and about 120k on this particular subject so maybe I'm skewed. Trust me. I would rather dude just didn't do his thing at all but i damn sure wish he'd done it with some other method which didn't affect my revenue directly.

       We've seen three of the guns so far, and one of them had a bump fire stock, I'd say the chances are pretty good that there was another AR modified with the rotary trigger.

       You must be a shitty shot or don't know how to properly handle the slide fire. There is a technique to it.

      <p>
       But that is completely moot because he was using bipods. So are you saying you can have substantially better accuracy with a full auto on a bipod vs a slide fire on a bipod? That is bullshit.

       Guns tend to be super unreliable when fitting a new sear in, takes a few hundred rounds to even be consistent at all, while a bump fire stock works right off the bat. I'd imagine a home made sear, even made by a professional would be even harder to get right. What's he going to do, make 10+ full auto sears, fit them in and gradually go to the range to test them?

       If you're doing this illegally you wouldn't take them to the range to test fire would you? It would get reported by the range officer, then to the ATF. A smart person would drive out to the woods and work out all the kinks there.

       You just don't want to admit you're wrong? Instead just downvote anyone that disagrees with you. My point was on top of the fact that bump fire is super easy and cheap to do, legal, and raises no suspicion. People can still hear gun shots in the middle of the desert or a forest. I live in a rural area and I've had people report my gunshots that live miles away.

       Did neither of those things, but you don't want to admit you're wrong, so you accuse. I live in space and can see the stars, people have reported my laser beams that I shoot at asteroids as they pass by. Sometimes, these calls come from light years away!

       His girlfriend is Indonesian, a predominantly Muslim country. The event he targeted was in blatant violation of the Islamic doctrine against music and drinking. It was so similar to the Manchester bombing that comparisons are being drawn on many subreddits. This is far from conclusive but it is worth considering that, despite the attacker being white, he may have been politically motivated and a terrorist. And leaked Israeli intelligence isn't going to be a five page document with an alphabetical reference list, it's just a leaked memo. Calm down okay?

       Well they don't represent all Muslims, they typically follow the religion strictly, an example would be sharia law and the way women and gays are treated. I believe the manchurian candidate possibility before the isis one. It's definitely super weird and suspicious. Paddock just seems like a typical old retiree who can afford to gamble heavily. I don't think a lot of old white guys would be drawn to Islam either.

       To me, it would be worse if it was an unmotivated act of pure evil. At least if it was religious, it would be easier to understand why he committed such an atrocity, due to extremism and brainwashing. Maybe we will never know why.

       Calm down Shlomo. This sub is for discussing conspiracy theories, the report may or may not be true, but it is out there and worth considering. Add in the fact that ISIS is claiming the very same thing and it is certainly a possibility. Honestly, you're a moron for not considering it.

       No no no. If it's not true then why would we consider it? Just because it's out there doesn't make it worth consideration. I could say: "he was actually a Lizardman with 12 dicks," so now that is out there, will you consider this info? Of course not, the only reason you want to consider the Islam thing is your brain wants to match your underlying belief that only Muslims do bad things.

       There are two sources saying it. Again, this is a conspiracy sub, we consider all of the available information. If you think that MSM is the only valid source for information, you're in the wrong place. The guy very well could have been an ISIS recruit, hopefully we get more information (and hopefully the information isn't suppressed).

       In the search for truth our standards should be higher, not lower. The only reason anyone is willing to entertain these websites (which do not have any air of reliability to them) is because they conform to the World-view that people had previous to reading them. Before we found out who it was they screamed "Muslims did it!" and now that it turns out it was an old white man, they have to find meaning by refocusing it into their worldview. The man is in Las Vegas, he can find far worse halal than a country concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't respond to the brainwashing nonsense, other than to note that this hoping that he is a Muslim seems like successful deployment of Fox News' brainwashing tactics of blaming Muslims for all bad things.

       So you believe the MSM narrative that he had no religious nor political affiliations? And that any source to the contrary isn't worth considering?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, that's not how a conspiracy forum works. Here, we realize that the truth is often hidden from us and you have to go looking for it. That doesn't mean you should necessarily
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       any random source, but it can be considered when looking at the big picture. And if more pieces of corroborating evidence come out, it can strengthen the source's credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not be surprised if this guy had some connection to ISIS or radical Islam. You have ISIS claiming that he was, and that he had an Islamic name, you have this Israeli source, and then you have the fact that his wife was originally from a majority Muslim country. Hope this helps you understand how these forums work.

       Yep, two other sources state that he recently converted to Islam, and yet the MSM says "He has no know political or religious affiliations." Without mentioning any other possibility. He was probably a muslim, as for being a lizard, that is still up for debate.

       You can not trust both MSM, and shitty internet sources. Instead of being whipped up in a frenzy about Muslims (which is a result of the brainwashing you have received via the Idiot-in-chief) I'm concerned about what's actually happening. What is this covering? Corporate information collection hearings that TPTB don't want us to think about at all since they are heavily invested in collecting everything they can. You said before maybe I was in the wrong sub, I think you are, as this isnt r /t_dummies.

       What does being a millionaire have to do with it? All that means is he (probably) doesn't have money problems. Other than that, he probably has all the same problems as most other people... depression, pain, etc.

       When you are a millionaire, you can slay as much pussy as the body can handle, you can do as many drugs as you damn well please. You can go on any trip you ever wanted. You can stay anywhere in the world. You can swim with sharks, have a cocaine fueled orgy with ten smoking hot women (look at leanardo decaprio on his boat).

       Basically, even depression is small in comparison to multiple millions of dollars.

       What about Robin Williams and more recently Chester Bennington (Linkin Park)? Those two were loved by millions, had millions in the bank, yet still committed suicide due to severe depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because some depression is caused by a lack money, doesn't mean it all is. I'm going to make a safe assumption and say that having a lot of money can also be depressing. Imagine not knowing who likes you for you, and not your money or material possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I do agree that there does seem to be a lack of motive. Guess we won't really know until someone close to the accused comes forward

       Happiness doesn't come from outside of yourself with worthless material possessions and cheap hookers. Happiness only arises within. Millions of dollars won't change that fact, only make your life more comfortable and easy.

       Do you think that is a witty remark? Your maturity shows by responding with a question about age. It's a tired old joke. And someone made the same comment on either this comment or another on in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only are you using a tired old joke. But you are using the same joke you probably just read.

       I hate to question age or aptitude. But I'm suggesting you look in the mirror. Your either very low functioning or just all around useless.

       I am a millionaire so I can tell you that all of that shit you mentioned doesn't cure depression. Most other millionaires I know are miserable people. You can do awesome shit all day and still be depressed the rest of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's hard to believe, but think of the last thing you bought that made you happy. It only lasted for a brief time right? The same is true for big houses, trips, cars, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's not that hard to be a millionaire these days. 6.5% of American households have at least 1 millionaire living in them:

       Also, it's not that hard to be a millionaire these days. It took me 12 years after finishing college, and I have an English Degree... so according to Reddit I should be working at Starbucks. But it's true, there are a lot of millionaires these days... 6.5% of American households have at least 1 millionaire living in them:

       Do not pursue money, pursue what makes you happy (and that thing is rarely money). Money gets you out of the hole, but it doesn't lift you above the ground.

       Yea man I get it. My point was money makes life easier and more comfortable. Not it cures depression.

       A lot of people cope with mental issues with drugs and sex. It certainly makes coping a lot easier.

       To be completely honest the gun debate is just a big distraction while corporations like Lockheed Martin, with the support of the left and the right, deals weapons to war criminal countries like Saudi Arabia while the people stay focused here with there grips on their guns. All the while America and many other countries become less safe in the process.

       There's no correlation between mass shootings and increased control afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is however a very direct correlation between mass shootings, fear mongering about gun control, and subsequent increases in gun/ammo sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone was going to organize a mass shooting to push their goals it would be the pro-gun side, because they're the ones who benefit from them.

       Where? I haven’t seen anyone calling for bans of all the guns he had there. Oh and Trump today said ‘We’ll be talking about gun laws’, guess he’s one of those liberals you’re taking about.

       What exactly adds up?  Republicans control congress and there's a snowflake's chance in hell they will pass gun reform.  If the left actually wanted to ban weapons they would wait until they had the power to do so before sparking mass outrage in a staged attack.  Quit blaming others for the actions of this idiot.

       It should be known that guns can be disassembled. So whoever continually points to this discussion about large bags being carried in, please be aware that a few high powered assault rifles with extended magazines can be broken down and put into duffle bags. 100 round barrels on bump stock rifles can dump out a lot of rounds, albeit inaccurately. The discussion about these being hard to obtain is incorrect. Bump stocks are a loophole item of sorts but are not difficult to obtain if you're in a place where they're more easily obtained. 
READ. A bump stock tactical rifle is NOT a full auto "machine gun." Semantics are very important here. 
A cart from the lobby could carry these bags. Like it carries everyone else's bags.
It wouldn't be difficult to carry 10 guns on a single cart from the garage to room, in luggage bags as conspicuous as anyone else's.

       Number of bags or frequency?  I can imagine him using ONE bag to go get disassembled firearms out of his car.  The thing that a lot of people are missing (having stayed at MB and Four Seasons several times) is that you typically are valeted.  I always fly in, but i don't normally see folks getting their own luggage out of their cars....not at a hotel like MB

       a single ar weighs about 4-6 lbs
Ammo is heavy but every hotel in that area has a cart for luggage.  and he could have gone out and bought some of this stuff while in vegas and brought it in pieces at a time.  It's common for those of us who enjoy firearms to order separate upper and lower assemblies.  It takes two seconds to separate an AR into two very manageable parts.  And, some ARs are polymer upper/lower, so they are extremely light weight

       4-6 lbs is lightweight for an AR, 10-12 is more common for a loaded AR. ex:

       Number of bags is means nothing.  He was there for four days.  Him bringing in three bags a day at different times of the day/night = 12 bags without anyone giving a ripping fart about it.  And he probably only needed 3-4 bags so adjust the numbers accordingly.

       Found this link interestingly enough, goes along with the detached tweets Hillary Clinton sent out after the shooting. As well as different video sources showing what looks to be muzzle flashes from a room on the 4th floor. Listening to the weapon itself it's easy to tell that this was not an automatic weapon, as an automatic weapon can empty a 30 round clip in under 5 seconds, let alone the fact that one man that was interviewed claimed his buddy was shot 3 times in the chest... Think a 10 inch grouping (automatic or semi with a handcrank system) would be nearly impossible from the distance.

       But at 350+ yards distant, automatic fire getting a grouping of three shots on a single person's chest. I woulda thought the gun would be shaking all over the place.

       Almost certainly. I won't name names, but there are people working in certain rural cities in 3rd world countries, where there are local conflicts, who basically sell "tours" to millionaires, where they set POWs loose in an uninhabited area with natural boundaries (think of Holes) and the client goes out and kills these people. Sometimes they do this with criminals who were going to executed anyway.
      </p>

       Now the ones they really don't tell you about (I shouldn't even mention them) are the police agencies (several in the USA) who actually allow "ride alongs" with wealthy billionaires who pretend to be cops and get the chance to kill those black guys you hear about who get unjustly killed. Not all of them are billionaires, of course, but sometimes they are. Sometimes they're just Russian agents who infiltrate US police forces in order to create racial/ethnic strife. I have this one friend, well had this one friend, who, well, nm.

       This strong need for control becomes more or less pathological, leading to cart-before-horse reasoning and leaps of logic.  People will talk about 'rituals' (that don't ever include specifics because there are none), secret groups, etc.  Things with correlative but not causative relationships like "the gunman had an orange hat, the same color as the president's skin!!!! OMGWTFBB".

       He was most likely a psychopath. We have no info about his personal relationships because he probably didn't have many. He made a bunch of money and got some freedom and got bored and decided to end it. His dad is an infamous bank robber psychopath and he probably has the same genes. He's a smart guy--multimillionaire. Probably planned to be the best mass shooter ever. Did it in a pretty smart way if you ask me if you want to inflict max carnage for as long as possible.

       Oh, he certainly had a motive, but it might not be one that we ever get to know, or it might be very unsatisfying, like Columbine.  That kind of dissatisfaction makes people really reach- they tried to blame the music they listened to, their fashion choices etc, because "there is no way you could have prevented this" is a terrifying reality.

       Yes, they would, because an evil organization is something you can at least theoretically do something about.  Some asshole who just decided to do this, not so much.
      </p>

       I'm not saying there aren't evil organizations- there certainly are (and I do think one of them is behind that day in Dallas).

       But I do find it ironic that people invent them, lacking evidence  but sure
       <em>
        someone

       besides the person we know about must be involved, which serves the interests of the actual evil organizations by deflecting attention and robbing places like this of credibility.

       Lol, the concept of conspiracy theories was invented because there's been a history of conspiracies since as long as anyone can remember. The CIA embraced the term while turning it derogatory via various psy-ops to mock people questioning their manufactured narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, people would rather believe an idiot did some shit than finding out WW2 never ended and we're controlled by literal Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason people are choosing to believe in conspiracies is not because the "problem" is easier to solve (it's not) -- it's because the alternative lacks any kind of motivation. At least with 9/11 it was about our freedom.

       I see so much argument over what the motive for an attack like this would be, and I think nobody is really bringing up the idea that these sort of events are intended to shape our minds, and keep our psychology slave like. 9/11 worked to change the world into a state of permanent war because the mass destruction and display of force spoke to our ID. When you feel the roar of the lion reverberate through your body, you understand your mortality. People who are kept socially isolated, afraid, and most importantly in touch with their mortality, arent likely to organize and rise up. I believe that is the point of things like this.

       BTW not a gun guy at all, but I've seen a ton of Iraq war footage. That gun sounds exactly like an M42 to me. Check videos on YouTube and tell me what you think.

       How it is highly secure? Have you ever been to a Vegas Casino? There aren't metal detectors or security checkpoints. They're huge with 3000+ rooms. Thousands of people coming and going every day. There is tons of surveillance but that doesn't mean they're secure. Look up a few of the high profile casino robberies over the years. They are not secure. Vulnerable would be a more accurate description.

       Isn't it interesting how the LV events are similar to the JFK assasination? "Lone-wolf" rifleman targets victim(s) from a tall building across the street. Eye witness and police scanner chatter indicate at least one other shooter near ground level. Uncontained, predominantly white, outdoor event. Description of the "Lone-wolf" doesn't seem to stand up to scrutiny when describing the crime commited.

       try reading what you link.  "According to unofficial report..." From a website that is not an official news website in Israel, with no sources, or any information other than the exact point you wanted to make. This sub is a joke.

       What about Robin Williams and more recently Chester Bennington (Linkin Park)? Those two were loved by millions, had millions in the bank, yet still committed suicide due to severe depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because some depression is caused by a lack money, doesn't mean it all is. I'm going to make a safe assumption and say that having a lot of money can also be depressing. Imagine not knowing who likes you for you, and not your money or material possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I do agree that there does seem to be a lack of motive. Guess we won't really know until someone close to the accused comes forward

       Ever tried to accurately aim a bump stock? I have one and it's garbage. From the audio I've heard I say it was a rotary firing mechanism. Btw, you don't need a bump stock to bump fire a rifle.

       He was most likely a psychopath. We have no info about his personal relationships because he probably didn't have many. He made a bunch of money and got some freedom and got bored and decided to end it. His dad is an infamous bank robber psychopath and he probably has the same genes. He's a smart guy--multimillionaire. Probably planned to be the best mass shooter ever. Did it in a pretty smart way if you ask me if you want to inflict max carnage for as long as possible.

       I’m calling out your argument fallacy, you’re so obsessed with liberals it’s fucking sad dude, we’re not talking about political leanings we’re talking about gun control and it’s clear you’re just obsessed with blaming everybody but the problem: fucking guns designed to kill people.

       a single ar weighs about 4-6 lbs
Ammo is heavy but every hotel in that area has a cart for luggage.  and he could have gone out and bought some of this stuff while in vegas and brought it in pieces at a time.  It's common for those of us who enjoy firearms to order separate upper and lower assemblies.  It takes two seconds to separate an AR into two very manageable parts.  And, some ARs are polymer upper/lower, so they are extremely light weight

       To be completely honest the gun debate is just a big distraction while corporations like Lockheed Martin, with the support of the left and the right, deals weapons to war criminal countries like Saudi Arabia while the people stay focused here with there grips on their guns. All the while America and many other countries become less safe in the process.

       Oh, he certainly had a motive, but it might not be one that we ever get to know, or it might be very unsatisfying, like Columbine.  That kind of dissatisfaction makes people really reach- they tried to blame the music they listened to, their fashion choices etc, because "there is no way you could have prevented this" is a terrifying reality.

       You just don't want to admit you're wrong? Instead just downvote anyone that disagrees with you. My point was on top of the fact that bump fire is super easy and cheap to do, legal, and raises no suspicion. People can still hear gun shots in the middle of the desert or a forest. I live in a rural area and I've had people report my gunshots that live miles away.
