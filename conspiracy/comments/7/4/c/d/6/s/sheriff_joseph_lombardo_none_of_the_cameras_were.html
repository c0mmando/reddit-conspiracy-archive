       He just said at the 5:00 PM PT press conference, that none of Stephen Paddock's cameras were recording.

       ....really? The guy who planned an entire massacre forgot to turn on the cameras? The guy who shot himself before they entered the room?

       He simply set the camera up so he could know when they were approaching his room.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't want to be captured alive so he wanted to ensure he had ample time to off himself before being wounded and arrested. So he set up a few cameras to livestream to his laptop as a security system of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely NO reason to record those feeds in his mind. Why bother?
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, you'd think someone going through all that trouble would record some sort of motive or goodbye separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just not that unusual that his security cams weren't recording.

       Indeed. He saw hotel security and blasted them through the door. Apparently unloading nearly 200 rounds into the hallway. He wounded one and they retreated. He probably assumed it was a matter of minutes before they came back and just went ahead and killed himself to not risk getting caught.

       Wait I'm the one that can't read. I swear my comment was a reply not a parent comment. Old mate was saying this is bullshit that the casino cameras weren't recording and I was trying to point out that the post is talking about the suspects camera. That's why i thought your reply didn't make sense.

       Is it unreasonable to think that was his original intention, but never got around to doing it? This whole post is clickbait. They aren't talking about the Hotel/Casino's cameras. They are talking about the killer's cameras.

       Something is fishy about the whole hotel security went to his room and got shot narrative. If I was a hotel security guard and there were shots fired, I (or any rational person) definitely would not be going around investigating before the police.(especially because it was only minutes before the police arrived)

       I was just referring to the general tone of this sub over the last two days. But yeah, I'm sure the shooter only did set up a live camera feed of the hallway. There's not much reason to not believe that.

       If he's talking about the ones monitoring if the cops were coming down the hallway is pretty reasonable to think he was just using them for monitoring and not recording it. I guess it depends if we get any info about them being hooked up to the TV's in the room.

       Baby monitors have a transmitter and a receiver.  If he was sending audio from his room, who was receiving it?  Were the other cameras also transmitting to someone else, or livestreaming to someone?

       It's possible it was just a camera he didn't feel the need to use.  He had more guns than he needed, why are extra cameras out of the question? Also, if he was committing a crime with the intent to escape, which is the only reason I can figure he set up so many cameras in the first place, then he has motive not to record anything to leave as little evidence behind as possible.

       It was a large suite with multiple rooms and he was shooting out of multiple rooms.  He most likely had the receiver with him so when he was in the second room he could hear what was going on in the first room if the police were outside the door so he'd know when to shoot himself.

       I've been seeing different reports on how many cameras he had then. I read he had one in the peep hole of the door and then one on a food service cart farther down the hall. What reliable article do you have that places one inside the room too?

       Yeah, they said he set up cameras, not that he recorded it. He set up the cameras strategically. Hidden in a room service cart outside of his door so he could see down the hallway, and another in the peephole to his room.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was watching the camera feeds as a tool for himself. That's how he shot the security guard through the door.

       He broke out the windows of that room. It's not all that difficult to count upwards or downwards to find the right floor.

       It was on the corner so that limits the possibilities down pretty well.

       Obviously police would at least lock down the building pretty quickly. Any time there is a concert there is a large police presence. Plus, the moment a call of shots fired hits the radio every cop in the city would be heading to the location.

       There are recordings of the streams online, you can go listen to the bits you missed. One of the security guards got there before the shooting finished and was shot through the door. Police reached the floor two minutes after the shooting finished.

        10.05pm: First shots fired by the suspect. This was seen on closed-circuit television from the concert venue.

        10.12pm: First two officers arrive on 31st floor and announce gunfire is coming from directly above them.

       You're right that doesn't make sense. So there are several possibilities here:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        You are lying
       </li>
       <li>
        You are misremembering the time that you heard the feed
       </li>
       <li>
        The police and everyone else is lying about the timeline
       </li>
       <li>
        The feed that you listened to was not live.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I'd say that #2 and #4 are the most likely explanations

       How would he know before hand how long that would take?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also ignoring the security guard who approached the door and was shot. He told police exactly what room it was. He and the police as they arrived stayed in the hallway watching the door from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the security guard hadn't been there they would have certainly locked down the building and checked everyone inside until they found the shooter.

       Well, the sheriff said, "we have reason to believe he thought he would be leaving alive." So I guess when evidence gets released we will have proof.

       And how the hell are you going to call me out on speculation when that's exactly what your doing? Do you have any proof that he thought he would die in his hotel room? Other than, he planned it, he knew he was going to die. Smart ass.

       If the deceased is in a locked room with only a single path out that is being watched by police and a hotel security guard then yeah it's probably suicide.

       of fucking course. I have a very strong but very hypothetical feeling that they saw some shit on those cameras they can never release to us. My hope is a leak of more info, maybe LVPD anon will return to 4chan or something. And we aren't going to hear any more about a 'motive' from them either until something shifts so they can benefit from it.

       Okay. So what about hotel cameras, hallway cameras, elevator cameras, garage cameras... Casinos that deal with a lot of money (and therefore) potential ne'er-do-wells usually have more security than your average Holiday Inn.

       I have a lot of doubt about this. From first shots fired to police breach, there is ~an hour of time completely unaccounted. Hundreds of rounds of unused ammo.. Why cut his attack short? If his dream was to create as much carnage as possible, he wouldn't have ended it. I don't think it's certain at all that he was alone in his room the entire time.

       Agreed. Also, just a note on the cameras. How I viewed the information presented from the sheriff is that the cameras were just used to stream video to the baby monitor-like device to see outside the hallway and through peep hole.

       If I heard correctly he said that he was using baby monitors? So he wouldn't be recording those. But you'd think if he had this months/years long plan and dropped tens of thousands on a gun arsenal, that he'd splurge on something more than baby monitors lol

       It's actually pretty smart. Cameras do many things and have many options,lower battery life. Baby monitors are perfect for easy setup and just work with audio and visual.

       Exactly. As far as an off-the-shelf method for personal surveillance of a specific spot, I can't think of an easier solution than going into WalMart and picking up a few baby monsters.

       Why would he record? Makes a lot more sense as just a live feed. There's absolutely no reason to set cameras up to record.

       I'm not sure what to believe on this one. The Sheriff seems pretty genuine to me, except for that part about the note.

       Like maybe if they discovered he was some type of insect that could operate 4 rifles at a time, I'd agree with the "having something bigger planed"...but idk, it's very strange behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not necessarily on board with the theory that he was a gun runner for the FBI or whatever. But wouldn't it be logical if you're going to follow through with a plan like this to stockpile as much AMMO as you can in the room and limit yourself to, oh I don't know, maybe just a half dozen rifles? Lol

       Also, I'm not a gun guy, but assuming you can take all those rifles apart, how many trips would it take you to get 23 complete rifles to a 32nd floor hotel room.

       We'll know more I suppose if or when they release some of the security footage. I do understand why they aren't quick to release the security footage and satisfy everyone at r/conspiracy....they probably think there might still be others out there who helped him

       I've taken multiple long guns into hotel rooms on multiple shooting trips here and never had an issue. He could've had them in a large chest for all we know. I don't understand why this is an issue, he was a wealthy guy in Vegas, it's common for casinos to look the other way instead of turning away a high roller. This is Nevada, we all have guns here.

       I'm not sure I do either, especially considering he's highly regarded by the casinos as a high roller type according to his brother.

       I just watched yesterdays press conference and he had ammonium nitrate and a shit load of tannerite in his truck and they haven't even finished going through it all yet. In some photos I noticed some rifles with very nice scopes also so I think he was planning on a much longer stand. Maybe he panicked when security got too the room so quickly or acted impulsively due too anxiety after the fact. Whatever went through dick heads head, I think he was planning something much bigger and it just fell through or didn't go the way he planned. He had another room booked downtown also so I'm wondering what he was planning their.

       They wouldn't overheat to an extent he couldn't fire anymore or that it would warp the barrel. that would take like 300 plus rapid fire rounds from one weapon. Also a jam is as simple as tap rack  bang 99% of the time. It would be much more efficient to just switch mags out of 1 or2 rifles.

       I think he means that camera's were fed strait to monitors, and not backed up to any sort of media.  But i'm curious about that baby monitor.  I'm wondering if maybe it was one of those wi-fi cameras that people were hacking into.  He may have had recording equipment in one of those other rooms he rented.  The sheriff did mention finding potential video evidence there.

       He was using the camera footage as a live feed so he could see when people were coming down the hallway/in front of his door. He wasn't using them to record.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a tool for him, not a gift to us. This is not a hard concept in my opinion.

       If they were go pros, he probably just had them mounted and connected to the GoPro app on your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically acts as a second screen and you control when it starts or stops recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wasn't concerned with looking at the footage after, just seeing a live feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I feel like if he did use a gopro or another camera with an app, and was using a phone/tablet to view the feed, they should also look on the phone to ensure that stuff wasnt recorded straight to the phone (another option you can use with the GoPro app) or straight to a cloud.

       Is it unreasonable to think that was his original intention, but never got around to doing it? This whole post is clickbait. They aren't talking about the Hotel/Casino's cameras. They are talking about the killer's cameras.

       There are recordings of the streams online, you can go listen to the bits you missed. One of the security guards got there before the shooting finished and was shot through the door. Police reached the floor two minutes after the shooting finished.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        10.05pm: First shots fired by the suspect. This was seen on closed-circuit television from the concert venue.
       </p>
       <p>
        10.12pm: First two officers arrive on 31st floor and announce gunfire is coming from directly above them.
       </p>
       <p>
        10.15pm: Last shots are fired from the suspect per body worn camera.

       Also, I'm not a gun guy, but assuming you can take all those rifles apart, how many trips would it take you to get 23 complete rifles to a 32nd floor hotel room.

       We'll know more I suppose if or when they release some of the security footage. I do understand why they aren't quick to release the security footage and satisfy everyone at r/conspiracy....they probably think there might still be others out there who helped him

       DONT KNOW IF THIS IS RELIABLE AND I DONT HAVE THE SOURCE ANYMORE : read somewhere where a witness heard two car bombs down the block before the shots were fired. 
Not posting that as proof, just saying it in case someone on here saw that same post.
